5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so {{water can}} be quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down {{to bring in a}} single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E

5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face is parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on the equatorial plane.|$|E
5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1¬∞, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3¬∞.|$|E

Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, {{both of which were}} based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.|$|E

5|$|The adult caddisfly is a {{medium-sized}} insect with membranous, hairy wings, which {{are held in}} a tent-wise fashion when the insect is at rest. The antennae are fairly long and threadlike, the mouthparts are reduced in size and the legs have five tarsi (lower leg joints). Adults are nocturnal and are attracted to light. Some species are strong fliers and can disperse to new localities, but many fly only weakly. Adults are usually short-lived, most being non-feeders and equipped only to breed. Once mated, the female caddisfly lays eggs in a gelatinous mass, attaching them <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the water surface depending on species. The eggs hatch in a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|The male half wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, {{adorned with}} a {{crescent}} moon. Sometimes the jata-mukuta is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a nakra-kundala, sarpa-kundala ("serpent-earring") or ordinary kundala ("earring"). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (trinetra) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> Parvati's round dot. A common elliptical halo (prabhamandala/prabhavali) may be depicted behind the head; sometimes {{the shape of the}} halo may differ on either side.|$|E

5|$|The precise {{function}} of various patterns of animal coloration {{that have been}} called countershading has been debated by zoologists such as Hannah Rowland (2009), with the suggestion {{that there may be}} multiple functions including flattening and background matching when viewed from the side; background matching when viewed from <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below,</b> implying separate colour schemes for the top and bottom surfaces; outline obliteration from above; and a variety of largely untested non-camouflage theories. A related mechanism, counter-illumination, adds the creation of light by bioluminescence or lamps to match the actual brightness of a background. Counter-illumination camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid. It has been studied up to the prototype stage for military use in ships and aircraft, but it too has rarely or never been used in warfare.|$|E
5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion and the argument of perihelion of these objects. Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0‚Äì120¬∞ have arguments of perihelion between 280‚Äì360¬∞, and those with longitude of perihelion of 180‚Äì340¬∞ have argument of perihelion 0‚Äì40¬∞. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggest that the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard also noted that the arguments of perihelion of ETNOs with perihelion less than 35 AU are opposite those with perihelion greater than 35 AU.|$|E
5|$|Venus, with {{an orbit}} {{inclined}} by 3.4¬∞ {{relative to the}} Earth's, usually appears to pass under (or over) the Sun at inferior conjunction. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with the Sun at or near one of its nodes‚Äîthe longitude where Venus passes through the Earth's orbital plane (the ecliptic)‚Äîand appears to pass directly across the Sun. Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only 3.4¬∞, Venus can be as far as 9.6¬∞ from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction. Since the angular diameter of the Sun is about half a degree, Venus may appear to pass <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the Sun by more than 18 solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction.|$|E

5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E
5|$|Netham Lock is {{the point}} at Netham in Bristol at which boats from the River Avon, gain access to Bristol's Floating Harbour. Construction started in 1804 to build the tidal New Cut, where it is joined by the River Malago, and divert the Avon along the Feeder Canal to the harbour; a system {{designed}} and built by William Jessop and later improved by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. A weir carries the river into the New Cut and boats use the adjacent lock. Access to the harbour is only possible during {{the day when the}} lock keeper will open the gates unless the water level in the river between Netham and Hanham is <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the level of the harbour. Netham Lock and the weir form part of Bristol's flood defence mechanisms and it was announced in December 2008 that they would be upgraded as part of the ¬£11 million City Docks Capital Project.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either <b>above</b> <b>or</b> <b>below</b> the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E

40|$|Aerosol {{vertical}} profile significantly affects the aerosol direct radiative forcing at the TOA level. The {{degree to which}} the aerosol profile impacts the aerosol forcing depends on many factors such as presence of cloud, surface albedo and aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA). Using a radiation model, we show that for absorbing aerosols (with an SSA of 0. 7 ‚Äì 0. 8) whether aerosols are located <b>above</b> cloud <b>or</b> <b>below</b> induces at least one order of magnitude larger changes of the aerosol forcing than how aerosols are vertically distributed in clear skies, <b>above</b> cloud <b>or</b> <b>below</b> cloud. To see if this finding also holds for the global average aerosol direct radiative effect, we use realistic AOD distribution by integrating MODIS, MISR and AERONET observations, SSA from AERONET and cloud data from various satellite observations. It is found that whether aerosols are <b>above</b> cloud <b>or</b> <b>below</b> controls about 70 ‚Äì 80 % of the effect of aerosol {{vertical profile}} on the global aerosol radiative effect. Aerosols below cloud contribute as much to the global aerosol radiative effect as aerosols above cloud...|$|R
