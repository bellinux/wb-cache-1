40|$|Productivity is {{a measure}} of {{production}} efficiency and it is the rate at which input resources are effectively translated into outputs. There are several measures of productivity which are all broadly categorised as partial or total (multi factor) productivity depending on the parameters used in calculations. Several plan compliance metrics, advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing as well remuneration mixes also emerged from literature review. There is a need to understand ways of measuring productivity and improving productivity under changing economic conditions to ensure that the South African mining industry is competitive. This project illustrates the productivity trends at selected Anglo American Platinum Limited (<b>Amplat)</b> mines namely, Bathopele, Kroondal and Mototolo. The project further investigated the trends in market factors and establishes the correlation coefficients between reported measures of productivity and market factors. Such market factors include: the Republic of South African (RSA) and United States of America (US) ’ inflation rates, platinum price as well as the exchange rate (US dollar/RSA Rand). <b>Amplat</b> reported two categories of partial productivity, labour productivity and financial productivity. Fluctuating trends in productivity were observed for all three mines irrespective of the measure of productivity analysed. Fundamental causes of productivity differences between mines included: stoping width, relative rock density, grade, dilution, recovery factors (in the concentrators and smelters), metal ratios, mine call factor. There is a need to investigate productivity improvement by commodity to keep the mining industry competitive. It was concluded that labour availability and utilisation are becoming increasingly important, given the unionised nature of the mining industry...|$|E
40|$|Many {{previous}} studies of both behavioral and physiological correlates of cogn~t~ve workload have burdened subJects w~th a contrived secondary task ~n order to assess the workload of a pr~mary task. The present study invest~gated event-related potent~al (ERP) indices of workload in a single task paradigm. Subjects mon~tored changing digital readouts for values that went "out-of-bounds. " The <b>amplat.</b> ude of a long-latency pos i ta. va. -ty in the ERPs elicited by readout changes increased {{with the number of}} readouts being monitored. This effect of workload on ERPs is reported, along with plans for addit~onal analyses to address theoretical implications. Despite considerable research aimed at developing reliable measures of the cognitive workload experienced by human operators in complex man-mach~ne systems (see Frazier & Crombie, 1982), the assessment of operator workload in realistic settings is still problem-atic. Subjective ratings of workload are usefu...|$|E
50|$|The {{market is}} {{controlled}} primarily by three companies - Anglo American Platinum (<b>Amplats),</b> Impala Platinum (Implats), and Lonmin. <b>Amplats</b> is the world's largest producer of platinum. Workers are mostly represented {{by either the}} Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) or the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Potential layoffs are a particularly sensitive issue in South Africa, as 25% {{of the country is}} unemployed.|$|R

5000|$|The strike {{cost the}} {{platinum}} industry around 1.2 million ounces of production, worth about 24 billion rand ($2.25 billion). <b>Amplats</b> estimated it had lost 11 billion rand ($1.04 billion) in revenue. [...] The company spent about 2.4 billion rand on overhead on mines closed during the strike. Additional losses were expected while the companies paid full wages, but experienced less than full production while production ramped back up. Impant executive commented [...] "This strike has been enormously damaging. It has destroyed the relationships {{we have with}} employees, communities, the union and government ... It has resulted in us taking an untold financial impact. ... it could substantially influence {{the shape of the}} future business." [...] <b>Amplats</b> said it would consider selling its AMCU mines as it moved its core business to mechanized production, such as the Mogalakwena mine.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the strike, Lonmin stock fell 21% and Implats stock fell 11%. However, <b>Amplats</b> stock rose 9% during the strike. Stock analyst Edward Sterck of BMO Capital Markets said the market had likely underestimated the damage done to the {{industry}} by the strike. Global platinum prices rose 6% during the strike, but prices retreated in early-June when a deal looked imminent. The price of palladium, which is closely tied to that of platinum, rose 15%. The modest increase in the price of platinum was due to a large stockpile of global platinum reserves built up over several years of weak demand. When talks stalled in mid-June, the price of the precious metals again rose.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. The {{consumption}} of energy results in environmental costs, which include resource shortages, {{air pollution and}} radioactive wastes. Due to the economic cost associated, more and more Western industrial organisations are investing in innovative technologies to reduce energy consumption through improved thermal insulation of buildings, modifying equipment and by using energy-saving devices. The organisations are, however, not assured of any savings unless employees handle apparatus and equipment {{in a manner that}} conserves energy. Therefore, the important question to answer is how organisational behaviour can be changed to improve and enhance energy conservation efforts. Anglo American Platinum (<b>Amplats)</b> has identified that it needs to change its operations to conserve energy, thus ultimately conserving the planet. The company has identified an internal goal of reducing its energy consumption by fifteen percent, without sacrificing output, over a period of ten years from 2004. Current (2011) energy consumption at the Rustenburg Base Metals Refinery (RBMR) facility indicates that the mentioned goal does not seem achievable in 2014 as anticipated. The proposition to this phenomenon is that the prevailing culture at RBMR is not conducive to a conservation culture as required to conserve energy. Organisational culture is the pattern of values, norms, beliefs, attitudes and assumptions that shape the ways in which people behave and things get done. This hypothesis was tested with a culture survey {{in the form of an}} environmental questionnaire. The findings from the questionnaire confirm cultural barriers to achieving centralised targets and goals. Responses to the questionnaire indicated that the organisation does not measure energy conservation efforts accurately and that the information on how to attain the required conservation is not sufficient. The respondents further indicated that they have very limited input into energy conservation efforts and that trust issues present themselves as barriers to achieving set goals and targets. The prevailing perception by the respondents is that inadequate recognition systems are in place to drive the required savings. A surprising finding of the research is that the level of education of the respondents showed no significance with regard to energy conservation and the environment in general. A second interesting finding was that most respondents felt that they could do something to conserve energy and thereby conserve the environment. The challenge facing <b>Amplats</b> is to transform this awareness into a vehicle that will produce significant and sustainable results. Clear and decisive action will be required to bring about cultural change...|$|R
5000|$|A wave {{of strikes}} {{occurred}} across the South African mining sector. As of early October analysts estimated that approximately 75,000 miners were on strike from various gold and platinum mines and companies across South Africa, {{most of them}} illegally. Citing failure of workers to attend disciplinary hearings, on 5 October 2012, Anglo American Platinum—the world's biggest platinum producer—announced that it would fire 12,000 people. It said it would do so after losing 39,000 ounces in output - or 700 million rand ($82.3 million; £51 million) in revenue. The ANC Youth League expressed anger at the company and pledged solidarity with {{those who had been}} fired: This action demonstrates the insensibility and insensitivity of the company... which has made astronomical profits on the blood, sweat and tears of the very same workers that today the company can just fire with impunity. <b>Amplats</b> is a disgrace and a disappointment to the country at large, a representation of white monopoly capital out of touch and uncaring of the plight of the poor. Reuters described the move as [...] "a high-stakes attempt by the world's biggest platinum producer to push back at a wave of illegal stoppages sweeping through the country's mining sector and beyond". The announcement triggered the rand falling to a -year low. The events were expected to put further political pressure on President Jacob Zuma ahead of the leadership vote in December's ANC National Conference.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. Earnings in the South African and Zimbabwean mining {{industries}} have been severely impacted by these countries' socio-economic and political {{changes in the}} last decade. News reports and international research publications consistently rates Zimbabwe as a country with the highest political risks in the world. In South Africa (SA), the initial mining charter requiring 51 % Black Economic Empowerment, was leaked to the press in 2002 before promulgation making international investors weary. The currency, the Rand (R) has strengthened from the US$ from R 13. 85 in 2002 to R 7. 17 in 2007, significantly impacting on returns as investors to shift their portfolio to other sectors. The purpose {{of this research was}} to explore the implications of country risk and investor sentiment for Impala Platinum's valuation and provide strategy recommendations to improve its market rating whilst sustaining its competitive advantage as a platform for achieving its 2010 vision. In this study, a brief environmental scan of the mining industry was undertaken focusing on the platinum sector as well as a background review of the industry and a five year performance comparison between Impala and Anglo Platinum. It also reviewed corporate strategy literature {{as it relates to the}} research problem as well as theoretical models of investor sentiment and decision making processes. The specific research design was primarily exploratory in nature. The Implats valuation conundrum appears to be a phenomenon and the best way to achieve the main research objective was to identify any new ideas, preliminary explore some possible hypothesis and provide strategy recommendations to the board. The research adopted both quantitative and qualitative designs to focus on understanding the values, attitudes and perceptions of investors, which is interpretive and inductive in nature. A holistic case study was the specific vehicle used to conduct the research. The research population was made up of all investors in different regions of the world. Given that the study specifically related to the Implats valuation relative to <b>Amplats,</b> the sampling was tailored to their common investors. Data was collected using a questionnaire; the likert five scale was used to design the questionnaire. The following recommendations were made as a result of the research. Implats should implement measures to build its value chain and attempt to move to a cost quartile not easy to replicate without significant investment and time. In the short term Implats needs to continue improving on its fundamental values whilst crafting a take over defence strategy. It also needs to improve on its investor relations program to robustly communicate its political risk management strategy...|$|R
