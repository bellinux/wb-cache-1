5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an <b>antibiotic</b> clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: <b>antibiotic</b> and benzoyl peroxide, <b>antibiotic</b> and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical <b>antibiotic</b> with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to <b>antibiotic</b> resistance.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as <b>antibiotic</b> courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of <b>antibiotic</b> resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing <b>antibiotic</b> resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line topical <b>antibiotic</b> due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Antibiotics</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{prescribed}} drugs in the NICU; despite this, studies on its use are scarce. Aim: To assess <b>antibiotics</b> utilization ratio in a medical surgical NICU. Methods: Prospective, observational study. Daily registry of <b>antibiotics</b> given to newborn infants; two periods of two months, 2010; data collected every day after the second medical round. Variables: treated patients, days on <b>antibiotics,</b> treatment/patient days, number of courses, number of <b>antibiotics.</b> <b>Antibiotics</b> utilization ratio – ratio days on antibiotics/days at the NICU. Results: Patients enrolled - 113; admission days – 1722; length of stay - 15. 2 days; 85 newborn infants were given antibiotics; days on <b>antibiotics</b> - 771; <b>antibiotics</b> utilization ratio – 44. 8; 292 <b>antibiotics</b> were prescribed; 61. 8 % of patients were given more than two <b>antibiotics</b> and 15. 3 % had more than one course. The most frequents were gentamicin, cefotaxime, ampicillin, vancomycin and metronidazole.

5|$|<b>Antibiotics</b> are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of <b>antibiotics</b> for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, <b>antibiotics</b> are becoming less effective, especially macrolide <b>antibiotics</b> such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used <b>antibiotics,</b> either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When <b>antibiotics</b> are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. <b>Antibiotics</b> taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical <b>antibiotics,</b> and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral <b>antibiotics</b> are not recommended for use together.|$|R
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} survey {{was done in}} secondary schools in Dar es Salaam region between April and June 2006 {{with the aim of}} determining misuse of <b>antibiotics</b> among boarding secondary school students. A total of 450 randomly selected students with average age of 19 years were interviewed using self administered questionnaires with both closed and open ended questions. Most of the respondents knew <b>antibiotics</b> but perceived knowledge of <b>antibiotics</b> did not correspond to definition of <b>antibiotics</b> given as 55. 0 % gave a wrong definition of <b>antibiotics.</b> The prevalence of misuse of was found to be high, indicated by the fact that 58. 4 % used <b>antibiotics</b> for condition that do not require <b>antibiotics,</b> 40. 7 % do not complete their dose regimen. 25. 8 % get their <b>antibiotics</b> without prescription, majority (53. 9 %) of whom get it from the pharmacy and 54. 6 % share <b>antibiotics</b> with friends. This study therefore found that there was misuse of <b>antibiotics</b> among the studied population and this could be due to the observed poor knowledge of <b>antibiotics</b> among the students. Usage of <b>antibiotics</b> among the students was high (92. 8 %) and the <b>antibiotics</b> were used for wrong disease conditions (irrational use). Most of the students procure the drugs from pharmacies and this is a major factor contributing to misuse of <b>antibiotics.</b> I It is recommended that doctors should explain the importance of compliance to <b>antibiotics</b> and danger of being non compliant to their clients- drug regulatory authority should strengthen the laws on sales of <b>antibiotics</b> as over the counter drugs especially to pharmacy dealers.

5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest <b>antibiotic</b> use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop.

Methods: A cross sectional study design using convenience sampling technique was adopted in this study from May 2010 until August 2010.
