Such sensitization involves changes in brain mesolimbic dopamine transmission, {{as well as a}} protein inside mesolimbic neurons called delta FosB. An <b>associative</b> <b>process</b> may contribute to addiction, for environmental stimuli associated with drug taking may increase craving. This process may increase the risk for relapse in addicts attempting to quit.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that distraction actually increases creative cognition. One such study done by Jonathan Schooler found that non-demanding distractions improve performance on a classic creativity task called the UUT (Unusual Uses Task) in which the subject must come up with as many possible uses for a common object. The results confirmed that decision-related neural processes occur during moments of unconscious thought while a person engages in a non-demanding task. The research showed that while distracted a subject isn’t maintaining one thought for a particularly long time, which in turn allows different ideas to float {{in and out of}} one’s consciousness—this sort of <b>associative</b> <b>process</b> leads to creative incubation.|$|E
30|$|This imagery {{learning}} generally {{refers to}} the visual learning style that can enable students to integrate the common structural and functional properties with each other through representational, referential, and <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> (Paivio 1991). Through representational processing, a stimulus can implicitly activate corresponding memories. For example, the concrete word “rose” can set the verbal memories in motion that trace and activate the corresponding image of the rose and vice versa, or an abstract word “love” can launch verbal representations that raise personal expectations, happiness or disappointment, providing the visualization of a cheerful or resentful face. This cross-activation {{refers to the}} referential processing through which the <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> may implicitly evoke many different images and words from the one intended (Rieber 1994). However, human learning can occur more easily than without the interactions between referential and <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> (Koren 1999). Learning these concepts through the <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> can be easier than without these associations (Mayer 2003). Therefore, conceptual learning can become more robust if it involves implicit representational, referential, and <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> (Mayer and Anderson 1992), because they can assist students in interpreting, making meaning, and in comprehending insights into their educational experiences (Paivio 1991). The role of these unconscious processes is also readily observable in learning native languages (Chomsky 1986; Keenan et al. 1998), in getting accustomed to social norms and forming cultural worldviews and personal beliefs (Kulkofsky et al. 2010).|$|R

I review evidence I have collected showing how <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> {{are involved in}} building spatial, temporal, and causal maps. Evidence comes from studies on simple associative acquisition such as Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, higher-order conditioning procedures such as sensory preconditioning and conditioned inhibition, and from cue-competition studies.

50|$|Gibson {{believed}} that a radically different new view of perceptual learning was needed. Gibson worked with her husband James on a joint study to explore the perception of nonsense scribbles to clarify this concept of perceptual learning. The participants were tasked to identify one standard scribble from a set of similar scribbles varying in many different dimensions. At first the standard scribble was imperceptible from the other scribbles but after repeated tests the standard scribble became clear. The participants were tested until the standard was identified correctly without any correction given. The Gibson's then stated that the stimulus held all the information for perception rather than the participants learning to perceive through an <b>associative</b> <b>process.</b> This resulted in perceptual learning as being redefined as a change in what was perceived by an observer became {{more sensitive to the}} different aspects of a stimulus.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>associative</b> <b>process</b> {{described}} by the R-W model also accounts for extinction (see [...] "procedures" [...] above). The extinction procedure starts with a positive associative strength of the CS, {{which means that the}} CS predicts that the US will occur. On an extinction trial the US fails to occur after the CS. As a result of this “surprising” outcome, the associative strength of the CS takes a step down. Extinction is complete when the strength of the CS reaches zero; no US is predicted, and no US occurs. However, if that same CS is presented without the US but accompanied by a well-established conditioned inhibitor (CI), that is, a stimulus that predicts the absence of a US (in R-W terms, a stimulus with a negative associate strength) then R-W predicts that the CS will not undergo extinction (its V will not decrease in size).|$|E
50|$|Habituation is {{an example}} of non-associative {{learning}} in which the strength or probability of a response diminishes when the response is repeated. The response is typically a reflex or unconditioned response. Thus, habituation must be distinguished from extinction, which is an <b>associative</b> <b>process.</b> In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed owl (or similar predator) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it {{as though it were a}} real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant Mimosa pudica and the large protozoan Stentor coeruleus.|$|E
40|$|Compulsive {{smoking is}} a {{worldwide}} public health problem. Although research has confirmed {{the importance of}} <b>associative</b> learning <b>processes</b> in nicotine addiction, therapies targeting nicotine-associated cues still have a high relapse rate. Most theories conceptualize nicotine as an 2 ̆ 7 outcome 2 ̆ 7 that reinforces behaviors and/or changes the affective value of stimuli. Albeit important, this view does not capture the complexity of <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> involved in nicotine addiction. For example, nicotine serves as a conditional stimulus acquiring new appetitive/affective properties when paired with a non-drug reward. Also, nicotine functions as an occasion setter that participates in higher-order <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> that likely permit a more pervasive influence of conditioned cues that are resistant to typically cue-exposure therapy techniques. Finally, nicotine appears to amplify the salience of other stimuli that have some incentive value resulting in enhanced nicotine self-administration and conditioned reinforcement processes.

The present study showed age-related deficits in a contingency learning task, although older participants' resistance to interference was not disproportionately affected. Recognition memory predicted discrimination, whereas general cognitive ability predicted resistance to interference, suggesting differentiation between <b>associative</b> and strategic <b>processes</b> in learning and memory, and age declines in <b>associative</b> <b>processes.</b> Older participants' generalisation of associative strength from existing to novel stimulus-response associations was consistent with elemental learning theories, whereas configural models predicted younger participants' responses.

50|$|The {{degenerative}} transfer {{mechanism is}} based on very fast exchange equilibria between small free radicals (being continuously injected into the solution) and dormant polymeryl radicals (protected as closed-shell cobalt species). Systems based on degenerative transfer do not proceed via the persistent radical effect (PRE). Instead an active propagating radical interchanges its role with a latent radical in a dormant complex. The activation of one polymer chain means the deactivation of another polymer chain. If the exchange process is much faster than the polymerisation rate (kp), effectively all polymer chains grow at the same rate. Because the large polymer chains diffuse much slower than the small organic radicals, and thereby terminate much slower via 2nd order radical-radical coupling or disproportionation, long chains effectively build-up at cobalt while the small radicals keep terminating. This leads to a desirable narrow molecular weight distribution of the polymer at high polymerization rates.DT-CMRP is an <b>associative</b> <b>process,</b> which for CoIII(por)(alkyl) species implies formation of a 6-coordinate intermediate or transition state. Such Co(por)(alkyl)2 species formally have a Co(+IV) oxidation state, but in reality their (electronic) structure is best described as a weak radical adduct of a CoIII(por)(alkyl) species.A striking feature of DT-CMRP {{is the fact that}} even upon using a large excess of the radical initiator compared to the transfer agent, the radical polymerization reactions still remains controlled. A satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon seems to be lacking at the moment.|$|E

40|$|People {{with serious}} illness or {{disability}} are often burdened with social stigma that promotes {{a cycle of}} poverty via unemployment, inadequate housing and threats to mental health.

This article examines two psychological processes that underlie public stigma: <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> and rule-based <b>processes.</b> <b>Associative</b> <b>processes</b> are quick and relatively automatic whereas rule-based processes take longer to manifest themselves and involve deliberate thinking.

40|$|Dickinson, Shanks, & Evenden claimed 30 {{years ago}} that <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> may be {{underlying}} intuitive judgments in human contingency learning. However, this hypothesis has been seriously questioned by a more cognitive account based on inferential reasoning (see Shanks, 2010 for a review). A prediction derived from the associative hypothesis, probably not sufficiently tested, is that knowledge retrieval must be fast and derived from a spreading activation mechanism. Thus, <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> may not only be underlying intuitive judgments but also individuals’ performance in tasks where a rapid response must be executed, after allowing little time to stimulus processing.

Further, I observed that after OPFC inactivation, rats favour spatial over cue responses in a competition test of the water task. These results support a role for the OPFC in influencing response strategies and suggest this region is critical for constraining responses during uncertain conditions. Through interactions with learning and memory systems, these results suggest the OPFC supports <b>associative</b> <b>processes</b> during uncertainty by mediating between discrimination and generalization...|$|R

The present experiments were designed to determine the potential of A 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to alleviate both conditioned and unconditioned sickness in rats (Rattus norvegiens). The results in the present study suggest that when the place aversion is strong (Experiment 1), THC may interfere with the establishment; however when the aversion is weak (Experiments 2 and 3), THC may interfere with the expression. Also, when administered during acquisition of a strong amphetamine-induced place preference, THC also seems to interfere with the establishment of the preference. Therefore it appears that when the place association is strong, THC may interfere with the <b>associative</b> <b>process</b> itself, but when the place association is weak THC may interfere with the conditioned sickness or the retrieval of the association...|$|E

Automatic drug-relevant associations were assessed in 121 at-risk youth in continuation high schools in California {{with the use of}} a word association index and computer-based, reaction time measures (i. e., Implicit Association Test [IAT] and Extrinsic Affective Simon Task [EAST]). Measures of working memory capacity, sensation seeking, and explicit cognitions also were included in analyses as potential confounders. The word association index and the marijuana IAT excited D measure were significant predictors of marijuana use. The word association index accounted for more variance in marijuana use than did the IAT or EAST measures. Further, confirmatory factor analytic models of the indirect measures of marijuana use revealed a significant moderate correlation between the EAST Excitement and Word Association factors but no significant correlations between the Word Association and IAT factors. These findings suggest that there is some convergence among the different indirect measures, but these assessments also appear to tap different aspects of <b>associative</b> <b>processes.</b> The types of indirect measures evaluated in this work provide information about spontaneous cognitions related to substance use, capturing influences on behavior that are not evaluated with traditional explicit assessments of behavior.

Our evidence {{over the last decade}} from a smooth-brained omnivore has been that food after deprivation rewards intake even when those reinforced ingestive responses occur long before the physiological signals from renewed assimilation.
