The study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Clinical Centre of Vojvodina. The study included 57 singleton pregnancies, gestation > 24 weeks, of which 29 were healthy pregnancies and 28 were with pre-eclampsia, defined as systolic arterial pressure of > 90 mmHg, diastolic of > 145 mmHg, and 24 h proteinuria of > 300 mg.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Inefficient {{cellular}} delivery {{limits the}} land-scape of macromolecular drugs. Boronic acids readily form boronate esters with the 1, 2 - and 1, 3 -diols of saccharides, {{such as those}} that coat the surface of mammalian cells.

The utility of many biologic drugs is limited by inefficientcellular delivery. 1 Previous efforts to overcome this limitation have focused largely on the use of cationic domainspeptidic (e. g., HIV−TAT, penetratin, and nona-arginine) or nonpeptidic (e. g., PAMAM dendrimers and polyethylenimine) to enhance the attraction between a chemotherapeutic agent and the anionic cell surface. 2 Natural ligands (e. g., folic <b>acid,</b> <b>substance</b> P, and the RGD tripeptide...|$|E

These substances are markers of lipid peroxidation induced by free oxygen radicals. Early reperfusion was judged by regression of ST elevation and late coronary artery patency from the results of coronary angiography 24 - 72 hours after thrombolysis. RESULTS [...] The concentration of thiobarbituric <b>acid</b> reactive <b>substances</b> increased in only 6 out of 14 patients with signs of early reperfusion. In patients with late coronary artery patency the corresponding number was 6 out of 15.

The frequency of this depolarization was monitored as an index of the respiratory frequency. An elevation of the concentration of Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + caused a decrease in the respiratory frequency, whereas an elevation of K+ concentration caused an increase.

The decreased of superoxide dismutase and gluthathione peroxidase activities in lysates of rats aorta at 48 hour and increased content of the reactive thiobarbituric <b>acid</b> <b>substances</b> during 72 hours after radiation exposure were observed. The consumption of polyphenolic complex from wine did not change the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in lysates of aorta rats treated with ionizing radiation, whereas gluthathione reductase and gluthathione peroxidase activities was increased during 72 hours after radiation influence. The content of TBA reactive substances was significantly decreased in lysates of aorta rats that were exposed to radiation and polyphenols of grape wine, {{compared with those of}} animals that were exposed to radiation alone...|$|R
40|$|A N ACCURATE {{method for}} the de-•* • * • {{termination}} of uric acid in poultry excreta {{is of great}} importance in protein metabolism studies, for uric acid forms the most important nitrogenous con-stituent in avian urine. Uric acid, as pre-cipitated from an alkaline extract of poultry excreta, is admixed with other non-uric <b>acid</b> reducing <b>substances</b> which also react with strong oxidizing substances such as potassium permanganate, eerie sulphate, etc., generally used for the ti-tration of uric acid. Bose (1943) reported a simple and accurate iodimetric method for the estimation of uric acid in poultry excreta. With the iodimetric method, the non-uric <b>acid</b> <b>substances</b> with higher oxi-dation potential do not interfere in the titration. In the present investigation, another method for the determination of uric acid in poultry excreta has been developed by. {{taking advantage of the}} specific action of uricase on uric acid and this method has been compared with the iodimetric method (Bose, loc. cit.), to check the accuracy of the results.
