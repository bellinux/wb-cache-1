5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptible</b> to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E
25|$|His Cello Concerto, {{dedicated}} to Siegfried Palm (1966) contains two movements.

The second movement is a virtuoso piece of dynamic atonal melody {{on the part of}} the cello.|$|E
60|$|We {{know not}} how it was, but about this time an unaccountable, <b>almost</b> an <b>imperceptible,</b> coolness seemed to spring up between our hero and the Lady Aphrodite.

Perhaps this was the origin; perhaps the Duke's conduct had become, though unexceptionable, too negative. But here we only throw up a straw. Perhaps, if we must go on suggesting, anxiety ends in callousness.|$|R

In our country, since the 70 ’s years, this field was incorporated in our National Health System to the daily work of our professionals as to the patients expectations, in an <b>almost</b> an <b>imperceptible</b> way. Twenty polemical questions were asked to an expert, about several current dilemmas in this field. The questions and the answes are only a motivation for new debates in medical services, in medical education activities and in research...|$|R
50|$|The 1946 Aleutian Islands {{earthquake}} occurred {{near the}} Aleutian Islands, Alaska on April 1. The shock {{had a moment}} magnitude of 8.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). It resulted in 165-173 casualties and over $26 million in damage. The seafloor along the fault was elevated, triggering a Pacific-wide tsunami with multiple destructive waves at heights ranging from 45-130 ft. The tsunami obliterated the Scotch Cap Lighthouse on Unimak Island, Alaska among others, and killed all five lighthouse keepers. Despite the destruction to the Aleutian Island Unimak, the tsunami had <b>almost</b> an <b>imperceptible</b> effect on the Alaskan mainland. The wave reached Kauai, Hawaii 4.5 hours after the quake, and Hilo, Hawaii 4.9 hours later. The residents of these islands were caught completely off-guard by {{the onset of the}} tsunami due to the inability to transmit any warnings from the destroyed posts at Scotch Cap. The effects of the tsunami also reached the West Coast of the United States.|$|R

25|$|Although mining had {{provided}} foreign exchange, {{the vast majority}} of Hondurans gained their livelihoods from agriculture, usually on a subsistence level. Periodic efforts were made to develop agricultural exports, but they met with little success. Some tobacco, cattle, and hides were exported, mostly to neighboring countries. The recurring civil conflicts and the resultant confiscation of stock by various military commanders, however, put a damper on efforts to develop the cattle industry and contributed to its rather backward status. Some bananas and other fruits were exported from the Islas de la Bahía, much of this trade going to New Orleans, but the volume was small and the benefit {{for the rest of the}} nation <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptible.</b>|$|E
25|$|The forest wildcat's fur {{is fairly}} uniform in length {{throughout}} the body. The {{hair on the}} tail is very long and dense, thus making it look furry and thick. In winter, the guard hairs measure 7cm, the tip hairs 5.5–6cm, and the underfur 4.5–5.5cm. Corresponding measurements in the summer are 5–6.7cm, 4.5–6cm, and 5.3cm. In winter, the forest wildcat's main coat colour is fairly light gray, becoming richer along the back, and fading onto the flanks. A slight ochreous shade is visible on the undersides of the flanks. A black and narrow dorsal band starts on the shoulders, and runs along the back, usually terminating {{at the base of}} the tail. Indistinct black smudges are present around the dorsal band, which may form a transverse striping pattern on rare occasions. The undersurface of the body is very light gray, with a light ochreous tinge. One or more white spots may occur on rare occasions on the throat, between the forelegs, or in the inguinal region. The tail is the same colour as the back, with the addition of a pure black tip. 2–3 black, transverse rings occur above the tail tip. The dorsal surface of the neck and head are the same colour as that of the trunk, but is lighter gray around the eyes, lips, cheeks, and chin. The top of the head and the forehead bear four well-developed dark bands. These bands sometimes split into small spots which extend to the neck. Two short and narrow stripes are usually present in the shoulder region, in front of the dorsal band. A dark and narrow stripe is present on the outer corner of the eye, under the ear. This stripe may extend into the neck. Another such stripe occurs under the eye, which also extends into the neck. The wildcat's summer coat has a fairly light, pure background colour, with an admixture of ochre or brown. In some animals, the summer coat is ashen coloured. The patterns on the head and neck are as well-developed as those on the tail, though the patterns on the flanks are <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptible.</b>|$|E
60|$|Towards midnight--when {{the rocky}} crags and {{beetling}} cliffs frowned like dark clouds over {{the spot where}} the travellers lay in deepest shade, with only a few red embers of the camp-fire to throw a faint lurid light on their slumbering forms--a tall savage emerged from the surrounding gloom, so stealthily, so noiselessly, and by such slow degrees, that he appeared more like a vision than a reality. At first his painted visage only and the whites of his glittering eyes came into view as he raised his head above the surrounding brushwood and stretched his neck in order to obtain a better view of the camp. Then slowly, inch by inch, <b>almost</b> with <b>imperceptible</b> motion, he crept forward until the whole of his gaunt form was revealed. A scalping-knife gleamed in his right hand. The camp was strewn with twigs, but these he removed one by one, carefully clearing each spot before he ventured to rest a knee upon it. While the savage was thus engaged, Larry O'Hale, who was nearest to him, sighed deeply in his sleep and turned round. The Indian at once sank so flat among the grass that scarcely any part of him was visible. Big Ben, who slept very lightly, was awakened by Larry's motions, but having been aroused several times already by the same restless individual, he merely glanced at his sleeping comrade and shut his eyes again.|$|R
6000|$|So we {{made sure}} to work against the wind, which, however, was so light as <b>almost</b> to be <b>imperceptible,</b> and stole along the dark ravine, taking half a dozen steps or so at a time. How still the forest! When {{it was like this}} I always felt as if I had {{discovered}} something new. The big trees loomed stately and calm, stretching a rugged network of branches over us. Fortunately no saucy squirrels or squalling jays appeared to be abroad to warn game of our approach. Not only a tang, but a thrill, seemed to come pervasively on the cool air. All the colors of autumn were at their height, and gorgeous plots of maple thicket and sumac burned against the brown and green. We slipped along, each of us strung {{to be the first to}} hear or see some living creature of the wild. R.C., as might have been expected, halted us with a softly whispered: [...] "Listen." [...] But neither Copple nor I heard what R.C. heard, and presently we moved on as before. Presently again R.C. made us pause, with a like result. Somehow the forest seemed unusually wild. It provoked a tingling expectation. The pine-covered slope ahead of us, the thicketed ridge to our left, the dark, widening ravine to our right, all seemed to harbor listening, watching, soft-footed denizens of the wild. At length we reached a level bench, beautifully forested, where the ridge ran down in points to where the junction of several ravines formed the head of Gentry Canyon.|$|R
40|$|Taxes are {{generally}} not given a particularly detailed treatment as analytic concepts. Instead, thinking on taxes has {{tended to focus on}} the technical aspects of how they behave. Historians have generally dealt with taxes in two ways: the first looks at them as encapsulating a moral transaction based on duty to the state and fellow citizens; and the other treats taxes as though they were simply a tool by which the government raises revenues. The second approach does not take full appreciation of the extra-economic implications and meanings of tax transactions while the first does not actually explain how taxes work to enforce these moral obligations. Taxes affect all parties in the nation in significant but <b>almost</b> completely <b>imperceptible</b> ways. For this reason, tax relationships between citizens and the state are complicated enough; let alone the interactions between corporations and the state. The corporation was and continues to be a key structure that enables and is enabled by the nation state. Despite its long and storied history in America, it occupies an ambiguous place in American society and law. Legal thinkers have tried to understand the corporate entity as existing in an uneasy cohabitation with the individualist legal tradition in America, yet this becomes harder and harder to do as corporations have come to dominate the economic and thus legal landscapes. Legislators have come to equate conceptually corporations and citizens. This becomes problematic because of the different roles that are played by corporations and citizens, a fact that is highlighted during moments of tax reform. Nowhere is this clearer than {{in the case of the}} oil industry. After the railroads of the Gilded Age, no other industry has so completely transformed the American economy and the way of life of American citizens. Yet the tax privileges granted to the oil industry have always sparked the ire of various citizens even as they are vociferously defended by others. The arguments tend to focus on why and how taxes and tax breaks for corporations can be justified. This question is a reflection of a more significant one: what is the place of the corporation in American society? I believe that the financial crisis of the late 1960 s, which provoked Nixon's tax reform of 1969, gives us some insight into how legislators have sought to grapple with this question. The arguments for and against the mineral depletion allowance in 1969 are thus indicative of a much deeper trend in American thinking on the corporation...|$|R
500|$|Many reviewers {{considered}} the technical enhancements, {{such as the}} increased frame rate, a welcome advancement from the original game. Turi of Game Informer felt that the frame rate [...] "dramatically elevate" [...] the game above the original.

IGN's Moriarty stated that, though the change was initially [...] "jarring", he appreciated it through further gameplay. Tom Hoggins of The Daily Telegraph echoed these statements, feeling as though the increased frame rate heightened {{the intensity of the}} gameplay. Metros David Jenkins felt that the increased frame rate is <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptible,</b> though stating that it is [...] "definitely an improvement". Philip Kollar of Polygon appreciated the game's improved textures and loading times.|$|E
500|$|Freshwater sloughs {{are perhaps}} the most common {{ecosystem}} associated with Everglades National Park. These drainage channels are characterized by low-lying areas covered in fresh water, flowing at an <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptible</b> [...] per day. Shark River Slough and Taylor Slough are significant features of the park. Sawgrass growing to a height of [...] or more, and broad-leafed marsh plants, are so prominent in this region that they gave the Everglades its nickname , cemented in the public imagination in the title for Marjory Stoneman Douglas's book (1947), which culminated years of her advocacy for considering the Everglades ecosystem as more than a [...] "swamp". Excellent feeding locations for birds, sloughs in the Everglades attract a great variety of waders such as herons, egrets, roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), ibises and brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), as well as limpkins (Aramus guarauna) and snail kites that eat apple snail, which in turn feed on the sawgrass. The sloughs' availability of fish, amphibians, and young birds attract a variety of freshwater turtles, alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), water moccasin (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti), and eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus).|$|E
500|$|As {{the drift}} {{proceeded}} the ocean became deeper; soundings gave successive depths of , [...] and , a progression which indicated that no undiscovered land mass was nearby. On 15 November 1895 Fram reached 85°55′N, only [...] below Nansen's Farthest North mark. From this point on, the drift was generally {{to the south}} and west, although progress was for long periods <b>almost</b> <b>imperceptible.</b> Inactivity and boredom led to increased drinking; Scott Hansen recorded that Christmas and New Year passed [...] "with the usual hot punch and consequent hangover", and wrote that he was [...] "getting more and more disgusted with drunkenness". By mid-March 1896, the position was 84°25′N, 12°50′E, placing the ship north of Spitsbergen. On 13 June a lead opened and, {{for the first time in}} nearly three years, Fram became a living ship. It was a further two months, on 13 August 1896, before she found open water and, with a blast from her cannon, left the ice behind. She had emerged from the ice just north and west of Spitsbergen, close to Nansen's original prediction, proving him right and his detractors wrong. Later that same day a ship was sighted—Søstrone, a seal hunter from Tromsø. Sverdrup rowed across for news, and learned that nothing had been heard from Nansen. Fram called briefly at Spitsbergen, where the Swedish explorer-engineer Salomon Andrée was preparing for the balloon flight that he hoped would take him to the pole. After a short time ashore, Sverdrup and his crew began the trip south to Norway.|$|E
