5000|$|Claimants take {{advantage}} of the <b>action</b> <b>in</b> rem, rather <b>action</b> <b>in</b> personam, because an <b>action</b> <b>in</b> rem is more easy and convenient to institute. It is more difficult, <b>in</b> an <b>action</b> <b>in</b> personam, to summon the defendant via writ outside the jurisdiction unless the defendant is a resident of EU or EFTA countries. Besides, the processes to find the rightful shipowner, the defendant, are very complicated and time consuming due to the complex and inconsistent ship registration in different countries. An action with respect to a bareboat ship will frequently encounter this problem.|$|R
50|$|Now {{part of the}} Territorial Force, the London Regiment {{expanded}} to 88 battalions in the First World War. Of these, 49 battalions saw <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the trenches of the Western Front in France and Flanders, six saw <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the Gallipoli Campaign, 12 saw action at Salonika, 14 saw action against the Turks in Palestine, and one saw <b>action</b> <b>in</b> Waziristan and Afghanistan.|$|R
5|$|Before {{his service}} in North America, {{he served as}} Bailiff of Guernsey. His tenure in New England was authoritarian and turbulent, as his views were decidedly pro-Anglican, a {{negative}} quality in a region home to many Puritans. His <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> New England resulted in his overthrow during the 1689 Boston revolt.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{supporting}} policies pursued by France, Houphouët-Boigny also influenced their <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> Africa.

5|$|Coolidge and Cox were renominated {{for their}} {{respective}} offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> the Police Strike {{around the state}} and the nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form. He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier. His <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge run for president in 1920.|$|E

5|$|During a LARP, player <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> {{the real}} world {{represent}} character <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between {{the real world}} and the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> the border regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks were {{conducted}} by regimental-size NVA/NLF units, but unlike the usual hit-and-run tactics used by the People's Army forces, these were sustained and bloody affairs.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War. Her <b>actions,</b> <b>in</b> part, helped the fort's outnumbered defenders give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was more heavily defended than had been anticipated.|$|E

A Canadian version has been cast that was originally to be awarded to the Unknown Soldier at the rededication of the Vimy Memorial on 7 April 2007. This date was chosen {{as it was the}} 90th anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge but pressure from veterans' organisations caused the plan to be dropped.|$|E
5|$|For his <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> Korea {{leading up}} to his death, Brown was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Purple Heart Medal, and the Air Medal. For the failed rescue attempt, Hudner {{received}} the Medal of Honor, the highest valor award presented by the U.S. military.|$|E

The first to receive it was Simon Suhler who received it under the name Charles Gardner; the next two were David Goodman and George Geiger. The last Jew to receive the medal for the Indian wars was Jacob Trautman who received it for his <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> the battle now frequently referred to as the Wounded Knee Massacre.|$|E
