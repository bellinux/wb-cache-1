40|$|Abstract The {{study and}} {{extension}} {{of a simple}} <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> method for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) to {{a broad range of}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) is de-scribed. The isolation of seven PCDD, ten PCDF, and three coplanar PCB (cPCB) is extended to eight mono-ortho substituted PCB and seven so-called “marker PCB” (Aroclor 1260) for fatty food samples. This enables quan-tification of 35 compounds – including all congeners with a WHO toxic equivalent factor (TEF) – in a single extrac-tion and single purification step. The chromatographic be-haviour of mono-ortho PCB and marker PCB on a variety of adsorbents, including basic alumina, has been studied. Partitioning of analytes through multi-column sequences is described and correlated with their structural and elec-tronic properties, by use of molecular modelling calcula-tions. The fractionation process available with the Power-Prep <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> system enables rapid indepen-dent analysis of the different groups of compounds. Gas chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry (GC–HRMS) is used for the PCDD/F and cPCB fraction and quadrupole ion-storage tandem in time mass spec-trometry (GC–QISTMS) for analysis of the remaining PCB. A comparison study was performed on quality-con-trol samples and real fatty food samples to evaluate the ro-bustness of the new strategy compared with a reference method. On the basis of this simultaneous clean-up, a rapid simplified strategy for PCDD/F and selected PCB analysis determination is proposed for fatty food samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{strategy}} for determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated biphenyls on fatty matrices has been established. After extraction, the proposed method allows the purification and the fractionation of all target groups of compounds {{in a simple}} multi-step <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up.</b> Furthermore, their subsequent analysis is carried out using a single benchtop mass spectrometer, in four separate injections. Required sensitivity considering levels found in the environment is attained using electron impact ionisation followed by tandem in time mass spectrometry. The whole method has been evaluated on standard solution and quality control samples consisting of fortified beef fat. Sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy and repeatability were tested with satisfactory results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Liquid chromatography-tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (LC-MS/MS) is rapidly gaining ground in special clinical chemistry laboratories. It significantly increases the analytic potential in clinical chemistry, {{especially in the}} field of low molecular weight biomarker analysis. This review overviews current LC-MS/MS methods used for the quantification of biogenic amines and their metabolites. New possibilities offered by this technique are illustrated by recently developed assays for biogenic amines. Major shortcomings of conventional chromatographic techniques, such as labor-intensive sample preparation, long analysis times and often the relatively low specificity, are circumvented by using LC-MS/MS. In addition, LC-MS/MS has broad analyte compatibility and high analytical performance. In the last 5 years introduction of LC-MS/MS in routine diagnostics has resulted in improved assays for diagnosis and follow-up of neuroendocrine tumors characterized by the secretion of biogenic amines. Due to their labile nature and low concentration ranges biogenic amines require extensive and careful sample preparation. Introduction of new sophisticated techniques such as selective sorbents adsorption is evolving. This enables not only more specific analyte selection, but also automation of the complicated <b>clean-up</b> procedure. <b>Automated</b> sample <b>clean-up</b> can be directly coupled to LC-MS/MS, which facilitates reproducible and efficient handling of the growing number of samples to be analyzed in laboratories [...] (C) 2010 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

40|$|Sample {{preparation}} {{is often a}} bottleneck in systems for chemical analysis. The aim of this work was to investigate and develop new techniques {{to address some of}} the shortcomings of current sample preparation methods. The goal has been to provide full automation, on-line coupling to detection systems, short sample preparation times and high-throughput. A new technique for sample preparation that can be connected on-line to liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) has been developed. Microextraction in packed syringe (MEPS) is a new solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique that is miniaturized and can be fully automated. In MEPS approximately 1 mg of sorbent material is inserted into a gas tight syringe (100 - 250 μL) as a plug. Sample preparation takes place on the packed bed. Evaluation of the technique was done by the determination of local anaesthetics in human plasma samples using MEPS on-line with LC and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). MEPS connected to an autosampler was fully <b>automated</b> and <b>clean-up</b> of the samples took one minute. In addition, in the case of plasma samples the same plug of sorbent could be used for about 100 extractions before it was discarded. A further aim of this work was to increase sample preparation throughput. To do that disposable pipette tips were packed with a plug of porous polymer monoliths as sample adsorbent and were then used in connection with 96 -well plates and LC-MS-MS. When roscovitine in human plasma and water samples was used as model substance, a 96 -plate was handled in two minutes...|$|R

All these compounds fall under or are candidate to the Stockholm Convention and {{they are subject to}} United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) monitoring programmes 1. In the past, different complex <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> systems have been developed and dedicated to the analysis of dioxins in environmental samples. Later these methodologies have been adapted to include other conventional or emerging persistent organic compounds such as PCBs and PBDEs 2, 3, 4. These methodologies involve different types of adsorption media such as acidic silica/silica, alumina and active carbon and are useful if multiresidual analysis with PCDD/Fs analysis in a final step is applied. Often the monitoring of these chemicals do not include all these compounds, but is limited to only a few classes excluding the PCDD/Fs, so that a reduced number of clean up steps are needed and time and cost expenses reduced [...] In this study we tested the flexibility of an <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> system used for the multiresidual analysis 5 developing a shorter and simpler automated method for the simultaneous analysis of PCBs and PBDEs in fish. For this purpose we reduced the clean up steps to GPC followed by acidic silica/silica columns. The automated clean up system (J 2 Scientific, Missouri, USA) consists of a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with autosampler (AccuPrep MPSTM), an evaporator system (AccuVapTM) and three solid phase module able to manage the acid silica/neutral silica, basic alumina and active carbon columns (Dioxin/SPE module) in-line.

40|$|A {{clean-up}} {{method for}} organochlorine compounds in fatty samples based on normal-phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) is described. To this end, an existing clean-up procedure which uses column switching for {{the separation of}} organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the fat matrix was simplified to a single silica LC column procedure. The use of an LC column packed with 3 μm silica enables complete fat/OCP separation in a total fraction volume of 12 ml, and results in a fully <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> procedure that takes only 32 min per sample. The method showed average recoveries of 80 - 110 % in the concentration range of 1 - 510 μg/kg, with relative standard deviations of less than 10 %.

To use spectra {{acquired}} by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) from pre- and post-digital rectal examination (DRE) urine samples {{to search for}} discriminating peaks that can adequately distinguish between benign and malignant prostate conditions, and identify the peaks’ underlying biomolecules. METHODS. Twenty-five participants with prostate cancer (PCa) and 27 participants {{with a variety of}} benign prostatic conditions as confirmed by a 10 -core tissue biopsy were included. Pre- and post-DRE urine samples were prepared for MALDI MS profiling using an <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> procedure. Following mass spectra collection and processing, peak mass and intensity were extracted and subjected to statistical analysis to identify peaks capable of distinguishing between benign and cancer. Logistic regression was used to combine markers to create a sensitive and specific test. RESULTS. A peak at m/z 10, 760 was identified as b-microseminoprotein (b-MSMB) and found to be statistically lower in urine from PCa participants using the peak’s average areas. By combining serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels with MALDI MS-measured b-MSMB levels, optimum threshold values obtained from Receiver Operator characteristics curves gave an increased sensitivity of 96...|$|E
40|$|Phthalic acid diesters (PAE) are omnipresent in {{the human}} {{environment}} and food is {{a major contributor to}} the overall human exposure towards these chemicals. Due to developmental effects, PAE infants' exposure via human milk has been subjected to a number of analytical studies. These previous studies, however, revealed that normal laboratory blank values are in the range of or even higher than human milk levels due to the presence of PAE in laboratory environments. In order to provide more reliable data on PAE exposure via human milk, the aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a robust and sensitive analytical method. This should be capable of removing matrix components efficiently and guarantee limits of quantification in the low ppb range. The method development took into account liquid-liquid extraction and selective pressurised fluid extraction (sPFE) as well as chromatography-based clean-up steps. The final method consisted of a liquid–liquid extraction followed by an <b>automated</b> chromatographic <b>clean-up</b> by an sPFE device. After volume reduction the cleaned extracts were analysed by quadrupole GC/MS. Quantification was based on internal standards. An extensive quality assurance and method test programme demonstrated conservatively determined limits of detection and quantification from 0. 3 to 10 ng g- 1 in human milk, with recoveries of internal standards from 50 % to 101 %. Thus, the method allowed the quality-assured detection of di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-allyl phthalate (DAP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP) and di-cyclohexyl phthalate (DcHP) in 30 human milk samples provided by 30 volunteers from southern Germany. DiBP, DBP and DEHP were the most commonly detected PAE, with median levels of 1. 0, 0. 6 and 2. 3 ng g- 1, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A fast <b>automated</b> {{extraction}} and <b>clean-up</b> {{procedure for}} low-level analysis of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (cPCBs) in biological fluids is presented. Online extraction of prepared fluids {{is carried out}} using disposable octadecyl bonded (C- 18) solid-phase extraction columns. Extracts are then cleaned up through disposable multi-layer silica (acidic, basic and neutral) and dispersed PX- 21 carbon columns. This new methodology is compared with classical Soxhlet extraction and manual solid-phase extraction in terms of repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy and recovery rates for reference and certified materials. Robustness is evaluated on different matrices, such as cow's milk, breast milk and human serum. As {{a consequence of the}} reduced number of reusable glassware used, as well as lowering of solvent consumption, recorded blank levels are decreased in favor of limits of detection (LODs). Total analysis time and cost are further reduced using simultaneous sample preparation units and the sample throughput is increased compared to classical methods. As a result, this new approach appears to be suitable for the fast sample preparation often required for such fluids in case of emergency foodstuffs analysis or during large epidemiological studies.

40|$|This article reviews some of {{the recent}} {{developments}} in the extraction and clean-up areas of biological samples dedicated to dioxin and related compound analysis. A brief introduction on the major dioxin contamination events, which have occurred in the food chain, is given to illustrate the need of fast high throughput methods in case of crises. The emphasis of this paper is the method development based upon reliable instrumental extraction techniques for rapid sample processing and automation such as; supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and, solid-phase extraction (SPE). The PLE and SPE are also discussed in conjunction {{with the use of a}} multi-column <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> system that can accommodate up to 5 g of extracted lipids. The fractionation in sub-groups of analytes during the clean-up process allows the isolation of various types of toxicants from a single sample and illustrates the versatility of the system.

40|$|We {{report on}} the use of a {{state-of-the-art}} method for the measurement of selected polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated biphenyls in human serum specimens. The sample preparation procedure is based on manual small size solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up</b> and fractionation using multi-sorbent liquid chromatography columns. SPE cartridges and all clean-up columns are disposable. Samples are processed in batches of 20 units, including one blank control (BC) sample and one quality control (QC) sample. The analytical measurement is performed using gas chromatography coupled to isotope dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry. The sample throughput corresponds to one series of 20 samples per day, from sample reception to data quality cross-check and reporting, once the procedure has been started and series of samples keep being produced. Four analysts are required to ensure proper performances of the procedure. The entire procedure has been validated under International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17025 criteria and further tested over more than 1500 unknown samples during various epidemiological studies. The method is further discussed in terms of reproducibility, efficiency and long-term stability regarding the 35 target analytes. Data related to quality control and limit of quantification (LOQ) calculations are also presented and discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Particulate matter (PM) is an air {{pollutant}} that seriously impacts human health. Epidemiological {{studies have shown}} associations between human exposure to urban air PM and lung cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OPAHs) are two groups of compounds associated with PM in ambient air. These compounds are generated from the incomplete combustion of organic material of both natural and anthropogenic origin. PAHs are thought {{to play an important}} role in the adverse health outcomes from exposure to PM in air. OPAHs contain one or more carbonyl groups and could be more toxic to humans compared to their corresponding parent PAH. Measurement of these compounds at trace levels in complex matrices requires analytical methods with high selectivity and precision and low quantification limits. This thesis describes the development and application of analytical methods for the determination of PAHs and OPAHs in ambient air and engine exhaust PM. Extraction was performed using pressurized liquid extraction, and two different setups for liquid chromatography–gas chromatography (LC-GC) were employed for automated sample clean-up, separation and detection. The developed methods were validated using standard reference materials issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The first methodology developed used off-line solid-phase extraction and on-line LC-GC/mass spectrometry (LC-GC/MS). This method provided low limits of quantification and high selectivity and was successfully applied to the determination of OPAHs and PAHs in PM from the urban atmosphere of Sulaymaniyah city in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. The concentration of benzo[a]pyrene in Sulaymaniyah city was three times higher than the legislated EU target value (1 ng/m 3). Furthermore the analytical method was applied on exhaust PM of vehicles fuelled with various gasoline/ethanol blends. The emissions factors for PAHs and OPAHs were highest when using 70 % ethanol/gasoline blends at - 7 °C. The second method developed provided fully <b>automated</b> <b>clean-up,</b> separation and detection of PAHs in PM extracts using a multidimensional 2 D-LC/ 2 D-GC system. Polar, mono/di-aromatic and alkane compounds were successively removed by the two-dimensional LC part of the system. Heart-cutting segments from the first GC column (first dimension) to the second GC column (second dimension) increased the resolution of poorly separated or co-eluted PAHs. The results were in good agreement with the certified values from NIST (± 25 %).
