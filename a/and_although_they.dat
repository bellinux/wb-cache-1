5|$|Bobby Hope led Albion to {{a victory}} {{at the start of}} their League Cup campaign, having {{received}} a bye past the first round, scoring a hat-trick as the team went on to defeat Aston Villa 6–0. Albion played Manchester City on 5 October 1966 in the third round, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> won the game 4–2, they were pressed hard for the victory. Albion went a goal down after nine minutes against Northampton Town, but came back to win 3–1.|$|E
5|$|During the event, five wrestlers {{suffered}} legitimate injuries. Randy Orton dislocated {{his shoulder}} while Ted DiBiase suffered a concussion, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> both appeared on Raw the following night, {{they did not}} wrestle. CM Punk required 13 staples to close the wound in his forehead he sustained during his match with Mysterio. Batista suffered a back and tailbone injury during his match with John Cena, who himself suffered a laceration and lost a tooth.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 Six Nations Championship, England lost to both France and Ireland and {{finished}} third. Sir Clive Woodward resigned on 2 September and Andy Robinson was appointed England head coach. Robinson's first Six Nations campaign in 2005 resulted in fourth place for England, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> then defeated Australia 26–16, {{the year was}} completed with a 23–19 loss to the All Blacks.|$|E

5|$|Latics {{were elected}} to the Football League in 1978 and the club were {{promoted}} to the Premier League, the top division of English football, in 2005. The club were relegated in 2013 <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> suffered further relegation in 2015, the club was promoted again in 2016, meaning they currently play in the second tier of English football, the Football League Championship. During the clubs spell in the top division, they were crowned 2013 FA Cup champions, defeating Manchester City in the final.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2011, Georgia Tech {{was forced}} to vacate the win due to an NCAA investigation. The NCAA accused Tech of fielding an ineligible player during the game, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> were unable to obtain {{evidence}} that an ineligible player had been played, the NCAA concluded that the investigation had been hampered by Georgia Tech's administration. This was taken as evidence of wrongdoing, and penalties for playing an ineligible player were imposed.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} {{can be prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E

5|$|The Skye Cuillin {{mountains}} provide classic {{examples of}} glacial topography {{and were the}} subject of an early published account by James Forbes in 1846 (who had become a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh aged only nineteen). He partnered Louis Agassiz on his trip to Scotland in 1840 <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> subsequently argued, Forbes went on to publish other important papers on Alpine glaciers.|$|E
5|$|The words {{attachment}} {{style or}} pattern {{refer to the}} various types of attachment arising from early care experiences, called secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, (all organized), and disorganized. Some of these styles are more problematic than others, <b>and,</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> are not disorders in the clinical sense, are sometimes discussed under the term 'attachment disorder'.|$|E
5|$|By now, Chapman {{had retired}} as a player in {{first-class}} football, having played his last match against Watford in January 1909, but filled the gap he left, as well as showing his eye for spotting talent, by signing players such as future England international Fanny Walden. As Southern League champions, Northampton contested and lost the 1909 FA Charity Shield, 2–0 to Newcastle United, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> did not win the Southern League title again during Chapman's time as manager, they {{finished in the top}} four in each of the following three seasons. Additionally, they proved their mettle in the FA Cup against First Division sides, knocking out The Wednesday and taking Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United to replays, losing 1–0 both times.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|From 2009, Manchester Phoenix, {{who play}} home {{games at the}} Altrincham Ice Dome, {{are members of the}} English Premier Ice Hockey League. The club was formed in 2003 as the {{successor}} to Manchester Storm {{and was one of the}} founder members of the Elite Ice Hockey League. In 2008–09 they finished sixth in the Elite Ice Hockey League. The Trafford Metros are the Phoenix's junior side and are also based at the Altrincham Ice Dome. Rugby Union side Sale Sharks were formerly based in Trafford, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> now play at the AJ Bell Stadium in Salford their former home ground at Heywood Road in Sale is still used for training. Sale Sharks won the Guinness Premiership in 2006; in 2008–09 they finished fifth.|$|E
5|$|Ilse Steppat as Irma Bunt – Blofeld's henchwoman who {{assists in}} the {{attempts}} to eliminate Bond, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> fail to finish him off Bunt eventually manages to kill Tracy. Said {{to be the most}} successful piece of casting in the film, the Bunt character did not appear in the film You Only Live Twice, although she did appear in the novel. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was Steppat's last role: the 52-year-old {{died of a heart attack}} on 22 December 1969, four days after the film premiered.|$|E

5|$|Kelsey wanders {{from the}} tour and {{attempts}} to phone Maria, but disturbs an unknown beast, the Bane Mother, to the annoyance of the staff, to which Wormwood orders the alarms switched off and Sarah Jane killed. Maria attempts to phone Kelsey, but sets off the alarms again, causing the Archetype to escape, transferring the focus upon him. Maria, while escaping, encounters him, who just mimics her, and they escape into a women's bathroom. Sarah Jane then enters, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> are surprised to see each other, they manage to escape the factory, albeit without Kelsey. When they arrive back on Bannerman Road, Sarah warns Maria not to get involved as her life is too dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four years all three of the regiment's {{operational}} squadrons eventually served in Vietnam, providing invaluable close support to the infantry, particularly during the clearance of Viet Cong bunker systems. Although their value in Vietnam was originally questioned by some, they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence, and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties. The Centurions were able to move through the countryside more easily than expected <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield. The tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{instructed}} Bremner {{to be more}} attacking in the 1973–74 campaign, and {{the result}} was 11 goals in 52 appearances, his biggest goal tally in 12 years. The manager focused entirely on the league and told his team the aim was to go the season unbeaten, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> lost three games they secured a second league title by a five-point margin on second-place Liverpool. Bremner was named on the PFA Team of the Year and finished second in the FWA Footballer of the Year voting to Ian Callaghan. At {{the end of the season}} he was given a testimonial match against Sunderland which raised him £32,500; he had chosen the opponents in an attempt to avenge defeat in the previous year's FA Cup final.|$|E

5|$|Rice is the {{foundation}} of every meal, and is often eaten with fish broth, greens, beans or squash. Manioc and green bananas are staples most commonly eaten when other more preferable foods are too expensive or out of season. The Antankarana were historically herders <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> are now generally agriculturalists, cattle are kept for milk. They are also viewed as a form of wealth; the number of cattle one gives away indicates generosity, and the number sacrificed to the ancestors is a measure of loyalty. The sacrifice of zebu is a typical element of many major rituals and celebrations ranging from Muslim holidays to life events like marriage, death and birth.|$|E
5|$|Temporarily {{transferred}} to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 <b>and,</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> immediately expanded the church building, {{it was still}} not {{large enough to accommodate}} all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, Magloire-Désiré Barthet, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many catechumen.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Massachusetts {{regiment}} {{that served}} during the Civil War {{was formed in}} 1855 during the reorganization of the Massachusetts militia. Other units {{dating back to the}} 18th century were given the designation 6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia. They were formed and disbanded at various times <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>they</b> shared the same numerical designation, there was no continuous unit known as the 6th Massachusetts. One of the units designated as the 6th Massachusetts was a regiment that served during King George's War in the Siege of Louisbourg in 1745. During the Revolutionary War, the 6th Massachusetts Regiment was engaged in the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battle of Harlem Heights, the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Saratoga.|$|E
