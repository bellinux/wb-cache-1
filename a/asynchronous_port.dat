50|$|DECserver 500/550The DECserver 500 series server was an Ethernet Communications Server for Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs), {{configurable}} {{to provide}} 128 EIA-423-A or 64 RS-232 <b>asynchronous</b> <b>port</b> connections to DEC asynchronous terminals. Both RS-232, via the 8 port CXY08 Q-Bus communication option card, and EIA-423-A, via the 16 port CXA16 communication option card and EIA-422 16 port CXB16 communication option card could be mixed together in any combination {{from two to}} eight cards in one server. The DECserver 510 and 550 would also support CXM04 IBM 3270 Terminal option cards, but on VMS only. The DECserver 500 series server provided a convenient method to connect logically up to 128 Digital asynchronous terminals {{to one or more}} service nodes (hosts) on an Ethernet. The DECserver 500 series server also allowed for ULTRIX host-initiated connections to asynchronous printers. The DECserver 500 series server implemented the LAT protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet. The 500 series differed from other DECservers in that the configuration was not stored in nonvolatile storage locally on the server itself, but rather downline loaded from a file on a MOP host. Configuration changes which needed to remain permanently had to be changed locally on the DECserver and also updated on the MOP host using the OpenVMS Terminal Server Configurator utility (SYS$COMMON:DECSERVERDS5CFG on VMS or /usr/lib/dnet/tsc on Ultrix) so that it would return the next reboot. The 500 and 550 models are based on the PDP-11/53 chipset with 512kb or 1.5mb of on-board ram and can be reverted to a full PDP-11/53 system with a PROM swap and console port re-wire.|$|E

40|$|Despite the availability, {{inherent}} parallelism, {{and potential}} fault tolerance of networked workstations and microcomputers, most programmers do not write distributed code. Those that do are often {{overwhelmed by the}} asynchrony, concurrency, and tricky failure behaviour inherent in such systems. In this thesis, we describe the design and implementation of a new programming language called Distributed ML. Distributed ML provides a programming construct called a port group that hides the sources of complexity listed above and can be implemented efficiently. Port groups are intermachine multicast channels which provide membership and failure information to application programmers. Although inherently <b>asynchronous,</b> <b>port</b> groups guarantee the delivery of data sent through them and can order such data in several different ways, thereby providing many of the assurances of synchronous communication. Port groups are general-purpose communication abstractions {{that can be used}} to transfer information between machines, between processes on the same machine, and between threads within the same process. In this thesis, we demonstrate that efficient distributed programs-even highly available and fault-tolerant distributed programs-can be quickly developed, easily reasoned about, and properly coded in a well-designed high level programming language. First, we provide an implementation and description of port groups in the context of the Concurrent ML concurrent programming language, which is a superset of the Standard ML general-purpose programming language. Second, we introduce a formal theory for relating the membership and ordering properties of port groups. Finally, we argue that our implementation matches the formal specification...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSynchronization using {{flip-flop}} chains {{imposes a}} latency {{of a few}} clock cycles when transferring data and control signals between clock domains. We propose a design scheme that avoids this latency by performing synchronization as part of state/data computations while guaranteeing that metastability is contained and its effects tolerated (with an acceptable failure probability). We present a theoretical framework for modeling synchronous state machines {{in the presence of}} metastability and use it to prove properties that guarantee some form of reliability. Specifically, we show that the inevitable state/data corruption resulting from propagating metastable states can be confined to a subset of computations. Applications that can tolerate certain failures can exploit this property to leverage low-latency and quasi-reliable operation simultaneously. We demonstrate the approach by designing a Network-on-Chip router with zero-latency <b>asynchronous</b> <b>ports</b> and show via simulation that it outperforms a variant with two flip-flop synchronizers at a negligible cost in packet transfer reliability...|$|R

At present, manufacturers are starting to introduce small, household human-interactive robots to the market. Any human-interactive device has safety, endurability and simplicity constraints, which are especially strict when it comes to robots. Indeed, we are still far from a multi-purpose intelligent household robot, but human-interactive robots and arti cial intelligence research has evolved considerably, demonstration prototypes are a proof of what can be done. This project contributes to the research in humaninteractive robots, as the robotic arm and hand used are specially designed for human-interactive applications. The present study provides a distributed framework for an arm and a hand devices based on the robotics YARP protocol using the WAMTM arm and the BarrettHandTM as well as a basic modular client application complemented with vision. Firstly, two device drivers and a network interface are designed and implemented to control the WAMTM arm and the BarrettHandTM from the network. The drivers allow abstract access to each device, providing three ports: command requests port, state requests <b>port</b> and <b>asynchronous</b> replies <b>port.</b> Secondly, each driver is then encapsulated by YARP devices publishing realtime monitoring feedback and motion control to the network through what is called a Network wrapper. In particular, the network wrapper for the WAMTM arm and BarrettHandTM provides a state port, command port, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) <b>port</b> and an <b>asynchronous</b> noti cations <b>port.</b> The state port provides the WAMTM position and orientation feedback at 50 Hz, which represents a maximum blindness of one centimetre. This rst part of the project sets the foundations of a distributed, complete robot, whose design enables processing and power payload to be shared by di erent workstations. Moreover, users are able to work with the robot remotely over Ethernet and Wireless through a clear, understandable local interface within YARP. In addition to the distributed robotic framework provided, a client software framework with vision is also supplied. The client framework establishes a general software shell for further development and is organized in the basic, separate robotic branches: control, vision and plani cation. The vision module supports distributed image grabbing on mobile robotics, and shared-memory for xed, local vision. In order to incorporate environment interaction and robot autonomy with the planner, hand-eye transformation matrices have been obtained to perform object grasping and manipulation. The image processing is based on OpenCV libraries and provides object recognition with Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features matching, Hough transform and polygon approximation algorithms. Grasping and path planning use pre-de ned grasps which take into account the size, shape and orientation of the target objects. The proof-of-concept applications feature a household robotic arm with the ability to tidy randomly distributed common kitchen objects to speci ed locations, with robot real-time monitoring and basic control.

40|$|Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is {{emerging}} as a crucial technology within the resource and communications sector, allowing {{for the development of}} autonomous control in hazardous environments. This thesis is concerned with the design, construction and evaluation of a low cost and high performance DGPS which can be embedded into robotic systems. The principle behind this thesis is to prove that a DGPS can be designed to meet the same performance of an industrial grade system, while using low end components. The thesis is composed of five major stages: research, design, construction, evaluation and documentation. This thesis is to provide documentation of the development and evaluation of the DGPS. The final product is a fully documented and highly functional DGPS system, for the Murdoch University School of Engineering & Energy to integrate into future projects. Standard GPS systems are based on a single Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal receiver to process position co-ordinates and relevant data. These GNSS signals containing pseudoranges, travel through the atmosphere and are susceptible to distortion, which is the predominate cause of error in GPS positioning. The atmospheric distortion and hence positioning error can be significantly reduced through the use of DGPS as it assumes that the signals have travelled the same atmospheric path and hence induced with the same distortion. By adopting this concept, highly accurate relative positioning between receivers can be produced through a series of calculations. DGPS can be extended further to produce corrected positioning based on fixed receiver locations which can compare the error of the fixed position to those received, and then apply the same error to other mobile receiver positions. Currently a large scale network of DGPS base stations exists and can be used for correcting commercial and industrial grade systems, however these can be expensive. The expense of these systems is largely dependent on the accuracy and functionality that the system can produce, and therefore highlights the need for this thesis as a means of a cost effective solution. The prototype produced in this thesis was the product of thorough engineering design and evaluation of the three major components; communications, hardware and software. Each of these components had sub-objectives allow the main objective of a low cost, high performance system to be achieved. Evaluation of proposed communication wireless transceivers was undertaken to find characteristics of reliability, suitable bandwidth and a sufficient operating distance. The wireless communications is used for the transmission of the base station positioning data to the mobile station for processing. Comparative testing methods of the APPCON APC 200 found it to be a suitable alternative to the University proposed HopeRF HM-TR transceivers. The APPCON provides reliable data transmission, with error correction capabilities while exceeding an operational distances of 850 meters. Processing the incoming simultaneous stream of pseudoranges from both GPS receiver modules requires a minimum of two hardware universal <b>asynchronous</b> receiver/transmitter (UART) <b>ports,</b> while meeting the system memory and processing requirements. The initial open-source Arduino Duemilanove microcontroller chosen for the project was deemed to be unsuitable after evaluation of two software based UART. The Arduino Mega, having met these requirements, has been used as the prototype microcontroller as it provides four hardware UART ports and largely redundant memory and processing capabilities. Arduino is based on the open-source software environment called ‘wiring’ which is a derivative of the C++ software language. The strong online support community for the Arduino has developed an expansive range of open-source software libraries which can be adapted to user projects. Implementing these software libraries, developed as community based projects, means that advanced capabilities and extensively tested code is integrated into the system software code. The outcome of combining these components has completed the sub objectives of this project and has resulted in a high functioning, reliable, accurate and low cost system. Thorough evaluation of the DGPS prototype has yielded results that substantially exceed the manufacturer rated specifications and prove the benefits of DGPS relative positioning. The average accuracy of the system in an open environment has achieved 0. 216 meter averaged distance and an operation range of 882 meters. Testing of the system has been undertaken in a number of environments to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the system. The finalized hardware value of the prototype was 467. 28, developing an accurate positioning system at a budget price...|$|R
