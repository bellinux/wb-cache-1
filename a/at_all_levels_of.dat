For cg-Chart, developed c-Chart by used the mean and variance of the geometric distribution constructed control limits. For cmg-Chart, the mean used for constructed the control limits. The cme-Chart, developed control limits of c-Chart from median and variance values of geometric distribution.

5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> society.

This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E

5|$|Although {{tropical}} cyclones in {{the extreme}} eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from a subtropical ridge, this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance. Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband, resembling the precursor to an eye, tightened around the center. At 06:00UTC on August30, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred 390mi (625km) east-southeast of Praia, Cape Verdeamong the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851. A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average sea surface temperatures. The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the circulation. Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75mph (120km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 00:00UTC, August31.

Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of the menu, and new store designs to standardize {{the look and feel}} of the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E
