Meanwhile, Australian Navy Clearance divers infiltrated the area aboard the Collins-class submarine , conducting a covert beach reconnaissance ahead of the amphibious landing. The following day mechanised infantry from the 5/7 RAR conducted a beach landing at first light. RESPFOR subsequently secured Ambeno. Reinforced by Gurkhas from 2 RGR, the force then swept through the area, capturing a number of militia while the remainder were believed to have fled to West Timor.

Communist communications and resupply routes between War Zone C and D also met the Ho Chi Minh Trail in this area.

5000|$|The major {{tactical}} innovation {{illustrated in}} Operation IRVING was airmobile combat. An <b>airmobile</b> <b>operation</b> {{is one in}} which combat forces and their equipment move about the battlefield in aircraft to engage in ground combat. In such an operation, helicopters not only transport the forces to the battle area, but also enable them to develop the situation and to reinforce, withdraw, and displace combat power during the battle. The purpose of an airmobile assault is to position fresh combat troops on or near-their tactical objectives. The tactical unit can fly over obstacles and impassable terrain to land at the strategic point in the battle area. Lieutenant General John H. Hay Jr.|$|E

The North Vietnamese Army was a well-trained, equipped, and led force. They turned A Shau into a formidable sanctuary —complete with PT76 tanks; powerful crew-served 37mm antiaircraft cannons, some radar controlled; twin-barreled 23mm cannons; and scores of 12.7mm heavy machine guns.
