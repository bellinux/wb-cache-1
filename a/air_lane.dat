60|$|Lane {{could not}} catch the low reply. He lingered there a while longer, and then {{returned}} to the hall, much surprised to find it so dark he could scarcely distinguish the dancers. The lights had been lowered. If the dance had been violent and strange before this procedure, it was now a riot. In the semi-darkness the dancers cut loose. The paper strings had been loosened and had fallen down to become tangled with the flying feet and legs. Confetti swarmed like dark snowdrops in the hot <b>air.</b> <b>Lane</b> actually smelled the heat of bodies--a strangely stirring and yet noxious sensation. A rushing, murmuring, shrill sound--voices, laughter, cries, and the sliding of feet and brushing of gowns--filled the hall--ominous to Lane's over-sensitive faculties, swelling unnaturally, the expression of unrestrained physical abandon. Lane walked along the edge of this circling, wrestling melee, down to the corner where the orchestra held forth. They seemed actuated by the same frenzy which possessed the dancers. The piccolo player lay on his back on top of the piano, piping his shrill notes at the ceiling. And Lane made sure this player was drunk. On the moment then the jazz came to an end with a crash. The lights flashed up. The dancers clapped and stamped their pleasure.|$|E

50|$|Flight 810-9 left Vancouver International Airport at 6:10 PM on 9 December 1956, {{assigned}} {{to fly the}} Green 1 <b>air</b> <b>lane</b> east to Calgary, Alberta, though the pilots asked for and received clearance for a routing via airways Red 44 and Red 75 instead, which took the aircraft past Cultus Lake and into a weather system called a trowal. The pilots climbed to 19200 ft by 6:55, when they experienced a fire warning indication in No. 2 (the inner port engine), which was then shut down as a precaution (false fire warnings in North Star aircraft had been noted on numerous previous occasions.) Pilot Allan Clarke, 35, a former bomber commander, radioed Vancouver Air Traffic Control to notify them of the event ("looks like we had a fire"), requested a return flight path on Airway Green 1 back to Vancouver Airport (the flight path with the most favourable terrain for an aircraft losing altitude), but inexplicably made a right turn instead of a left one and wound up heading west-southwest 12 mi south of Green 1 and straight into the border mountains.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss some aspects of {{decision}} fusion using Fuzzy Logic of type 1 for two aviation scenarios. We study the fuzzy inference system/engine and briefly discuss the MATLAB-GUI based tool developed by authors to evaluate any existing or new fuzzy implication functions. Two examples: i) formation flight, and ii) flying along the <b>air</b> <b>lane</b> are numerically evaluated and the performance o decision fusion systems incorporating fuzzy logic is illustrated. The results indicate that some existing as well as new implication functions, devised by the authors, work very well for the examples considered. This opens up new possibilities of application of fuzzy logic based decision fusion to varieties of aerospace/aviation problems in data fusion, decision making and decision fusion...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft wake {{vortices}} {{present a}} potential risk to following aircraft, particularly during final approach and landing, as wake vortices may {{remain in the}} <b>air</b> <b>lane</b> for a long time. Wind and turbulence are the key factors influencing the wake vortex evolution, but also the wake vortex generation behind the aircraft. Flying through a gust influences the wake vortex roll-up process and its evolution. Note that vertical and lateral gusts may affect counter-rotating wake vortices differently. Both vortices influence each other by inducing a downward velocity. Disturbances may therefore lead to local vortex tilting and later to complex three-dimensional deformation. This work employs two different hybrid RANS-LES approaches to investigate the effect of gusts on wake-vortex evolution. In a one-way coupling, a pre-calculated RANS velocity field of the aircraft’s near-field is being swept through an LES domain. The effect of a sine gust on the turbulent wake is modelled by manipulating the RANS-field accordingly. As a more sophisticated approach the concept of two-way coupling is being presented. Here an LES and a URANS solver are coupled bi-directionally, exchanging values at every physical time step...|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary {{air traffic}} control {{procedures}} prohibited overtaking in the air corridors to ensure a safe operating environment inside these narrow <b>air</b> <b>lanes</b> and to prevent aircraft from accidentally straying into East German airspace. This compelled jet aircraft crews to reduce their speed if the preceding aircraft was a slower-flying piston or turboprop plane. This in turn extended the jet's flying time inside the air corridor and resulted in higher operating costs due to increased fuel consumption at , especially on short-haul internal German services covering a maximum distance of [...]|$|R

Air bursts are also studied by a fleet of over 40 aircraft that collect samples of the air in the drop zone as well as surrounding areas. Data is sent back to the radiological command center. After each flight, all aircraft used in trailing and sampling are washed down to decontaminate the aircraft and return them to service within a 24-hour period.|$|R
50|$|By early 1942, it {{had become}} clear that the Philippines could not be held, principally because the Japanese had cut the only sea and <b>air</b> <b>lanes</b> over which {{available}} reinforcements, such as they were, could reach General MacArthur. By the end of February 1942, the air connection between India and Australia was also cut due {{to the advancement of}} Japanese forces into Southeast Asia, although some heavy bombers and other reinforcements from the USA were able to get through before the Japanese captured Singapore and overran the Netherlands East Indies. Fortunately for the Allies, the five remaining major routes were held.|$|R

Iran Air Flight IR655 flew every day out of Bandar Abbas—a civil {{as well as}} military airport—on a scheduled passenger flight to Dubai using established <b>air</b> <b>lanes.</b> The Italian navy and another U.S. warship, the frigate , confirmed that the plane was climbing—not diving to attack—at {{the time of the}} missile strike. The U.S. radio warnings were only broadcast on 121.5 MHz, not air traffic control frequencies and mistakenly identified the altitude and position of the plane, so the Airbus crew, if they were monitoring [...] "guard," [...] could have misinterpreted the warnings as referring to another aircraft. Captain David Carlson of Sides later said that the destruction of the airliner [...] "marked the horrifying climax to Rogers' aggressiveness".|$|R
50|$|The Fiesta is {{organised}} {{by a local}} Marketing agency, co-partner is the City of Leipzig. In 1995 {{the first}} Balloon Fiesta attracted 5000 visitors as a local event in Mügeln. In 1996 the festival was relocated to a recreation area close to Leipzig called „Silbersee“. This area lies beyond the <b>air</b> <b>lanes</b> of Leipzig. The spacious recreation area „Silbersee“ is situated between the urban areas of Loessnig (a district of Leipzig) and the open-pit landscape in the southern areas of Leipzig, which is currently {{in a process of}} recultivation and transfiguration. The public park „Silbersee“ has room for over one hundred balloons. Competitions between the hot-air balloons are essential at the Saxonia International Balloon Fiesta. The different kinds of competition-flights are: Fox hunting, Key grab and flying as far as possible. Most of the balloons are sponsored by large companies.|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} and functional requirements for commercial communication satellites are discussed. The need for providing quality service at an acceptable cost is emphasized. Specialized services are postulated in a needs model which forecasts future demands. This needs model {{is based upon}} 322 separately identified needs for long distance communication. It is shown that the 1985 demand for satellite communication service for a domestic region such as the United States, and surrounding sea and <b>air</b> <b>lanes,</b> may require {{on the order of}} 100, 000 MHz of bandwith. This level of demand can be met by means of the presently allocated bandwidths and developing some key technologies. Suggested improvements include: (1) improving antennas so that high speed switching will be possible; (2) development of solid state transponders for 12 GHz and possibly higher frequencies; (3) development of switched or steered beam antennas with 10 db or higher gain for aircraft; and (4) continued development of improved video channel compression techniques and hardware...|$|R

50|$|The Germans {{deployed}} {{among others}} the tri-motor Ju 52 transport for airborne {{troops in the}} attack on the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. The first large-scale air attack with paratroops in history subsequently occurred during the Battle for The Hague. No fewer than 295 Ju 52s were lost in that venture and {{in other parts of the}} country, due to varying circumstances, among which were accurate and effective Dutch anti-aircraft defences and German mistakes in using soggy airfields not able to support the heavy aircraft. Thus, almost an entire year's production was lost in the Netherlands. These losses were never surpassed in any air battle in history. The lack of sufficient numbers of aircraft most probably heavily influenced the decision not to invade England following the Battle of Britain. In total, the Nazis lost over 2,000 planes in the continuous air war over the Netherlands. This high number can also be attributed to the main Allied <b>air</b> <b>lanes</b> into Germany, that led directly over the Netherlands. Altogether, over 5,000 aircraft were lost over the Netherlands (Allied and Nazi), and over 20,000 crew lost their lives in these mishaps. Most of these crew were buried locally, so that the Netherlands has some 600 places where Allied and Nazi airmen are buried. This makes the country the densest burial place for air crew in all of Europe.|$|R
