In November 1984, US Teledyne Continental Motors {{corporation}} (taken over by General Dynamics Land Systems conglomerate) {{was awarded}} a contract to upgrade the firepower and mobility of a single T-54. The modernization initial designation was T-54E but it was subsequently renamed as Ramses II. The first prototype was sent to Egypt for extensive firepower and mobility trials in January 1987 and with them ending later that year. In late 1989 Egypt signed a technical <b>assistance</b> <b>agreement</b> with TCM to support continued Egyptian trials of the Ramses II. The new set of trials began in summer of 1990.

2500|$|Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam assumed {{power as}} head of state and Derg chairman, after having his two {{predecessors}} killed, as well as {{tens of thousands of}} other suspected opponents. [...] The new Marxist government undertook socialist reforms, including nationalisation of landlords' property and the church's property. Before the coup, Ethiopian peasants' way of life was thoroughly influenced by the church teachings; 280 days a year are religious feasts or days of rest. Mengistu's years in office were marked by a totalitarian-style government and the country's massive militarization, financed by the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, and assisted by Cuba. In December 1976, an Ethiopian delegation in Moscow signed a military <b>assistance</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Soviet Union. The following April 1977, Ethiopia abrogated its military <b>assistance</b> <b>agreement</b> with the United States and expelled the American military missions.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the strike}} was spreading, Honduras was also {{becoming}} more {{deeply involved in}} the movement to topple the Arbenz government in Guatemala. In late May, a military <b>assistance</b> <b>agreement</b> was concluded between the United States and Honduras, and large quantities of United States arms were quickly shipped to Honduras. Much of this incoming assistance was passed on to anti-Arbenz rebels commanded by Castillo Armas. In June these forces crossed into Guatemala and after several days of political maneuvering but little actual fighting, Arbenz fled into exile, and Castillo Armas became president.|$|E

Moscow demanded that Estonia allow the USSR to establish Soviet military bases and station 25,000 troops on Estonian soil {{for the duration of}} the European war. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding mutual <b>assistance</b> <b>agreement</b> on September 28, 1939.|$|E

50|$|The United States {{market for}} the {{electrical}} products covered by the agreements is heavily concentrated. Although they {{are two of the}} largest manufacturers of electrical products outside the United States, MHI and MELCO do not compete in this market. Their entrance into the United States market would substantially increase the amount of competition in that market. By 1965 MELCO and MHI wished to sell in the United States and had the technical ability to design around Westinghouse's many patents. Their failure to do so, the government contends, {{is a direct result of}} the Technical <b>Assistance</b> <b>Agreements.</b> Because MELCO and MHI are licensed by the Agreements under Westinghouse's foreign patents, and because they have had such licenses for a long period of time, they have become so committed to Westinghouse technology as to be economically incapable of developing new products that might compete in the United States without infringing upon Westinghouse's United States patents. Without licenses under Westinghouse's United States patents, MELCO and MHI are effectively barred from the United States market by dint of the patent laws and the heavy investment in Westinghouse technology that the Technical <b>Assistance</b> <b>Agreements</b> induced them to make.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{terms of}} {{repatriation}} are still unclear. Without specific mutual legal <b>assistance</b> <b>agreements,</b> they are {{done on a}} case by case basis. For instance, Switzerland confiscated US 600 million of former Nigerian President Abacha's loot, but worked out an agreement to use the money for development purposes, monitored by the World Bank. Other potential agreements are not so generous. When Indonesia originally approached Hong Kong to repatriate Indonesian banker Hendra Rahardja's assets, the Hong Kong authorities offered to assist for a 20% commission, and then splitting the remaining money evenly.|$|R
2500|$|Although Trujillo {{sought to}} emulate Generalissimo Francisco Franco, he welcomed Spanish Republican {{refugees}} following the Spanish Civil War. During the Holocaust in the Second World War, the Dominican Republic took in many Jews fleeing Hitler {{who had been}} refused entry by other countries[...] These decisions arose from a policy of blanquismo, closely connected with anti-Haitian xenophobia, which sought to add more whites to the Dominican population by promoting immigration from Europe. As part of the Good Neighbor policy, in 1940, the U.S. State Department signed a treaty with Trujillo relinquishing control over the nation's customs. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor Trujillo followed the United States in declaring war on the Axis powers, {{even though he had}} openly professed admiration for Hitler and Mussolini. During the Cold War, he maintained close ties to the United States, declaring himself the world's 'Number One Anticommunist' and becoming the first Latin American President to sign a Mutual Defense <b>Assistance</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{guard was}} first formed under Emperor Basil II after 988, {{following}} the Christianization of Kievan Rus' and union with Vladimir I of Kiev, who sent 6,000 men to Basil {{as part of}} a military <b>assistance</b> <b>agreement.</b> Basil's distrust of the native Byzantine guardsmen, whose loyalties often shifted with fatal consequences, as well as the proven loyalty of the Varangians, many of whom served in Byzantium even before, led the emperor to employ them as his personal guard. Over the years, new recruits from Sweden, Denmark, and Norway kept a predominantly Scandinavian cast to the organization until the late 11th century. So many Scandinavians left to enlist in the guard that a medieval Swedish law from Västergötland stated that no one could inherit while staying in [...] "Greece" [...] — the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire. In the eleventh century, there were also two other European courts that recruited Scandinavians: Kievan Rus', c. 980–1060, and London, 1018–1066 (the Þingalið).|$|E
2500|$|As part of {{terrestrial}} radio giant Clear Channel Communications' early investment into XM in 1998, the companies entered into agreements which provided for certain programming and director designation arrangements {{as long as}} Clear Channel retained the full amount of its original investment in XM. One positive consequence of this was that XM had (and still has) exclusive programming rights to all Clear Channel content, including popular national shows like Coast to Coast AM, but the shows could only be broadcast inside the bandwidth controlled by Clear Channel. In June 2003, Clear Channel entered into a forward sales agreement relating to its ownership of XM. During {{the third quarter of}} 2005, Clear Channel and XM arbitrated the impact of this agreement on the [...] and the [...] The Arbitration Panel decided that the Operational <b>Assistance</b> <b>Agreement</b> would remain in effect, including Clear Channel's right to receive a revenue share of commercial advertising on programming it provides to XM, but declined to enforce the Director Designation Agreement, which forced the Mays family members off the board of directors. Per the original agreement, Clear Channel had the right to program 409.6 kbit/s (or 10%) of XM bandwidth, requiring XM to include commercial advertising on the existing Nashville!, KISS, Mix, and Sunny (now The Music Summit). The amount of advertising on the music channels amounts up to 4 minutes per hour, similar to the amount of advertising XM included before going commercial free. Exceptions include syndicated music shows which carry network spots. Clear Channel advertising on XM is handled by its subsidiary, Premiere Radio Networks. Clear Channel also provided existing talk channel programming (Fox Sports Radio, Extreme XM, Talk Radio). Clear Channel also controlled America Right (formerly Buzz XM), but through a series of show swaps, most non-Clear Channel content was removed and programming control returned to XM Radio. Plans to introduce new regional based talk channels, which would have featured a regional 5 minute newscast for each area of the country, were canceled. Instead, Clear Channel chose to introduce other music and talk channels. Newer channels including ReachMD, America's Talk remain on the air. The Pink Channel, National Lampoon Comedy Radio, WSIX-FM, WLW, and Rock@Random were launched and later removed, and replaced by channels like Bollywood & Beyond, The Music Summit, and Sixx Sense, all of which are on the air today.|$|E
