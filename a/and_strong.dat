5|$|As a {{developing}} typhoon, the outer rainbands of Saomai affected the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam, causing moderate damage. Localized power outages were reported, and damage totaled to US$650,000. Even before Saomai made landfall on Okinawa, the typhoon caused rough seas {{off the coast}} of Japan that resulted in several shipping incidents. Concurrently, the approach of a front into the country interacted with the typhoon, resulting in unprecedented rainfalls in Japan. Due to the floods, approximately 400,000people were evacuated in three prefectures. In Nagoya, observed rainfall totals were the highest since records began in 1891. Despite making landfall on Okinawa, damage was not as severe, though several landslides <b>and</b> <b>strong</b> winds were reported. Overall, damage in Japan and its outlying islands totaled JP¥24.8billion (US$223million) and eleven fatalities were reported. As Saomai tracked near China, its outer rainbands <b>and</b> <b>strong</b> waves prompted the evacuation of 20,000people and caused record high stream heights.|$|E

It thus has very high ionization potentials <b>and</b> <b>strong</b> polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent.
