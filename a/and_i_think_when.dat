You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
2500|$|Obama also said, [...] "It's {{not that}} I want to punish your success. I {{just want to}} make sure that {{everybody}} who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too... My attitude is that if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's gonna be good for everybody. If you've got a plumbing business, you're gonna be better off [...] if you've got a whole bunch of customers who can afford to hire you, and right now everybody's so pinched that business is bad for everybody <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012, Rippon {{announced}} a coaching change, moving to train with Rafael Arutyunyan in Lake Arrowhead, California. At the 2012 Cup of China, Rippon collided with China's Song Nan– who sustained a concussion and withdrew– a minute {{into the final}} warm up before the free skate. Rippon said, [...] "I kind of turned around {{to go into a}} jump <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> Nan Song and I saw each other we both tried to avoid each other, but we went in the same way and we went head first into each other." [...] Rippon finished 4th at the event and 8th at the 2012 NHK Trophy. At the 2013 U.S. Championships, he landed three triple Axels and finished 5th. He was assigned to the 2013 Four Continents but withdrew after sustaining an ankle injury on February 2, 2013.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you know, Robert, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} {{so much about the}} future, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> we come back from our travels we ought to put aside almost all our money to do good with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Ingleby contritely, with a {{trace of}} confusion. [...] "Certainly not. I would never have offered, only we are such old friends; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> you brought that hat home after buying it you {{let me put it}} on for you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some celebrities opposed Davis' {{decision}} {{to continue on}} the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body {{was still in the}} building. Chaka Khan, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: [...] "I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.' [...] I don't know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like... I don't understand how that party went on." [...] Sharon Osbourne condemned the Davis party, declaring: [...] "I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don't {{want to be in a}} hotel room when there's someone you admire who's tragically lost their life four floors up. I'm not interested in being in that environment <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon I'll be all right. Don't {{you even}} say a word, {{no matter what}} happens, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> our little scrap is finished, he won't have {{anything}} {{more to say about}} our leaving the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Muriel. [...] "Do {{you know}} that you are just a little hard, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> one is too hard one is {{generally}} sorry afterwards. Now, I don't understand it all, but you once told me you had got something you wished for done, and were sorry you had. I fancied you were even sorrier than you wished me to know." ...|$|E
60|$|Shortly {{after that}} one glimpse I had had {{of the old}} Admiral, he died. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw him {{standing}} at his gate gazing past me at the distance, he was looking out for an expected messenger--a figure in black moving swiftly towards him with a drawn sword in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he won't {{break his}} heart. Billy {{has too much}} good sense for that. He likes Nettie Blewett pretty well, too, and mother would rather he married her than any one. She's such a good manager <b>and</b> saver. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> Billy is once sure you won't have him, he'll take Nettie. Please don't mention this to any one, will you, Anne?" ...|$|R
60|$|I incline to {{hold that}} Satchells was {{occasionally}} reminiscent of a ballad for the reasons and traces given, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that Scott <b>when</b> his and Satchells' versions coincide, did not borrow direct from Satchells, but that both men had a ballad source.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, pussy," [...] she said, on one {{of these}} {{occasions}} when they chanced to be alone together, [...] "little did you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> we used to be sitting so comfortably here, that our darlings were being tossed about and starved in open boats on the stormy sea! Ah! pussy, pussy, we little knew--but `it's all well that ends well,' as a great writer that you know nothing about has said, and you and I can never, never be thankful enough for getting back, safe and sound, our dear old man, and our darling boys, and our--our little Pauline, the Island Queen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Again you go too fast, Cousin Andre I have {{permitted}} my uncle to consent that M. le Marquis shall make his court to me. I like {{the look of}} the gentleman. I am flattered by his preference when I consider his eminence. It is an eminence that I may find it desirable to share. M. le Marquis does not look {{as if he were a}} dullard. It should be interesting to be wooed by him. It may be more interesting still to marry him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> all is considered, that I shall probably--very probably--decide to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you," [...] she {{answered}} doubtfully; [...] "but please, no. Somehow, I {{think that it would}} spoil everything if I accepted that sort of help from you. If you have any money of Arthur's, keep it for a time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> you write him--I do not want to seem grasping--but I think if he has any to spare you might suggest that he does give me just a little. I have never had anything from him at all. Perhaps he does not quite understand how hard it is for me.|$|E
5000|$|... "In this film, some audiences {{will say}} that the title seems to be very cynical, because it is about two persons living {{together}}, and at the end, they are just separate. But to me, happy together can apply to two persons or apply to a person and his past, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> sometimes <b>when</b> a person is at peace with himself <b>and</b> his past, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it {{is the beginning of a}} relationship which can be happy, and also he can be more open to more possibilities in the future with other people." ...|$|R
3000|$|Once a week {{whenever}} <b>I</b> run out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Saturday is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> run out, so Saturday night I {{just sit}} down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have one of those}} little medical tray organizers, morning and night, and I’ll just start putting them in there based on what I take…[it takes] about an hour.

6000|$|The Governor {{looked puzzled}} for an instant. He {{could not quite}} {{remember}} {{what had happened to}} those jovial men who had cheered him over night. Judson interrupted swiftly: [...] "His Excellency has set them to forced works on barracks <b>and</b> magazines, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> a custom-house. <b>When</b> that is done they will be released, I hope, Excellency." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{this fashion}} then, slowly, {{a day at}} a time, which is very bad for doubting troops, the War came upon us. At first the Winged Hats swept in from the sea as they had done before, and there we met them as before--with the catapults; and they sickened of it. Yet {{for a long time}} they would not trust their duck-legs on land, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> it came to {{revealing}} the secrets of the tribe, the little Picts were afraid or ashamed to show them all the roads across the heather. I had this from a Pict prisoner. They were as much our spies as our enemies, for the Winged Hats oppressed them, and took their winter stores. Ah, foolish Little People! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Sir James, coloring. [...] "I {{am not so}} sure of myself." [...] He {{paused a}} moment, and then added, [...] "That was a right thing for Casaubon to do. But a man may wish {{to do what is}} right, and yet be a sort of {{parchment}} code. A woman may not be happy with him. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is, her friends ought to interfere a little to hinder her from doing anything foolish. You laugh, because you fancy I have some feeling on my own account. But upon my honor, it is not that. I should feel just the same if I were Miss Brooke's brother or uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you know, {{as well as}} I {{can tell}} you, that {{yourself}} {{would be the last}} man to take the whiskey off the table, as long as the lads that were with you chose to be drinking it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> I sent them boys off to Carrick as comfortably asleep as if they were in bed, so that they wouldn't be too late at business this morning, I acted by them as I'd wish anybody to act by me if I had an accident; and if that an't being a good Christian, I don't know what is. So lave off preaching, Father John, and come round to the stables, till I show you the mare that'll win at Carrick; at least, it 'll be a very good nag that 'll take the shine out of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suggested}} it. The {{letter was}} so short I felt ashamed {{to deliver it}} as it stood. I told him to put the time--so as to show {{her that he was}} obliged to write in a hurry. He put the time when the train started; <b>and</b> (<b>I</b> <b>think)</b> the time <b>when</b> the letter was written as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This spring I {{remember}} going {{with her to}} look at a view near the Abbey House, <b>and</b> saying--what <b>I</b> often <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> look at anything beautiful and full of life--that it depressed one to know that all this was so much food for death, and its beauty a thing that to-day is and to-morrow is not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The tiger {{was keeping}} up an angry growl, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt that, unless it took its paw off me, I should soon die, when I heard a shot, and a fierce growl from the tiger, {{and then the}} weight was gone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> fainted. <b>When</b> I came round, I was lying where I fell, {{for many of the}} ladies were insensible, and {{everyone}} was too busy with them to think anything of me.|$|R
60|$|Use Third. Is Christ Jesus {{not only}} a priest of, and a King over, but an Advocate for his people? Let this make us stand and wonder, and be amazed at his humiliation and condescension. We read of his humiliation on earth when he put himself into our flesh, took upon him our sins, and made them as his own unto {{condemnation}} and death. And to be an advocate is an office reproachful to the malicious, if any man be such an one, for those that are base and unworthy. Yea, and the higher and more honourable the person is that pleads for such, the more he humbles himself. The word doth often in effect account him now in heaven as a servant for us, and acts of service are acts of condescension; and I am sure some acts of service have more of that in them than some; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> all things are considered, that Christ neither doth nor can do anything for us there, of a more condescending nature, than to become our Advocate. True, he glories in it; but that doth not show that the work is excellent in itself. It {{is also one of}} his titles of honour; but that is to show how highly God esteems of, and dignifies all his acts; and though this shall tend at last to the greatening of his honour and glory in his kingdom, yet the work itself is amazingly mean.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the riff, both Becki Newton and Vanessa Williams {{claim that}} there were no {{problems}} on the set. Notes Newton: [...] "I think people love drama, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> you watch the show you’ll see the drama was between the characters on screen." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{record was}} {{recorded}} in a Maine farmhouse dating to the 18th century. According to Ritter: [...] "Lyrically, musically, {{and in terms of}} production, it's the most adventurous record I've made yet <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> you hear it you're going to be surprised. Seriously, repeatedly, and in a good way." ...|$|E
5000|$|Heard {{publicly}} {{came out}} at GLAAD's 25th anniversary event in 2010, and has stated, [...] "I don't label myself {{one way or}} another—I have had successful relationships with men and now a woman. I love who I love; it's the person that matters." [...] Of her decision to come out, she said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> became aware of my role in the media, I had to ask myself an important question 'Am I part of the problem?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> millions <b>and</b> millions of hard-working, taxpaying Americans are denied their rights and denied their equality {{you have to ask}} yourself what are the factors that are an epidemic problem and that's what this is." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned to}} me. [...] "Will you come in, Mr. Brocken? I {{have seen that}} your horse is made quite easy. He was fast asleep, poor fellow, as you surmised; <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> dreaming; for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> proffered him a lump of sugar, he thrust his nose into my face and breathed as if I were a peck of corn. The candles are lit, sir; supper is ready." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{producers}} {{brought the}} character {{back to the}} show {{in the second half}} of the final season. About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, [...] "Finally, all of your questions [...] will be answered", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, [...] "No, they will not". Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six: [...] " [...] so sweet <b>and</b> honest. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> hopefully, <b>when</b> people see our scenes that they’ll get that feeling, too. [...] are so incredibly real with each other. I was really grateful that I got to play those scenes and Libby got to sort of express herself in ways that she hasn’t been able to." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a {{successful}} entertainer, {{she was part}} of the glamorous world of the rich and/or famous. Many of her dresses were designed by Colin Becke, whose sister was band vocalist Eve Becke. Lenner recalled: [...] "My days were always very full and time flew. I was very lucky to be singing during a period of the best song writers <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> British dance music was at its best." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I don't like that, It's not {{something}} I like. You're looking to scrap away. The fans are here and paying {{their money to}} watch <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> a player runs down the tunnel without sitting down and watching and getting behind the team, I think that is disrespectful to his team-mates Redknapp reaction on Pavlyuchenko actions. [...] Pavlyuchenko then apologised for his actions, saying it wasn't his best performance and was angry at himself after coming off the pitch and not at the decision to replace him.|$|E
5000|$|Coca recalled, There was {{a special}} {{chemistry}} to Your Show of Shows, I think, because producer-director Max Liebman wasn't afraid to throw out material at the last minute. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> you do live television — well, we stopped for nothing. We had no cue cards, no TelePrompTers, and no ad-libbing on the air, because Max would have died if anybody had ad-libbed. It would have been utter disgrace, {{and you would have}} been drummed right out of the corps.... Nobody ever forgot a line, and that was the amazing part of it.|$|E
60|$|When Lord Roberts {{desired to}} sum up the {{character}} of the soldiers whom he had led, he declared that they had behaved like gentlemen. I believe that statement to be no exaggeration, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> the bitter animosities of warfare have subsided, it will be acknowledged by the Boers themselves that it is true. They have had some unsavoury work to do--for guerilla warfare brings much in its train which is hateful--but officers and men have ameliorated and softened the asperities of warfare wherever it has been possible to do so. Their character has been most foully attacked by politicians at home, and by the ignorant or malevolent abroad. Let us examine the evidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I sha'n't forget you, I'm sure," [...] said Maggie, {{shaking her}} head very seriously. [...] "I never forget anything, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about {{everybody}} <b>when</b> I'm away from them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about poor Yap; he's got a lump in his throat, and Luke says he'll die. Only don't you tell Tom. because it will vex him so. You never saw Yap; he's a queer little dog,--nobody cares about him but Tom and me." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a result, she {{enrolled}} as a pre-medical {{student at}} a local university. During this time, she decided to transfer to the University of Santo Tomas Conservatory of Music. It was her time here that cemented her calling to music.
