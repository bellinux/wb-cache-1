P. transouralicum, formerly Indricotherium, from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and northern China includes B. grangeri and I. minus.

P. orgosensis may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name, but its exact position requires evaluation.

Though the genus name Indricotherium is now a junior synonym of Paraceratherium, the subfamily name Indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy does not affect the names of higher level taxa that are derived from these. Members of the subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the concentrations of}} platinum (Pt) <b>and</b> palladium (<b>Pd)</b> in surface sediments and sedimentary cores collected from the Pearl River Estuary {{with a view of}} evaluating the distribution, background levels, possible sources, and contamination level of anthropogenic Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd.</b> Thirty-six samples of surface sediments and 12 samples from sedimentary cores were collected. Al 2 O 3 was analyzed on fused glass disks by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Heavy metal elements were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> were separated from the sample matrix by anion exchange chromatography and subsequent solvent extraction after samples had been digested in Carius tubes using aqua regia. The analysis of Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> was performed by isotopic dilution-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> concentrations in surface sediments were 0. 28 - 2. 11 and 0. 39 - 38. 30 ng/g, respectively, <b>and</b> Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> concentrations in sedimentary cores were 0. 19 - 1. 18 and 0. 15 - 1. 76 ng/g, respectively. Background values of Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> were 0. 20 - 1. 17 and 0. 10 - 1. 34 ng/g, respectively. The spatial distribution of the enrichment factor differed between Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> in surface sediments. Down-core variations in Pt, <b>Pd,</b> <b>and</b> other heavy metal elements were similar in all cases and were related to sediment type. Some of the Pt and Pt in surface samples were derived from anthropogenic emissions. Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> were delivered to the sediment by fluvial input.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{legislation in the}} western world over the last 20 years or so requires that poisonous exhaust emissions from cars are reduced. Catalytic converters fitted to exhaust systems make these poisonous gases safer. Now nearly half the world's annual production of platinum (Pt) <b>and</b> palladium (<b>Pd)</b> is being used in the manufacture of catalytic converters. As cars travel around our cities these converters lose Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> which are ejected onto roads. This creates artificial concentrations of Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> in the urban environment that is a new addition to the global distribution. We know very little about such concentrations but we know much more about Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> concentrations in geological settings. Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> occur naturally at the Earth's surface only in a very few rare locations in rocks formed by an unusual combination of geological processes. The major Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> deposits were formed by crystallisation of magma which concentrated the metals into specific minor rock units within large igneous intrusions. As these precious metals are very rare on the Earth's surface they are economic at concentrations of only a few parts per million. Recent studies, including those described here, show that values of Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> accumulating in our cities are approaching values found in natural deposits. Certainly Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> can be located in road dust at road junctions in the cities in the wealthy western world at levels well above natural background values...|$|R

40|$|Platinum (Pt) <b>and</b> Palladium (<b>Pd)</b> {{concentrations}} {{have been}} analysed in 194 samples {{from within the}} city of Sheffield in the UK. The samples were taken from road dust, gully pots (also known as drains), soils, a motorway drainage pipe, rivers, lakes, sewage sludge, incinerator ash, incinerator ash in landfill, street cleansers and gully cleansers. The introduction of Pt- and Pd-bearing automobile catalysts, has been cited {{as the cause of}} a rise in the concentration of urban Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> accumulations. Geochemical analyses for the different sample types are used here to show how the Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> accumulate in different urban environments as they are transported from their catalytic source. Initially Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> collect in road dust and gully pots at values of up to 450 ppb although most analyses for both elements are around 100 ppb. The four roadside soils analysed, have a great range in values, the highest with a value of over 600 ppb Pt <b>and</b> 1000 ppb <b>Pd.</b> Then the fate of the Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> is either to be removed by gully flushers and road sweepers (which contain around half the concentration of that in road dust) or to be washed from the roads, through the gully pots, into either the river or urban drainage systems. Due to the addition of terrestrial sediments, river samples contain much reduced values of Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd,</b> at approximately an order of magnitude lower than in road dust. Similarly, sewage sludge contains Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> values which are lower than road dust. However, the Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> analyses are much higher in incinerated sewage (with many samples over 150 ppb for both metals), probably due to the loss of the mass of other material during the incineration process. Weathered incinerator ash in landfill has lower values of Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> than fresh ash from the incinerator. Although the range in values of Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> is similar for road dust and gully pot sediments their modal values tell a different story. The mode for Pt is very similar for both road dust and gully pot sediments, at around 100 ppb, whereas there is a drop of 50 ppb in the mode for Pd in the gully pots (from 80 ppb to around 40 ppb). Given that gully pot sediment is derived from road dust, it is suggested that in gully pots, Pd is preferentially mobilized over Pt. Furthermore, a comparison of the modal values of Pt <b>and</b> <b>Pd</b> in river sediments suggests that this process continues into the natural drainage system of the city...|$|R
