5|$|Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> Eurasia, while within Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren the Lilieae s.s. subclade <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> the Himalayas (Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau), with later {{radiation}} {{there in}} montane and alpine habitats. Species of Lilium and Fritillaria then dispersed {{into the rest}} of Eurasia and North America. The second subclade, the Tulipeae <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> East Asia with subsequent colonisation of North America by Erythronium and Lloydia. On the other hand, Clintonia-Medeola (Medeoleae) may have appeared in North America but subsequently underwent intercontintental dispersal (although some evidence points to a Eurasian origin). The Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae) appears to have evolved in western North America, with subsequent colonisation of East Asia by Streptopus and the ancestral Tricyrtis.|$|E

5|$|Administrative or Economic (Polish: gospodarcze) sejmiks oversaw {{voivodeship}} self-government. Often, {{they were}} held on the day following the deputational sejmik. Their decrees were known as laudas. Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included: dealing with taxation (distribution of national taxes) and tax collectors, managing the local (voivodeship) taxes and treasury, recruiting local military and (from mid-1700s) election of deputies to the Treasury Tribunals. These sejmiks <b>arose</b> <b>in</b> the early 16th century.|$|E

5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties <b>arose.</b> <b>In</b> January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow another of his novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E

5|$|Narcissus {{appears to}} have arisen {{in the area of}} the Iberian peninsula, {{southern}} France and north-western Italy, and within this area most sections of the genus appeared, with only a few taxa being dispersed to North Africa at a time when the African and West European platforms were closer together.
