5|$|The tickets {{along the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were {{originally}} handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets. In 1990, <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> toll collection system was {{proposed for the}} Pennsylvania Turnpike, where a motorist would create an account and use <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> device that would be read from <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> tollbooth. The motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, {{which was to be}} called E-ZPass, was planned to be implemented by 1998. The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley. On December15, 2001, E-ZPass was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Commercial vehicles were allowed to start using E-ZPass on December14, 2002.|$|E

5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|E
