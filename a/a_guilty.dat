5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E
5|$|Eighty-nine {{per cent}} of courts martial {{returned}} <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict, {{the vast majority}} of cases being for offences such as Absence Without Leave (the most common offence), drunkenness and insubordination. Terms of imprisonment were often suspended, to discourage soldiers from committing an offence to escape the front lines, but also to give a convicted man a chance to earn a reprieve for good conduct.|$|E
5|$|Harry Innes' {{libel suit}} against Joseph Street was not fully {{adjudicated}} in the Jessamine County Circuit Court until 1811. The jury found in Innes' favor and awarded $750 in damages, although Innes' counsel, Henry Clay and Robert Wickliffe, insisted that Innes only desired the vindication of <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict against Street {{and would not}} collect the damages. Soon after, Street shuttered the Western World and moved to Illinois.|$|E

5|$|At the International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia, the trial of Milan Martić {{resulted}} in <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict with regard to Martić's involvement on Kijevo, and {{the findings of the}} Trial Chamber in 2007 regarding Kijevo were confirmed by the Appeals Chamber in 2008, based on witness testimonies about it being ethnic cleansing. The siege of Kijevo was the first instance of application of the strategy of ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars. The events at Kijevo {{were not included in the}} indictment at the trial of Ratko Mladić, but the Croatian judiciary tried Mladić in absentia for war crimes committed in Kijevo. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|By mid-2011, Arafiles {{had moved}} his {{practice}} to East Texas and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline. A hospital administrator there {{said that she}} had looked into some of the allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor. In November 2011, Arafiles entered <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E

5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|Ichijinsha {{released}} three manga adaptations {{under its}} DNA Media Comics line. The three volumes of <b>a</b> <b>Guilty</b> Gear X2-based yonkoma series were released on August 24, 2002, December 25, 2002, and July 25, 2003, respectively.

5|$|Martić {{was tried}} at the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) on several {{different}} charges of war crimes including, {{his involvement in the}} siege of Kijevo.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship exposure to forensic crime television has on a potential juror’s willingness to find <b>a</b> suspect <b>guilty</b> {{when presented with}} a case involving only circumstantial and eyewitness evidence. This study also looks at a potential juror’s expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial based upon this exposure. To better understand these relationships, the study utilized social constructionism as the theoretical framework. To collect data, an original survey instrument that included either a violent or non-violent crime scenario was developed. Reponses from 1572 undergraduate students were analyzed to better understand what might influence their willingness to find <b>a</b> suspect <b>guilty</b> and their expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial. The results indicate that viewership of forensic crime television does not significantly influence a potential juror’s decision to find <b>a</b> suspect <b>guilty</b> or not guilty. After controlling for viewership, {{it appears that the}} number of justice-based classes completed by the potential juror does influence their decision to find the suspect guilty. The analysis also shows that gender and the type of scenario (violent versus non-violent) may influence a juror’s willingness to find <b>a</b> suspect <b>guilty.</b> It does not appear that there is a correlation between a juror’s willingness to find <b>a</b> suspect <b>guilty</b> and their expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial...|$|R
5|$|On May 24, 1913, Frank {{was indicted}} {{on a charge}} of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was in fact the perpetrator of the murder. <b>A</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The first Castellania {{was built}} in 1572, during the magistracy of Grand Master Jean de la Cassière, and was likely {{designed}} by Girolamo Cassar, similar to other Valletta buildings of the late 16th century. The building had a military appearance, with the corners designed with massive quoins, typical of Cassar. The Castellania made use of bells to attract people and inform about an event, such as <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict. Similar to other prominent buildings, the Castellania was provided with water within its courtyard by connection to the Wignacourt Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{military}} tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles, who believed that a civil court should have presided; but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force {{at the time in}} the District of Columbia. (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan, the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) Only a simple majority of the jury was required for <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Vick was {{transported to}} Virginia in November 2008 {{to face the}} state charges. He {{appeared}} before the Surry County Circuit Court on November 25 at a session held in neighboring Sussex County because the Surry court building was undergoing renovation. He submitted <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> plea to a single Virginia felony charge for dog fighting, receiving a 3-year prison sentence suspended on condition of good behavior, and a $2,500 fine. In return for the plea agreement, the other charge was dropped. Michael Dwayne Vick, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) ID# 33765-183, was released on July 20, 2009.|$|E
5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} ended with <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict on July 8, 1912. The defendants, including 27 leading Camorra bosses, {{were sentenced to}} a total of 354 years' imprisonment. The main defendants Enrico Alfano and Giovanni Rapi were sentenced to 30 years. The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. The jury had been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the verdict, a furious Alfano accused the authorities to have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison. Another defendant, Gennaro De Marinas, who was sentenced to 30 years as well, slashed his throat with a piece of glass in the Court when the verdict was delivered.|$|E
5|$|Bryant and Milam {{were indicted}} for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} {{that he could get}} a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure <b>a</b> <b>guilty</b> verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E
