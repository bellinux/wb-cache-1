500|$|To this end, Welensky {{organised}} {{a conference}} in February 1949 to investigate {{the idea of a}} federation. Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel (a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences), representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present, but native Africans and the British Government were not. It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail, with both the British and native Africans opposed. Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution, and pushed the idea of 'partnership' between blacks and whites. However, he insisted that [...] "for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see, in that partnership [...] will be senior partners".|$|E
500|$|Zola {{himself was}} happy with his {{achievements}} to the Chelsea side, but when asked if his substitution was all projected, he denied it, stating: [...] "It wasn't planned. In the moment, I used my positive strength and I got a reward for the passion, the work not only I, but the masseur Mimmo Pezza did together in Rimini. The injury should take one month to heal, Mimmo Pezza helped me be fit in less than half that. I thank this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember."

500|$|Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote {{a letter}} to Johannes Stricker, one which he {{described}} to Theo as an attack. Within days he left for Amsterdam. Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his [...] "persistence is disgusting". In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: [...] "Let me see her for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep my hand in the flame." [...] He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.|$|E

500|$|Dormand later {{described}} himself as [...] "a republican for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember having an interest in politics" [...] and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group. He spoke out {{in opposition to the}} monarchy, declaring in 1971 that [...] "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for [...] "scores of miners" [...] to be honoured as they were just as worthy.|$|E
500|$|Barkley {{is known}} for his {{compulsive}} gambling. In an interview with ESPN's Trey Wingo, Barkley revealed that he lost approximately $10 million through gambling. In addition, he also admitted to losing $2.5 million [...] "in a six-hour period" [...] while playing blackjack. Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit. When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue, Barkley replied, [...] "It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems. I gamble for too much money. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> continue to do it I don't think it's a problem. Do I think it's a bad habit? Yes, I think it's a bad habit.

500|$|On 17 July 2009, Del Piero {{extended}} {{his contract with}} Juventus by one more year until 30 June 2011 in Pinzolo while training for pre-season, thus practically ensuring that he would retire at the club with which he started his professional career. During his renewal, he said, [...] "I am happy at Juventus and we are competitive. I want to keep playing for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> and I'm certain that {{for at least two}} more years I will be at the top level." [...] On 14 February 2010, Del Piero marked his 445th Serie A appearance, breaking the all-time club record previously held by Boniperti, with a brace in a 3–2 win against Genoa. Del Piero finished the season as the all-time top scorer for Juventus, having scored over 250 goals in all competitions with the club, and having also made over 600 appearances in official matches for Juventus, breaking Scirea's appearance record.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} responded {{positively to}} [...] "A Quiet Night In". David Chater, writing for The Times, gave a highly laudatory review, saying the episode was [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember– {{one of those}} fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". He chose not to reveal {{too much about the}} plot for fear of [...] "spoiling the fun". Chater later described the episode as [...] "mindboggling in its originality", and [...] "one of the funniest, most imaginative programmes shown on television in the past 15 years". Jane Simon, writing for the Daily Mirror, called the episode a [...] "triumph", while writers for Metro described the episode as [...] "quality comedy", and journalists writing for The Sunday Times characterised it as a [...] "brilliantly conceived and choreographed mime". Jack Seale, writing for the Radio Times, also stressed how the episode was [...] "beautifully choreographed", praising Pemberton and Shearsmith's [...] "willingness to attempt difficult concepts".|$|E
500|$|In April, Farmer played {{shooting}} guard for the North {{team in the}} Kentucky Derby Festival Classic. He scored 14 points on 5 of 12 shooting and grabbed 3 rebounds, but his team lost to the South team 134125. Among his teammates in the Classic was Kentucky signee Sean Woods, who told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he and Farmer had become good friends and that he hoped Farmer would choose {{to play for the}} Wildcats. The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, {{the second day of the}} April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a National Letter of Intent with Kentucky.

500|$|On 12 June 2012, Spearritt {{denied the}} reunion plans {{and stated that}} she will not return to S Club or {{continue}} her music career and will keep on pursuing her acting career. She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see it in my plans at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working {{and being able to}} do what I love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago and we talked about it and we still are talking about it.

500|$|Many critics responded very {{positively}} to Inside No. 9. After the final {{episode of the}} first series, the comedic critic Bruce Dessau said on his website that it had [...] "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week we entered an entirely different world." [...] On the same day, David Chater, writing in The Times, said of the series as a whole that [...] "t's hard to know which to admire more – the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent that has brought this strange and memorable series to life." [...] Chater had previously described [...] "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of Inside No. 9, as [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember – one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". Mark Jones (The Guardian) considered the whole series, saying that the Inside No. 9 was [...] "never less-than-captivating", while a review in the Liverpool Echo described every episode as [...] "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though {{it was felt that}} the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three. In December 2014, Metro television critic Keith Watson named Inside No. 9 the twentieth best television programme of 2014, and in January 2015, Daily Star Sunday columnist Garry Bushell named Inside No. 9 the best comedy TV programme of 2014.|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
