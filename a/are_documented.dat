5|$|Because of the colder climate, ectothermic {{reptiles}} {{are all but}} absent, {{with two}} species of garter snake and the western painted turtle being the only three reptile species proven to exist. Similarly, only six species of amphibians <b>are</b> <b>documented,</b> although those species exist in large numbers. After a forest fire in 2001, a few park roads were temporarily closed the following year to allow thousands of western toads to migrate to other areas.|$|E
5|$|Hall Place, {{formerly}} Bentworth Hall or Manor, is a Grade II* listed medieval hall-house, located {{south of}} the road to Medstead just south-west of Tinker's Lane. It was built in the early 14th century with additions in the 17th and 19th centuries. The hall {{is believed to have been}} constructed by either the constable of Farnham Castle, William de Aula, or 'John of Bynteworth'. The de Aula family <b>are</b> <b>documented</b> as being the first owners, followed by the de Melton family.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks <b>are</b> <b>documented.</b>|$|E
5|$|Luttwak terminates his {{analysis}} {{at the end}} of Constantine's reign, before the establishment of the diocesan comitatus. Unlike the imperial escort-armies, these were close enough to the theatre of operations to succour the border troops. But their stationing may have differed little from the location of legions in the 2nd century, even though they apparently wintered inside cities, rather than in purpose-built legionary bases. For example, the two comitatus of Illyricum (East and West) <b>are</b> <b>documented</b> as wintering in Sirmium, which was the site of a major legionary base in the Principate.|$|E
5|$|Feral horses <b>are</b> <b>documented</b> {{as living}} in the Pryor Mountains by the early 1700s, {{although}} {{they may have been}} there since the late 1600s. By the late 1800s, thousands of feral horses inhabited the area. In the early 1900s, many of the unbranded horses were rounded up, to allow domesticated livestock to graze the range without competition, and by 1964 there were only around 200 horses left. In 1964, the BLM announced that the horses would be removed altogether, to the outrage of the public. The controversy continued until 1968, when the BLM was legally stopped from removing all of the horses, and the area declared a Wild Horse Refuge. After the 1971 signing of the WFRHBA, the BLM spent the 1980s and 1990s conducting population studies and developing management and adoption policies; during this time, numerous genetic studies were also completed.|$|E

5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns <b>are</b> <b>documented,</b> watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|It {{was assumed}} {{at first that}} the lake existed in a single long {{interval}} between 1000-1500; however, later a succession of wet and dry phases was determined from radiocarbon dating. Each phase was stable for prolonged times. About three or four highstands were identified in the lake, one theory assumes four highstands between 695-1580. One chronology assumes these highstands occurred 100 BC - 600 AD, 900-1250 and 1300-1500. Six or five different cycles <b>are</b> <b>documented</b> in Coachella. At Superstition Mountain five lake cycles from 817-964, 1290-1330, 1440-1640, 1480-1660, 1638-1689 and 1675-1687 are documented; the 1440-1640 cycle may have consisted of four sub-cycles that occurred within short time distances from each other. An older highstand was observed at East Mesa and dated to 3,850 years before present. At least 12 different cycles of lake growth and lake shrinkage occurred over the last 2,000 - 3,000 years. Radiocarbon dates of the highstands range 300 ± 100 to 1,580 ± 200 before present. The basin was probably not entirely dry between the last three highstands. The Colorado River Delta shows evidence of reduced sedimentation while the river drained into Lake Cahuilla.|$|E
5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} <b>are</b> <b>documented</b> in the park: three species of snakes {{which are the}} wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the breed are not fully documented, but some {{evidence}} points to the ancestors of the Jutland {{being used by the}} Vikings during the early 9th century. Images from the time show Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain riding horses similar in appearance to the modern Jutland. Some of those horses may have been left behind, contributing to the base stock from which the Suffolk Punch was eventually developed. Horses from Jutland were exported to England, Germany and France during the Middle Ages, and were popular mounts for knights, especially for use in jousting. The first mention of the Jutland type is from the 12th century, when they <b>are</b> <b>documented</b> as war horses with many useful attributes. The Jutland horse appears in the Danish ballad Svend Felding's Kamp med Risen, in which mythic hero Svend Fælling goes on a pilgrimage to Rome and on his journey encounters a giant. Other horses prove too shy or too weak to enable him to confront the giant, therefore Svend obtains a Jutland horse from a passing miller, who claims that it is strong enough to carry fifteen skippund. Mounted on the Jutland, Svend succeeds in killing the giant.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between John of Brienne and Hugh I of Cyprus was tense. Hugh ordered the imprisonment of John's supporters in Cyprus, releasing them only at Pope Innocent's command. During the War of the Antiochene Succession John sided with Bohemond IV of Antioch and the Templars against Raymond-Roupen of Antioch and Leo I, King of Cilician Armenia, who {{were supported by}} Hugh and the Hospitallers. However, John sent only 50 knights to fight the Armenians in Antiochia in 1213. Leo I concluded a peace treaty with the Knights Templar late that year, and he and John reconciled. John married Leo's oldest daughter, Stephanie (also known as Rita), in 1214 and Stephanie received a dowry of 30,000 bezants. Quarrels among John, Leo I, Hugh I and Bohemond IV <b>are</b> <b>documented</b> by Pope Innocent's letters urging them to reconcile their differences before the Fifth Crusade reached the Holy Land.|$|E
