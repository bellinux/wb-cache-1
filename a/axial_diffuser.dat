40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} heat transfer between the turbulent airflow and the inner wall surface of an <b>axial</b> <b>diffuser</b> rotating around its longitudinal axis. Heat transfer was assessed through the measurement of a time-dependent temperature field of the diffuser inner wall surface. Measurements of the instantaneous flow velocity components were performed by a laser-Doppler anemometry system, which delivered information on mean velocity components {{as well as on}} the turbulence intensity. A significant increase of all three mean velocity components was observed near the rotating diffuser wall in comparison with a non-rotating diffuser. Temperature field measurements were carried out by means of infrared thermography. The experiment showed a significant dependence of the temperature field on the turbulent flowfield induced by diffuser rotation. A strong influence of the flow separation and reattachment on the temperature distribution was observed, while rotation was found to suppress the occurrence of flow separation from the diffuser wall. Properties of the velocity field such as turbulence intensity were directly coupled with the temperature distribution in order to gain the information on how to enhance or reduce heat transfer by changing the integral parameters of the diffuser (e. g. rotation frequency or amount of flow). 1...|$|E
40|$|Downstream of {{a modern}} {{combined}} cycle gas turbine there is generally an abrupt end of the turbine inner hub wall leading to a backward facing step with separation and flow recircula-tion on the hub axis. This {{can lead to a}} strong hub wake with high losses {{in the center of the}} diffuser. The interaction between the end of the hub and the downstream <b>axial</b> <b>diffuser</b> can have a significant influence on diffuser flow field and hence on overall gas turbine performance. To minimize the hub wake the flow can be guided to the axis by reducing the diameter of the hub. But this can still lead to separation on the extended hub and to a strong hub wake. This paper describes experimental and numer-ical investigations of the use of flow injection to control the flow separation on the hub and to guide the main flow towards the axis of the diffuser to reduce the hub wake. A new test rig has been built at the Institute of Thermal Turbomachinery and Machinery Laboratory of the University of Stuttgart, Germany (ITSM). This rig features an active flow control device based on hub flow injection with a Coanda-effect to influence the hub wake flow. In addition to experi-mental studies, steady CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations have been performed for this configuration and validated using the experimental data. Test results and flow field computations confirm that the flow control device tested can have a beneficial influence on diffuser performance at specific conditions. If it is the casing flow which separates then hub injection has little effect. If the casing flow is attached, and a hub separation limits the perfor-mance, then hub jet flow injection can be highly beneficial. The results also indicate that the mass flow injected in the hub jet control device has to be carefully balanced...|$|E
40|$|Rotating stall, a {{phenomenon}} that causes flow instabilities and pressure hysteresis by propagating at some fraction of the impeller rotational speed, can occur in centrifugal impellers, mixed impellers, radial <b>diffusers,</b> or <b>axial</b> <b>diffusers.</b> Despite considerable efforts devoted {{to the study of}} rotating stall in pumps, the mechanics of this phenomenon are not sufficiently understood. The propagation mechanism and onset of rotating stall are not only affected by inlet flow but also by outlet flow as well as the pressure gradient in the flow passage. As such, the complexity of these concepts is not covered by the classical explanation. To bridge this research gap, the current study investigated prerotation generated at the upstream of the impeller, leakage flow at the tip clearance between the casing and the impeller, and strong reserve flow at the inlet of the diffuser. Understanding these areas will clarify the origin of the positive slope of the head-flow performance curve for a mixed flow pump. Nonuniform pressure distribution and adverse pressure gradient were also introduced to evaluate the onset and development of rotating stall within the diffuser...|$|R
40|$|Performance of an <b>axial</b> exhaust <b>diffuser</b> {{downstream}} of an un-shrouded {{turbine rotor}} is computationally analyzed. Three-dimensional analysis of two turbine stage-exhaust diffuser configurations has been performed. In one case, the turbine rotor is shrouded {{and in the}} second case, the rotor is un-shrouded. The static pressure recovery coefficient in the exhaust diffuser is used as the diffuser performance parameter. It has been found that the over the tip leakage flow in the un-shrouded rotor emerges as a swirling wall jet at the upper wall of the diffuser. The case of the shrouded rotor produced no wall jet {{at the entrance to the}} diffuser and the turbine exit flow was “quasi-uniform”. The presence of the wall jet allowed the annular diffuser outer wall angle at stall point to increase from 12 ° (in the shrouded rotor case) to 18 ° in the un-shrouded turbine. By changing the angular speed of the rotor, the effect of the swirl in the turbine exit plane on the performance of the diffuser was explored. In the shrouded rotor case, the diffuser recovers higher static pressure when the inlet is swirl-free. In this case, the performance of the diffuser is independent of whether the turbine exit flow has co- or counter-swirl. However, in the presence of un-shrouded rotors, higher static pressure recovery was achieved when the core flow possessed slight counter-swirl. This observation was more pronounced when larger diffuser upper wall angles were considered...|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this article investigates the influences of inlet boundary conditions on the precombustion chamber internal flow patterns, validated by experimental data. An <b>axial</b> fixed-vane swirling <b>diffuser</b> with 12 vanes of declining angle 20 ° {{is used for the}} primary air flow. For the swirling air flow inlet boundary condition specifications, two methods are compared employing the standard κ-ε turbulence model The conventional method is to specify the inlet velocities based on totally constant axial and tangential momentum fluxes. For the new method, the whole simulation domain is extended to the supply duct, and detailed air flows between the supply swirling diffuser and precombustion chamber are linked using the multigrid technique. Comparisons with experimental data reveal that the new method can more accurately predict turbulent airflows and mixing processes near the swirling diffuser, and consequently more accurately predict the size of the recirculation zone, and farther downstream velocities and air jet mass fractions.

40|$|Abstract — The {{reason behind}} doing {{this work was}} to prepare an {{experimental}} procedure of a micro turbojet engine for the laboratory education purpose. By operating a micro turbojet engine one can get an idea about the basic processes in a Brayton cycle and it helps one to know the thermodynamics behind each process. The paper presents both the theoretical and experimental procedures {{that could be done}} on a micro turbojet engine. The experiments were conducted on a standard test rig with a SR- 30 micro turbojet engine on which certain parameters like thrust, TSFC (Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption) and various component efficiencies could be evaluated. The main components in the test rig include a <b>diffuser,</b> <b>axial</b> flow compressor, reversible annular flow combustion chamber and an axial flow turbine. The engine on which the experiment has been conducted runs at 90000 RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) and produces a thrust of 256 N. The efficiencies obtained from theoretical and experimental calculations are found to have a difference of 18. 35 % for compressor and 16 % for turbine respectively. There is a difference in the overall thrust of 56 N...|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} model was constructed of acrylic (methyl methacrylate monomer) 5  mm in thickness, {{and has a}} cross-sectional area of 40  cm[*]×[*] 40  cm, and a length of 6  m, which is a scaled down of the real CRT at mine site (1 : 10 of cross-sectional area and 1 : 35 of length). The model has two rectangular obstructions that represented coal feeders in CRT. Four MQ 4 sensors have been placed {{at the top of}} the {{physical model}} in positions from upstream to downstream (two sensors after the upstream coal feeder and the other two sensors located after the downstream feeder), thus the methane concentrations from upstream to downstream of airflow could be detected by the sensor using a data logger and computer. Ultra High Purity (UHP) methane gas was injected into the physical model at 0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4 and 0.5  L per minute. Two axial fans (Rayden Fan, 12  cm[*]×[*] 12  cm[*]×[*] 3.8  cm; AC 220 / 240  V 50 / 60  Hz; 0.14 A; 0.033 – 0.055  m 3 /s) were used at the upstream portal of the physical model, with the purpose of blowing fresh air from outside of the tunnel. Several <b>axial</b> fans with <b>diffuser</b> outlets (Rayden Fan, 9.2  cm[*]×[*] 9.2  cm[*]×[*] 2.5  cm; AC 220 / 240  V; 0.08 A; 0.0245  m 3 /s) were placed in the physical model to simulate jet fans inside the CRT. A Kestrel 2000 thermo-anemometer (dimension: 122  mm[*]×[*] 42  mm[*]×[*] 20  mm, velocity range of 0.4 – 40  m/s, and accuracy of[*]±[*] 0.1  m/s) was used to detect air velocity in the inlet at inside and outlet of the physical model. The air velocity has been measured by using fixed-point measurement method with 9 (nine) segments on the cross-sectional area of the CRT physical model.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the computational modelling of low pressure (LP) steam turbine exhaust hood flows. A test case for LP last stage blades (LSBs) {{with a full}} aerodynamic definition and an accompanying exhaust hood was developed which is representative of current industrial practice. The test case geometry is freely available allowing other researchers to build on this work and {{is the first of}} its kind. Studies on this Durham Stage and Exhaust Hood Test Case showed the geometry produces a representative flow pattern and performance metrics comparable to other published research. Using the test case, the effect of condenser cooling water pressure gradient on the hood flow was computed for the first time. A generic boundary condition was developed to represent the transverse condenser cooling water flow and, when applied to the test case, was shown to have a larger influence on the flow asymmetry within the hood than the tip leakage jet. This thesis describes the first application of the non-linear harmonic (NLH) method to couple the LSBs to the exhaust hood. This method enabled the circumferential non-uniformity which develops in the exhaust hood to be transferred across the interface to the stage, in half the computational demand of the full annulus frozen rotor approach. The first review of the influence of inlet circumferential asymmetry on the hood flow field highlighted that modelling its effect is not as crucial as indicated in the literature, unless the <b>diffuser</b> <b>axial</b> length is very compact or if off-design flows are to be studied. A series of recommendations and guidelines for the CFD modelling of steam turbine exhaust hood flows based on this work are supplied. Experimental validation of the Durham Stage and Exhaust Hood Test Case and a comparison of full unsteady studies with the NLH method should be the next steps in this research...|$|R
