5|$|In 1975, a 48.9-foot-long {{concrete}} tee {{beam bridge}} was built; this bridge carries Hollow Ave over Leggetts Creek. In 1979, a 37.1-foot-long prestressed box beam or girders bridge was built; it carries Mary Street across the creek. A 44.9-foot-long {{bridge of the}} same type {{was built in the}} same year <b>and</b> <b>carries</b> Wells Street over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long bridge of a similar type was built in 2009 <b>and</b> <b>carries</b> T-422/Burcher Ave over the creek.

40|$|Abstract. Reversible {{logic is}} {{emerging}} as a promising computing paradigm, having its applications in low-power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotech-nology and optical computing. Firstly, we showed a modified design of conventional BCD subtractors and also proposed designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors. The proposed designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors {{are based on the}} novel designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD adders, respectively. Then, we introduced the reversible logic implementation of the modified conventional, as well as the proposed, <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors efficient {{in terms of the number}} of reversible gates used and garbage output produced. To the best of our knowledge, the <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors and their reversible logic design are explored for the first time ever in literature...|$|R
5000|$|A Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> Crane {{is similar}} to a mobile crane in that is {{designed}} to travel on public roads; however, Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes have no stabiliser legs or outriggers and are designed to lift the load <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> it to its destination, within a small radius, then be able to drive to the next job. Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes are popular in Australia where large distances are encountered between job sites. One popular manufacturer in Australia was Franna, who have since been bought by Terex, and now all Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes are commonly referred to as [...] "Frannas" [...] even though they may be made by other manufacturers. Nearly every medium and large sized crane company in Australia has at least one and many companies have fleets of these cranes. The capacity range is usually ten to twenty tonnes maximum lift, although this is much less {{at the tip of the}} boom. Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes have displaced the work usually completed by smaller truck cranes as the set-up time is much quicker. Many steel fabrication yards also use Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes as they can [...] "walk" [...] with fabricated steel sections and place these where required with relative ease.|$|R

When a jealous love-interest of Alex reports Ada as sentient to the FBI, Alex and Ada attempt to flee the country. When they are intercepted by the FBI, Ada gets shot {{by the police and}} Alex is arrested. He is convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but Ada is not found to be sentient.|$|E
5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer.

The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.|$|E
