40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study of insured Swedish dogs with a recorded diagnosis of canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) was performed. In order {{to validate the}} correctness of this specific diagnosis in the insurance database, medical records were requested by mail from the <b>attending</b> <b>veterinarians.</b> All dogs with a reimbursed claim for the disease during 2002 {{were included in the}} original study sample (n = 373). Medical records were available for 335 individuals (response rate: 89. 8 %). By scrutinizing the submitted records it was determined that all dogs had been treated for dermatologic disease, and that 327 (97. 6 %) could be considered to have some allergic skin disease. However, as information regarding dietary trial testing was missing in many dogs the number that were truly atopic could not be determined. The clinical presentation and nature of test diet for dogs with or without response to dietary trial testing was compared for a subset of 109 individuals that had undergone such testing. The only significant difference between these two groups was that the proportion of dogs with reported gastrointestinal signs was higher in the group that subsequently responded to a diet trial. In conclusion, the agreement between the recorded diagnosis in the insurance database and the clinical manifestations recorded in the submitted medical records was considered acceptable. The concern was raised that many <b>attending</b> <b>veterinarians</b> did not exclude cutaneous adverse food reactions before making the diagnosis of CAD...|$|R

40|$|Hendra virus (HeV) {{was first}} {{described}} in 1994 in {{an outbreak of}} acute and highly lethal disease in horses and humans in Australia. Equine cases continue to be diagnosed periodically, yet the predisposing factors for infection remain unclear. We undertook an analysis of equine submissions tested for HeV by the Queensland government veterinary reference laboratory over a 20 -year period to identify and investigate any patterns. We found a marked increase in testing from July 2008, primarily reflecting a broadening of the HeV clinical case definition. Peaks in submissions for testing, and visitations to the Government HeV website, were associated with reported equine incidents. Significantly differing between-year HeV detection rates in north and south Queensland suggest a fundamental difference in risk exposure between the two regions. The statistical association between HeV detection and stockhorse type may suggest that husbandry is a more important risk determinant than breed per se. The detection of HeV in horses with neither neurological nor respiratory signs poses a risk management challenge for <b>attending</b> <b>veterinarians</b> and laboratory staff, reinforcing animal health authority recommendations that appropriate risk management strategies be employed for all sick horses, and by anyone handling sick horses or associated biological samples...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the level of}} biosecurity training among Australian equine veterinarians and to assess their perceptions of biosecurity and infectious disease risk and their opinions about {{the management of the}} 2007 equine influenza (EI) outbreak. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A survey was conducted among equine <b>veterinarians</b> <b>attending</b> the 2010 annual conference of the Equine Veterinarians Australia (EVA) in New South Wales, Australia. Data were collected using a self-completed questionnaire and analysed using Fisher's exact tests to assess veterinarians' levels of biosecurity training, their perceptions of infectious disease and views regarding the 2007 EI outbreak management. Results: A total of 46 of the 196 (23. 5 %) <b>attending</b> <b>veterinarians</b> completed the questionnaire. Significantly greater proportions of recently graduated veterinarians received theoretical and practical biosecurity training at veterinary schools than their older counterparts. The majority of respondents considered their likelihood of spreading infectious diseases from one client's horse to another to be low (84 %). More than half (58 %) of the veterinarians considered that hand-washing/wearing gloves was very effective in preventing disease spread. However, around one-quarter (27 %) reported a degree of reservation about the practicality of performing general biosecurity practices in everyday working life. Overall, veterinarians were satisfied with the EI outbreak response, but had mixed opinions about the control measures and communications used. Conclusion: Levels of biosecurity training and the frequency of biosecurity advice provided by veterinarians have increased over time, although the practicality of biosecurity practices is a concern for some veterinarians. Further investigations of the barriers to the use of various biosecurity practices are required in order to inform training programs. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This {{issue of}} ILAR Journal is {{designed}} to provide research-ers, instructors, IACUC members, <b>attending</b> <b>veterinarians,</b> and other laboratory animal medicine specialists with a series of peer-reviewed articles written by experts in the care and use of three broad categories of nontraditional species: fish (by L. J. DeTolla and others), amphibians (by D. DeNardo), and rep-tiles (by H. W. Greene). As they prepared their manuscripts, we asked these authors to do the following: • Define and describe the applicable species; • Comment on availability and possible sources; • Summarize applicable animal welfare laws, regulations, standards, and policies; • Describe how to develop appropriate procedures for housing, husbandry, and breeding in various settings, includ-ing references to any published protocols or guidelines; • Summarize any unusual safety considerations, such as the need for care during live feeding procedures, handling venomous or toxic species, and possible zoonotic diseases; • Give examples of the use of these species in research; • Review methods for analgesia, anesthesia, and euthana-sia, including references to any published protocols or rec-ommendations; and • Suggest how to facilitate IACUC review of animal use protocols using these species. The result is what my fellow editors and I believe to be three excellent articles, each of which provides a wealth of information about the relevant species.

40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} long-term {{results and}} complications of gonadectomy performed {{at an early}} age (prepubertal) or at the traditional age in dogs. Design—Cohort study. Animals— 269 dogs from animal shelters. Procedure—Dogs that underwent gonadectomy were allotted to 2 groups on the basis of estimated age at surgery (traditional age, ≥ 24 weeks old; prepubertal, < 24 weeks old). Adoptive owner information was obtained from shelter records, and telephone interviews were conducted with owners to determine physical or behavioral problems observed in the dogs since adoption. Follow-up information was obtained from <b>attending</b> <b>veterinarians</b> for dogs with complex problems or when owners were uncertain regarding the exact nature of their dog’s problem. Results—Prepubertal gonadectomy did not result in an increased incidence of behavioral problems or problems associated with any body system, compared with traditional-age gonadectomy, during a median follow-up period of 48 months after gonadectomy. Rate of retention in the original adoptive household was the same for dogs that underwent prepubertal gonadectomy as those that underwent traditional-age gonadectomy. Infectious diseases, however, were more common in dogs that underwent prepubertal gonadectomy. Conclusions and Clinical Implications—With the exception of infectious diseases, prepubertal gonadectomy may be safely performed in dogs without concern for increased incidence of physical or behavioral problems during at least a 4 -year period after gonadectomy. (J Am Vet Med Assoc 2001; 218 : 217 – 221) Millions of dogs and cats are euthanatized annually in US animal shelters. 1 Many animal adoption agencies now require mandatory neutering of all companion animals after adoption; however, owner compliance with these programs is estimated to be < 60 %. 2, 3 As a method of increasing population control effectiveness, many of these groups, as well as many veterinarians, have promoted prepubertal gonadectomy, which is neutering well before the onset of puberty and prio...|$|R

40|$|When dogs play with, chew on or {{persistently}} carry sticks, {{injuries to}} the mouth, pharynx {{and possibly the}} oesophagus could occur. Acute oropharyngeal stick injuries (when the incident has been less than seven days ago) and chronic oropharyngeal stick injuries (when {{it has been more}} than seven days) can be dangerous and even life threatening. The University Clinic for Companion Animals at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Utrecht therefore has a protocol for the treatment of these cases. With the combination of a literature study, a patient review of 32 client owned dogs treated for (possible) acute or chronic stick injury at the UCCA between 2004 and 2011 and an evaluation of two surveys held among the patient owners and <b>attending</b> <b>veterinarians,</b> this protocol was reviewed for suitability and usability.

Most veterinarians used the protocol during treatment of their patient. Twenty-five dogs made a full recovery after treatment, five dogs died or were euthanized and the in two dogs the problems still remained after initial treatment.

Ducks were anesthetized for either 2 or 3 procedures, 1 week apart, then euthanized and necropsied after the final procedure. Air sac areas on survey and PPI radiographs were measured to calculate average percent increase of visible air sac area after PPI. No clinical complications resulted from PPI procedures. Birds recovered quickly without respiratory distress. No gross or microscopic respiratory lesions associated with PPI were identified at necropsy. Average percent increases in air sac areas resulting from PPI on lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs were 79 % and 90 %, respectively.
