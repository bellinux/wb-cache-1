40|$|PRELIMINARY VERSION We study a unit-demand, common-value, affiliated-signals auction {{model with}} two objects. We derive {{symmetric}} equilibrium for the sequential second-price auction, {{with and without}} revelation of the first-round winning bid. We demonstrate that auctioning objects in sequence generates a lowballing effect that reduces first-round revenue. Thus, revenue is greater in <b>a</b> single-round uniform <b>auction</b> for two objects than in <b>a</b> sequential <b>auction</b> with no bid announcement. When the first-round winning bid is announced, there are also two informational effects:apositiveeffect on second-round price and an ambiguous effect on first-round price. First-round revenue could be greater or smaller than with no bid announcement, and greater or smaller than the price in <b>a</b> uniform <b>auction.</b> <b>As</b> a result, total revenue in <b>a</b> sequential <b>auction</b> with winning-bid announcement could be greater or smaller than in <b>a</b> uniform <b>auction.</b> ...|$|R
