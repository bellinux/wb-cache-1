40|$|ABSTRACT: CONTEXT: Intussusception is {{a common}} cause of acute {{intestinal}} obstruction in the pediatric population and it is normally idiopathic. Rare cases of chronic intussusception require investigation with greater attention. CASE REPORT: We present a clinical case of a three-year-old boy with <b>aqueous</b> <b>diarrhea,</b> abdominal distension, vomiting and weight loss over a two-month period. During the investigation, abdominal ultrasound showed imaging of intussusception. The intraoperative findings showed the intussusception had resolved spontaneously. In further investigation, {{it was found that}} the diarrhea was malabsorptive and, after the patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, a diagnosis of celiac disease was made. After a gluten-free diet was introduced, the patient showed complete remission of symptoms and regained weight, and normal growth was reestablished. CONCLUSION: If the clinical presentation of intussusception is unusual, etiological investigation should be undertaken. In this case report, celiac disease was the underlying cause...|$|E
40|$|Non-enterotoxigenic {{bacteria}} of the Bacteroides fragilis {{group and}} enterotoxigenic B. fragilis were identified from children {{with and without}} <b>aqueous</b> acute <b>diarrhea.</b> In this study, 170 stool samples from 96 children with and 74 without diarrhea were analyzed. Enterotoxin production and the toxin gene detection were detected by cytotoxicity assay on HT- 29 /C 1 cells and by PCR, respectively. B. fragilis species was prevalent in both groups and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis strains were isolated from two children with diarrhea. More studies are important to evaluate the role of each bacteria of the B. fragilis group, including enterotoxigenic strains play in the diarrheal processes in children...|$|R
40|$|Campylobacteriosis is a {{foodborne}} disease that affects humans mainly due to manipulation {{and consumption of}} broiler meat contaminated with different species of Campylobacter. The infection can also be acquired through contact with carriers and environmental exposure. The main reservoir for Campylobacter spp. are birds, along with cattle, sheep, pigs, rodents, cats and dogs and wild mammals and birds. The reservoir spectrum varies according to the species: C. jejuni is widely spread whilst C. coli is more frequently isolated from pigs. Primary acquisition of Campylobacter spp. from animals occurs after birth and although {{it can be a}} cause of morbi-mortality in these animals, in most cases colonization leads to a state of permanent carrier. The last European Food Safety Authority report on zoonosis, zoonotic agents and foodborne outbreaks registered in 2010 shows that Campylobacter spp. is still the foodborne pathogen responsible for the largest number of cases. In the European Union (EU), the notification rate increased from 45. 6 per 100, 000 in 2009 to 48. 6 per 100, 000 in 2010. Remarkably the notification rate of confirmed campylobacteriosis has shown a growing trend {{in the last five years}} (2006 - 2010), especially since 2008. Campylobacteriosis causes acute enterocolitis with discomfort, fever, severe abdominal pain aand <b>aqueous</b> and/or bloody <b>diarrhea.</b> The incubation period varies from 1 to 11 days (usually 1 - 3 days). In most cases, the diarrhea is self-limiting. Bacteraemia occurs in less than 1 % of the patients with enteritis and provoke after-effects like rheumatoid disorders or peripheral neuropathies (Guillain-Barr√© syndrome). Control strategies to reduce the burden of Campylobacter spp. in broiler meat must be based on the strict implementation of Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system along the whole food chain...|$|R
