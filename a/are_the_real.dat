Gisele begins growing ill from her previous experiment and calls upon Professor Julian to aid her. As he leaves, Joseph awakens in Julian's lab. Pierre triggers an alarm which has him race out the castle where he meets the disoriented Joseph. Pierre takes Joseph to the police station where he reveals he was the kidnapper of the young women but the people in the castle <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> murderers. The police arrive looking for Marguerite but only find Gisele who denies any knowledge of Joseph. Pierre and the police explore the castle without finding clues. On leaving, Gisele begins transforming back into Marguerite before their eyes prompting for an emergency search of the castle. A gun battle ensues between Professor Du Grands assistant and the police leaving the assistant and Professor Du Grand shot. This leads the police to open his grave where they find Lorette. Lorette is sent home and Inspector Chantal reveals that Giselle confessed to the crimes and died shortly after.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} change was {{the role of}} the porters. The 1922 expedition recognized several of them were capable of gaining great heights and quickly learning mountaineering skills. The changed climbing strategy which increased their involvement later culminated in an equal partnership of Tenzing Norgay for the first known ascent in 1953 together with Edmund Hillary. The gradual reversal in the system of “Sahib - Porter” from the earliest expeditions eventually led to a “professional - client” situation where the Sherpa “porters” <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> strong mountaineering professionals and the westerners mainly weaker clients.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values <b>are.</b> <b>The</b> <b>real</b> self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
25|$|The line's cost totaled $715.3 million, with $334.3 million {{coming from}} the federal government. This is {{considerably}} higher than initial budgets predictedthe figure was about $400 million in 1997. Opponents to the rail line state that it went far over-budget, but supporters of the line state that extensions of the route and other alterations, plus the impact of inflation, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> reasons for the increased cost. Initial designs cut out the last stop in downtown, and {{the southern end of}} the line did not quite connect to the Mall of America. The Warehouse District stop was added early but another cost increase came from approximately $40 million to enhance the line (while construction was in progress) to bring the line directly into the Mall of America's transit hub. It was completed later than what was initially hoped for (a lot of literature points to 2003 as the opening year), but the mall connection was a significant contribution to the extra time requirements. These extensions are also why the line was initially reported to be 11.6 miles long, but ended up being 12 miles in length. The Target Field extension in 2009 added a few more tenths to the length.|$|E

500|$|These interpretations {{have also}} been criticized as hypocritical and poor {{justification}} for the film's content, as Cannibal Holocaust itself is highly sensationalized. Firsching claims that [...] "The fact that the film's sole spokesperson for the anti-exploitation perspective is played by porn star Robert Kerman should give an indication of where its sympathies lie", while Schager says Deodato is [...] "pathetically justifying the unrepentant carnage by posthumously damning his eaten filmmaker protagonists with a 'who <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> monsters – the cannibals or us?' anti-imperialism morale".|$|E
500|$|The film {{draws on}} a number of macabre {{incidents}} from international banking: the Bank of Credit and Commerce International crisis in 1991, the murder of Roberto Calvi, an alleged banker to the Sicilian Mafia, in London in 1982, and the assassination by poisoning of Georgi Markov in London in 1978. The bank is making large loans to rogue states and simultaneously acting as their munitions broker. The script offers the chilling insight that the creditors <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> winners of any conflict. A.O.

500|$|Marshall was not fond of Wilson, as he {{disagreed}} {{with him on}} a number of issues. Although Wilson invited Marshall to cabinet meetings, Marshall's ideas were rarely considered for implementation, and Marshall eventually stopped attending them regularly. In 1913 Wilson took the then unheard-of step of meeting personally with members of the Senate to discuss policy. [...] Before this, presidents used the vice president (who serves as president of the senate) as a go-between; Wilson used the opportunity to show that he did not trust Marshall with delicate business. In his memoir, Marshall's only negative comment towards Wilson was, [...] "I have sometimes thought that great men are the bane of civilization, they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> cause of all the bitterness and contention which amounts to anything in the world". [...] Their relationship was described as one of [...] "functioning animosity".|$|E

500|$|Orbison did not {{authorize the}} use of the song or know {{it was going to be}} used, but {{the use of}} [...] "In Dreams" [...] proved {{beneficial}} to his career, which had stalled in the 1970s. BAM magazine called the song [...] "the emotional epicenter of the film". Orbison biographer Ellis Amburn called [...] "In Dreams" [...] deceptively simple and that it is used to significant effect in Blue Velvet because it suggests dreaming is preferable to waking, and power and control <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> themes of the song, instead of love, longing, and loss. The film made the song a cult favorite, and after seeing it a few times, Orbison reconsidered his stance on its use. Footage of the film is featured in the 1987 music video of [...] "In Dreams", and interspersed with live action shots of Orbison's image projected over a filmy linen cloth blowing in the wind.|$|E
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> battles?'

500|$|He next {{starred in}} Joseph Zito's Red Scorpion in 1989, {{opposite}} M. Emmet Walsh, Al White, T. P. McKenna and Carmen Argenziano. The plot centers on Lundgren's character Nikolai, a Soviet Spetsnaz-trained KGB agent who {{is sent to}} an African country where Soviet, Czechoslovakian and Cuban forces support the government's fight against an anti-communist rebel movement. Nikolai is ordered to assassinate the movement's leader, but eventually switches sides. The film was partly shot in Namibia and it was claimed that Grace Jones joined him during production in Swakopmund, insisting on staying in a $3000-a-month villa, even though his girlfriend {{at the time was}} reported to be Paula Barbieri. The film was poorly received and has an 11% [...] "rotten" [...] rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said, [...] "Dolph Lundgren's pectorals <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> stars of Red Scorpion, an action-adventure movie set in the fictional African country of Mombaka. Filmed from below so that one has the sense of peering up at a massive kinetic sculpture, his glistening torso, which {{over the course of the}} film is subjected to assorted tortures, is the movie's primary visual focus whenever the action slows down. And since Mr. Lundgren remains stone-faced, rarely speaking except to issue commands in a surprisingly hesitant monotone, his heaving chest actually communicates more emotion than his mumbling lips." ...|$|E

500|$|ISIS {{is forced}} to quit mission {{training}} due to time constraints. After the space shuttle Intrepid exits out of the Earth's atmosphere, Drake introduces them to the blueprints of Horizon, which is overrun with so-called [...] "mutineers". Drake's plan is to fight past the mutineers and link up with his men on the bridge. The group is aided with an M41A pulse rifle, which is set into two modes: on kill mode, the weapon fires lethal plasma ammunition, while the weapon serves as a tranquilizer on stun mode. Indeed, stun mode can potentially initiate cardiac arrest, as proven when Archer accidentally shoots Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), who is later revived after defibrillation. The trajectory of the shuttle is off course from Horizon, which is later found {{to be caused by}} Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer) and Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), who are being harbored in cargo. Archer is then put on probation in the hold, after shooting Pam with his pulse rifle. As the Intrepid lands on a port on the Horizon, Lana, Cyril, and Ray Gillette (Adam Reed) enter into the spacecraft with Drake. Being overwhelmed by the number of mutineers, Archer later joins their endeavors after being released by Pam. The party successfully makes it to the bridge, where it is revealed that Drake and his men <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> mutineers, and his real plan was to lure Lana onto the station to become breeding stock for the colonization of Mars.|$|E
500|$|In July 1937, {{following}} the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, full-scale {{war broke out}} between Japan and China. Initially limited to northern China, the fighting spread in August to Shanghai. The Japanese government decided to send two divisions of reinforcements to drive the Chinese Army from Shanghai, which would be organized as the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEA). Due to a shortage of active duty generals, the Army General Staff opted to pull someone from the reserves to lead the new army and on August 15 Matsui was officially appointed commander of the SEA. The reason why Matsui was selected is not entirely clear, but {{his reputation as a}} [...] "China expert" [...] was likely a major factor. The historian Ikuhiko Hata argues that at the time the Army General Staff was hoping to seek a settlement with China once Shanghai had been secured for Japan, and Matsui, because of his close friendships with China's leaders, was seen as an ideal candidate to conduct the negotiations. Matsui declared that his mission would be [...] "to make the Chinese people recognize that Japanese troops <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> friends of China", and likewise stated that [...] "I am going to the front not to fight an enemy but in the state of mind of one who sets out to pacify his brother." [...] However, one of his old acquaintances in the Chinese Army remarked in The New York Times that [...] "There can be no friendship between us while there is war between China and Japan." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1173 {{and early}} 1174 Geoffrey fought a {{military}} campaign in northern England {{in support of}} his father's attempts to subdue the Scots, who were supporting the rebellion by Geoffrey's legitimate half-brothers against their father. The campaign resulted in the capture of William the Lion, the King of Scots, at the Battle of Alnwick and also helped to compel Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, to pledge fealty to Henry II. During the campaign, Geoffrey captured several castles held by Roger Mowbray, a supporter of the Scottish king. It was after this campaign that Henry said of Geoffrey [...] "My other sons <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> bastards. ... This is the only one who's proved himself legitimate!" [...] After Geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by Pope Alexander in 1175, the bishop-elect made a ceremonial visit to Lincoln on 1 August 1175. He subsequently went to study at Tours, where he probably befriended Peter of Blois, a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on St Wilfrid to Geoffrey. The bishop-elect made several gifts to the cathedral at Lincoln, including two bells for the bell tower. While Geoffrey was the bishop-elect at Lincoln, it appears that Adam, Bishop of St Asaph, carried out the episcopal duties in the diocese of Lincoln, as Geoffrey had not been consecrated and was unable to perform those functions. Nevertheless, he managed to recover some lands of the diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items. Although he aided the finances of his diocese with these recoveries, in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father. In 1181 Pope Lucius III became concerned that Geoffrey {{was never going to be}} ordained or consecrated, and demanded that the bishop-elect's position be regularised, either through consecration as bishop or through resignation.|$|E
