5|$|In 1952, the Reverend Francis Dixon of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth, England, began hearing several testimonies {{from people}} who became Christians after Jenner accosted them on George Street, Sydney. The {{following}} year, Dixon met with Jenner in Australia and told him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> he had met who had become Christians {{as a result of}} Jenner's evangelism, and Jenner, then fifty years old, cried because he had not previously known that even one of the people he had talked to had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith.|$|E
5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins {{once again}} with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura {{in the middle of}} a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Yuko tells Yu how she has {{influenced}} people in two separate stories (from Ef: The First Tale). After she is done with this, she asks him to tell her <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> he has influenced. Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears out of nowhere and disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Egyptian tombs and temples {{contained}} {{thousands of}} paintings, sculptures, and written works, which reveal {{a great deal}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of that time. However, their depictions of themselves in their surviving art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic, rather than realistic, pigments. As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity {{of the people who}} lived in Egypt during dynastic times.|$|E
25|$|While Lavoisier is {{commonly}} {{known for his}} contributions to the sciences, he also dedicated {{a significant portion of}} his fortune and work toward benefitting the public. Lavoisier was a humanitarian – he cared deeply <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in his country and often concerned himself with improving the livelihood of the population by agriculture, industry, and the sciences. The first instance of this occurred in 1765, when he submitted an essay on improving urban street lighting to the French Academy of Sciences.|$|E

25|$|James Vance, Tulsa World (April 22, 2001) — Stout's {{books are}} mysteries, but they're {{invariably}} more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> involved than the mysteries themselves. Hutton, an Academy Award–winning actor (for 1980's Ordinary People), is ideal casting for Archie, and the lesser-known Chaykin is a surprisingly satisfactory choice {{to flesh out}} the combination of growls and tics that make up Nero Wolfe. To that mix Hutton and his partners in production have added the concept of repertory casting that will see the same nucleus of performers returning in different roles each week.|$|E
25|$|The {{general public}} are {{familiar}} with the names of the High Secure Hospitals due to the frequency that they are mentioned in the news reports <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who are sent there. Those in England include, Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside; Broadmoor Hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire and Rampton Secure Hospital in Retford, Nottinghamshire and in Scotland is The State Hospital, Carstairs. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man have their own Medium and Low Secure units but use the mainland faculties for High Secure, which smaller Channel Islands also transfer their patients to as Out of Area Referrals under the Mental Health Act 1983. Of the Medium Secure units, there are many more of these in number scattered throughout the UK. As of 2009 there were 27 women only units in England alone. Irish units include those at prisons in Portlaise, Castelrea, and Cork.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} eastern Notre Dame Bay, on the {{northeast}} coast of Newfoundland, {{has been found to}} contain numerous archeological sites containing material from indigenous cultures. One of them is the Boyd's Cove site. Situated {{at the foot of a}} bay, it is protected by a maze of islands that shelter it from waves and winds. The site was found in 1981 during an archeological survey to locate Beothuk sites, in order to study their artifacts and gain more insight into Beothuk culture. Existing historical records were too limited to answer a number of important questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> Few record-keeping Europeans had been in contact with the Beothuk, and information about their lives has been more limited. By contrast, peoples such as the Huron or the Mi'kmaq interacted with the French missionaries, who studied and taught them, and had extensive trade with French, Dutch and English, all of whom made records of their encounters.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.|$|E
25|$|Around 100BC, the Adena {{evolved into}} the Hopewell people, who were named for the farm owned by Captain M. C. Hopewell, where {{evidence}} of their unique culture was discovered. Like the Adena, the Hopewell people participated in a mound-building culture. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated earthworks {{can be found in}} modern-day Marietta, Newark, and Circleville. They were also a powerful trading society, managing to knit together a network that passed goods throughout a third of the continent. The Hopewell, however, disappeared from the Ohio Valley in about 600AD. Little is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who replaced them, although many Siouan-speaking peoples from the Plains & East Coast claim them as ancestors & say they lived throughout the Ohio region until approx. the 13th century. It is possible that the rise of the Mississippian Culture was the downfall of the Hopewell, as they began to rise to prominence on the Mississippi River around {{the same time that the}} Hopewell Culture died out.|$|E
