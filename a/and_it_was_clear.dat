5|$|In late August, Seacole was on {{the route}} to Cathcart's Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city was burning out of control, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications {{to the north of}} the harbour. Later in the day, Seacole {{fulfilled}} a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell. Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing refreshments and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10ft) long painting of the Madonna.|$|E

5|$|Skanderbeg's {{primary reason}} for allying with Alfonso was his fear of 21-year-old Mehmed II, whose {{ambition}} was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain. Mehmed had been planning a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Krujë in 1450. Another factor was that Krujë geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> {{that there would be}} some sort of clash between the two in Albania, the epicenter of the conflict. Mehmed {{was one of the first}} monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 French Open Men's singles {{semifinal}} between world No. 2 Novak Djokovic {{and world}} No. 3 Roger Federer was a historic encounter that {{brought about the}} end of the longest winning streak in almost 30 years. Djokovic entered the match undefeated for the first five months of the year having gone 41–0 with a total winning streak of 43 matches (his last loss had come against Federer at the World Tour Finals). It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer. Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011, however, Federer shocked many by taking the first two sets. Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that if the match went to a fifth set it would have to be continued the next day. Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5–4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker.|$|E

He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by neuritis in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued {{a career as a}} composer, studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher—a great one, according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at St Paul's Girls' School, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of Whitsun music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.|$|E

5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E

In 1750, the Treaty of Madrid separated the Portuguese and Spanish areas of South America in lines that are mostly consisted to present-day boundaries. Neither Portugal nor Spain {{were satisfied with the}} results, and new treaties were signed in the following decades that either established new territorial lines or repealed them. The final accord signed by both powers, the Treaty of Badajoz (1801), reaffirmed the validity of the previous Treaty of San Ildefonso (1777), which had derived from the older Treaty of Madrid.|$|E
25|$|According to Yoav Gelber, During the {{six weeks}} between the Hagannah {{offensive}} in 1 April and {{the invasion of}} the Arab armies the Arabs were defeated in almost every front. The Jewish forces captured four cities (Tiberias, Jaffa, Safed and Haifa) and 190 villages, most of their residents fled. The refugees flooded Samaria, central Galilee, Mount Hebron region, Gaza region, as well as Transjordan, Lebanon and southern Syria. The defeat of the Palestinian forces and the ALA, the Arab League saw no other option than to invade {{by the end of the}} British Mandate. The process of deciding to invade and preparing for the attack began two or three weeks before the end of the Mandate, when the level of the defeat was revealed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> the ALA could not prevent it.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s the {{passenger}} train service was increasing considerably, especially as branch lines opened, {{and an additional}} through island platform was provided in 1871, occupying space formerly in use for stabling carriages. Increase in traffic continued, as also increasing train lengths <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that a major extension of the station was essential. Newcastle had been given city status in 1882 and was supportive of the work, seeing it as a civic improvement. Forth Street was displaced southwards and two new trainshed roofs covered a southward extension of the station; in addition a large expansion to the east took place, with additional bay platforms there {{on the north side}} of the former bays. The original through track was blocked to form east and west bays, so that there were still only three through platform lines. This work was completed in 1894.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Royal Canadian Air Force’s {{standard}} elementary training aircraft was the de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk. Flight instruction {{was completed by}} student pilots on the DHC-1 before they progressed to the then-brand-new Canadair CT-114 Tutor jet trainer. A decision was made by RCAF HQ to remove the DHC-1s from service and not replace them, as {{it was felt that}} the CT-114 was easy enough to fly that initial training was not needed. The CT-114 quickly developed a wash-out rate of near 95% amongst student jet pilots <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that an elementary trainer was needed. Due to the RCAF’s previous customer relationship with Beechcraft while operating that company's Expeditor twin-engine aircraft, a hasty purchase of twenty-four B23 Musketeers was made in 1971. The first CT-134 arrived at CFB Portage la Prairie on March 23, 1971.|$|E

Alexander Tettey and Per Ciljan Skjelbred established themselves on the team, along with Swede Mikael Dorsin. By the summer break, Per Joar Hansen felt that Eggen was too dominant, and wanted him removed.

25|$|Despite the {{rationalisation}} to its twelve strongest {{teams and}} improved television coverage, the financial {{position of the}} competition {{and the vast majority}} of its clubs remained perilous into the early 1990s, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that the VFA was no longer a viable independent body in the long term. At the end of the 1994 season, the VFA was formally disbanded in an administrative capacity, and the on-field competition was turned over to the Victorian State Football League – a body which had been set up two years earlier by the AFL to manage and oversee football at all levels in Victoria, and also ran the statewide under-18s competition (the TAC Cup) and the AFL reserves competition in Victoria. This ended the VFA's 97 years of independence from the VFL/AFL, and created for the first time since 1896 a unified structure for state-level football in Victoria.|$|E

25|$|The product {{rule and}} chain rule, {{the notions of}} higher {{derivatives}} and Taylor series, and of analytic functions were introduced by Isaac Newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of mathematical physics. In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus {{to solve the problem}} of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a cycloid, and many other problems discussed in his Principia Mathematica (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that he understood the principles of the Taylor series. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.|$|E
