These parameters can be computed from quoted bond prices and allow <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> ratings much finer than those provided by various rating agencies. We estimate the risk measures {{on a daily basis}} for a sample of US firms and compare them with the corresponding ratings provided by Moody's and the distance to default measures calculated using the Merton (1974) model. The three measures group the sample of firms into various risk classes in a similar but far from identical way, possibly reflecting the models' different forecasting horizons. Among the three measures, the highest rank correlation is found between our continuous measure and Moody's ratings. The techniques in this paper can be used to extract the entire distribution of inter-temporal risk-neutral default intensities which is useful for time-to-default estimators as well as for pricing credit derivatives. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{structure}} and attributes of subprime mortgage-backed securitization deals originated between 1997 and 2007. Our data set allows us to link loan-level data for over 6. 7 million subprime loans to the securitization deals into which the loans were sold. We show that the securitization process, including the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> ratings, provided incentives for securitizing banks to purchase loans of poor credit quality in areas with high rates of house price appreciation. Increased demand from the secondary mortgage market for these types of loans appears to have facilitated easier credit in the primary mortgage market. To test this hypothesis, we identify an event which represents an external shock to the relative demand for subprime mortgages in the secondary market. We show that following the SEC’s adoption of rules reducing capital requirements on certain broker dealers in 2004, five large deal underwriters disproportionately increased their purchasing activity relative to competing underwriters in ZIP codes with the highest realized rates of house price appreciation but lower average credit quality. We show that these loans subsequently defaulted at marginally higher rates. Finally, using the event as an instrument, we demonstrate a causal link between the demand for mortgages in th...|$|E

Quantitative response {{data from a}} series of experiments on responsibility attribution Project description: This project aims to identify the principles that underlie people's attributions of cause, responsibility and blame in social contexts. This is a complex problem, because people's judgments are responsive to many factors, including the intentions and foreknowledge of the agents involved, and subtle interactions between the different parties. As a guiding framework the project will test and develop a structural model approach to attribution, based upon notions of counterfactual dependence and active causal pathways between events. This approach maintains that <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and blame are driven by people's causal models, but allows for dissociations between what is judged a cause and what is singled out for blame. The project will use experimental studies to test the applicability of the structural model in everyday human attributions. These studies will explore a variety of contexts, including interactive games with multiple players. The complex interactions between players in competitive games present a novel and rich environment to investigate people's attributions. In addition, the project will investigate how people construct and communicate the causal models that underpin their attributions. These studies will examine how people transform scenarios into causal models, and how these models affect their subsequent judgments of cause and blame...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} there is an urgent need to emphasise the role of the {{academic}} as an important actor in the study of policy implementation in higher education. It asserts that research into higher education is distinctive in adopting an ‘over-socialised˚s conception of men and women. To demonstrate the actor's importance in the understanding of change the article draws on the results of an ethnographic single-site case study of NewU, a post- 1992 university. The locus of the study was the developing ‘mass˚s model of higher education and curricular characteristics associated with that, particularly the credit framework, the constellation of features related to and facilitated by the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to assessed learning, considered in a context of relative resource decline and increasing student numbers. The study highlighted the ways in which academics respond to changing contexts and take actions which have the effect, intentionally and otherwise, of changing policy outcomes. A greater understanding of academics' behaviour can be achieved by moving beyond the essentialist position adopted by many higher education researchers which gives explanatory priority to the epistemological characteristics of disciplines. Researchers also need to take account of the organisational, cultural and ideological characteristics of particular contexts and the interests and understandings of actors in them...|$|E

Although the student modeler was evaluated once with positive results, {{in order to}} better understand it and student modeling in general, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. That is, we studied the effects on accuracy of varying both numerical parameters of the student modeler (e. g., the prior probabilities) and structural parameters (e. g., whether the tutor uses feedback; whether the tutor insists that students correct errors; whether missing entries are counted as errors). Many of the results were surprising. For instance: Leaving feedback on when testing students improved the assessor's accuracy; Long tests harmed accuracy in certain circumstances; CAI-style user interfaces often yielded higher accuracy than ITS-style user interfaces. Furthermore, we discovered that the most important problem confronted by the Andes student modeler was not the classic <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and blame problem, which is what Bayesian student modeling was designed to solve. Rather, it is that if students do not keep moving along a solution path, knowledge that they have mastered may not get a chance to apply, and thus the student modeler can not detect it. This factor had more impact on assessment accuracy than any other numerical or structural parameter. It is arguably a problem for all student modelers, and other assessment technology as well...|$|E

We examined whether people with damage restricted to subregions of prefrontal cortex showed the patterns of impairment observed in prior investigations {{of the effects of}} lesions to homologous regions in macaques. Groups of patients with either lOFC (predominantly right hemisphere), mOFC/vmPFC, or dorsomedial prefrontal (DMF), and a comparison group of healthy age- and education-matched controls performed a probabilistic 3 -choice decision-making task. We report anatomically specific patterns of impairment. We found that credit assignment, as indexed by the normal influence of contingent relationships between choice and reward, is reduced in lOFC patients compared with Controls and mOFC/vmPFC patients. Moreover, the effects of reward contingency on choice were similar for patients with lesions in DMF or mOFC/vmPFC, compared with Controls. By contrast, mOFC/vmPFC-lesioned patients made more stochastic choices than Controls when the decision was framed by valuable distracting alternatives, suggesting that value comparisons were no longer independent of irrelevant options. Once again, there was evidence of regional specialization: patients with lOFC lesions were unimpaired relative to Controls. As in macaques, human lOFC and mOFC/vmPFC are necessary for contingent learning and value-guided decision-making, respectively...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{the term}} {{capacity}} to describe possible geologic storage implies a realistic or likely volume of CO 2 to be sequestered. Poor data quantity and quality may lead to very high uncertainty in the storage estimate. Use of the term “storage resource” alleviates the implied certainty of the term “storage capacity”. This is especially important to non- scientists (e. g. policy makers) because “capacity” is commonly used to describe the very specific and more certain quantities such as volume of a gas tank or a hotel’s overnight guest limit. Resource is a term used in the classification of oil and gas accumulations to infer lesser certainty in the commercial production of oil and gas. Likewise for CO 2 sequestration, a suspected porous and permeable zone can be classified as a resource, but capacity can only be estimated after a well is drilled into the formation and a relatively higher degree of economic and regulatory certainty is established. Storage capacity estimates are lower risk or higher certainty compared to storage resource estimates. In the oil and gas industry, prospective resource and contingent resource are used for estimates with less data and certainty. Oil and gas reserves are classified as Proved and Unproved, and by analogy, capacity can be classified similarly. The highest degree of certainty for an oil or gas accumulation is Proved, Developed Producing (PDP) Reserves. For CO 2 sequestration this could be Proved Developed Injecting (PDI) Capacity. A geologic sequestration storage classification system is developed by analogy to that used by the oil and gas industry. When a CO 2 sequestration industry emerges, storage resource and capacity estimates will be considered a company asset and consequently regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, storage accounting and auditing protocols will be required to confirm projected storage estimates and <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> from actual injection.

40|$|The {{orbitofrontal cortex}} and {{adjacent}} ventromedial prefrontal cortex carry reward representations and mediate flexible behaviour when circumstances change. Here we review how recent experiments in humans and macaques have confirmed {{the existence of}} a major difference between the functions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and adjacent medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) {{on the one hand and}} the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) on the other. These differences, however, may not be best accounted for in terms of specializations for reward and error/punishment processing as is commonly assumed. Instead we argue that both lesion and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal that the lOFC is concerned with the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for both reward and error outcomes to the choice of specific stimuli and with the linking of specific stimulus representations to representations of specific types of reward outcome. By contrast, we argue that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/mOFC is concerned with evaluation, value-guided decision-making and maintenance of a choice over successive decisions. Despite the popular view that they cause perseveration of behaviour and inability to inhibit repetition of a previously made choice, we found that lesions in neither orbitofrontal subdivision caused perseveration. On the contrary, lesions in the lOFC made animals switch more rapidly between choices when they were finding it difficult to assign reward values to choices. Lesions in the mOFC caused animals to lose their normal predisposition to repeat previously successful choices, suggesting that the mOFC does not just mediate value comparison in choice but also facilitates maintenance of the same choice if it has been successful...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{contentious}} elements of the design of cap-and-trade systems for emissions trading is the allocation or <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> the emissions <b>credits</b> themselves. Policy-makers usually try to satisfy a range of goals through the allocation process, including easing the transition costs for high-emissions firms, reducing leakage to unregulated regions, and mitigating {{the impact of the}} regulations on product prices such as electricity. In this paper we develop a detailed representation of the US western electricity market to assess the potential impacts of various allocation proposals. Several proposals involve the " of permit allocation, where the allocation is tied to the ongoing output, or input use, of plants. These allocation proposals are designed with the goals of limiting the pass-through of carbon costs to product prices, mitigating leakage, and of mitigating the costs to high-emissions firms. However, allocation updating can also inate permit prices, thereby limiting the benefits of such schemes to high emissions firms. Rather than mitigating the impact on high carbon producers, the net operating profit of such firms can actually be lower under input-based updating than under auctioning. This {{is due to the fact}} that product prices (and therefore revenues) are lower under input-based updating, but overall compliance costs are relatively comparable between auctioning and input-based updating. Thus, the anticipated benefits from allocation updating are greatly reduced and further distortions are introduced into the trading system...|$|R

The first and simple approach in form of a calibration curve assumes independence of the defaults <b>of</b> different corporate <b>credits.</b> The second approach with mixture models is more realistic as it takes default dependence into account. With these models we can use an estimate of a country’s GDP to calculate an estimate for the Value-at-Risk <b>of</b> some <b>credit</b> portfolio...|$|R
