50|$|The <b>azimuth</b> <b>guidance,</b> {{based on}} the Moir√© Pattern, works {{independently}} of the laser that calculates distance to stop and is unaffected by weather conditions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Azimuth</b> <b>Guidance</b> for Nose-In Stand {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular forms of stand guidance. It {{consists}} of two coloured lights mounted side by side.|$|E
5000|$|Elevation {{coverage}} {{is provided in}} the same airspace as the <b>azimuth</b> <b>guidance</b> signals: In elevation, to at least +15 degrees; Laterally, to fill the Azimuth lateral coverage and in range, to at least 20 nautical miles (37 km) (See FIG 1-1-9.) ...|$|E
50|$|If {{the pilot}} {{is on the}} stand {{centreline}} they will see two green lights. If they are off centreline, one of the lights will appear red and the pilot then steers towards the green one. AGNIS alone provides only <b>azimuth</b> <b>guidance,</b> it does not inform pilots when they should stop. It is relatively imprecise but cheap to implement and reliable.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{recognised}} that {{leader cable}} would be impractical at some airports, {{but that it}} could be dispensed with if improvements could be made to ILS. Some improvement resulted from a narrow beam localizer aerial system developed by BLEU during the early 1950s [...] and by 1958 automatic landings had been made using only ILS localiser for <b>azimuth</b> <b>guidance.</b> [...] That required a good site but by the early 1960s radically new aerial designs for the ILS transmitters developed by Standard Telephones & Cables (ST&C) improved ILS to an extent that leader cable could be dispensed with.|$|E
40|$|Report {{describes}} {{studies conducted}} with pilots in flight simulator to examine use of front azimuth and back azimuth functions of {{microwave landing system}} (MLS) during precise departures immediately after takeoffs and during missed approaches. Studies provided data to determine optimum back azimuth signal sensitivity to establish operationally acceptable limits and procedures for use of back <b>azimuth</b> <b>guidance,</b> and to determine optimum technique for switching from front azimuth to back <b>azimuth</b> <b>guidance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Refinements in {{the lateral}} and {{longitudinal}} guidance for an {{automatic landing system}} capable of curved trajectories were studied. Wing flaps or drag flaps (speed brakes) were found to provide faster and more precise speed control than autothrottles. In {{the case of the}} lateral control it is shown that the use of the integral of the roll error in the roll command over the first 30 to 40 seconds of flight reduces the sensitivity of the lateral guidance to the gain on the <b>azimuth</b> <b>guidance</b> angle error in the roll command. Also, changes to the guidance algorithm are given that permit pi-radian approaches and constrain the airplane to fly in a specified plane defined by the position of the airplane at the start of letdown and the flare point...|$|E
