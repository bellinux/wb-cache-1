5|$|It is {{possible}} that Felix was associated with Irish missionary activity in Francia, which was centred in Burgundy and was particularly associated with Columbanus and Luxeuil Abbey. Columbanus had arrived in Francia in about 590, after leaving Bangor along with twelve companions <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> voluntary exile. Upon Columbanus's arrival, he was encouraged to stay, and in about 592 settled at Annegay, but was then forced to find an alternative site for a monastery at Luxeuil, when lay people and the sick continually sought the counsel of himself and his fellow monks.|$|E

However, this schedule conflicted {{with the release of}} The Men Who Stare at Goats, another Clooney film. The film was eventually released on December 4 in fifteen theaters spanning twelve markets, broadening in the next week to 72 theaters <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> wide release on December 23, 2009. It was released in other countries beginning in early 2010.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.|$|E

5|$|Susan Eloise Hinton (better {{known as}} S. E. Hinton) is an American author who {{is best known}} for writing young adult fiction. The Outsiders was Hinton's first {{published}} book in 1967; Hinton wrote the book at the age of seventeen. Hinton based the characters, the Greasers and the Socs, off of teenage gangs and alienated youth in her hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma during the 1960s. The Outsiders has sold over fourteen million copies since it was published. In 1983, The Outsiders became a movie, and was later released onto DVD. After experiencing a writer's block <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> a state of depression, Hinton met somebody in her freshmen biology class, who inspired her to continue writing.|$|E
5|$|Ladas {{was sent}} to Doncaster for the St Leger on 12 September {{in an attempt to}} win the Triple Crown. Ridden by Tommy Loates, Ladas started at odds of 10/11 (0.9/1) in a field of eight, with Matchbox (ridden by Watts) the second choice on 2/1 and the filly Throstle ignored on 50/1. As usual, Ladas was held up {{at the back of the}} field as, at first Throstle, then a horse named Legal Tender, then Matchbox made the running. Ladas moved {{steadily}} closer and turned into the straight in second, before overtaking Matchbox <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> a clear lead. In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by Throstle, and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three quarters of a length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as the outsider overhauled the favourite.|$|E
5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E

The match also saw some unusual (and controversial) tactics on the fourth day by the Australians. Following the Tea Break, they were in a dominant position, however they were a long way behind on their over rate. So to prevent a one match suspension to captain Ricky Ponting, they chose to bowl their part-time bowlers such as Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey (who were both unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), to make it up. This drew strong criticism from many commentators, who suggested that their faster bowlers could have bowled from a shorter run-up.|$|E
