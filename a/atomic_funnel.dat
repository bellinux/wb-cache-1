40|$|We {{have built}} an <b>atomic</b> <b>funnel</b> which {{produces}} {{a slow and}} cold cesium atomic beam. The <b>atomic</b> <b>funnel</b> {{is based on a}} pyramidal Magneto Optical Trap (MOT) with a small hole at its apex. Characterization of the funnel operation has been carried out by fluorescence emission and absorption spectroscopy, and optical time of flight (TOF) methods. The atomic beam has a longitudinal velocity in the range 8 - 12 m/s and a spread less than 1. 5 m/s. The transverse temperature is close to the Doppler limit. Typically, an atom flux similar to 4 x 10 (9) atoms/s is attained. These features, combined with the compactness and simplicity of the experimental arrangement, make this system an ideal source for experiments in atom lithography and atom optics.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 A low velocity, low {{temperature}} beam of atoms is produced from a two-dimensional magneto-optic trap {{known as an}} <b>atomic</b> <b>funnel.</b> The funnel provides simultaneous spatial and velocity compression of atoms and will provide a source for a three-grating atomic interferometer. Rubidium atoms from an oven are slowed by chirped cooling and loaded into the trap. Atoms are ejected from the trap using frequency offsets in optical molasses. The resultant beam has a controllable velocity {{in the range of}} 3 to 10 m/s with temperatures of order 500 μK...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 A continuous, low-velocity, nearly {{monochromatic}} {{atomic beam}} is created using laser cooling and two-dimensional magneto-optic trapping. Rubidium atoms from an effusive oven are slowed and cooled using Zeeman-tuned slowing. The scattering force from a counter-propagating, frequency-stabilized diode laser beam {{is used to}} decelerate the thermal beam of atoms to a velocity of 20 m/s. A spatially varying magnetic field is used to Zeeman shift the resonance frequency of the atom {{to compensate for the}} changing Doppler shift, thereby keeping the slowing atoms resonant with the fixed frequency laser. This slowing process also cools the beam of atoms to a temperature of a few Kelvin. The slow beam of atoms is loaded into a two-dimensional magneto-optic trap or <b>atomic</b> <b>funnel.</b> The atoms are trapped along the axis of the funnel and experience a molassestype damping force in all three spatial dimensions. By frequency shifting the laser beams used to make the trap, the atoms are ejected at a controllable velocity. The continuous matter-wave source has a controllable beam velocity in the range of 2 to 15 m/s, longitudinal and transverse temperatures of approximately 500 μK, and a flux of 3. 4 x 10 ⁹ atoms/s. At 10 m/s, the de Broglie wavelength of the beam is 0. 5 nm. The spatial profile of the atomic beam was characterized 30 cm from the exit of the <b>atomic</b> <b>funnel</b> using a surface ionization detector. The low-velocity atomic beam is an ideal source for atom interferometry and a variety of applications in the field of atom optics...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} on the results of a {{nanolithography}} experiment with a cold cesium beam. We have realized a brilliant and collimated cesium beam with a low longitudinal velocity (10 m/s) exploiting laser cooling techniques, in particular a pyramidal <b>atomic</b> <b>funnel.</b> The cesium atomic beam has been utilized to pattern gold substrates, using Self Assembled Monolayers (SAM) of thiols as resist, and a wet etching process. The pattern generated by a light mask, a one-dimensional standing e. m. wave, was characterized by diffraction and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements, showing the presence of lines spaced half the wavelength of the standing wave (426 nm) with lateral size well below 100 nm.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 We have {{developed}} simple and inexpensive laser systems using grating-feedback diode lasers with electronic {{feedback to the}} injection current. These grating-feedback lasers can be continuously scanned up to 10 GHz and have a linewidth of 150 kHz. The three electronic frequency-stabilization systems we developed use polarization spectroscopy, etalon transmission and modified heterodyne signals as the frequency discriminators to drive an integrating servo control circuit. These laser systems are used for laser cooling and trapping of rubidium and atomic beam diagnostics. The rubidium D₂ line at 780 nm is a strong, cycling transition {{that can be used}} for laser cooling and trapping. We use chirped cooling and Zeeman-tuned cooling to slow atoms from a thermal atomic beam. These atoms are loaded into a two-dimensional magneto-optic trap, or funnel. Using a frequency offset of the trapping lasers, the atoms are ejected from the funnel at a controllable velocity. The diode laser systems we {{have developed}} are a central component of this rubidium <b>atomic</b> <b>funnel.</b> We will use the funnel's bright, cold atomic beam as a source for matter-wave interferometry. We also developed an ionization detector to measure the flux and the spatial profile of the atomic beam when the background of scattered light makes fluorescent detection difficult...|$|E
