50|$|Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine {{attacked}} the Prussian forces on 22 November {{outside the gates}} of Breslau, between the villages of Kosel und Gräbschen, launching the battle with a cannonade. The Prussians, who had taken up fortified positions in the surrounding villages, were then attacked at three separate points. After the Austrians were able to conquer the first few villages, they manned them with howitzers and intensified their cannonade, after which the duke of Brunswick-Bevern gathered ten regiments together and began a counter-attack. A tough, bloody struggle for the villages began, in which the Prussians were able to score several decisive successes against the superior Austrian forces. It has never been established whether Bevern wanted to lead another counter-attack {{the next day or}} whether the retreat. Nevertheless, the Prussians did retreat, which seemed to have begun suddenly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>cue,</b> whether it had been ordered or not. The battle field was consequently abandoned to Prince Charles and the Prussians went back to Glogau via Breslau.|$|E

As the family assembles for dinner, Asa is smitten with Mary Dundreary and instantly detects Coyle's plans.

Cornelius realizes that killing her old body was the trigger that awakened the new one. Toko kills Cornelius, and is confronted by Soren as she is tending to Mikiya's head injury. Soren asks whether Toko intends to oppose him; she replies that she had already lost, when she died. She says that the one who would stop him would be Shiki. Then she guesses Soren's real purpose regarding the apartment complex by representing the Taiji in order to take in the Taiji (using Shiki (yin) to get into the Spiral of Origin and end the world). Soren replied yes and says he has sealed her outside of space, which incites Toko to laugh derisively. She explains that he {{would have been better off}} sealing her in concrete, as no such barrier would hold Shiki for long. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>cue,</b> Shiki arrives with the katana to duel with Soren and Shiki finally kills him. As Soren dissolves slowly, he discusses with Toko his reason for ending the world is that he wanted the records of the deaths of all humans and a conclusion to his deed. With that he achieves happiness for giving meaning to meaningless deaths of the human race.|$|E
5000|$|Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle {{stated the}} {{original}} film was [...] "an effective little tingler whose frights are steady, implied, and cumulative [...] [...] [...] {{but in the}} remake the frights are such that you’re wondering why the stubborn Lutzes don’t flee after the first night. Obviously, the filmmakers were keen to remake this film exactly because the technological advances of the last 25 years now permit more graphic displays of horrific imaginings and computer enhancements that can render the invisible world visible. Strategically, the new Amityville never intended {{to go for the}} subtler, implied horror of the original; this one would be all about scaring the pants off viewers. And in this, the movie generally succeeds as sudden scares and flashes of yucky imagery cause audience members to yelp aloud <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>cue</b> [...] [...] [...] The most irritating aspect of the new movie, however, {{has nothing to do with}} comparisons but rather with some of the inherent illogic of the story. Why are we seeing images of a hanged girl when we know she’s been shot in the head? Images seem to be grafted into the film that have little to do with the actual story. Maybe it’s a technique that succeeds within quick advertising spots, but it piles confusion onto the art of storytelling." ...|$|E

5000|$|Varvara Petrovna takes Marya (and Liza who {{has insisted}} on coming with them) back to Skvoreshniki. Already present are Dasha, {{her older brother}} Ivan Shatov, and a nervous Stepan Trofimovich. Praskovya arrives, {{accompanied}} by her nephew Mavriky Nikolaevich, demanding to know why her daughter has been dragged in to Varvara Petrovna's [...] "scandal". Varvara Petrovna questions Dasha about a large sum of money that Nikolai Vsevolodovich supposedly sent through her to Marya's brother, {{but in spite of}} her straightforward answers matters don't become any clearer. Marya's brother, the drunkard Captain Lebyadkin, comes looking for his sister and confuses Varvara Petrovna even further with semi-deranged rantings about some sort of dishonour that must remain unspoken. At this point the butler announces that Nikolai Vsevolodovich has arrived. To everyone's surprise, however, a complete stranger walks in and immediately begins to dominate the conversation. It turns out to be Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky, Stepan Trofimovich's son. As he is talking, Nikolai Stavrogin quietly enters. Varvara Petrovna stops him imperiously and, indicating Marya, demands to know if she is his lawful wife. He looks at his mother impassively, says nothing, kisses her hand, and unhurriedly approaches Marya. In soothing tones he explains to Marya that he is her devoted friend, not her husband or fiancé, that she should not be here, and that he will escort her home. She agrees and they leave. In the din that breaks out after their departure, the strongest voice is that of Pyotr Stepanovich, and he manages to persuade Varvara Petrovna to listen to his explanation for what has occurred. According to him, Nikolai Vsevolodovich became acquainted with the Lebyadkins when he was living a life of [...] "mockery" [...] in Petersburg five years earlier. The downtrodden, crippled and half mad Marya had fallen hopelessly in love with him and he had responded by treating her [...] "like a marquise". She began to think of him as her fiancé, and when he left he made arrangements for her support, including a substantial allowance, which her brother proceeded to appropriate as though he had some sort of right to it. Varvara Petrovna is elated and almost triumphant to hear that her son's actions had a noble foundation rather than a shameful one. Under interrogation from Pyotr Stepanovich, Captain Lebyadkin reluctantly confirms the truth of the whole story. He departs in disgrace as Nikolai Vsevolodovich returns from escorting Marya home. Nikolai Vsevolodovich addresses himself to Dasha with congratulations on her impending marriage, of which, he says, he was expressly informed. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>cue,</b> Pyotr Stepanovich says that he too has received a long letter from his father about an impending marriage, but that one cannot make sense of it - something about having to get married because of [...] "another man's sins", and pleading to be [...] "saved". An enraged Varvara Petrovna tells Stepan Trofimovich to leave her house and never come back. In the uproar that follows no-one notices Shatov, who has not said a word the entire time, walking across the room to stand directly in front of Nikolai Vsevolodovich. He looks him in the eye for a long time without saying anything, then suddenly hits him in the face with all his might. Stavrogin staggers, recovers himself, and seizes Shatov; but he immediately takes his hands away, and stands motionless, calmly returning Shatov's gaze. It is Shatov who lowers his eyes, and leaves, apparently crushed. Liza screams and collapses on the floor in a faint.|$|E
50|$|The album {{includes}} the following liner notes:RINGSIDE - Lost Days December 2010In the time since Ringside’s self-titled debut album was released in 2005, a lot has happened to Ringside singer and songwriter Scott Thomas…Several months into the promotion of that album, he broke his back. Around the same time, he agreed to let his friend Enrique Iglesias cover his song “Tired Of Being Sorry”, which {{was just beginning to}} become a radio hit for Ringside. “Tired Of Being Sorry” instead became a big international hit for Enrique, which then signaled {{the beginning of the end}} of Ringside’s relationship with their former record label, also Enrique’s label. But Scott produced Enrique’s version of the song, as well as French singer Nadiya’s version with Enrique, and “Tired Of Being Sorry” went on to become the #1 longest-running song on the charts in France. Meanwhile, Scott toured Australia on his own dime opening for Ben Harper with nothing but his trusty old battered Gibson acoustic guitar. He sold his own bootleg CD’s out of a tent for money for food. Scott was befriended by some fans in Russia, who brought Ringside there to play several private parties. Ringside’s music grew in popularity in Russia and Eastern Europe. Multiple performances there have now grown into continued large concerts at outdoor arenas several times a year. Scott has performed Ringside material while being backed by Russia’s National Cossack Choir, and performs each Christmas with the Moscow Philharmonic at historic Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow.His relationships in the East, his newfound affair with Mother Russia, led to a strong friendship there with a wealthy patron of the arts. This resulted in the purchasing of a Los Angeles recording studio, so that Scott could have a safe haven to create new music. Ringside set up shop at Ocean Studios Burbank, where they recorded their self-financed new Money EP and Lost Days album.Although Scott played most of the instruments and produced, Lost Days features appearances from an impressive list of musicians and collaborators:Ben Harper is featured on the title track “Lost Days,” a somber rocker with a big chorus, and in the accompanying music video. Ozomatli contributed horns to the songs “Freedom” and “Good” (and to “Chamberlain” on the Money EP).Esthero, Res, and Graph Nobel sang backing vocals.In addition to Scott, Kirk Hellie, Ben Harper, and Brian Bell from Weezer played guitar. Joey Waronker, Jim Keltner, Josh Freese, Norm Block, Sandy Chila, and Jon Pikus played drums. Joaquin Phoenix wandered in late nights and provided mysterious inspiration. Balthazar Getty co-produced the new EP and album, and is a part of the band as much as he can be, though he is occasionally pre-occupied with primetime television acting, tabloid exploits and evading the paparazzi.The process of recording over several years left Scott drained. He had strayed into dark corners of the world, lost his muse, uncertain of his path, and feared he had lost his voice as well. He persuaded longtime friend and collaborator Jon Pikus to manage him, and the constraint he felt from being trapped in an archaic publishing deal was recently lifted when that deal came to an end. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>cue,</b> his muse returned, as did his voice, and so earlier this year he wrote and recorded the final 2 songs for the album, “This Time” and “Satellite.”The iconic Lost Days album cover was captured by Scott’s longtime friend photographer Michael Muller.Scott contributed music to the James Franco film Good Time Max, and is currently scoring and writing songs for the upcoming film LOL.Scott also has recently formed a side-project band called Matson Tweed, with Gary Louris of The Jayhawks and Nashville singer/songwriter Madi Diaz, with songs co-written by Nashville songwriter Kristen Hall (Sugarland), but that’s another story for another day. …A lot has happened to Scott Thomas since 2005, and will continue to happen to him, because that is simply the hand he has been dealt. He has lived for the music, starved, celebrated, behaved badly, repented, been burned, healed, fallen apart, re-grouped, been a father and husband, friend, and a renegade. There has been birth, death, exploitation, education, sex, drugs, contemplation, revelation, redesign, theft, arrest, intoxication, solitude, love, and finally redemption. This album is a testament, a musical document of his Lost Days.|$|E
