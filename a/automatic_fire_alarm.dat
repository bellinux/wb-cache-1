25|$|A smoke {{detector}} is {{a device that}} detects smoke and issues a signal. Most {{smoke detector}}s work either by optical detection or by physical process, {{but some of them}} use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails. The first <b>automatic</b> electric <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> was co-invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961.

25|$|The first <b>automatic</b> {{electric}} <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate}} of Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} 1960s-built tunnel was slated as {{of one of}} {{the least}} safe in Europe in 2000, according to a study. Inspectors visited 25 major tunnels around Europe after fire devastated the Mont Blanc Tunnel under the Alps between France and Italy. The Tyne Tunnel was officially rated as [...] "poor" [...] and languished {{near the bottom of the}} European league table. The inspectors found it had no <b>automatic</b> <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system, poor lighting, no laybys or hard shoulder, and an emergency walkway that could be reached only by able-bodied people. They also criticised its smoke extraction system. These deficiencies were addressed during the refurbishment of the original road tunnel in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Manual {{fire alarm}} {{activation}} is typically achieved {{through the use}} of a pull station (USA & Canada) or call point (Europe, Australia, Asia and Germany), which then sounds the evacuation alarm for the relevant building or zone. Manual fire alarm activation requires human intervention, as distinct from <b>automatic</b> <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> activation such as that provided {{through the use of}} heat detectors and smoke detectors. It is, however, possible for call points/pull stations to be used in conjunction with automatic detection as part of an overall fire detection and alarm system. Systems in completed buildings tend to be wired in and to include a control panel. Systems for use during construction can also be wireless or mechanical, however it is recommended by the Structural Timber Association in the UK that for timber-framed constructions, interconnecting wireless systems be used.|$|E
50|$|Allowing for a {{grandfather}} clause {{that did not}} require schools to retrofit to a new standard if they already met previous regulations, the school legally complied {{with the state of}} Illinois and city of Chicago fire codes of 1958 and was generally clean and well-maintained; nonetheless, several fire hazards existed. Each classroom door had a glass transom above it, which provided ventilation into the corridor but also permitted flames and smoke to enter once heat broke the glass. The school had one fire escape. The building had no <b>automatic</b> <b>fire</b> <b>alarm,</b> no rate-of-rise heat detectors, no direct alarm connection to the fire department, no fire-resistant stairwells, and no heavy-duty fire doors from the stairwells to the second floor corridor. At the time, fire sprinklers were primarily found in factories or in new school construction, and the modern smoke detector did not become commercially available until 1969.|$|E
