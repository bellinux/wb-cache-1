5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E

You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while."

Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> family entertainment's dead."

Move, unfortunately, doesn't produce that reaction often enough... Move feels a little too safe, or, said another way, a little too static". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still has something to say, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> it well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying [...] "Whether accompanied by sharp-edged electric or slippery resonator guitars, a kids choir or the Blind Boys of Alabama, Third Day's Southern rock remains grounded in the band's faith".|$|E
500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E
