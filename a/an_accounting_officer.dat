Upon arriving in Runan to take office, Deng Ai sought a man who generously helped his father before because he wanted to repay that man for his kindness.

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2007. An {{objective}} {{of local government}} is to ensure the provision of services to communities in a sustainable manner. Thus, the Matjhabeng Local Municipality has the obligation to ensure that public services are rendered effectively, efficiently and sustainably. The obligation consequently is on the municipal officials, as agents of change towards improved service delivery, especially the Municipal Manager, as <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer,</b> to ensure improved service delivery and to continuously evaluate the quality, usefulness and acceptance of services delivered. Officials at the Matjhabeng Local Municipality, especially those at the Welkom office, {{have a range of}} delivery options to ensure quality service provision by strategically assessing and planning the most appropriate forms of service delivery for their customers. Officials need to be geared to the implementation of the chosen delivery options in the most effective and economical manner and to ensure maximum benefits to the customers. As agents of change, officials at the Matjhabeng Local Municipality need to be effective in operating the municipal machine effectively, efficiently and in providing rational advice to the elected office-bearers and for improved services to the Welkom community. For the purpose of this study, the hypothesis was formulated that legislation since 1994 entrusted officials as agents of change in service delivery, yet officials of the Welkom branch of the Matjhabeng Local Municipality lack capacity to effect change, and would require strategic training programmes to enhance their skills and effectiveness. In support of the empirical research, use and analysis of a theoretical study of local government as agent for change were undertaken. The analysis showed that the theoretical distinction in the roles of political office-bearers and appointed officials in the service delivery process was incorrect. Rather, the empirical study supported a close and meaningful collaboration between the appointed officials and political office-bearers for sound financial and resources management. Further, it was found that with administrative and financial resources available, the municipality can make a significant impact in the Welkom community. Master...|$|E

40|$|D. Cur. (Nursing Science) A {{cost centre}} in a {{hospital}} setting was an identifiable department; such as a nursing care unit, where a nurse manager was also assigned the responsibilities of assuming the duties of a cost manager, e. g. managing the expenditure of that unit and being accountable for the costs. The cost centre was assigned an account number in the hospital accounting system {{for the purpose of}} controlling clinical and administrative costs, as well as accumulated expenses by that department (Cleverley & Cameron, 2003 : 437). The South African National Treasury prescribed expenditure control measures in Section 38 to ensure that expenditure should be accounted for, by appointing <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> (South Africa: 1999). In the particular tertiary hospital complex environment, accounting officers were the appointed cost centre managers who were also the unit nurse managers of these nursing care units. These managers experienced difficulties in fulfilling their dual role in a cost centre management environment for which they had not received training. The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop a training programme for nurse managers also appointed as cost centre managers at a tertiary hospital complex in the Limpopo Province. In this study, a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory and contextual design was used. Homogenous purposive sampling was conducted from a population of thirty six (36) nurse managers appointed as cost centre managers. A focus group interview session in which nine (9) cost centre managers participated and twelve (12) cost centre managers participated in one-on-one unstructured interviews were conducted until saturation of data was reached. The central question posed was: “How is it for you as a cost centre manager in your nursing care unit executing dual role for CCMT and providing quality care to patients?” Participants were given an opportunity to describe their experiences about being appointed as cost centre managers in their working situation and while providing care to patients. Adapted phases of the development process of Meyer and Van Niekerk (2008) were used in developing the programme. The survey list of Practice Oriented theory of Dickoff, James and Wiedenbach (1968 : 434) and Malcolm Knowles’ adult learning (Graig, 1996 : 253) served as the point of departure for developing a context-specific training programme. Malcolm Knowles’ adult learning theory (Graig, 1996 : 253) acknowledged that adult learners had specific learning needs when compared to other learners...|$|E
