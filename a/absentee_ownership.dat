2500|$|The Commissioners {{concluded}} {{they could}} not [...] "forbear expressing our strong sense of the patient endurance which the labouring classes have exhibited under sufferings greater, we believe, than the people of {{any other country in}} Europe have to sustain." [...] The Commission stated that bad relations between landlord and tenant were principally responsible. There was no hereditary loyalty, feudal tie, or mitigating tradition of paternalism as existed in England (Ireland was a conquered country). The Earl of Clare observed of landlords that [...] "confiscation is their common title". According to the historian Cecil Woodham-Smith, landlords regarded the land as simply a source of income, from which as much as possible was to be extracted. With the Irish [...] "brooding over their discontent in sullen indignation" [...] (in the words of the Earl of Clare), the countryside was largely viewed by landlords as a hostile place in which to live, and <b>absentee</b> <b>ownership</b> was common; some landlords visited their property only once or twice in a lifetime, if ever. The rents from Ireland were generally spent elsewhere; an estimated £6,000,000 was remitted out of Ireland in 1842.|$|E

60|$|There are, {{it will be}} seen, some {{elements}} in the program of the new British Labour Party apparently at variance with American and English institutions, traditions, and ideas. We are left in doubt, for instance, in regard to its attitude toward private property. The instinct for property is probably innate in humanity, and American conservatism in this regard is, according to certain modern economists, undoubtedly sound. A man {{should be permitted to}} acquire at least as much property as is required for the expression of his personality; such a wise limitation, also, would abolish the evil known as <b>absentee</b> <b>ownership.</b> Again, there will arise in many minds the question whether the funds for the plan of National finance outlined in the program may be obtained without seriously deranging the economic system of the nation and of the world. The older school denounces the program as Utopian. On the other hand, economists of the modern school who have been consulted have declared it practical. It is certain that before the war began {{it would not have been}} thought possible to raise the billions which in four years have been expended on sheer destruction; and one of our saddest reflections today must be of regret that a small portion of these billions which have gone to waste could not have been expended for the very purposes outlined--education, public health, the advancement of science and art, public buildings, roads and parks, and the proper housing of populations! It is also dawning upon us, as a result of new practices brought about by the war, that our organization of industry was happy-go-lucky, inefficient and wasteful, and that a more scientific and economical organization is imperative. Under such a new system it may well be, as modern economists claim, that, we shall have an ample surplus for the Common Good.|$|E

50|$|A second March for Territory, Land, Political Participation and Development {{was held}} in 1996. It began with 2000 CIDOB marchers in Santa Cruz de la Sierra on August 27, 1996, and was joined {{by members of the}} Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia (CSUTCB) and the Bolivian Syndicalist Confederation of Colonizers (CSCB) on the {{following}} day. CIDOB won its demand that indigenous land rights be protected as indigenous territories, with elements of sovereignty and local jurisdiction and ended its participation in the march in Samaipata, Santa Cruz. CSUTCB and CSCB continued the march to La Paz, where some 13,000 marchers grew to twenty to forty thousand protesters, but were unsuccessful in winning the campesino federations' demands.

50|$|In Prince Edward Island, the {{ultimate}} {{results of his}} father’s work came to have far-reaching and exceptional merit, in the unpleasant story of <b>absentee</b> proprietary <b>ownership</b> on that island. Much of his land gained directly through original grants from Lord William Campbell, the 5th Earl's interests having been secured through purchase by lease and release, from individual holders. At its peak in 1831, the Selkirk PEI Estate consisted of Lots 10, 31, 57, 58, 60, and Lot 62, one-half of 12, one-third of 53, and one-third of 59, some 142, 966 acres. In 1842, the Estate was estimated at some 114,000 acres; the lands having been correctly disposed of by sale or lease of 99 or 999 years. In 1860, Dunbar Douglas, Lord Selkirk, acting on advice of his land agent, sold his holdings to the Island Colonial Government, then containing some 62,059 acres, for £6,586 17s 8d Sterling, the per acre price stated as 2s 2p Sterling (this the lowest price paid for land lottery grant lands).|$|R
30|$|After 2000, {{a partial}} {{recultivation}} of abandoned lands has been observed, which is primarily driven by adjustment of agricultural policies and growing prices for agricultural commodities (de Beurs and Ioffe 2014; Estel et al. 2015; Meyfroidt et al. 2016; Smaliychuk et al. 2016). However, recultivation {{rates have been}} compensated by ongoing agricultural land abandonment—reaching 60  Mha by 2013 for three largest post-Soviet agricultural nations (Fig.  13). From 2000 to 2010, grain yields increased (Trueblood and Arnade 2001; Liefert et al. 2010). In southern Russia where the physical attributes, location, and human resources are best positioned to support agricultural activity (e.g., in Stravropol’ Krai), there is growth potential for agriculture (Kattsov et al. 2012). Here, there is evolving specialization of former socialized farms in response to market conditions. In Stavropol’, this involves a shrinkage of animal husbandry and a consequent release of surplus labor, increased levels of <b>absentee</b> (corporate) <b>ownership</b> of farmland in the more favorable locations, decoupling of the economic fate of successful large farms from deficient local municipal budgets, and an expansion of non-Russian ethnic communities in the countryside (Ioffe et al. 2014).|$|R

5000|$|Absentee {{landlord}} is {{an economic}} term for a person who owns and rents out a profit-earning property, but does not live within the property's local economic region.

50|$|Railways {{had been}} {{extended}} into frontier states; there were heavy crops in sparsely settled regions where freight-rates were high, so {{that given the}} existing distributive system there were over production and waste; there was notorious stock manipulation and discrimination in rates; and the farmers regarded <b>absentee</b> <b>ownership</b> of railways by New York capitalists much as <b>absentee</b> <b>ownership</b> of land has been regarded in Ireland. The Grange officially disclaimed enmity to railways: Though the organization did not attack them, the Grangers, through political farmers clubs and the like, did. In 1867, the Grange began efforts to establish regulation of the railways as common-carriers, by the states. Such laws were known as Granger Laws, and their general principles, endorsed in 1876 by the Supreme Court of the United States, have become an important chapter in {{the laws of the}} land.|$|E
40|$|In October 2008, Petrohawk Energy drilled {{the first}} modern {{fracking}} well into the Eagle Ford Shale, sparking an oil and gas boom {{in what is now}} one of the world?s most productive shale plays, responsible for 1. 087 million barrels of oil per day. Large investments in production infrastructure and commercial developments have brought economic opportunities to one of the poorest areas in Texas. Notwithstanding multiple reports on economic activity, there have not been any studies examining how this development is experienced on the Eagle Ford Shale and the amount of local policymaker economic governance. I therefore ask: Does a resource curse exist on the Eagle Ford Shale? In framing this question, this study evaluates if social disruption and worsening economic inequality are present on the shale play. This thesis employs two methods: semi-structured interviews with 15 economic development officials from August 2014 to March 2015 and a spatial assessment of relative mineral wealth using 2010 - 2015 public tax data as a proxy for actual mineral wealth from Live Oak County, a core Eagle Ford oil and gas production county. The interviews indicated that economic development officials are most concerned about the deterioration of roads, the high demand for housing, and ramifications of skyrocketing wages. Findings from the Live Oak County mineral wealth analysis demonstrate that only 1. 95 % remains local to the county. This absentee mineral wealth is concentrated with major energy firms in the Texas metropolitan regions. The implications from these results indicate that a traditional core-periphery relationship has developed on the Eagle Ford Shale, economic development officials remain optimistic about development despite receiving few benefits in an apparent royalty paradox, and social relations are changing possibly due to <b>absentee</b> mineral <b>ownership.</b> I answer the research question by noting that there are indications that the resource curse is present. As one respondent describes it, Eagle Ford ?[economic development] all depends on the price of oil!? and not on policymaker actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of land ownership in Iowa is rapidly changing. More {{than half of}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s land is rented. The average age of land owners has increased over time. This study examines the differences in adoption of conservation practices between absentee owners and owner operators. Specifically, this study investigates hitherto unexplored differences between absentee owners and owner operators found in previous studies (e. g., <b>absentee</b> owners, sole <b>ownership,</b> proximity of habitation to farm and reasons for owning land) regarding decisions to conserve land. This study 2 ̆ 7 s 2006 survey data were analyzed using the non-parametric method (tau-b) and a parametric regression framework (logistic regressions). The results suggested that all conservation practices were not considered to be equal by landowners. Being an owner operator or absentee owner impacted the decision to use certain types of conservation practices. Absentee owners tend to adopt the structural (expensive) conservation practices more than owner operators, whereas both types of owners equally adopt inexpensive conservation practices. Being an absentee owner or owner operator does not impact the probability of having land enrolled in a government conservation program. Age, education, place of residence, owned agricultural land and reasons for owning land seem to affect the adoption of each practice individually. However, knowledge about the cost-share program does {{have a positive impact on}} adoption, regardless of the type of conservation practices. Ultimately, there is a need for more investigation to increase our knowledge of absentee owners, the reasons land owners choose to be absentee owners and their motivations to conserve land. This study found that landowners rarely used the internet for management information regarding their land. Similarly a very low percentage of landowners said the internet was their preferred way to receive such information. Reasons why the internet was not more widely used should be explored. Finally, policy makers should consider absentee owners as being strategically different from owner operators when creating conservation policies...|$|R
