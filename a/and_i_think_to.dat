60|$|In this {{business}} of supplying my place in emergencies, Walkirk showed so much ability in promoting my interests that I became greatly pleased with the arrangement I had made with him. It was somewhat surprising to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> Walkirk, that so many cases arose in which I found it desirable that he should take my place. I was {{going to look at}} a horse: some visitors arrived; I sent Walkirk. There was a meeting of a scientific society which I wished very much to attend, but I could not do that and go to a dinner party to which I had been invited on the same evening; Walkirk went to the meeting, took notes, and the next day gave me a full report in regard to some particular points in which I was interested, and which were not mentioned in the short newspaper notice of the meeting.|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} before my {{departure}} from Culpeper the Honorable E. B. Washburne visited me there, and remained with my headquarters for some distance south, through the battle in the Wilderness <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> Spottsylvania. He {{was accompanied by a}} Mr. Swinton, whom he presented as a literary gentleman who wished to accompany the army with a view of writing a history of the war when it was over. He assured me--and I have no doubt Swinton gave him the assurance--that he was not present as a correspondent of the press. I expressed an entire willingness to have him (Swinton) accompany the army, and would have allowed him to do so as a correspondent, restricted, however, in the character of the information he could give. We received Richmond papers with about as much regularity as if there had been no war, and knew that our papers were received with equal regularity by the Confederates. It was desirable, therefore, that correspondents should not be privileged spies of the enemy within our lines.|$|E

Not that I would make bold for to dror comparisons, even in my own mind, for she's only a common woman--as common a one as ever you see. But few women rise above the common. Last Sunday, in yon village church, I heard the {{minister}} read out that one man in a thousand had he found, 'but one woman in all these,' he says, 'have <b>I</b> not found,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>to</b> myself, 'Right you are!'

60|$|Our provisions--if I {{may give}} that name {{to what we}} had left--were reduced to the rind of one lemon and {{about a couple of}} handsfull of coffee-berries. Besides these great distresses, caused by the death, the danger, and the {{suffering}} among my crew and passengers, I had had a little distress of my own to shake me still more, in the death of the child whom I had got to be very fond of on the voyage out--so fond that I was secretly a little jealous of her being taken in the Long-boat instead of mine when the ship foundered. It used to be a great comfort to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> those with me also, after we had seen the last of the Golden Mary, to see the Golden Lucy, held up by the men in the Long-boat, when the weather allowed it, as the best and brightest sight they had to show. She looked, at the distance we saw her from, almost like a little white bird in the air. To miss her for the first time, when the weather lulled a little again, and we all looked out for our white bird and looked in vain, was a sore disappointment. To see the men's heads bowed down and the captain's hand pointing into the sea when we hailed the Long- boat, a few days after, gave me as heavy a shock and as sharp a pang of heartache to bear as ever I remember suffering in all my life. I only mention these things to show that if I did give way a little at first, under the dread that our captain was lost to us, it was not without having been a good deal shaken beforehand by more trials {{of one sort or another}} than often fall to one man's share.|$|E

5000|$|Lord Linlithgow, the Viceroy, {{told the}} leaders of the Muslim League that the Government of Great Britain {{intended}} to divide India into three dominions - among the Hindus, the Muslims, and the Rulers of Princely States. Within the Muslim League Working Committee, various sub-committees were established, numerous proposals were presented with the final decision resting with the British. However, when the British saw that their objectives could not be met, they unilaterally rejected all proposals submitted by the Muslims. At this point, Zafarullah Khan was asked to submit a proposal on the partition of India, about which the Viceroy wrote to the Secretary of State for India:Upon my instruction Zafarullah wrote a memorandum on the subject.

In the spring of 2012, she was contacted again by the series and she auditioned for the role of [...] "Maya." [...] Castillo admitted that she didn't think they even came up with her character's real name until the day before she was to start taping her first scenes. She once again tested with Thompson. Castillo was chosen out of hundreds of other actresses for the role of Sabrina. After several weeks of waiting, she was contacted by the show again and read for executive producer, Frank Valentini. She went back for another chemistry test in late August. Castillo began filming her scenes on August 31, 2012. During the audition, the actresses started out getting [...] "pretty" [...] to do a fantasy scene in which the character admits her love for Patrick, and then transforming into a nerdy girl with glasses for the rest of the scene. To make sure she stood out from the 9 other actresses that the producers had called back, Castillo admitted that she [...] "decided to have fun." [...] Several days later, Castillo learned from her manager that she had booked the role. The character first appeared on September 19, despite some sources stating the first air date to be September 14. The date may have been confused with Emily Wilson's first appearance as Ellie Trout, who did appear on the 14th. Castillo originated the role on a contractual basis.|$|E
40|$|Since the [relativity] {{postulate}} {{comes to}} mean that only the four-dimensional world {{in space and time}} is given by phenomena, but that the projection in space and in time may still be undertaken with a certain degree of freedom, I prefer to call it the postulate of the absolute world.

40|$|This {{first page}} of this edited {{collection}} states that we have moved to ‘a new participatory turn’ (p. 15) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> myself, that’s interesting as it’s not really ‘new’ anymore; I thought we had moved beyond attractiveness of the visual to a post-popular juncture where researchers and practitioners are discussing the limitations of participatory visual methods (Packard, 2008). However, despite this, perhaps out-of-place, initial claim, the book itself is highly reflexive and does not present an easy marriage between the digital, the visual and the participatory, but instead seriously considers how the ‘imagined ideal of participation and the actual practice on the ground often manifest quite differently from one another’ (p. 21). The book presents a series of chapters that recognise the tensions between giving voice and the ethical concerns that mean voices are kept hidden;the values of creative forms to reach new audiences and break down barriers; {{and the importance of}} building a shared vocabulary so that researchers who apply multimodal participatory techniques can work together to refine and improve their craft...|$|E
