25|$|Jawless {{fish were}} the {{earliest}} fish to evolve. There is current {{debate over whether}} these are really fish at <b>all.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> no jaw, no scales, no paired fins, and no bony skeleton. Their skin is smooth and soft to the touch, {{and they are very}} flexible. Instead of a jaw, they possess an oral sucker. They use this to fasten onto other fish, and then use their rasp-like teeth to grind through their host's skin into the viscera. Jawless fish inhabit both fresh and salt water environments. Some are anadromous, moving between both fresh and salt water habitats.|$|E

25|$|Roman is {{the leader}} of the Dark Signers. He {{possesses}} a birthmark resembling the Spider Nazca line and can use it send out spiders that can possess civilians, turning them into Dark Signers, and giving them Shadow powers and Dark Tuner and Synchro Monsters. The spiders can also be used as a means of surveillance, reporting <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> found once they return to their owner. Roman reveals himself to be Rex Goodwin's big brother and an assistant to Professor Fudo (Yusei's Father), until he met a mysterious man from Yliaster. The man told him to look into Ener-D's light and learn about the Earthbound Immortals' battle against the Crimson Dragon. Though revealed to be the Fifth Signer, Roman betrays Professor Fudo and causes the Zero Reverse incident after ripping his own arm off and giving it to Rex, telling him to unite the Signers. The resulting explosion transforms Roman into a Dark Signer.|$|E

500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans.

At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need.

[...] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's [...] "heaviness" [...] was inspired by [...] "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in."

2500|$|I'm New Here {{features}} introspective, confessional lyrics expressing {{themes of}} regret, reconciliation, and redemption, which deviate from his earlier music's agitprop lyrics and social, political themes. On Scott-Heron's thematic departure, critic Paul Trynka wrote [...] "The man who depicted Winter in America {{is now in}} his own autumn; a season replete with both beauty and sadness". The Skinnys Bram Gieben perceived [...] "flashes of Burroughs-like darkness, the wry humour of post-addiction Richard Pryor" [...] in Scott-Heron's performance. Although Scott-Heron's lyrics concerning his bleak life experiences are understated and reflective, they express pride, dignity, defiance, and unapologetic confession. According to Robert Ferguson of Drowned in Sound, Scott-Heron expresses [...] "confession, but no apology" [...] to [...] "pick over the bones of his life, acknowledging the hard times and his own mistakes, but standing proud of <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> led him to become".|$|E

2500|$|The book's {{foreword}} by Malcolm Nance grounds {{the reader}} by giving {{background on the}} conclusions of the report. Nance emphasizes the significant necessity of a coherent plan to stem American terrorists from exiting the country and then returning again from war-torn zones in order to commit criminal acts back in their home country. Nance concludes his foreword writing, [...] "This Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel is a keystone study of ISIS's ability to recruit terrorists from or in their home nations to abandon <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> ever known and launch themselves as a virtually programmed corps of human guided weapons globally." [...] The report discusses the significant problem of United States citizens leaving {{their country of origin}} in order to gain fighting experience in Iraq and Syria on the battlefield. The report documents that the amount of U.S. citizens who have tried to gain access to battlefield areas in order to fight alongside foreign terrorists numbers in the hundreds. The report faults the Obama Administration for failing to take enough action on the matter, writing, [...] "The U.S. government lacks a national strategy for combating terrorist travel and has not produced one in nearly a decade." ...|$|E

Other authors have discussed analogies (similar folklore motifs, purely typological considerations, and certain binary pairs in symbolics) {{may be related to}} a dualistic organization of societysome dualistic features can be found in comparisons with these peoples. However, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society nor cosmological dualism have been researched thoroughly.

[...] There are some reports of a division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties, folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and cooperation of two beings {{in the creation of the}} land, the motif of the earth-diver. This motif is present in several cultures in different variants. In one example, the creator of the world is helped by a waterfowl as the bird dives under the water and fetches earth so that the creator can make land out of it. In some cultures, the creator and the earth-fetching being (sometimes called a devil, or taking the shape of a loon) compete with one another; in other cultures (including the Ket variant), they do not compete at all, but rather collaborate.|$|E
