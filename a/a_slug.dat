5|$|During {{their time}} in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked {{their way into the}} {{interior}} of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamési) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of <b>a</b> <b>slug.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} Burgess Shale fossils {{since the mid-1970s}} {{has led to the}} description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which looked like <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but the discovery of a further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and has led to the reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E

25|$|The {{bottom side}} of <b>a</b> <b>slug,</b> which is flat, {{is called the}} 'foot'.

25|$|Slugs are hermaphrodites, having both {{female and}} male {{reproductive}} organs. Once <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia. A few days later, the slugs lay approximately thirty eggs in {{a hole in the}} ground, or beneath the cover of an object such as a fallen log.|$|E
25|$|The {{linotype}} machine operator enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles matrices, which are molds for the letter forms, in a line. The assembled line is then {{cast as a}} single piece, called <b>a</b> <b>slug,</b> of type metal in {{a process known as}} hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine from which they came, to be reused later. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than original hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast glyph (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name is a}} misnomer, as the {{statistic}} is not {{a percentage}} but a scale of measure whose computed value is a rational number in the interval 4. <b>A</b> <b>slugging</b> percentage is always expressed as a decimal to three decimal places, and is generally spoken as if multiplied by 1000 (so <b>a</b> <b>slugging</b> percentage of [...]589 would be spoken as [...] "five eighty nine").|$|R

25|$|When casting is complete, {{the mold}} disk turns {{three-quarters of a}} turn {{counterclockwise}} to the ejector and knife block assembly. The ejector is a rectangular rod that pushes the completed slug from the mold aperture in the mold disk. As it emerges from the mold disk, the slug passes a set of knife edges in the knife block, which trims off any small irregularities in the casting and produces <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> of exactly the desired width and height. From there, the slug drops into the galley tray which holds the lines in {{the order in which}} they were cast.|$|E
25|$|User-generated {{content is}} a major feature of Spore; there are {{eighteen}} different editors (some unique to a phase). All have the same general UI and controls for positioning, scaling and coloring parts, whether {{for the creation of}} a creature, or for a building or vehicle. The Creature editor, for example, allows the player to take what looks like a lump of clay with a spine and mold it into a creature. Once the torso is shaped, the player can add parts such as legs, arms, feet, hands, noses, eyes, and mouths. Many of these parts affect the creature's abilities (speed, strength, diet, etc.), while some parts are purely decorative. Once the creature is formed, it can be painted using a large number of textures, overlays, colors, and patterns, which are procedurally applied depending on the topology of the creature. The only required feature is the mouth. All other parts are optional; for example, creatures without legs will slither on the ground like <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> or an inchworm, and creatures without arms will be unable to pick up objects.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E

500|$|In 1994 The Times {{described}} the chain as [...] "a modish hang-out for the stripped pine brigade". The chain's interior layout {{has been described}} as [...] "minimalist". The chain has been criticised by some, such as the writer Will Self, for spreading a bland uniformity throughout British high streets, and for removing individual elements from the pubs that it converts. In 1997, <b>a</b> <b>Slug</b> and Lettuce in a listed building in Islington Green illegally removed its old mahogany bar, which it was later forced to restore.|$|E
500|$|Animal epithets may be pejorative, {{indeed in}} some {{cultures}} highly offensive. Epithets are sometimes used in political campaigns; in 1890, the trades unionist Chummy Fleming marched {{with a group}} of unemployed people through the streets of Melbourne, displaying a banner with the message [...] "Feed on our flesh and blood you capitalist hyenas: it is your funeral feast". On {{the other side of the}} ideological divide, the Cuban government described the revolutionary Che Guevara as a [...] "communist rat" [...] in 1958. Epithets are not limited to mammals; for instance, comparing someone to a snail means they are (extremely) slow, while calling them <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> implies they are lazy and loathsome. Frog is pejorative for French people in English, from the use of frogs' legs in French cuisine.|$|E
500|$|Legrand {{explains}} {{that on the}} day he found the bug on the mainland coastline, Jupiter had picked up a scrap piece of parchment to wrap it up. Legrand kept the scrap and used it to sketch the bug for the narrator; in so doing, though, he noticed traces of invisible ink, revealed by the heat of the fire burning on the hearth. The parchment proved to contain a cryptogram, which Legrand deciphered as a set of directions for finding a treasure buried by the infamous pirate [...] "Captain Kidd." [...] The final step involved dropping <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> or weight through the left eye of the skull in the tree; their first dig failed because Jupiter mistakenly dropped it through the right eye instead. Legrand muses that the skeletons may be the remains of two members of Kidd's crew, who buried the chest and were then killed to silence them.|$|E

500|$|The entire {{series was}} shot on sound stages. Production {{designers}} Greg Loewen and Graemay Murray designed the medical facility as a [...] "circular hub with offices and rooms radiating outward", and included a second floor in which DeMilla could oversee the entire hospital's operations. Director Joe Napolitano praised the sets while filming the episode [...] "Last Resort", calling the show [...] "a good candy store for a director" [...] {{due to the}} functionality {{and size of the}} hospital. He explained that the set enabled him to direct long takes and walk and talk sequences without much difficulty. The series required extensive prosthetic work for Dr. Batung and the non-human patients. The application of Lund's prosthetic makeup required several hours each day that he was filmed. Napolitano said that he found this to be a challenge to the production schedule, explaining that there would be discussions about the amount of prosthetics necessary for Batung depending on the scene. Batung's prosthetic work included a tail that wrapped around his neck and shoulders; Lund was pushed around the set on a sled to mimic the character's movements as <b>a</b> <b>slug.</b> Napolitano also specified that the patients required a similar amount of time and work for their prosthetic makeup, such as a man who has gills under his chin.|$|E
500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E
500|$|The year 1947 {{became a}} career {{year for the}} now-sober Black. There was {{optimism}} in the Indians clubhouse regarding his talent, with manager Lou Boudreau saying that Black was [...] "a leading candidate for one of our starting jobs." [...] In his first pitching appearance of the season against the Detroit Tigers, a tough 53 victory, someone in the press box said, [...] "I wonder what he’d give for <b>a</b> <b>slug</b> of bourbon", to which he replied, [...] "All I wanted in that situation was a fresh stick of chewing gum. Bourbon doesn’t even tempt me." [...] He followed this with a 10 shutout win against the Chicago White Sox. A game against his former team, the Philadelphia Athletics, became the highlight of his career. On July 10, 1947, Black no-hit the Athletics 3-0 at Cleveland Stadium, allowing six walks and five strikeouts in besting Bill McCahan—himself a no-hit pitcher on September 3 of that 1947 season. Only Eddie Joost came close to getting a hit on Black, hitting a ball {{in the eighth inning}} that just barely went foul. On top of his no-hit performance, Black had two singles and a squeeze bunt that day. He was modest about his performance afterwards, saying [...] "My control was pretty bad. I got behind on a lot of hitters, but they didn't seem to hit me." [...] Black finished the season with ten wins, 12 losses, a 3.92 ERA, eight complete games, and three shutouts. At the end of the season, he was planning to play in the Cuban Winter League along with fellow Indians Bob Feller and Al López, though this did not eventuate. During the off-season, Black returned to his hometown of Salix, where he was given a key to the city and made honorary mayor for a day.|$|E
