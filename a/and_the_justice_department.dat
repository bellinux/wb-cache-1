25|$|The {{suit was}} {{originally}} filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon (because {{that was where}} Reagan was living at the time), and that court ended up dismissing the action. Eitel appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which, in 1997, reinstated the case and allowed the Justice Department to join Eitel as a plaintiff in the suit. At this time, the case was also transferred to District Court in Arizona. Eitel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> however, disagreed over the allegations of CIA involvement, and whether {{that should be a}} factor in the suit. The DoJ filed motions in 1998 to drop several of the defendants, provoking a sharp disagreement between Eitel and the Department, and resulting in Eitel's accusation that the DoJ was covering up covert activities and evidence.|$|E

Daugherty overruled the FTC on June 22. The merger finally took effect on October 10, 1922. Six decades later, financial analysts observed that Bethlehem Steel probably purchased Lackawanna Steel for less than half what the company was worth.

25|$|On November 17, 1997, {{a federal}} {{official}} overseeing the Teamsters disqualified Ron Carey from seeking elective {{office in the}} union, concluding that Carey knew of and approved the donation kickback scheme.

Although Teamsters for a Democratic Union continued to support Carey as he fought the disqualification, they also debated what strategy to pursue {{in the event that}} the disqualification was upheld. Meanwhile, Carey <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> signed an agreement in which a federal monitor would oversee the union's spending to prevent any additional improper expenditures. Carey sued to have the disqualification overturned, but a U.S. district court and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both refused his request.|$|E
25|$|President Grant's Reconstruction policy {{worked through}} the U.S. Attorney General <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> in {{addition}} to the Secretary of War and the War Department. During later Reconstruction white supremacists known as white liners in both the North and the South put pressure on the Grant Administration to limit the use of deployed troops in the South that protected African American citizens under the Reconstruction Act of 1867. Previously President Grant had destroyed the Ku Klux Klan under the Enforcement Acts in 1871. Resistance continued and resurged as white liners violently attacked Mississippi blacks in 1875. Republican Governor Adelbert Ames requested troops to protect black voters. In order to avoid violence, Attorney General Pierrepont sent George K. Chase to Mississippi who met with white liner leaders to hold them to their previous pledge not to use violence during the election. President Grant and Att. Gen. Pierrepont told Governor Ames to use federal troops only if the white liners used violence on election day. No violence took place on election day, however, the intimidation tactics of the white liners prior to the election kept blacks and Republican voters from the polls.|$|E

500|$|In August 1948, Whittaker Chambers, {{a former}} spy for the Soviets {{and a senior}} editor at Time magazine, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He said that an {{underground}} communist network had been working within the U.S. government since the 1930s, of which Chambers had been a member, along with Alger Hiss, until recently a senior State Department official. Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for denials under oath. The Soviet Union's success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude that subversion by Soviet spies was responsible, and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence. However, Truman did not fully share such opinions. He famously called the Hiss trial a [...] "red herring," [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> was moving to indict Chambers instead of Hiss for perjury.|$|E
