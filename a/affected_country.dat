25|$|While {{globalization}} has radically increased incomes {{and economic growth}} in developing countries and lowered consumer prices in developed countries, it also changes the power balance between developing and developed countries and affects the culture of each <b>affected</b> <b>country.</b> And the shifting location of goods production has caused many jobs to cross borders, requiring some workers in developed countries to change careers.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the capital structure adjustment dynamics of listed non-financial corporations in seven East Asian countries during 1994 - 2002. Compared to {{firms in the}} least <b>affected</b> <b>countries,</b> average leverages were much higher among firms in the worst <b>affected</b> <b>countries</b> while the average speeds of adjustment were lower. This general ranking is robust to various alternative specifications and sample selections. We argue that this pattern is closely linked to weaknesses in regulatory environment and {{lack of access to}} alternative sources of finance in the worst <b>affected</b> <b>countries.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The {{desert locust}} is a {{difficult}} pest to control, and control measures are further compounded by the large and often remote areas (16-30 million kmÂ²) where locusts can be found. Undeveloped basic infrastructure in some <b>affected</b> <b>countries,</b> limited resources for locust monitoring and control, and political turmoil within and between <b>affected</b> <b>countries</b> further reduce the capacity of a country to undertake the necessary monitoring and control activities.|$|R

25|$|Capital flight {{occurs when}} assets or money rapidly flow {{out of a}} country because of that country's recent {{increase}} in unfavorable financial conditions such as taxes, tariffs, labor costs, government debt or capital controls. This is usually accompanied by {{a sharp drop in}} the exchange rate of the <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> or a forced devaluation for countries living under fixed exchange rates. Currency declines improve the terms of trade, but reduce the monetary value of financial and other assets in the country. This leads to decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets.|$|E
25|$|On the Indian subcontinent, {{almost all}} snakebite deaths have {{traditionally}} been attributed to the Big Four, consisting of the Russell's viper, Indian cobra, saw-scaled viper, and the common krait. However, {{studies have shown that}} the hump-nosed viper, previously considered essentially harmless and misidentified as the saw-scaled viper, is capable of delivering a fatal bite. In regions of Kerala, India, it may be responsible for nearly 10% of venomous bites. Commonly used antivenoms in India do not appear to be effective against hump-nosed viper bites. According to the most conservative estimates, at least 81,000 snake envenomings and 11,000 fatalities occur in India each year, making it the most heavily <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> in the world. The Malayan pit viper and banded krait are two other species involved in a significant number of venomous bites.|$|E

2500|$|The {{provision}} of {{emergency humanitarian aid}} consists of the {{provision of}} vital services (such as food aid to prevent starvation) by aid agencies, {{and the provision of}} funding or in-kind services (like logistics or transport), usually through aid agencies or the government of the <b>affected</b> <b>country.</b> Humanitarian aid is distinguished from humanitarian intervention, which involves armed forces protecting civilians from violent oppression or genocide by state-supported actors.|$|E
2500|$|Bangladesh is {{the most}} <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> by arsenic {{poisoning}} through drinking water. [...] Govt. and other agencies like UNICEF installed wells to provide fresh water in underdeveloped areas of Bangladesh, but later on they found disease related to consumption of this water. About 7-11 million wells or hand pumped wells are providing arsenic polluted water to local people. 20% of the total deaths are related to arsenic related cancer here.|$|E
2500|$|Phase 4 is {{characterized}} by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause [...] "community-level outbreaks". The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with the WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates {{a significant increase in}} risk of a pandemic but {{does not necessarily mean that}} a pandemic is a foregone conclusion.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the capital structure adjustment dynamics of listed non-financial corporations in seven east Asian countries before, {{during and after}} the crisis of 1997 - 1998. Our methodology allows for speeds of adjustment to vary, not only among firms, but also over time, distinguishing between cases of sudden and smooth adjustment. Whereas, compared with firms in the least <b>affected</b> <b>countries,</b> average leverages were much higher, generalized method-of-moments analysis of the Worldscope panel data suggests that average speeds of adjustment were lower in the worst <b>affected</b> <b>countries.</b> This holds also for the severely financially distressed firms in some worst <b>affected</b> <b>countries,</b> though the trend reversed in the post-crisis period. These findings have important implications for the regulatory environment as well as access to market finance. Copyright (c) 2009 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|R

2500|$|Only one {{television}} channel is currently dedicated to country music in Canada: CMT (Canada) owned by Corus Entertainment (90%) and Viacom (10%). In the past, country music had an extensive presence, {{especially on the}} Canadian national broadcaster, CBC Television. The show Don Messer's Jubilee significantly <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> music in Canada; for instance, it was the program that launched Anne Murray's career. Gordie Tapp's Country Hoedown and its successor, The Tommy Hunter Show, ran for a combined 36 years on the CBC, from 1956 to 1992; in its last nine years on air, the U.S. cable network TNN carried Hunter's show.

2500|$|On 5 December, the United Nations Security Council imposed tougher {{sanctions}} on Eritrea {{due to its}} reported role in providing support to the Al-Shabaab militants. Observers {{and members of the}} allied forces subsequently expressed optimism that the long-standing civil conflict in southern Somalia would soon be resolved. Colonel Felix Kulayigye, a spokesman for AMISOM's Ugandan military contingent, indicated that [...] "Normally, sanctions are supposed to reduce the capability of the <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> in its financial muscle. And, therefore, if Eritrea faces sanctions, if they are comprehensive enough, that means it will have not a spare penny to spend on negative elements". Political analyst Sheikh Abdisamad, the chairman of the research organisation Southlink, also suggested that [...] "If the sanctions become effective on Eritrea, what I'm sure is that they can easily defeat those militia within Somalia" [...] since sanctions would disrupt flights funnelling supplies to Al-Shabaab along the [...] "Eritrean route" [...] between Asmara in Eritrea and Kismayo in southern Somalia. Girma Asmerom, Eritrea's Ambassador to the AU, responded that the {{sanctions on}} his country would {{have a negative effect on}} both Eritrea's development and that of the larger East Africa region. He also indicated that he would not wish such restrictions on other nations, describing the United Nations' sanctions as [...] "illegal and unjust".|$|E
