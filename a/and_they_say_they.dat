500|$|To meet {{long-term}} requirements, Alberta Transportation also {{proposes to}} construct a high capacity directional ramp carrying traffic from eastbound Anthony Henday Dive to northbound Ray Gibbon Drive after the latter is twinned and upgraded to a freeway. [...] Ray Gibbon Drive is proposed as a major corridor that will carry the Highway2 designation in the future. [...] One kilometre {{further down the road}} at 137Avenue, grading was initially completed for a partial cloverleaf interchange but in 2008 Alberta elected not to spend $7million to complete paving of the ramps because development did not yet require it. St.Albert mayor Nolan Crouse was unhappy with the decision, stating that his city would not pay for it either. [...] "It's going to sit there until there's another plan, and right now we don't have a plan... we have taken the position that we think it's the province's responsibility, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> won't," [...] Crouse said. , there is no timeline for completion of the interchange.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Yale {{sought to}} recruit Fitzpatrick to return {{once again to}} that school. [...] At the time, one paper wrote: [...] "It is no {{exaggeration to say that}} today Fitzpatrick stands head and {{shoulders}} over every trainer in the country, just as Yost outshines rival football coaches. [...] And without Fitzpatrick, Yost could not produce the winning football teams he does." [...] A team from Yale visited Fitzpatrick in June 1905 but left Ann Arbor with the report that it was [...] "impossible to get Keene away from Michigan." [...] It was said: [...] "Keene is located there, with everything pleasant and just as he wants it, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> won't let him go and he says he can't come. [...] So Yale must give up hoping for him." [...] Fitzpatrick {{declined to comment on the}} offers and said, [...] "Ann Arbor is a good place to live in and I like the Michigan spirit." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have just}} been {{witnessing}} a remarkable play, here at the Burg Theatre in Vienna. I do not know of any play that much resembles it. In fact, {{it is such a}} departure from the common laws of the drama that the name 'play' doesn't seem to fit it quite snugly. However, whatever else it may be, it is in any case a great and stately metaphysical poem, and deeply fascinating. 'Deeply fascinating' is the right term: for the audience sat four hours and five minutes without thrice breaking into applause, except at the close of each act; sat rapt and silent--fascinated. This piece is 'The Master of Palmyra.' It is twenty years old; yet I doubt if you have ever heard of it. It is by Wilbrandt, and is his masterpiece and the work which is to make his name permanent in German literature. It has never been played anywhere except in Berlin and in the great Burg Theatre in Vienna. Yet whenever it is put on the stage it packs the house, and the free list is suspended. I know people who have seem it ten times; they know the most of it by heart; they do not tire of it; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> shall still be quite willing to go and sit under its spell whenever they get the opportunity.|$|E

Major Erasmus is very down-hearted about it. But the ordinary burghers hear nothing but lies; all lies, I tell you. (Crescendo) Look at the lies that have been told about us! Barbarians! savages! every name your papers have called us, but {{you know better than}} that now; you know how well we have treated you since you have been a prisoner; and look at the way your people have treated our prisoners--put them on board ship to make them sea-sick! Don't you call that cruel?' Here Gunning broke in {{that it was time for}} visitors to leave the prison. And so my strange guest, a feather blown along by the wind, without character or stability, a renegade, a traitor to his blood and birthplace, a time-server, had to hurry away. I took his measure; nor did his protestations of alarm excite my sympathy, and yet somehow I did not feel unkindly towards him; a weak man is a pitiful object in times of trouble. Some of our countrymen who were living in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State at the outbreak of the war have been placed in such difficult positions and torn by so many conflicting emotions that they must be judged very tolerantly. How few men are strong enough to stand against the prevailing currents of opinion! Nor, after the desertion of the British residents in the Transvaal in 1881, have we the right to judge their successors harshly if they have failed us, for it was Great and Mighty Britain who was the renegade and traitor then.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{numbers of}} Levantines are not clear. It is {{estimated}} that there are about 100-150 Levantines in Izmir. Another estimate put the number as hundreds. However, the number may be higher because of assimilation policies of Turkish nationalist-Kemalist governments, conversions to Islam because of the fear after the Greek and Armenian Genocides, or intermarriages.
