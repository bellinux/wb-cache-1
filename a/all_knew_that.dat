25|$|Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen, {{treasurer}} of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied {{to testify in}} the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change his mind. He told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, {{in order to maintain}} their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to keep the money advancements a secret, because they <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed any desire to be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after Verdens Gang broke the story.|$|E

500|$|The next session, {{according}} to John Payne, occurred {{early in the}} morning, {{but it did not}} work and nothing from this session worked for the final album. [...] "It just didn't happen'" [...] says Payne. [...] "It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create. I think {{that by the end of}} that session we <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> nothing was going to be used. They just said, let's forget it." [...] Jay Berliner was not available, so Barry Kornfeld was recruited [...] to play lead guitar in his place. According to Merenstein, there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours. [...] Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in [...] "two eight-hour sessions, plus two overdub sessions. That was the whole album." [...] In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as [...] 1 October and states that [...] "Only 'As Young Lovers Do' from this session would make the album" [...] contending that this is the reason for the different [...] "lounge-jazz sound" [...] on this track. Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album.|$|E

500|$|Both Huffington Post Crystal Bell and Washington Post Jen Chaney {{wanted to}} [...] "be honest" [...] about Vocal Adrenaline vs. New Directions in the competition: Bell said that Vocal Adrenaline [...] "put on the better show" [...] and Chaney wrote {{that they were}} [...] "better than New Directions": [...] "their dance moves were sharper and more in sync, and Unique's Minaj-esque {{magnetism}} factor sold the whole thing". VanDerWerff wrote that he [...] "could quibble that Vocal Adrenaline had stronger choreography overall" [...] or that he [...] "found Unique a more engaging performer than Rachel", but that as [...] "New Directions also used its whole ensemble better than Vocal Adrenaline did", he felt that [...] "either outcome seemed reasonable". Dodge simply stated, [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> New Directions would win and they'd get their happily ever after, but it was exciting to see it finally all play out." [...] Bell wrote that [...] "seeing the judges debate behind-the-scenes kind of takes away the entire title", though she appreciated Lohan's Freaky Friday reference. VanDerWerff said that the judging scene [...] "wasn't very good", and Votta described it as [...] "mostly waste". Futterman wrote that there was [...] "not really any emotion" [...] in Lohan's lines, though Strecker thought that the [...] "lines they gave her were pretty funny—if not a bit sad".|$|E
2500|$|Glover was {{an outspoken}} critic of George W. Bush, calling him a known racist. [...] "Yes, he's racist.

And {{most of the people who}} died were Afro-Americans or Hispanics." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1946 Miller was loaned out to Monogram Pictures. She {{played a}} model in the 1946 film noir, Suspense, where she appears as a party guest. Production ran mid-October–early December 1945. Around this time, Miller moved in the old Wallace Reid mansion in Coldwater Canyon, now {{converted}} into a boarding house for aspiring actresses known as [...] "The House of the Seven Garbos." [...] Among the boarders were Ruth Roman, Suzan Ball and Linda Christian. According to Doris Lilly, a former boarder and later society columnist, [...] "The dignity {{of the house in}} general was presided over and encouraged by Kristine Miller, who was blonde haired, high of cheekbone, grey eyed. Kristine had balance, she would check some of our madder impulses, kept us calm when that was necessary. Her manner was quiet and refined, and she had a way of touching a grubby coffeepot {{as if it were the}} tiara of the Empress Josephine. In spite of her reserve, we <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Kristine had a fine future for her somewhere, and we felt that she was an excellent actress." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{or not it}} was justified, {{the fact}} remains that {{distrust}} of Presley was common amongst the general African-American population after the accusations of racism were made public. According to George Plasketes, several songs by other performers came out after the singer's death which are a part of a [...] "demystification process as they portray Elvis as a racist". In his book, Colored White: Transcending the Racial Past, David Roediger considers contemporary [...] "wiggers" [...] (white kids [...] "acting Black") in light of the tensions in racial impersonation embodied by Elvis Presley. Chuck D and others have at one point or another publicly condemned Presley for [...] "stealing" [...] black music. However, in 2002, Chuck D, {{in an interview with the}} Associated Press in connection with the 25th Anniversary of Presley's death, explained how his feelings for Elvis' legacy were no longer those as originally suggested by the lyrics in [...] "Fight The Power", a song which he had written 12 years earlier. When [...] broadcast as a part of the NBC-produced documentary [...] "Elvis Lives", [...] Chuck D had the following to say about Presley. [...] "Elvis was a brilliant artist. As a musicologist—and I consider myself one—there was always a great deal of respect for Elvis, especially during his Sun sessions. As a black person, we <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that.</b> (In fact), Eminem is the new Elvis because, number one, he had the respect for black music that Elvis had".|$|E
