5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
25|$|His journey {{started when}} {{he studied the}} Qur'an in a literal way, and he slowly began to {{understand}} the principles lined in the religion. Then something happened to him in America to remove his doubts. He says; {{that while he was}} going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), and he saw the way the boat he was travelling in – was rocking in the huge sea – all under the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the whole of creation in front of him, and he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt {{felt that}} Tooke would be longest remembered, however, for his ideas about English grammar. By {{far the most}} popular English grammar of the early 19th century was that of Lindley Murray, and, in his typical method of {{criticism}} by antitheses, Hazlitt points out what he considers to be its glaring deficiencies {{compared to that of}} Tooke: [...] "Mr. Lindley Murray's Grammar ... confounds the genius of the English language, making it periphrastic and literal, instead of elliptical and idiomatic." [...] Murray, as well as other, earlier grammarians, often provided [...] "endless details and subdivisions"; Tooke, in his work commonly known by its alternate title of The Diversions of Purley, [...] "clears away the rubbish of school-boy technicalities, and strikes at the root of his subject." [...] Tooke's mind was particularly suited for his task, as it was [...] "hard, unbending, concrete, physical, half-savage ..." [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> [...] "language stripped of the clothing of habit or sentiment, or the disguises of doting pedantry, naked in its cradle, and in its primitive state." [...] That Murray's book should have been the grammar to have [...] "proceeded to [...] thirtieth edition" [...] and find a place in all the schools instead of [...] "Horne Tooke's genuine anatomy of the English tongue" [...] makes it seem, exclaims Hazlitt, [...] "as if there was a patent for absurdity in the natural bias of the human mind, and that folly should be stereotyped!".|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} {{difficulty}} that Leo breathed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>see</b> a dozen feet before him.|$|R
60|$|He {{moved to}} one side of the road, <b>and</b> waited. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the lights now, flying towards him.|$|R
60|$|Martin {{looked up}} at the sky, <b>and</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no birds now that the buzzards were all gone.|$|R
60|$|She started erect, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{her pale}} face glow with joy.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that she was {{inclined}} to believe him.|$|E
6000|$|She was keenly interested, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that the}} {{previous}} clash between them was already forgotten. Her disappointment was plain as she confessed: ...|$|E
60|$|This time Johnny turned <b>and</b> looked. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Reddy Fox turning somersaults {{and chasing}} his tail and rolling {{over and over}} in the little path.|$|R
60|$|He looked {{steadily}} {{at her for}} a moment, but her parasol {{had dropped}} a little upon his side <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her face.|$|R
60|$|Bob was right--a {{ship had}} struck. Away {{off through the}} mist <b>and</b> rain <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the colored lights and the flash of the gun, calling for help.|$|R
6000|$|Ojo {{unlatched}} {{the door}} and entered. It was very dark inside <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing at all. But the cat exclaimed: [...] "Why, there's no one here!" ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{conscious}} of an immense lassitude under his effort to be sarcastic. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that she had detected it with those steady, brilliant black eyes.|$|E
60|$|She went back, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her stoop till {{her head}} {{was close to the}} margin of the pool. She started up, and hastened back to his side.|$|E
60|$|Soames shrank back <b>and</b> stood where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{into the}} hall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we shall}} see each other again. Don't be worried." [...] He {{looked up at her}} with a smile, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> how forlornly she {{returned}} it.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was silent}} for a moment, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> {{the back of her head}} and its heavy brown coils. After a pause she asked abruptly, [...] "Where's your handkerchief?" ...|$|R
60|$|At last {{he began}} to come to himself and after a bit sat up to gaze about him. But all was dark <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> little or nothing.|$|E
60|$|Presently, however, {{he heard}} a light tap at his door, then the door opened slowly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the flash of Lady Arabella's white dress through the opening.|$|E
60|$|They {{were saying}} good-night; {{and he had}} to smirk and smile, and pretend--to her above all--that he was happy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that she knew it was pretence.|$|E
6000|$|Lemuel sat dumb <b>and</b> motionless. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{no way out}} of the net {{that had}} {{entangled}} him. He began feebly to repeat. [...] "There isn't anything," [...] when some one tried the door.|$|R
60|$|Berenice had leaned {{right back}} amongst the {{yielding}} cushions of her divan, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>see</b> her face. Yet {{her voice sounded}} to him strange <b>and</b> forced. <b>He</b> {{looked at her in}} some surprise.|$|R
60|$|For {{the life}} of him <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not tell whether she was pleased or disappointed. She had turned her {{shoulder}} to him. She was looking steadily out of the window, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her face.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{silent for}} a little, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her lips tremble and her tearless eyes burn with a feverish lustre. Then she pressed her {{forehead}} in both hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Mason," [...] she said, [...] "I {{hardly know}} how to do what I have undertaken." [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that she {{actually}} trembled as she spoke to him.|$|E
60|$|Here {{the view}} of the island and its {{vicinity}} was much extended, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> not only the bay where the Peacock had been at anchor, but also several other harbors.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2006 MTV Movie Awards, Borat {{introduced}} Gnarls Barkley's {{performance of}} [...] "Crazy", {{where he made}} a comment about Jessica Simpson, saying that he liked her mouth <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it clearly through her denim pants.|$|R
60|$|Smoke plunged around <b>and</b> by. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{the green}} lantern of Von Schroeder and, just below it, the red flare that marked his own team. Two men were {{guarding}} Schroeder's dogs, with short clubs interposed {{between them and}} the trail.|$|R
60|$|Then the woodchopper {{came and}} looked upon {{the face of}} Sir Ewaine, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> beheld that it was white like to death. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> that Sir Ewaine breathed, {{wherefore}} {{he thought that the}} wounded man was dead.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, {{the tree}} {{across the street}} {{appeared}} with dazzling brightness on his inner vision. It seemed to lurk just under his eyelids, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it whenever he wished.|$|E
60|$|The dark figures, {{stationary}} on the rocks, {{began to}} move, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that they were}} coming toward the house. He went indoors, {{so as not to}} appear to have been watching them.|$|E
60|$|Mr Birdsey was an {{intelligent}} man, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that Waterall's table-talk was {{for some reason}} getting upon Johnson's nerves. Like a good host, he endeavoured to cut in and make things smooth.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, his {{conscience}} {{was so strong}} within him, that {{when he reached the}} Castle he had almost made up his mind to tell his father everything. But just {{as he was about to}} enter the Lodge gate, he was touched on the arm by a female. [...] "Master Florian," [...] said the female, [...] "we is all in your hands." [...] It was now dark night, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not even <b>see</b> the woman's face. She seemed indeed to keep her face covered, <b>and</b> yet <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the gleam of her eyes. [...] "You're one of us now, Master Florian." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{brought out}} the nest, and held it so that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Rollo <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it.|$|R
60|$|Rollo looked up, {{but there}} was a curtain against the window, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> very well. He listened. He heard a low, moaning sound made by the wind, and a {{continuance}} of the sharp clicking which he had heard at first.|$|R
