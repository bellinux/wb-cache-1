5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> libretto. Because {{there are no}} curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{significant}} easing of the closure policy in 2010, {{the economy of}} Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels {{during the height of}} the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.|$|E

5|$|Ladislaus Löb {{writes that}} {{proposals}} and counter-proposals flew between Istanbul, London and Washington. The Jewish Agency and Brand wanted the Allies to string the Germans <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of slowing the deportations. The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, that offered $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral {{countries such as}} Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same. Rose writes that the agreement was intended only to give Brand something to take back to Budapest.|$|E

25|$|In his {{autobiography}} A Time to Heal, Ford wrote about a meeting {{he had with}} Nixon’s Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon’s staff thought were Nixon’s only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> impeachment process, to try and settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon’s staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.|$|E
25|$|A better {{solution}} came <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{form of the}} US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed like such a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The {{main task}} is {{monitoring}} all ship traffic <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mandated zone {{with the goal}} of detecting irregularities. A primary goal is to avoid accidents through communication with relevant ships and taking necessary actions. NOR VTS is responsible for dispatching the five tugboats which make up the State Emergency Tow Response Service. It is also responsible for issuing extreme weather warnings, as well as coordinating messages in Navarea XIX. This covers the waters between Greenland and the Norway–Russia border north of the 65th parallel north. NOR VTS also records statistics on traffic, including single-hull tankers. The VTS retains information exchange with Iceland and a mutual notification of acute pollution with Russia. The center is manned around the clock.|$|E

25|$|Before {{getting married}} Jonathan {{and his first}} wife had {{regularly}} visited Las Vegas, drawn to the city's live entertainment scene. When the Canadian real estate market collapsed in 2008 they moved there that December. The recession was further <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S., and Jonathan saw an opportunity to buy cheap properties while pursuing his career as an illusionist. Convincing J.D. to come with them, they made their home in the nearby suburb of Summerlin, Nevada. Jonathan opened a third branch of Scott Real Esate and, considering the depressed market, switched to leasing properties, but for only 80-percent of the market rates to help renters who were recovering from the ongoing recession.|$|E
25|$|As this is {{a sacred}} ceremony, people are {{typically}} reluctant to discuss it in any great detail. Given {{a long history of}} cultural misappropriation, indigenous people are suspicious that non-Natives may abuse or misuse the traditional ways. Elders and medicine men are concerned that the ceremony should only be passed <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right ways. The words used at a sun dance are often in the native language and are not translated for outsiders. Not talking about this ceremony is part of the respect the people display for it. In addition, the detailed way in which a respected elder speaks, teaches, and explains a sun dance to younger members of the tribe is unique and not easily quoted, nor is it intended for publication.|$|E
25|$|Theatrical {{evolution}} continued, sometimes tied to {{the lives}} and deaths of royal patrons. Queen Anne's Men disbanded {{with the death of}} Anne of Denmark in 1619; the accession of a new queen in 1625 saw the creation of Queen Henrietta's Men. Occasionally there were other new companies like Beeston's Boys, and new theatres like the Salisbury Court. The two prolonged closings of the London theatres due to plague, in 1625 and 163637, caused significant disruption in the acting profession, with companies breaking apart, combining and re-combining, and switching theatres, in a dizzying confusion. (Only the King's Men were exempt.) Political suppressions also came <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Stuart era, though they affected only single offending companies until a general political suppression closed the theatres from 1642 to 1660, and brought the age of English Renaissance theatre to its end.|$|E

25|$|At this time, John Canan and Ralph Kilbourne {{went back}} to Joseph Gale and {{reminded}} him of his promise to assist on the project and serve as captain once they got further <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building. Gale then went and inspected the ship to determine if it would be seaworthy, and after determining it was, he went home and sold his farm and farming equipment. After moving his family to Champoeg, Oregon, Gale then devoted much of the next year to completing the vessel. On May 19, 1841 the partially completed vessel was launched and moved up the Willamette River to near Oregon City. In the fall of 1841, George Davis and Henry Woods dropped out of the project, which reduced the number of partners to five. Kilbourne and Gale did most of the remaining work, while Thomas J. Hubbard did the blacksmithing.|$|E
25|$|Despite these gains, women’s {{academic}} {{careers in}} Europe remain characterized by strong {{vertical and horizontal}} segregation. In 2010, although female students (55%) and graduates (59%) outnumbered male students, men outnumbered women at the PhD and graduate levels (albeit by a small margin). Further <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> research career, women represented 44% of grade C academic staff, 37% of grade B academic staff and 20% of grade A academic staff.11 These trends are intensified in science, with women making up 31% {{of the student population}} at the tertiary level to 38% of PhD students and 35% of PhD graduates. At the faculty level, they make up 32% of academic grade C personnel, 23% of grade B and 11% of grade A. The proportion of women among full professors is lowest in engineering and technology, at 7.9%. With respect to representation in science decision-making, in 2010 15.5% of higher education institutions were headed by women and 10% of universities had a female rector.|$|E
