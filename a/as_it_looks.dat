25|$|Mill No.5, {{which had}} the smelter attached, was {{completed}} by 1822. The smelting house (shown here <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> today) had two furnaces. There was a reverberatory furnace —the large squared block in the foreground was part of this; and an older-style blast furnace, similar in design to a blowing house, but with a unique flue running up the hillside behind to a short stack. The two large standing and three fallen granite blocks towards {{the back of the}} building are the remains of this furnace.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} origins of Hercules are {{undoubtedly}} Greek his figure underwent an early assimilation into Italic local religions and might even preserve traces of an association to Indoiranian deity Trita Apya that in Greece have not survived. Among other roles that Juno and Hercules share there is {{the protection of the}} newborn. Jean Bayet, author of Les origines de l'Arcadisme romain, has argued that such a function must be a later development <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to have superseded that of the two original Latin gods Picumnus and Pilumnus.|$|E
25|$|The {{trademark}} Volvo (which is Latin for I roll) {{was first}} registered by SKF on 11 May 1915 {{with the intention}} {{to use it for}} a special series of ball bearing for the American market but it was never used for this purpose (however in the application for the trademark, it was also designated for the purpose of automobiles). The SKF trademark <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> today was used instead for all the SKF-products. Some pre-series of Volvo-bearings stamped with the brand name 'Volvo' were manufactured but never released to the market, and it was not until 1927 that the trademark was used again, now as a trademark and company name for an automobile.|$|E

Supporters from all over {{went down to the}} lanes to show and bolster the call for Reformasi, which was driven by Anwar Ibrahim. Gigantic and exceptional demonstrations occurred in Kuala Lumpur and other major cities.

25|$|In a move {{to expand}} new export {{opportunities}} that attract employment and diversify Mexico's crucial export sector away from excessive dependence on the US market, Mexico also expanded its trade accords beyond the US borders and sought to increase trade with the European Union, East Asia and Latin America. It was hoped that new infrastructure would help diversify Mexico's economy and improve stability in years to come. One new cooperative accord between major Latin American nations on the Pacific coast, called PaCiFiCa by the Economist, has helped to isolate the participating nations {{from some of the}} fluctuations stemming from the European debt crisis <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> towards greater trade with Asian nations. Mexico maintains positive trading relationships and trade discussions throughout the world so as to make Mexico an open economy with a growing number of trade opportunities for all regions of Mexico and aided by new infrastructure.|$|E

Electronic Gaming Monthly said the game sounds as [...] "beautiful" [...] <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks.</b> GameSpot said it [...] "expertly uses audio {{to push the}} story along" [...] and noted {{that many of the}} games' tracks [...] "include voice or {{chanting}} and all are appropriately uppity or low with the game's mood", but said there were many areas with silence or ambience making the [...] "game's soundtrack a tad sparse." [...] Xenogears was the first Square game to feature voice overs and anime cut scenes. Electronic Gaming Monthly said they are [...] "some of the slickest animation cinemas" [...] they have seen. Game Revolution praised the [...] "absolutely spectacular and stunning" [...] hand-drawn anime cut-scenes, but stated that they were sparse and poorly synched with the voice acting.|$|E
500|$|The PC {{version of}} Incoming was {{generally}} well-received. British magazine PC Zone {{described it as}} [...] "bloody good," [...] with [...] "some modest simulation elements." [...] The magazine praised {{the setting of the}} game, commenting: [...] "a refreshing change from the deep space of most futuristic combat sims, and something which definitely has a positive effect on gameplay." [...] The review concluded by saying that [...] "it's as fun <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks.</b> Just for once, all those people who don't read reviews and buy games purely on the strength of pretty pictures on the packaging are gonna find themselves playing a very, very enjoyable game." [...] Edge highlighted the game's efficient gameplay mechanics, stating that designers [...] "managed to produce something more than a lightshow, taking care to fine-tune a design that, if not exactly original, at least does its thing with flair and solid understanding of gameplay." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ballad of a Thin Man" [...] {{is driven}} by Dylan's piano, which {{contrasts}} with [...] "the spooky organ riffs" [...] played by Al Kooper. Marqusee describes the song as one of [...] "the purest songs of protest ever sung", <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> at the media and its inability to understand both the singer and his work. He writes that the song became the anthem of an in-group, [...] "disgusted by the old, excited by the new... elated by their discovery of others who shared their feelings", with its refrain [...] "Something is happening here/ But you don't know what it is/ Do you, Mr Jones?" [...] epitomizing the [...] "hip exclusivity" [...] of the burgeoning counterculture. Robert Shelton describes the song's central character, Mr Jones, as [...] "one of Dylan's greatest archetypes", characterizing him as [...] "a Philistine... superficially educated and well bred but not very smart {{about the things that}} count".|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of the film was the poor quality of its {{animation}}. Berardinelli called it {{some of the worst}} CGI animation in memory. He felt that the characters looked plastic, considered the backgrounds dull, and wrote, [...] "On more than one occasion, I thought I was watching something made for TV. When compared to today's visual standards for animated films, Hoodwinked is far below the curve." [...] Burr considered the film's surfaces poorly rendered and compared them to [...] "Teletubbieland reupholstered with Naugahyde." [...] Westbrook felt that the animation worked well for the animal characters, but wrote, [...] "the humans have a glassy sheen and brittle hardness, much like work done {{in the early days of}} CG... That art has come too far to embrace a throwback like Hoodwinked as lovably quaint. It's simply dated." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post compared the characters to rubber toys, and wrote, [...] "their faces are without nuance or vividness... In movement, especially, do they lack grace and conviction. It seems like the recent breakthroughs in computerized magic have bypassed the poor Edwards fellows, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> stuck somewhere in the 1970s, or maybe even earlier." ...|$|E
500|$|A second {{important}} {{event in the}} development of hip-hop was the start of hip-hop dance instruction. Buddha Stretch was a pioneer in this field. He started teaching formal hip-hop dance classes in 1989 at Broadway Dance Center in New York City. Around the same time, hip-hop party dancing started to appear in music videos and on television—this was another important point in the development and commercialization of hip-hop. An early example of this is when Janet Jackson performed the Running Man in her 1989 music video for the song [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] which was choreographed by street dancer Anthony Thomas. The dance was so popular during this time it was also performed by 1990s rappers MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice in their choreographed routines. Michael Jackson also used hip-hop in his 1992 music video [...] "Remember The Time" [...] which was choreographed by a then 21-year-old Fatima Robinson. At the time, Robinson was a street dancer with no formal training and [...] "Remember the Time" [...] was her first music video job. According to MTV.com, [...] "Dances have always been a part of hip-hop culture — from the running man to the Soulja Boy dance..." [...] and this era was the start of commercial hip-hop choreography <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> today: dance routines are not specific to one genre (strictly popping, strictly locking, or strictly breaking) but rather an [...] of urban party dancing with studio technique added to it.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

In one contrast, q and Q, there is an actual case-sensitive pair {{representing}} two different consonants.
