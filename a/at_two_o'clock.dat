5|$|In 1981 Icke {{became a}} sports {{presenter}} for the BBC's national programme, Newsnight, which {{had begun the}} previous year. Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on {{the first edition of}} the BBC's Breakfast Time, British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news for them until 1985, which meant getting up <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning five days a week. In the summer of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted Grandstand, at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme. He also published his first book that year, It's a Tough Game, Son!, about how to break into football.|$|E

Gouverneur Morris gave the eulogy at his funeral and secretly established a fund to support his widow and children. Hamilton was buried in the Trinity Churchyard Cemetery in Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> to fit in work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.|$|E
5|$|The French advance {{drove in}} the British skirmishers {{and reached the}} sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line {{formation}} for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way {{under the pressure of}} numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French 45e Ligne burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E

After rolling downhill, Epps {{took off and}} flew around 100 yards (90 metres) at a maximum {{altitude}} of around 50 feet (15 metres). The flight ended in a crash, but made Epps Georgia's first aviator. In 1949, Lola Trammel told The Atlanta Journal Magazine that Epps had already made a successful flight in the machine prior to the public demonstration, testing the machine by moonlight {{with the help of}} friends <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning.|$|E
25|$|On the {{day before}} Operation Weserübung, which started the German {{occupation}} of Norway on 8 April 1940, warning was received by the airport commander, Harald Normann. The aircraft were evacuated from the airport and camouflaged. At the time the airport was covered in snow, forcing the aircraft to use skis. A large shipment of the airport's technical equipment had just been shipped to Sola Air Station, which was unsuccessfully attempted recalled. <b>At</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{in the morning of}} 9 April the aircraft were commanded to fly to Steinsfjorden at sunrise.

25|$|In Larache {{the coup}} started <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{in the morning}} of July 18.

By mid-morning the only remaining centres of resistance were the High Commissioner's residence and the air force base at Tetuán (Base de Hidroaviones del Atalayon). The rebels threatened to bomb both and after a few hours the defenders surrendered to the Nationalists; all of them were executed, among them the High Commissioner and the Major de la Puente Bahamonde (Francisco Franco's cousin). The same day, the workers of Tetúan and Melilla attempted a general strike, but were crushed by the insurgent troops.|$|E

25|$|<b>At</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> the {{vehicles}} with D.

While approaching Benfica the king liberated the municipal guard squad that escorted him {{so that they could}} join the fight against the rebels. The escort arrived in Mafra at around four o'clock in the afternoon, but then discovered a problem: due to the holidays, the Practical School contained only 100 soldiers, as opposed to the 800 that were expected, and the person in charge, Colonel Pinto da Rocha, admitted to not having the means to protect the king. In the meantime, Counsellor João de Azevedo Coutinho arrived and advised the king to call to Mafra the queens D. Amélia and D. Maria Pia (respectively, the king's mother and grandmother), who were in the palaces of Pena and Vila in Sintra, and to prepare to continue on to Porto, where they would organise a resistance.|$|E
25|$|On 2 December, orders came {{to move on}} to Trier Airfield, on the Moselle, {{about sixty}} miles from Preutin. The {{squadron}} flew their Salmsons on the receipt of the news. Bad weather {{for the next few days}} slowed the move, however, the work of moving the squadron nevertheless went on, no easy job, as it was a two-day haul. It was at Trier that the 91st had its first opportunity to fly German aircraft turned over to the Allies, and for taking rides in the Fokker or the Pfaltz became a popular pastime. Christmas Day we spent at Trier, the second Christmas in Europe for the squadron, and not by any means a bad day. No one had home comforts as Christmas stockings, but the atmosphere at the dinner given in the hangar by the men <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock,</b> to which all the officers originally in the squadron were invited, was cheerful if not warm. The menu was excellent, and the tree in the center of the hangar was decorated as they were at home, made everyone happy (or homesick, as the case may be), just to look at if.|$|E

500|$|In August 1911 Mohun {{returned}} to his home at Royal Oak, Maryland to recover from wounds he had received during his twenty years service in Africa.

500|$|To {{give the}} Odyssey an unnatural ghostship feeling of solitude, many wide angle shots and VisFX matte {{extension}} were used with no additional music. Robert C. Cooper often {{listened to the}} CCR song [...] "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?" [...] during {{the making of the}} episode and decided to play it over the first montage, showing the passage of time. The tone of the second montage was set with a cello. Stargate composer Joel Goldsmith later accompanied the hand movements of the hired cellist with different music during post-production. A third montage was filmed but not included in the final cut of the episode since the last table scene already supplied the needed sentiment. Each time period included the same shots to help the audience focus on the differences that characters have gone through. The last scene at Stargate Command was the last filmed Stargate SG-1 scene, shot <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, for which every member of the crew came back.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Tilson was the rector of Ditton from 1679–1702 {{and was in}} {{correspondence}} with the Protestant cleric Richard Baxter.

While on her death bed, <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, she appeared as an apparition to a nurse in Rochester, some nine miles away, where her children were being looked after. It had been the dying woman's wish to see her children before she died {{but she had been}} persuaded not to travel because of her ill health. Baxter included this account in his subsequent book The Certainty of the Worlds of the Spirits published in the same year. Tilson died in 1750 and his memorial in St. Peter's AD Vincula Church records a bequest he made to the poor of [...] "£100 in money, the yearly produce to be distributed annually on the feasts of All Saints and the Purification, in wood and wheat" [...] (see inscription in photograph).|$|E
