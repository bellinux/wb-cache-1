50|$|The Greek locution Dialegein synthesizes a theoretic set of {{axiological}} investigations, {{corresponding to}} a unified epistemic methodology which embraces Cultural Hermeneutics, specifically Aesthetics and Ethics.

Intentionality and CognitionFirstly, Marc Jean-Bernard seeks to provide a philosophical account of cognitive sciences {{in the field of}} culture. The extension of research in Philosophy of Mind and Continental Philosophy assigns a theoretical imperative to ethical and cultural investigations, in order to grammatically fix the amphibology of explanation. In contrast to the anti-functionalism and anti- physicalism of phenomenology and hermeneutics, his research on intentionality and subjectivity induces a deep revision of the dichotomy between the transcendental and <b>analytical</b> <b>accounts</b> of phenomenology. He starts with a clear grammar of the term intentionality, unifying its phenomenological and cognitive meaning. Then, a non reductive perspective on Mind and Psychism examines cognitive intentionality (representational consciousness of cognition) and affective intentionality (non representational consciousness and non affective connaturality), following both the phenomenological description of consciousness and the legacy of Wittgenstein’s investigations on perception, knowledge and psychology.|$|E

30|$|Hence, it is {{difficult}} to dispute that the existing FRP literature often overlooks interdependence. It disregards how FRPs affect one another across national boundaries and how prior choices in one socio-political context can influence posterior choices in another socio-political context (cf. Bayes’ theorem). This implies FRP literature can be described as systematically biased in favour of a state of structural independence between FRPs. In other words, most <b>analytical</b> <b>accounts</b> of the FRP phenomenon (regardless of their scope) rely on a hypothesis of developmental independence, either {{in the form of a}} simplifying assumption or an unspecified theorisation.|$|E

30|$|These {{existing}} research efforts are admirable {{and serve as}} initial incentives to go further and resume scientific developments. This critical reflection contributes to the debate by providing {{an indication of the}} unlikely nature of the independence hypothesis, and aspires to stimulate future research to explicitly and formally incorporate interdependence between FRPs as part of the explanation of FRP development. In an effort to analyse FRP development more accurately and comprehensively, this study proposes that any and all <b>analytical</b> <b>accounts</b> of FRP development should not be restricted to the analysis of independent FRPs or an autonomous phenomenon, but should also include trans-national dynamics. Furthermore, this critical reflection implies such dynamics can most accurately be described by trans-national diffusion patterns.|$|E
