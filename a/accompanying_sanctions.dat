40|$|In {{this article}} I discuss {{different}} ways of conceptualising the relation between liberty and law. By ‘law’ I refer throughout to law {{in the sense of}} civil law: rules with <b>accompanying</b> <b>sanctions,</b> promulgated by a legislator for the regulation of action in political society. I do not intend to say anything about ‘natural law’, unless I explicitly state otherwise. For the purposes of my argument I will loosely group the positions I discuss under different labels: ‘liberty from the law’, ‘liberty by the law’, and ‘liberty under law’. There is nothing self-serving about these labels; indeed, they may appear simplistic and historically inept. I use them to direct our attention and in order to illustrate a general point that I wish to make, a point that seems to me to fall out of the preceeding discussion. That point is that concepts like liberty are institution dependent and that we cannot hope to understand or even talk about what they mean without adhering to that fact. To anticipate, I will argue that even when liberty is understood in terms of the absence of law, the presence of law or the possibility of its presence will have to be assumed in principle in order for its absence to make sense...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the number}} of {{conditions}} attached to claiming UK unemployment benefits (Jobseeker’s Allowance [JSA]/Universal Credit) and {{the severity of the}} <b>accompanying</b> <b>sanctions</b> for non-compliance have increased over recent decades. Whether or not one welcomes this development depends upon several considerations, notably one’s ideological position and what one believes works effectively in practice. Recent Labour and Conservative-led governments have argued that the tougher measures are necessitated by a widespread lack of commitment to employment among unemployed claimants – an argument that is seemingly contradicted by much empirical evidence. In this paper I look critically at existing evidence on the employment commitment of unemployed people and summarise my own empirical findings. I argue that social policy researchers have neglected two issues: 1. Job quality – while it is well established empirically {{that the vast majority of}} unemployed people want employment, little attention has been paid to their level of ‘choosiness’, in terms of the jobs they are willing to undertake; 2. The accuracy of first-hand accounts of unemployment – there has been a tendency to accept uncritically the statements made by unemployed claimants about their own commitment to employment, accompanied by a far more critical treatment of views expressed by professionals who work alongside claimants. All three of my studies investigated ‘choosiness’, and one of the three consisted of interviews with people employed in the welfare-to-work industry. Reflecting upon my findings, I conclude that while there remains little evidence to support the view that a separate ‘dependency culture’ exists among benefit claimants, the connection between ‘choosiness’ and periods of unemployment is perhaps far greater than social policy accounts usually imply...|$|E

The rites and ceremonies which he instituted seem puerile to us, but they were full of meaning and of efficacy in the view of those who performed them. There was, for example, a class of religious functionaries called augurs, whose office it was to interpret the divine will by means of certain curious indications which it was their special profession to understand. There were three of these augurs, and they were employed on all public occasions, both in peace and war, to ascertain from the omens whether the enterprise or the work in regard to which they were consulted was or was not favored by the councils of heaven. If the augury was propitious the work was entered upon with vigor and confidence. If otherwise, it was postponed or abandoned.|$|R

Meanwhile, in its development, imprisonment as a state facility of confinement for conficted criminals has got harsh critisicm from many legal exerts. A lot of criticism directed against this kind of criminal forfeiture is the independence, both seen from the effectiveness as well as the views of other negative consequences <b>accompanying</b> the <b>sanction.</b> In the concept of the draft of the new Criminal Code of 1982, it is filed a new criminal sanction, i. e. a sanction of supervision {{as an alternative to the}} imprisonment. Imprisonment and supervision or criminal scrutiny is in fact two concepts that are philosophically opposed, because on the one hand, imprisonment needs a convicted person imprisoned inside the institution, and on the other hand the criminal supervision requires the convicted person undergoing outside the institution (in the community), but remains under supervision. The two opposing concepts cause particular consequenses, either weaknesses or advantages. In order to compensate the weaknesses, it is needed a kind of criminal sanction as a balance between imprisonment and supervision. A limited imprisonment is a kind of imprisonment which is expected to achieve a balance between the interests of protection or security of society and the interests of the individual. Furthermore, it can be compromised or exploit the positive impacts (the opposite also means avoiding negative impacts) from imprisonment on the onehand and criminal supervision on the other hand...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Organisational {{culture is}} one of the most {{essential}} ingredients of every organisation and yet most of the misapplied in organisations in South Africa. It drives the organisations to be relevant or irrelevant to their society/ies where they establish themselves; and influence the human resources favourably or unfavourably towards job satisfaction or job dissatisfaction. The productivity of every organisation depends heavily on the role that the human resources play. There is therefore good correspondence between satisfied employees and good productivity; dissatisfied employees and poor productivity; productive company and progressive cultures, which enhance everybody such as Ubuntu. This study judges from a theoretical perspective the relevance of organisational culture and its influence to organisational strategy. It highlights to organisations that culture is paramount to all the activities of the organisations, involving the organisations, the employees, and the society. Organisations cannot avoid cultural connotations, as they can place the organisation favourably or unfavourably to the society; and can cause dissatisfaction or satisfaction to the employees. When an organisation satisfies its customers and is deemed favourable, it goes without saying that it will be a productive and successful organisation. The responsibility to introduce a progressive organisational culture involves the government, employers, employees, trade unions and the society. The government has already institutionalised labour relations Acts, affirmative Act, Skills development Act, new tendering Act to promote equity and force organisations in South Africa, which outlaw discrimination, promote equity and force organisations in South Africa to change their culture. These Acts are <b>accompanied</b> by <b>sanctions,</b> which must be meted to all defaulting organisations. However, employers face a daunting challenge to drive their organisations in manners that will ensure that there is empowerment of all the disadvantaged groups; their organisations to adapt to new South Africa and promote job satisfaction, if their organisations are to be productive...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the attitudes, perceptions, expectations {{and experience of}} menopause among women in New Zealand. It is based on focus groups and in-depth interviews with women aged thirty and above in the Feilding-Manawatu district and on narratives provided by respondents residing throughout the country. Additional information was collected from general practitioners, and readily accessible menopause educational programmes and material were also examined. The aim was to explore the social construction and individual experience of menopause with {{particular attention to the}} relation between the deficiency disease model and common sense knowledge about this life event. A constructivist/interpretive theoretical perspective was employed that recognises the socially constructed nature of menopause experience and accepts normative definitions of the feminine as crucial to social perception and individual experience. Contrary to the medical view of menopause as a disease of hormone deficiency, the women maintained a common sense perception of this event as a normal, natural life-stage. Overall, their knowledge of physiological processes was limited and reflected the impact of medicalisation. Three central meanings associated with menopause were identified as mid-life and ageing, loss of fertility and health risk. Control of the menopausal body (the body politic) emerged as the central aspect of experience across the four age groups of women who defined themselves as 'in' or 'through' menopause. Against a tradition of taboo surrounding matters of female reproductive functioning and sexuality, the mechanisms or strategies of control have changed over time. There has been a shift from a strategy of stoicism (among those aged sixty and above) to the use of 'natural' strategies and hormone replacement therapy (commonly adopted by women in their fifties and forties). Each of these strategies was a response to common sense understanding of this event and <b>accompanying</b> social <b>sanctions.</b> Two broad conclusions were reached. First, that the deficiency disease model presents a linear, causal explanation of menopause which fails to recognise medical knowledge as part of the broader socio-cultural and historical processes which give meaning to this event. Second, that as women's experience of menopause occurs at the interface of socio-cultural, historical and physiological processes, the meanings of menopause are fluid and change over time...|$|R
40|$|Low {{sanctions}} can initially {{appear to}} be a mitigating factor for unjust or inefficient laws, but this perception is likely wrong. This Article argues that low sanctions may have a pernicious effect on the democratic process and on legislative rule making because, as both public choice theory and historical precedent suggest, the laws <b>accompanying</b> these <b>sanctions</b> are more likely to perpetuate themselves and become part of the unquestioned background fabric of society. This Article focuses on intellectual property law (in particular, copyright) and examines the progression of suboptimal laws through widespread low sanctions that may mostly escape the public eye until sanctions then grow to more significant size. In intellectual property, as elsewhere, low-level sanctions coupled with problematic laws are less likely than their high-sanction counterparts {{to attract the attention of}} the media and lead to political action. This Article makes several claims about low sanctions. The first is that low sanctions increase the likelihood that a problematic law will be passed. Second, low sanctions decrease the odds that such a law will be repealed. Third, unjust laws with low sanctions bear the risk that the sanctions will (sometimes gradually) rise, and thus reduce any upsides that accompany the initial low level of the sanctions. By the time this occurs, it may prove an irreversible change because it is more difficult to abolish a law than to prevent its initial passage. The media plays a key role in these processes when it focuses on the identifiable victims of high sanctions and fails to pay attention to the statistical victims of low sanctions. Last, whether sanctions for single offenses are high or low, prosecutors can accumulate counts in a way that significantly intimidates alleged offenders with sometimes dramatic consequences. This practice was visible in the recent stories about computer coder and Internet activist Aaron Swartz 2 ̆ 7 s prosecution and suicide. Examples from intellectual property and other legal areas should encourage us to take a closer look at existing or proposed legislation that appears harmless enough at first glance due to its low sanctions or lack of enforcement...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} {{successes and failures}} of a community-driven development project, São José Agrário (SJA), conducted in Northeastern Brazil. The project was co-funded by the World Bank and the State of Ceará and co-directed by a social movement (the Landless Workers Movement, MST) and the State of Ceará. The dissertation employs a mixed methods approach based on eight case studies, a census survey of six communities, and interviews {{with a wide variety}} of actors connected to the project. I address the problem of elite capture, either by non-targeted communities or by an elite within the targeted communities disproportionately benefiting from projects. Case study communities met project targeting criteria. I found no evidence of elite capture of project funds or subproject benefits in the case studies. I then evaluate the free rider problem. The settlers, for the most part, overcame problems of free riding in both their collective work and in the SJA subprojects. Solving the challenges of free riding depended on the community and collective work institutions, such as clear, enforceable rules, monitoring, and graduated <b>sanctions.</b> <b>Accompanying</b> groups, such as the Landless Workers 2 ̆ 7 Movement, agricultural workers 2 ̆ 7 unions, local and state governments, and technical agencies assisted in preventing or resolving free riding problems. I found that even when the problems of elite capture and free riding were avoided, three of the eight subprojects I studied had failed, and one had been suspended for two years. I trace the source of subproject failure to problems of subproject design. First, subprojects required a greater skill set and knowledge base than the participants had. Power differentials between the participants and the private actors created dependency and allowed for participants to be taken advantage of rather than creating empowerment. Second, the duration of technical assistance for productive subprojects was too short and private technical agencies sometimes provided low-quality subprojects. Third, participants had little ability to accurately forecast their costs and benefits of subproject participation, resulting in subproject attrition...|$|R

And so he could put the proposition in the form already mentioned: there was Christ's Gospel persecuted in the two kingdoms by one anomalous power; plainly, then, the [...] "regiment of women" [...] was Antichristian. Early in 1558 he communicated this discovery to the world, by publishing at Geneva his notorious book--"The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women."[65] ...|$|R
40|$|Marine resources, {{so crucial}} to the {{countries}} of the South, are being over-exploited. Regulatory measures have been put in place, but must be accompanied by close surveillance of fishing vessels to be effective. Positive examples do exist, and these should be developed. June 11, 2005, saw a confrontation in Senegal between fishermen from Kayar and Guet-Ndar. The toll: one dead and several wounded. The cause of the dispute: rivalry over access to an increasingly scarce resource fish. Incidents of this kind are symptomatic of a serious problem. In August 2003, Spore sounded a cautionary note, urging the introduction of extensive political and economic changes if fish stocks were to be maintained. In March 2005, FAO confirmed that 75 % of fishery resources had been fished to their maximum yield, over-exploited or exhausted. Encouragingly, there is growing awareness of the need to move towards sustainable fisheries management, which combines long-term viability with a strategy that satisfies the needs of fishers and ensures the economic development of resources. This has translated into a growing understanding, shared by all those involved, and in a range of measures, binding or otherwise, developed to regulate fishing. But there {{is still a long way}} to go before responsible and voluntary management of marine resources is adopted by all players in the fisheries sector. As long as stocks are over-exploited, and their profits diminished, fishers will continue to break the law. That was the clear message from several participants in an internet debate organised by CTA in 2004. Crucial for ACP states The problem of fisheries surveillance is gradually being perceived as a major issue. Experts are coming up with acronyms such as IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing), MCS (monitoring, control and surveillance) and VMS (vessel monitoring system). In June 2005, a conference on the impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on developing countries was held in London. These developing nations are particularly badly affected, the meeting heard, because of a lack of funds, technical capacity, manpower, cooperation between states and, occasionally, of political will. Look out, fishers on patrol In an effort to reduce the number of conflicts between industrial and small-scale fishers, sparked by the incursion of trawlers into the zone reserved for small-scale fishing, a community surveillance project was set up in Guinea in 2002 (see Spore 110). It aimed to lower the number of trawlers by teaming up the institutions charged with coastal surveillance with the fishing communities themselves. According to Hassimiou Tall, technical advisor to the Ministry for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Guinea, the results have been very encouraging. The programme has succeeded in reducing illegal incursions by industrial trawlers by 60 % as crews now know that some small-scale fishers are working for the authorities. Relatively inexpensive (US$ 20, 000 less than 16, 500) and holding considerable promise, the Guinean experiment is due to be extended to Congo, Gabon and Mauritania. But in Guinea itself, the pilot project has been (provisionally?) suspended, due to lack of funds. More proof, if it were needed, that good ideas are not enough, unless they are backed up by adequate resources. The countries of the South are not alone. Published last May, the European Commission s annual report on serious breaches to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy revealed that the number of infringements recorded rose from 6, 756 in 2002 to 9, 502 in 2003. Five EU member states detected nearly 90 % of all breaches. Unauthorised fishing accounted for 22 % of the cases, while the figure for unlicensed fishing was 17 %. A fine was imposed in 84 % of cases. In 4, 720 cases, fishing gear was seized. The June 2005 bulletin of the Fisheries News Update section on CTA s Agritrade website concluded that the report offered interesting lessons for ACP countries, noting that greater transparency over infringements and sanctions will increase confidence in the fair and equitable enforcement of regulations. Fisheries infringements come in many guises, they include: fishing with unlicensed boats; and failing to land catches in local ports, in spite of the obligations of fisheries agreements and falsely reporting tonnage caught. Whatever the measures taken, whether they are aimed at getting fishing zones respected, at better regulating fishing gear, at limiting the size of catches, at guaranteeing a biological rest period or at developing the economic activity of ports by making it mandatory to land all or part of catches locally, the notion of self-regulation appears to be an illusory one, and control measures are certainly needed. Some of these are already in place, and fall into two groups so-called hardware and software measures. Means and human resources Hardware measures consist of advanced and often costly and cumbersome techniques, such as radar, onboard systems and satellite. To monitor an economic zone of 200 square miles, it takes several rapid intervention boats, surveillance vessels, radar stations and even airplanes. And, of course, a computer system capable of cross checking data, with permanent internet access. For ACP countries, it is hard to reconcile such demands with budgetary constraints. These systems are essential, but they are also inadequate unless they are backed by human resources. The software techniques refer to onboard observers or the participation of fishing communities. Officially, any such observers go onboard to collect scientific data. But since they are equipped with communication tools, their information is by default used for surveillance. They run the risk therefore, if this aspect of their work were to be known, of no longer being allowed on board. Senegal s fishing committees By limiting their catches and adopting good practices, the fishers of Kayar, in Senegal, have enabled fish stocks to be replenished. A local initiative, surveillance committees see to it that this Kayar code is respected. Fishing zones have been defined and a limit imposed of 45 kg of fish per canoe per day. Highly destructive techniques such as the use of explosives or drag nets have been banned. These days, catches are smaller, but they fetch a better price. Not surprisingly, this initiative has quickly spread throughout Senegal s main fishing zones since 2001, around 50 local committees have been created. But the incidents of June 11 show that not all fishers are ready to take the idea on board. The presence of onboard observers is crucial for providing independent information on fishing activities, both on a daily and a case-by-case basis, the CTA online debate concluded. But to be effective, such methods depend on the inspectors receiving adequate training and payment, as Ms Janet Uronu, joint president for fisheries at the Ministry for Natural Resources and Tourism in Tanzania pointed out, The high levels of technology (and the principles on which it is based) to be found on modern fishing vessels were well beyond the comprehension of those fishery officers sent to inspect the vessels. The job of these inspectors also carries risks: vulnerability to corruption, especially if they are poorly paid, violence and the risk of being taken hostage, to prevent them from reporting what they have seen. A number of experiments closely linking fishing communities with surveillance operations have been carried out in West Africa. After all, the fishermen know the fishing grounds better than anyone. However, while these initiatives have produced positive results, they also raise the question of motivation the fishers are simultaneously acting as inspectors and stakeholders. This approach effectively establishes that small-scale fishers are also responsible for the over-exploitation of resources. A culture of change None of these methods will work unless at least two conditions are met. First, there must be clear rules about what is and is not allowed, <b>accompanied</b> by <b>sanctions</b> which are properly enforced. Secondly, there needs to be regional cooperation between countries facing the same problem. That is true for the North: on March 14, 2005, the EU Fisheries Council finally agreed to establish a Community Fisheries Control Agency, based in Vigo, Spain which should coordinate fishing control systems within community waters, but also an important point for ACP countries within the framework of bilateral fisheries agreements. It is also true for the South, where one of the most successful initiatives in this respect has been the MCS Programme set up by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). Financed by the EU, it has, since 2003, allowed bilateral and trilateral surveillance operations to be carried out between the countries concerned, and strengthened the equipment, human resources and capacity to exchange information of member countries which needed support in these areas. Tanzania, for example, now has more than 30 trained observers. According to Ms Uronu, the first change needed to achieve such results involves overcoming inertia and bureaucracy. A culture of change is essential. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which numbers seven mainland or island East African countries among its members, is another example of regional cooperation. According to Mark Pearson, at the Secretariat of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), this cooperation has already enabled the number of refrigerated fishing vessels practising IUU fishing to be cut from 140 to 40. One method used is the exchange, between member countries and others, of lists of authorised vessels, together with their tonnage (known as the positive list). Other regional groupings in the fisheries sector may lead to similar initiatives. That has already happened in the case of the Programme pêche, commerce et environnement en Afrique de l Ouest (PCEAO), a programme set up to promote sustainable fishing in six West African states, which met in Dakar in early June 2005. The question of surveillance was not specifically on the agenda, but the West African sub-regional commission on West African fisheries, la Commission sous-régionale des pêches d Afrique de l Ouest (CSRP), does have a project to address this issue, supported by the Luxembourg Development Agency among others. In the Caribbean, the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism lists the development of a monitoring, control and surveillance system as a priority. Finally, the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Unit of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), based in the Solomon Islands, has, since 1999, installed a satellite surveillance system to monitor fishing vessels on behalf of its member states. It has proved to be highly effective the number of cases of illicit fishing recorded by the authorities is, and continues to be, very small. Fisheries surveillance requires considerable means. How should available resources be best used, and what kind of support is needed? That is what future fisheries agreements being drawn up between ACP countries and the EU should try to clarify. Equally, they should encourage greater harmony between national fisheries legislation, as well as regional cooperation in various forms: data exchange, joint patrols, exchange of personnel and experiences between crews, and of surveillance systems in the EU and the ACP regions concerned. In the long run, it makes sense all round. Marine resources, so {{crucial to the}} countries of the South, are being over-exploited. Regulatory measures have been put in place, but must be accompanied by close surveillance of fishing vessels to be effective. Positive examples do exist [...] ...|$|R
