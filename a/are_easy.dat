Roadkill, {{firearms}} for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are highly prized. Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more human settlements and agriculture. Less than 500 individuals are thought {{to exist in the}} wild today, most of the animals being found between the Termit area of Niger, the Bodélé region of western Chad, and the Aoukar in Mauritania.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact reflected by their scientific names. A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet {{at the back of the}} squid.|$|E

When players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough, the dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs.|$|E
5|$|The player {{encounters}} {{more than}} fifteen types of enemy, not including level bosses. Some <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to destroy; others, including the fire creatures found on the Iridion home world, are indestructible and must be avoided. Other enemies prevent the player from dodging enemy fire by laying mines to block paths. Passive objects, such as garbage or asteroids, can damage or destroy the player's craft. Enemies vary in armor and weaponrysome cannot return fire but travel in waves to ram the player.|$|E
5|$|Common loons {{are mainly}} Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their {{breeding}} season {{in spring and}} summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity.|$|E

5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E
5|$|Males <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to {{identify}} {{due to their}} perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E
5|$|Most park {{visitors}} sightsee {{using the}} scenic drive, which {{provides access to}} 13 viewpoints over the amphitheaters. Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked {{in less than a}} day (round trip time, trailhead): Mossy Cave (one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic), Rim Trail (5–6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1–2 hours, Sunrise Point) <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1–2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2–3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4–5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3–4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes. Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.|$|E

5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to culture {{on a large}} scale in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} found singly, scattered, or {{clustered}} together in broad-leaf woods favoring beech, less frequently with conifers. A preference for calcareous soils has been noted, {{but they will}} also grow on acidic bedrock. Because their initial development is subterranean, young fruit bodies <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to overlook, as they as usually covered with dirt or forest duff. They are more common in mountainous locations, and occur most frequently in the spring, often near melting snow. The fungus is distributed in 23 European countries, North Africa, and North America, from British Columbia eastward to Michigan and New York, south to Veracruz, Mexico. It has also been collected from Israel and the Asian part of Turkey. In Europe, the fungus is red-listed in 14 countries, and is considered a threatened species by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi. It is short-listed {{for inclusion in the}} Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi. Threats to the species include loss and degradation of habitats due to clearcutting and soil disturbance.|$|E

5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{human use}} of fungi for food {{preparation}} or preservation and other purposes is extensive {{and has a}} long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of natural products with antimicrobial or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial production of antibiotics, vitamins, and anti-cancer and cholesterol-lowering drugs. More recently, methods {{have been developed for}} genetic engineering of fungi, enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species—which <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels—has opened up ways of pharmaceutical production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals <b>are</b> <b>easy</b> prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E
