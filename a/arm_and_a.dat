5|$|The {{defeat in}} Mile High Stadium {{proved to be}} the last of Cleveland's streak of playoff {{appearances}} in the mid- to late-1980s. Kosar played through numerous injuries in 1989, including bruising on his right <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bad knee. Strong defense had carried the Browns to the playoffs even when the offense faltered, but that all crumbled in 1990. Kosar threw more interceptions than touchdowns {{for the first time in}} his career, and the defense allowed more points than any other in the league. The Browns' 2–7 start cost Carson his job. Jim Shofner was named interim head coach, and the team finished 3–13. After the season Bill Belichick, the defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.|$|E
5|$|The fourth match, between Minoru Suzuki and Kazushi Sakuraba, was {{conducted}} under UWFi rules; {{it would end}} with a knockout, submission, or referee stoppage. During the match, Sakuraba and Suzuki battled onto the entrance ramp, where Sakuraba used a kimura lock to injure Suzuki's arm. When {{they returned to the}} ring, Sakuraba targeted Suzuki's injured arm with kicks, stomps, and a cross armbreaker hold. Suzuki withstood the assault, responding with slaps with his good <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> running kick to Sakuraba's face. Suzuki applied a rear naked choke, making a judo throw while maintaining the choke (Saka Otoshi). Sakuraba fought the hold until he lost consciousness, at which point the referee stopped the match in favour of Suzuki at 9 minutes and 21 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers shook hands and embraced.|$|E
5|$|The game's main enemy {{force is}} the Covenant, {{a group of}} alien species allied by belief in a common religion. Their forces include Elites, fierce warriors {{protected}} by recharging energy shields much like the player's own; Grunts, which are short, comically cowardly creatures who are usually led by Elites in battle, and often flee in terror instead of fighting {{in the absence of}} a leading Elite; Jackals, originally space pirates, they wear a highly durable energy shield on one <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> form of handgun on the other; and Hunters, large, powerful creatures composed of small worm-like colonies with thick armor plates that cover the majority of their bodies and a large assault cannon that fires explosive rounds of green plasma.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prolific}} and enduring of the Fairey IIIs {{was the final}} model, the IIIF, {{which was designed to}} meet Air Ministry Specification 19/24 for a three-seat spotter/reconnaissance aircraft for the Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> two-seat general purpose aircraft for the Royal Air Force. The IIIF, which first flew on 20 April 1926, had a more streamlined engine installation and initially a fuselage of mixed metal and wooden construction, with similar wings to the IIID, although later production aircraft were fitted with an all-metal fuselages and wings.|$|E

25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an upper control <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> strut stabilized lower control arms in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|E

25|$|Along with Williams, the Outlaws roster {{included}} rookie Oklahoma State star RB Ernest Anderson. Former Pittsburgh Steelers {{defensive coordinator}} Woody Widenhofer coached the team. Williams {{had been one}} of the biggest NFL stars to bolt to the USFL. He left the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after they offered him a contract that would have still made him among the lowest-paid starters in the league, even though it would have been triple his previous salary. Williams was not a very refined, efficient, or consistent passer at that point in addition to being a little rusty, but had a big <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> knack for making plays.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 2014, Benjamin {{was arrested}} in Egypt. She had flown there en route to {{participating}} in a women's conference in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Upon her arrival at Cairo International Airport, Benjamin was detained by airport police and held overnight, during which time {{she said she was}} assaulted by police officers, resulting in a broken <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> dislocated shoulder. She was later deported to Turkey. Questions arose regarding the role of the United States Embassy in her detention, as embassy spokesman Mofid Deak said that Benjamin left the country following assistance from the embassy, while Code Pink's Alli McCracken said the embassy did not help Benjamin.|$|E
25|$|Matsunashi also {{continued}} directing {{and another of}} her early films, Bitch Matilda (1998), garnered her a nomination for the New Director's Award from the Directors Guild of Japan. Her next film, SABU, Goodbye to their Youth from 2000, {{was a mixture of}} science fiction and politics and was an early attempt by Matsunashi at a comic portrayal of young men from a woman's perspective. The film was shown theatrically in Osaka and Tokyo and at the TromaDance Film Festival in 2002. Matsunashi's next feature (from 2002) was Replicant Joe, with another science fiction-fantasy theme where the title character becomes a robot with a rocket-launcher <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> small woolen penis.|$|E
