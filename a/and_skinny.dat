5|$|Skyler (Anna Gunn) calls Walter {{to inquire}} about buying the car wash where Walter once worked, which they plan {{to use as a}} front {{business}} for Walter's drug money. When Walter fails to act on the purchase, Skyler starts doing her own detailed research about the business's expenses and revenues. She later approaches the car wash owner, Bogdan (Marius Stan), about the proposed purchase, but he angrily rejects her, making sexist remarks and condemning Walter for having insulted Bogdan when he quit the car wash. Meanwhile, Marie (Betsy Brandt) continues struggling to deal with her husband Hank's (Dean Norris) deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot. The bed-ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and, even after celebrating a successful session with his physical therapist, he refuses to share any of that excitement with Marie. Meanwhile, after three straight days of partying, Jesse tries to keep hanging out with Badger <b>and</b> <b>Skinny</b> Pete, but they are exhausted and go home, along with all of the other guests in Jesse's house. Alone with his thoughts, a depressed Jesse breaks down and cries, sitting less than an inch away from his speakers at an extremely high volume.|$|E

25|$|The two skew {{perpendicular}} opposite {{edges of}} a regular tetrahedron define a set of parallel planes. When one of these planes intersects the tetrahedron the resulting cross section is a rectangle. When the intersecting plane is {{near one of the}} edges the rectangle is long <b>and</b> <b>skinny.</b> When halfway between the two edges the intersection is a square. The aspect ratio of the rectangle reverses as you pass this halfway point. For the midpoint square intersection the resulting boundary line traverses every face of the tetrahedron similarly. If the tetrahedron is bisected on this plane, both halves become wedges.|$|E

25|$|Bauhaus {{inspired}} many industrial rock groups, like Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Nitzer Ebb <b>and</b> <b>Skinny</b> Puppy. The {{band has}} been cited as an influence by electronic act Carl Craig, the crust punk band Amebix and the extreme metal band Celtic Frost. Bauhaus were also hailed by several alternative/indie rock groups including Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden, A Neon Rome, AFI, Hole, Interpol, My Chemical Romance, She Wants Revenge, Elliott Smith, the Dresden Dolls, the Flaming Lips and the Horrors. Bauhaus influenced Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra {{in the writing of}} that band's 1982 album Plastic Surgery Disasters. Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses listed the Bauhaus compilation Bauhaus 1979–1983 in his 100 favorite albums list.|$|E
25|$|During the Process era, a loose-knit art/philosophy {{collective}} {{also known}} as The Process was formed, with early contributions from Ogre and Genesis P-Orridge, among others. P-Orridge and Chris Carter, among others, jammed with Skinny Puppy during this period, a recording of which was eventually released as Puppy Gristle in a limited edition in 2002. The creation of the Download project, which Key and Goettel formed with Mark Spybey and Phil Western, also occurred at this time. Download explored everything from electronic improvisation with spoken vocals to techno, and toured in 1996. Earlier, in 1993, Goettel and Western had issued a breakbeat hardcore single (under the name aDuck) on their own Subconscious Records, and after Goettel's death in 1995, Subconscious evolved into a recording studio and record label imprint that Key used to release {{a number of his}} own <b>and</b> <b>Skinny</b> Puppy's recordings. Key also continued to work with The Tear Garden, produced industrial/trance music with Western in the side project platEAU, and released his first solo album in 1998.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get into the male psyche, they spend a day at Walthamstow Stadium dog track and {{subsequently}} decide to invent six rules of fashion for men based on the way that the betting information is arranged. The six basic body shapes include man boobs, beer belly, short legs, thick neck, broad shoulders <b>and</b> <b>skinny.</b> With each body shape, there includes a list of clothing items men must avoid, and others that are suitable. To test out the rules, Trinny and Susannah travel to a Cumbrian slate mine for the miners to take the rules and go shopping on their own. After the trial, they fear the rules are not simple enough. They seek the help from an advertising company who come {{up with the idea of}} arranging the six rules in the form of the Highway Code, therefore renaming the rules The Male Dress Code. Meanwhile, the fashion duo have arranged for the male section of an Oxford Street department store to be sectioned off to allow a male only day. The section has the six important rules displayed, complete with six live male manikins, one for each body shape, to demonstrate the clothing rules. They also invite some of the civil engineers and slate miners to test the newly formatted rules. Then outside of the store, Trinny and Susannah unveil the six male manikins in the shop window to the women outside.|$|E

5000|$|Slim-fit pants or skinny jeans (when made of denim) have a {{snug fit}} through {{the legs and}} end in a small leg opening that can be {{anywhere}} from 9" [...] to 20" [...] in circumference, depending on size. Other names for this style include drainpipes, stovepipes, tight pants, cigarette pants, skinny jeans, pencil pants, skinny pants, gas pipes, <b>and</b> <b>skinnies.</b> Skinny jeans taper completely {{at the bottom of}} the leg, whereas drainpipe jeans are skinny but then the lower leg is straight instead of tapering and so they are often slightly baggier {{at the bottom of the}} leg than skinny jeans. In some styles, zippers are needed at the bottom of the leg to facilitate pulling them over the feet. Stretch denim, with anywhere from 2% to 4% spandex, may be used to allow jeans to have a super-slim fit. Skinny jeans come in a variety of colors and styles.|$|R
500|$|... "Starveling" [...] is a {{word for}} a thin or poor person lacking food. [...] "Robin" [...] may have {{connections}} to two of Queen Elizabeth's suitors, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. [...] Elizabeth's pet name for both of these men was [...] "Robin", leading scholars to believe that Robin Starveling may be a satiric creation of Shakespeare's in their honour (or dishonour). Another suitor, Duke François ("Francis") Hercule Alençon, may have similar connections with Francis Flute. It {{may also be a}} nod to the fact that tailors of the time were usually poor <b>and</b> <b>skinny.</b>|$|E
500|$|Nine Inch Nails' {{earliest}} influences include Ministry <b>and</b> <b>Skinny</b> Puppy, {{which helped}} shape what became 1989's Pretty Hate Machine. The album's liner notes also {{paid tribute to}} the hip-hop group Public Enemy and Prince. Another large influence on the band's sound is Gary Numan, which is evident as Reznor once said that [...] "after hearing 'Cars' I knew I wanted to make music with synthesizers". The 2005 single [...] "Only" [...] exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan's persuasion. Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails encompass late 70s and 80s acts such as Queen, Devo, Joy Division, Adam Ant, and Soft Cell.|$|E

500|$|Ponche de Leona {{delivered}} Mucho Macho Man {{three weeks}} after her due date. [...] At birth, the foal was lifeless with no heartbeat. Farm staff tried to revive him by massaging and shaking him. [...] He was unresponsive for several minutes, then his eyes opened and he [...] "just got up and galloped away". As a result, his foalhood nickname was [...] "Lazarus". [...] In {{addition to being a}} late foal, he was very big and hence slow to reach full development. Because the young horse was so tall <b>and</b> <b>skinny,</b> John Rio called him [...] "Mr. Green Jeans", though no one else did. [...] His official name is derived from the Village People song [...] "Macho Man", and owner Dean Reeves' nickname for him is [...] "Macho".|$|E

[...] Tim Skold, formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah, made his first appearance as a band member, writing lyrics and performing vocals on [...] "Anarchy". Looking back on Symbols in 2002, Konietzko said, [...] "I listened to the Symbols album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place. It told me the story of what went wrong. There were maybe two (good) songs on that album and the others were just a bunch of compromising tug-of-wars. That was something I was not going to do again." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was long}} {{suspected}} by several of Britten's close associates {{that there was}} something exceptional about his attraction to teenage boys: Auden referred to Britten's [...] "attraction to thin-as-a-board juveniles... to the sexless and innocent", and Pears once wrote to Britten: [...] "remember there are lovely things in the world still– children, boys, sunshine, the sea, Mozart, you and me". In public, the matter was little discussed during Britten's lifetime and much discussed after it. Carpenter's 1992 biography closely examined the evidence, as do later studies of Britten, most particularly John Bridcut's Britten's Children (2006), which concentrates on Britten’s friendships and relationships with various children and adolescents. Some commentators have continued to question Britten's conduct, sometimes very sharply. Carpenter and Bridcut conclude that he held any sexual impulses under firm control and kept the relationships affectionate – including bed-sharing, kissing <b>and</b> <b>skinny</b> dipping – but strictly platonic.|$|E

Effortlessly gyrating through the dances — even when she snapped a shoe strap during the finale on opening night — Ms. Danelson blesses Tracy {{with a touch of}} vulnerability that makes viewers root for her ingenuous character’s triumph over Baltimore’s racism <b>and</b> <b>skinnier</b> girls." ...|$|R
