40|$|The Home Energy Saver (HES) suite offers popular online {{simulation}} {{tools that}} enable U. S. homeowners and energy professionals to rigorously evaluate home energy use and develop recommendations on how energy {{can be saved}} across all end uses. The underlying analytical system is also available as a web service to power third-party energy analysis tools. Given the system’s diverse uses, {{it is important that}} the simulation is robust and accurate. While the engineering methods are extensively documented and subjected to peer review, it is useful to evaluate how well HES predicts energy use in occupied homes. In this paper we compare measured to predicted energy use for 428 occupied homes in Oregon, Florida, and Wisconsin, representing a diversity building types, energy intensities, and occupant behaviors. We show how <b>audit</b> <b>depth,</b> knowledge of operational details, and sub-metered energy data can be valuable to the process of improving model accuracy—particularly for individual households, where energy use can vary three-fold for homes with virtually identical physical characteristics. Accuracy is strongly proportional to the quality and completeness of inputs, yet audit data are often deficient. Predictions are best—and the tendency of models to over-predict actual consumption is mitigated—when behavioral inputs match actual conditions. When averaged across groups of homes, HES predicts energy use within 1 % of actual consumption when physical characteristics and occupant behavior are well accounted for. New research findings promise to confer even greater accuracy as they are incorporated into simulation tools...|$|E

40|$|Paragraph 52 of the German closed {{substance}} cycle {{waste management}} and waste avoidance management act (KrW-/AbfG) defines the term 'specialised waste management company'. Since the specialised waste management company directive (EfbV) {{went into effect}} on October 7, 1996, waste management companies can voluntarily acquire certification as specialised waste management companies, and have thereby a way to document their qualification with a branch-specific quality seal. This directive and the compelementary waste management association guideline (EgRL) specifiy the standards for implementation by the German member states. This research project conducted extensive inquiries about the acceptance of this directive by involved waste management companies, experts and certifying organisations, government authorities and waste producers; it also identified weak points and provided commercial recommendations. Using the states Saxony-Anhalt, North Rhine Westphalia and Berlin as case studies, the impact of 'specialised waste management company' certification was researched by means of questionnaires and interviews directed at specific target groups. In general, all the target groups questioned assessed the branch-specific certification as an appropriate means for {{improving the quality of}} waste management services. Weak points evidently exist above all in the job of the experts, which is partially characterised by inadequate <b>auditing</b> <b>depth,</b> scope and system. Recommendations were made for monitoring the certifying organisations. Although the need exists to put individual requirements into concrete terms, a trend in the waste management branch towards more specialised expertise, transparency and individual responsibility brought on by the specialised waste management company directive, is detectable two years after it went into effect.

Four aspects of professional activity were investigated: prescribing, practice activity as shown by family practitioner committee quarterly returns, hospital use, and <b>audit</b> in <b>depth.</b> The results are from 508 (76 %) questionnaires returned from the 669 general practitioners circulated in Leicestershire and Lincolnshire. The prescribing habits of most doctors are influenced both by factual information about drugs from many sources and by feedback on their personal prescribing or that of their practice, which is supplied by the Prescription Pricing Authority, particularly regarding prescribing costs. Little use is made of data from the family practitioner committee. A distinct pattern of preferences for particular items of information emerged. Most doctors wished to receive information that would enable them to compare their personal performance or that of their practice with their local colleagues from the Prescription Pricing Authority (66 %), the family practitioner committee (58 %), and hospital sources (57 %).

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} all general practitioner principals in Leicestershire and Lincolnshire (n = 669) to determine (a) {{the extent to which}} they would participate in quality assessment activities based on objective evidence of performance and (b) the personal and professional characteristics of interested doctors. The overall response rate to the {{questionnaire was}} 76 % (508 replies). The highest response rates were recorded by trainers (100 %), principals in training practices (94 %), and younger doctors (80 - 86 %), the lowest by overseas graduates (59 %) and older doctors (65 %). Distinctive patterns of interest and participation in three types of audit activities were clearly evident. Overall, 61 % (310) of respondents wished to be provided with profiles of practice activity from their family practitioner committees, 36 % (183) volunteered to participate in a prescribing study, and 34 % (172) expressed interest in carrying out an <b>audit</b> in <b>depth.</b> Proportionately, the most enthusiastic and active groups were trainers 88 %, 70 %, 62 %), principals in training practices (74 %, 49 %, 47 %), and members or fellows of the Royal College of General Practitioners (71 %, 50 %, 45 %). Also active were younger doctors, vocationally trained doctors, and principals in large group practices. These figures suggest that roughly 15 000 general practitioners in the United Kingdom would be prepared to participate in performance review activities using information provided by external agencies, 10 000 would if they had to generate some of the information, and 7500 would if they had to produce all the information themselves...|$|R

40|$|Better {{outcomes}} are obtained with stroke thrombolysis the more rapidly it is given, {{both in terms}} of the patient's level of functional ability and also mortality. Current UK performance targets (outside London) aim for a time of 45 minutes or less. Thrombolysis pathways involve multidisciplinary working across departmental boundaries as well as senior level decision making. Our system used telemedicine out of hours adding additional complexity to the pathway. The initial planning stages started by auditing current practice and mapping the existing pathway. The figures for door to needle times were held on a database on the stroke unit and collected in detail for the purposes of national reporting. The pathway was mapped by combining personal experience of working within the stroke service with the experiences of the general medical registrars who worked the system out of hours. The initial action was to present this information throughout the hospital at departmental meetings. Opinions were canvassed at these meetings on where the biggest barriers were within the pathway and how we could address them. An awareness campaign was held by advertising over the intranet. An intervention comprising the following elements was introduced over the period of a year: introduction of an ambulance pre-alert, revision of the existing pathway, and education to all those involved in thrombolysis. The cases where particularly long delays were noted were <b>audited</b> in more <b>depth</b> to identify barriers to flow through the system. This was reported in ward meetings for staff to contribute experience and to offer solutions.

40|$|Inspired by the {{innovative}} efforts of pioneers in non-governmental organizations, notably the Grameen Bank, financial services delivery {{to the poor}} has grown since the 1980 ?s and has been advocated as {{an important component of}} development interventions. These financial services, also known as microfinance, are believed to have positive outcomes on production, income, and consumption at household and macro-economic levels. The provocative idea that alleviating poverty can be profitable to microfinance institutions (MFIs) and donors had an enticing effect on the private sector hence private capital sources increased. The paradigm of microfinance shifted to MFIs emphasizing on cost effectiveness and financial viability in their operations. The microfinance industry has made considerable progress in financial performance measurement and evaluation. Of late, the microfinance industry is shifting from its emphasis on financial sustainability to a renewed concern on social performance. There is heightened interest in developing a social performance measurement tool with a common set of key social indicators to go {{hand in hand with the}} financial performance. Among others, measurement of social performance will encourage institutions to be more mindful in maintaining their social mission especially now that an increasing number of microfinance programs are gearing towards privatization. It allows MFIs to demonstrate social performance, transparency and credibility which can lead to donors and investors reallocation of funds towards socially-oriented MFIs. Empirical data were collected while the researcher was working with the Research Department of AMK 1 in Cambodia. Quantitative panel data were collected annually from 2006 to 2008 covering AMK clients and non-clients in 55 rural villages in nine provinces of Cambodia. Qualitative data were collected from 2007 to 2009. The first purpose of the study is to review the important theoretical frameworks on social performance and examine ongoing social performance initiatives in the microfinance industry in view of the synthesized frameworks. The concept of social performance borrows elements from different established concepts that we find in business, ethics and society. The study shows that social performance measurement pulls together three dominant frameworks ? the corporate social performance model, the stakeholder theory, and the accountability theory- into one theme. Drawing from the review of some of the well-known social performance initiatives in the microfinance industry, the study finds it necessary to integrate both process and outcome approaches in social performance measurement. The process approach reviews how an MFI identifies, integrates, and manages its social goals. Complimentarily, the outcome approach measures stakeholder satisfaction (client, staff, etc), outreach and impact of MFI policies and financial services. The study shows that there is an overemphasis of the outcome approach on one stakeholder, the clients, and is further limited on the depth of outreach of MFIs. Second, the study describes and reviews a practitioner?s approach in social performance measurement with empirical analysis. AMK provided an example of how an MFI can integrate the process and outcome approaches in their operations. While most outcome approaches used by other MFIs focus on social performance to clients with emphasis on the depth of outreach, AMK takes on a broader outcome approach to its stakeholders by also devising a system to measure satisfaction of clients and staff. AMK?s social performance measurement tools include an annual staff satisfaction survey, financial procedures and operations audit, client protection <b>audit,</b> client profile, <b>depth</b> of outreach, client satisfaction, exit client survey, and competition analysis. AMK?s depth of outreach is measured using the principal component analysis (PCA) on cross-sectional data (based on CGAP?s Poverty Assessment Tool). The PCA method creates a poverty index for each household and poverty groups (poor, less poor and better off) are created using a tercile analysis based on the poverty indexes of the control group (non-clients). Using the same method, the statistical results of the study indicate that more AMK clients fall under the poor group as compared to non-clients. The PCA method can be used by MFIS to show that they have properly targeted poor clients and to report on the depth of their outreach. The PCA method also paves the way for the measurement of poverty changes over time for individuals or households. Inherent in evaluating social programs such as microfinance is to measure its end result and impact. Impact of microfinance on clients is an important indicator in the measurement of social performance. Therefore, the third purpose of the study is to contribute to the empirical literature on the impact of group lending on clients. Different tests and models were applied on the panel data. Thus far, little attention has been given to the time-varying effects of microfinance. The research contributes to filling this research gap by considering 1 -year and 2 -year intervals between panel rounds to compare group lending effects on new entrants and long-term clients. Also, many impact studies faced incomplete sample bias. This research tackles this issue by including client dropouts in the sample. By applying the PCA weights of the base years (2006 and 2007 cross-sectional data) to panel data collected in 2008, the study was able to identify households that moved in and out of poverty. With two time-variant poverty indexes per household, a transition matrix identified those households that are transiently poor and chronically poor. Contrary to other studies that apply PCA over pooled data, the study shows the advantage of using different set of weights on different time periods of the unpooled data. Using different set of weights accounts for the changes in poverty characteristics and the different time intervals of the panel data. The study shows that household?s movement to a wealthier group has been significant among AMK clients, notably among the chronically poor. The statistical analysis on the changes in the mean of the clothing and footwear expenditure of households shows considerable increase in AMK clients compared to non-clients among the chronically poor. Among the transiently poor, clients have significantly accumulated savings while no significant change could be found among non-clients. As there is weak empirical evidence on the impact of microfinance on clients, the other component of the panel data analysis was to understand the determinants of credit participation using probit regression; analyze the factors that affect the likelihood of the client household becoming chronically poor, transiently poor (worsen and improved, separately), and never poor using multinomial logistic model; and test the impact of microfinance on food consumption in rural Cambodia with different statistical models. The findings suggest that households which are more economically stable and have the ability to build assets have less demand for small loans. Households with liquid assets are less likely to borrow. Because the panel data includes new entrants and long-term clients collected at 1 - and 2 -year intervals, it shed light on the importance of long term participation in group lending. An important finding of the fixed effect model with interaction variables and the conditional change score model is that access to group loans has a negative impact on food consumption of new clients but a positive impact on long-term clients. The negative impact on new clients may be temporary. This finding is supported by results of a multinomial logistic regression which shows that for a long-term client the odds of belonging to the ascended transient poor group rather than the descended transient poor group are 6 percent. The fourth purpose of the study is to review the different social performance measurement tools in existence today, draw lessons and select common criteria for selecting a social performance measurement tool. In general, the weaknesses on the social performance initiatives lie on its comparability of results and missing analysis on some social issues. A practical measurement method should have quantifiable indicators to minimize subjectivity and establish credibility. The challenge is to quantify indicators or assign values to qualitative information. One of the starkest contrasts between the social performance tools is the design and requirements in terms of technical knowledge, time and cost. Rigorous tools will be rejected by MFIs if they see it as a financial burden and too time consuming. Practicality is important in standardizing social performance measurement tools if it hopes to gain industry-wide acceptance. Inspiriert durch innovative Bemühungen von Pionieren der Nicht- Regierungsorganisationen, insbesondere der Grameen Bank, hat die Förderung von Finanzdienstleistungen für die Armen seit den 1980 ern zugenommen, und wurde als wichtige Komponente der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit befürwortet. Man geht davon aus, dass diese als Mikrofinanzierung bekannten finanziellen Dienstleistungen auf haushalts- und makroökonomischer Ebene einen positiven Einfluss auf die Produktion, das Einkommen und den Konsum haben. Die provokative Idee, dass eine Armutsreduzierung profitabel für Mikrofinanzinstitute (MFIs) und Kreditgeber sein kann, hatte einen verlockenden Effekt auf den privaten Sektor und demzufolge vermehrten sich private Kapitalquellen. Das Paradigma von Mikrofinanzierung verlagerte sich hin zu MFIs, die vor allem auf Effektivität und finanzielle Realisierbarkeit Wert legten.
