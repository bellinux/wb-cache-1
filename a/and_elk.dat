5|$|Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 {{terrestrial}} vertebrate {{species and}} 28 fish species. The most common large animals are mule deer <b>and</b> <b>elk,</b> but other mammals present include moose, black bears, cougar, coyote, yellow-bellied marmot, beaver, porcupine, Canadian lynx, mountain goat, pika, river otter, muskrat, pronghorn, mink, bobcat, marten, and timber wolves.|$|E
5|$|Communities in the {{watershed}} of West Branch Fishing Creek include Central <b>and</b> <b>Elk</b> Grove. Lumbering was an industry in {{the watershed}} in the late 1800s. Fish species living in West Branch Fishing Creek include brown trout, brook trout, and sculpin. The {{upper reaches of the}} creek are designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. There is significant benthic algae coverage in the lower reaches of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Goat Rocks {{obtained}} {{its name}} from a population of mountain goats that can be observed around the mountain. Other fauna include marmots and pikas at high elevations. Deer <b>and</b> <b>elk</b> can be found below the timberline, including mule deer, mule deer-black-tailed hybrids, Roosevelt elk, and Rocky Mountain elk that were introduced from Yellowstone National Park in 1913. Black-tailed deer are especially common.|$|E
5|$|Oak savanna {{is a type}} of {{grassland}} with scattered oak trees, {{found on}} the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. The Takelma tribe often set fires in the oak savanna and chaparral regions to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer <b>and</b> <b>elk.</b> It also prevented large wildfires. Oregon white oak and ponderosa pine are the most common trees found in the region. Buckbrush, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, Pacific madrone, deerbrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, and Pacific poison oak are also common.|$|E
5|$|Ole Bull State Park {{is located}} in the Kettle Creek watershed. It opened in 1925. The Susquehannock State Forest {{is located in}} Potter County, near the creek's headwaters. Kettle Creek State Park {{is located in the}} watershed, near the Alvin R. Bush Dam. It is {{commonly}} visited by fishermen. Much of {{the lower part of the}} watershed is in Sproul State Forest. Tioga State Forest <b>and</b> <b>Elk</b> State Forest also occupy a small part of the watershed, on the northeastern and edges, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The volcano and the {{surrounding}} Goat Rocks Wilderness, established in 1964, are named after the numerous mountain goats which live in the area. The variable climate of the wilderness area supports a host of wildlife, including marmots, pikas, deer, <b>and</b> <b>elk.</b> Various peaks within the wilderness can be climbed or scrambled, and other activities such as hiking are permitted. The area is rife with minerals and resources, including coal, cobalt, copper, and base metals.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{red deer}} <b>and</b> <b>elk</b> were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer <b>and</b> <b>elk</b> subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer. Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{operates}} the Cole M. Rivers Hatchery {{near the base}} of the dam at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogueâ€“Elk Hatchery built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the hatchery in 1973 to offset the loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate <b>and</b> <b>Elk</b> Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest salmon and steelhead hatchery in the United States.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines were {{becoming}} worn out {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for a few years before being sold for breaking up. The machinery of Avon, Dwarf <b>and</b> <b>Elk</b> was in good enough shape that they were assigned as tenders to the coastguard district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a tugboat in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer <b>and</b> <b>elk.</b> They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{typically}} harvested local small game, {{but sometimes}} organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their {{main sources of}} animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, <b>and</b> <b>elk.</b> They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.|$|E

5|$|The Shasta-Trinity National Forest {{encompasses}} {{nearly the}} entire Trinity River watershed {{with the exception of}} private inholdings and the small area in Humboldt County. Large mammals found in the national forest include black bear, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, gray fox, Columbian black-tailed deer (mule deer), <b>and</b> <b>elk.</b> River otters inhabit most streams. Other mammals include ringtails, raccoons, skunks, jackrabbits, martens and many squirrel and rat species including northern flying squirrel. Several species of bats are also found in the watershed, little brown bats being the most common. The area around Trinity Lake has a significant nesting bald eagle population.|$|E
5|$|The panel issued {{over 500}} recommendations, {{including}} limiting {{the growth of}} the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people <b>and</b> <b>elk.</b> The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.|$|E
5|$|The state {{established}} a tree nursery in the Moshannon State Forest in 1911, {{which became the}} largest in Pennsylvania before it closed in 1980. In addition to planting millions of trees, in 1913 the state encouraged use of state forest lands by allowing permanent leases for camp sites; when the state stopped issuing new permits in 1970, 4,500 campsites had been leased. The Pennsylvania Game Commission began purchasing land for state game preserves in 1920, and by 1941, State Game Lands 34, which is partly in Quehanna Wild Area, had been established. Despite these conservation efforts, major forest fires swept the Moshannon <b>and</b> <b>Elk</b> state forests in 1912, 1913, 1926, and 1930, and minor fires occurred in other years.|$|E
50|$|Players in {{multiplayer}} {{can start}} rallies <b>and</b> hunt bull <b>elk</b> <b>and</b> moose. Bull <b>elk</b> have more meat than female <b>elk</b> <b>and</b> are many times harder to kill. Moose {{are far more}} difficult to hunt {{than any of the}} <b>elk,</b> <b>and</b> will take some time to kill, but the reward of meat is greater. Players may bite elk in the neck or back legs while hunting. WolfQuest 2.7 added a multiplayer mode to the Slough Creek mission arc, so players can raise pups together and journey to the rendezvous site.|$|R

5|$|Twenty other Pennsylvania {{counties}} today contain {{land that}} was once part of Lycoming County: five were formed completely from it (Jefferson, McKean, Potter, Tioga, and Sullivan), eight were formed from it and other counties (Armstrong, Bradford, Centre, Clearfield, Clinton, Indiana, Venango, and Warren), three were formed from counties that were themselves formed partly from it (Cameron, Clarion, <b>and</b> <b>Elk),</b> Forest was formed from a county that was formed completely from it, two (Luzerne and Wyoming) contain territory {{that was part of}} lycoming County in 1795, and finally Union received a township from it in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Over 40 {{species of}} mammals have been documented, {{including}} the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, <b>and</b> <b>elk.</b> Along the coastline, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals {{live near the}} shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River. Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including the red squirrel and northern flying squirrel {{spend most of their}} lives well above the forest floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the site was first {{brought to the attention}} of Professor Richard Daugherty in 1952 by a rancher named John McGregor. Excavations at the site were started by Daugherty and Roald Fryxell, a geologist, under the auspices of Washington State University (WSU)and the National Park Service in 1962, and continued until 1964. In 1965, Fryxell returned to the site along with Professor Carl Gustafson and students from WSU, and had Roland Marmes dig a trench in front of the rockshelter with his bulldozer, which turned up human <b>and</b> <b>elk</b> bones. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the human remains were about 10,000 years old. In 1968, Fryxell returned, this time with several WSU professors (including a visiting professor from Poland) and members of the United States Geological Survey, and found more human and animal remains, along with bone tools. April 29 of that year, Washington Senator Warren Magnuson made a public announcement of the finds.|$|E
