40|$|This study {{examines}} lobbying against the FASB 2 ̆ 7 s 1985 Exposure Draft (ED) on accounting for pensions. The ED 2 ̆ 7 s proposals {{would have put}} a liability on the balance sheet for unfunded pension benefits, reduced flexibility in measurement of pension expense, and caused possible volatility in expense measurement. Drawing upon contracting theory, {{it was hypothesized that}} industrial firms would be motivated to lobby against the proposals because of <b>adverse</b> financial <b>statement</b> effects. The potentially <b>adverse</b> balance sheet effect was measured by using a ratio of net pension liability (asset) to the firm 2 ̆ 7 s total existing balance sheet tangible assets. Lobbyists were hypothesized to have a smaller ratio than nonlobbyists. The potential for <b>adverse</b> income <b>statement</b> effects was captured by the use of a ratio of pension expense to pretax earnings. This ratio was hypothesized to be larger for lobbyists than nonlobbyists. Using political cost management wealth theories, firm size and management percentage ownership were hypothesized to be key motivating factors in the lobby decision. Lobbyists were hypothesized to be larger than nonlobbyists. The management wealth hypothesis was a joint test of Jensen and Meckling 2 ̆ 7 s (1976) theory and Fama 2 ̆ 7 s (1980) theory, so a nondirectional test of management wealth was used. ^ Using both univariate and multivariate (logit) analyses, it was determined that firm size differed significantly (and in the direction predicted) between lobbying and nonlobbying firms. The hypotheses representing <b>adverse</b> financial <b>statements</b> effects were not supported. The pension ratio variable was never significant, although the sign of the difference was in the direction predicted. The pension expense ratio was not significant, and the sign of the difference was opposite of that predicted. Management percentage ownership was significant in the univariate tests, but the logit results indicated that management wealth was not independent of either firm size or industry membership. Results of this study support the political cost theory that firm size may be sufficient to explain the decision to lobby. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{environmental}} assessment has been prepared that summarizes the expected {{effects of the}} proposed project on the existing environment. The Omaha District, Corps of Engineers {{in partnership with the}} Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, proposes to construct a research and education center (REC) at Ponca State Park in Dixon County, Nebraska. The proposed project would consist of the construction ofa 15, 000 square foot REC building, a constructed treatment wetland to handle the waste from the REC building, a 1. 5 acre lake that would receive used water from the heat pump system, a system of geothermal wells for use as part of a heat pump system, a new entrance road, and a parking lot. Ponca State Park is located within the boundaries of the Missouri National Recreational River. Construction of the REC was authorized by Section 707 of the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 (TL 95 - 625). This act amended the National Wild and Scenic River Act of 1968 (90 - 542). Three alternatives were considered but eliminated from further consideration. These include two alternative construction sites for the REC and the no-action alternative. The two alternative locations were eliminated because they did not meet the criteria set up to evaluate the sites as well as the preferred alternative. The no-action alternative was eliminated because this alternative would not meet the purpose and need of the proposed project, and the facilities at Ponca State Park would remain inadequate {{to meet the needs of}} current or future visitors to the park. All environmental, social, and economic factors, which are relative to the proposal, were considered in this assessment. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, threatened and endangered species, vegetation, wetlands, cultural resources, air quality, water quality, and wildlife. The {{environmental assessment}} and comments received from tribes and other agencies have been used to determine whether the proposed action requires the preparation of an environmental impact <b>statement.</b> <b>Adverse</b> impacts identified for this action were determined not to be significant. These impacts would include a temporary noise increase during construction and the displacement of resident wildlife. There are not expected to be any adverse impacts to threatened and endangered species as a result of the proposed project. Erosion control methods would be utilized during construction. It is my finding, based on the environmental assessment, that the proposed Federal activity will Poot have any significant adverse impacts on the environment and that the proposed project will not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The proposed action has been coordinated with the appropriate resource agencies, and there are no significant unresolved issues. Therefore, an environmental impact statement will not be prepared...|$|R

40|$|Resource {{managers}} are frequently {{concerned that the}} area burned by wildfire over time will impede achievement of land management objectives. Methods that use the Poisson probability model to quantify that risk are described. The methods require a concise <b>statement</b> of an <b>adverse</b> wildfire outcome and information on fire frequencies and sizes. An example is presented that illustrates use of the risk assessment procedure to quantify the trade-off between burned acreage risk {{and the cost of}} a fuels treatment project that reduces risk. Forest wildfire can pose a significant risk to achieving forest land management objectives. Water quality in municipal watersheds can be threatened by wildfire events. Anadromous fisheries can be endangered by the stream sedimentation resulting from runoff when rainstorms follow a large fire or even a series of smaller fires. Maintaining minimum acceptable levels of a wildlife habitat can also be at risk to the cumulative effects of wildfire. Sustained timber supplies are also at risk to wildfire events. For these reasons resource {{managers are}} concerned with the uncertainty posed by wildfire. Their concern centers on both the threat to meeting land management objectives and the costs of wildfire risk management. Accurately assessing the uncertainty posed by wildfire is frequently quite difficult, particularly if the outcomes of concern involve collections of random events. When adequate data are available, quantitative techniques can help in estimating the probabilities of wildfire outcomes involving joint random events, as has been shown for adverse fire movement (Wiitala and Carlton 1994). These procedures will help reduce the biases that can creep into purely subjective assessments of these probabilities (Cleaves 1994). This paper describes how probability theory can be used to assess the risk posed by wildfire to achieving resource management objectives. The procedures combine fire size and frequency data with the Poisson probability model to calculate the chance that burned area will exceed some threshold for a given area and period. A hypothetical example is presented that illustrates use of the risk assessment procedure to quantify the trade-off between burned acreage risk and the cost of a fuels treatment project that reduces risk...|$|R
40|$|In 2010 in Cadder v HM Advocate the Supreme Court {{held that}} Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) entitles all {{suspects}} to consult a solicitor {{before and during}} police questioning, {{as well as to}} be informed of this right. It immediately caused ripples in the Scottish criminal justice pond which may grow to tidal wave proportions, with some worrying that the decision may even leave criminal suspects worse off than before. Thus the legislation responding to Cadder doubled the existing six hour period of detention allowed for police questioning and empowered the police to apply for a further twelve hours. Potentially more significant are the recommendations of the Carloway Review, commissioned to “review key elements of Scottish criminal law and practice in the light of [Cadder]. ” A year later it reported {{on a wide variety of}} issues, including the law on arrest and detention, custody periods, the giving of legal advice, police questioning, child suspects and other vulnerable witnesses, the general test of evidential sufficiency, “mixed” <b>statements,</b> drawing <b>adverse</b> inferences from reliance on the right to silence, as well as issues relating to appeals. Many of the Report’s recommendations have been received positively, notably those to limit detention to 12 hours, and to retain a robust right to silence. By contrast, a veritable storm of controversy has met its recommendation to abolish the requirement of corroboration on the basis that it is “an archaic rule that has no place in a modern legal system where judges and juries should be free to consider all relevant evidence and to answer the single question of whether they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person committed the offence libelled”. Fairly predictably, this was welcomed by Government lawyers and some police organisations who were joined by women’s groups and more tentatively by some academics. But, as Gordon predicted almost twenty years ago, and Lord Carloway expected, the requirement has been “defend[ed] religiously [as] one of the most notable and precious features of Scots criminal law” by lawyers, judges, academic and human rights campaigners, who have questioned whether abolition will in fact save costs and have the predicted positive impact on conviction rates in sexual and domestic violence offences. Instead, they warn that removing such a “cornerstone” of the law will lead to many unintended problems, take years to bed in and, most crucially, threaten civil liberties. Nevertheless, despite the overwhelming view that such a momentous step requires greater consultation and consideration, and a far more convincing case than that provided by Lord Carloway, the Scottish Government declared itself persuaded and, although setting up a consultation process, later announced its intention to introduce a bill to give effect to the Carloway Review including its recommendation to abolish the corroboration requirement. This article seeks to evaluate whether it should have been so easily persuaded by Lord Carloway, and, if not, whether a convincing alternative case for abolition could have been made. We will also consider whether, as the Scottish Government seems now to have accepted, that Lord Carloway was wrong to dismiss the need to replace the requirement with safeguards compensating for the loss of the protection against miscarriages of justice that it supposedly provided. In doing so, we will aim to go beyond the often highly rhetorical and sometimes misleading, unfounded and even illogical arguments seen on both sides of the debate, and, by adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, ground the debate in a more theoretically and empirically informed understanding of the criminal justice process...|$|R
40|$|Background context: Spinal {{manipulative}} therapy (SMT) {{is commonly}} used to treat spinal disorders. Although clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of SMT {{in the treatment of}} neck and back disorders, concerns exist about the nature and incidence of adverse events associated with the intervention. Comprehensive reporting of adverse events in clinical trials could allow for accurate incidence estimates through meta-analysis. However, it is not clear if randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that involve SMT are currently reporting adverse events adequately. Purpose: This study aimed to describe the extent of adverse events reporting in published RCTs involving SMT, and to determine whether the quality of reporting has improved since publication of the 2010 Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. Study design: This is a systematic literature review. Methods: The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for RCTs involving SMT. Domains of interest included classifications of adverse events, completeness of adverse events reporting, nomenclature used to describe the events, methodological quality of the study, and details of the publishing journal. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Frequencies and proportions of trials reporting on each of the specified domains above were calculated. Differences in proportions between pre- and post-CONSORT trials were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals using standard methods, and statistical comparisons were analyzed using tests for equality of proportions with continuity correction. There was no funding obtained for this study. The authors declare no conflict of interest. Results: Of 7, 398 records identified in the electronic searches, 368 articles were eligible for inclusion in this review. Adverse events were reported in 140 (38. 0 %) articles. There was {{a significant increase in the}} reporting of adverse events post-CONSORT (p=. 001). There were two major adverse events reported (0. 3 %). Only 22 articles (15. 7 %) reported on adverse events in the abstract. There were no differences in reporting of adverse events post-CONSORT for any of the chosen parameters. Conclusions: Although there has been an increase in reporting adverse events since the introduction of the 2010 CONSORT guidelines, the current level should be seen as inadequate and unacceptable. We recommend that authors adhere to the CONSORT <b>statement</b> when reporting <b>adverse</b> events associated with RCTs that involve SMT. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|I. This study {{examines}} the value to financial analysts and investors generally in the UK of firms' accounting disclosures {{and other information}} contained in the annual report and accounts for share valuation purposes. 2. Using daily share price data and a large sample of actively traded UK firms the relative information content of four major information releases, the preliminary announcement, annual report and accounts, annual general meeting and the interim report, are examined. Three different models are employed, two of which involved the calculation of the market risk measure; the firm's beta. To increase comparability with previous studies, some of the tests were replicated using weekly data. 3. Previous studies have shown a bias when calculating abnormal returns due to the size composition of the sample. Re-estimating the parameters using Ordinary Least Squares but including a size variable, showed virtually {{no effect on the}} magnitude of the estimated parameters. Neither the constant `alpha' nor the coefficient 11 of the size variable were statistically significant. The former is consistent with prior research. 4. Infrequency of trading is largely associated with small companies and gives rise to a downward bias when estimating betas. Although the sample comprised actively traded mainly large companies, the betas were re-estimated using a method which takes into account thin trading. The results indicated that parameter estimates have to take into consideration thin trading even when using predominantly large actively traded stocks. The degree of stability in the betas over successive periods was low though the difference in the average betas of the two periods was negligible. The pooled betas were therefore used. 5. The initial test was to ascertain the extent of the information content of the four events. The three different model formulations employed produced almost identical results suggesting a naive model with beta= 1 may well be adequate in many such event study situations. Therefore, all further tests were conducted using only the market model with adjusted betas. Of the four events, the preliminary announcement and interim report, largely representing earnings and dividends announcements, had the highest information content, whilst little information in aggregate is conveyed to the market by the annual general meeting and the annual report and accounts. Similar results were produced using a different information measure and weekly data. No unusual share price activity was observed prior to 111 the event day or after event day plus one, which is consistent with the semi-strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. 6. Evidence was found in tests of the market's reaction to `good' and `bad' news that, on average, they are given equal value except for the interim report where there is a sharper reaction to `bad' news. 7. This study supports previous research showing an inverse relationship between company size and the abnormal return on an event day. When variance of returns is included in the regression, the size coefficient albeit statistically significant becomes negligible in magnitude which suggests, like prior work, that size is probable a surrogate for absent firm specific variables. 8. Using a control group of companies with low annual report and accounts abnormal returns but otherwise matching a sample of outlier companies with high annual report and accounts residuals, an analysis was made of both groups. Little difference was noted in the amount of statutory or voluntary information disclosed in the preliminary announcements of the groups. There was, however, significant evidence of greater price-sensitive information being provided in the annual reports and accounts of the outlier group. 9. There was little evidence to suggest that one group was more closely followed by analysts than the other. Capital gearing and income cover were, on average, little different. Apparently what was driving the returns of the outlier sample was company specific information. The information seemed to be largely contained in two sections of the annual report, the balance sheet and the chairman's statement, which previous studies have shown to be valued by users. 10. Tests of association between information content of the events produced conflicting results but analysis of the press comments seemed to furnish some evidence of an informational relationship between the preliminary announcement and the annual report and accounts of the outlier group not observed in the control group. Press comments on the annual reports of the outlier group bear some relationship to the press comments on their preliminary announcements. 11. No previous study has directly examined the informational value of the annual report and accounts for individual firms and used analysis of press comments to identify those parts of the annual report which seem to have information content. The value of this study lies in the new evidence that it provides suggesting the annual report and accounts does have some information value for the stockmarket for particular firms and in identifying those parts of the annual report found useful by investors. 12. The implications of this study are that whilst, in aggregate, {{there seems to be an}} apparent lack of incremental information in the annual report and accounts,this is not a true reflection of its value to all market participants. Unless the stockmarket has access to this financial <b>statement</b> potential <b>adverse</b> valuation consequences may be missed. This study suggests summary accounts are unsuitable for active stockmarket participants...|$|R
