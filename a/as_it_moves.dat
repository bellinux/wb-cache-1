5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves,</b> {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling {{allows them to}} reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk. (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Milan Records {{released}} a Chef soundtrack on May 6, 2014, {{three days before}} the film's release. The soundtrack is a combination of Latin jazz, New Orleans jazz and blues, which serve as background to the storyline <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> through Miami, New Orleans and Austin, respectively. The film's music was chosen by music supervisor Mathieu Schreyer, while the incidental music was scored by Lyle Workman.|$|E

50|$|In late April a {{circulation}} {{began to develop}} within a monsoon depression in the South China Sea, forming into a tropical depression on April 27 when it was 710 km {{to the west of}} Manila. <b>It</b> strengthened <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to the west and became Tropical Storm Leo the next day. The storm then performed a cyclonic loop off the Vietnamese coast and began to intensify, becoming a typhoon <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to the northeast. As <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> towards China under a high-level ridge Typhoon Leo rapidly intensified to its peak with 205 km/h (125 mph) winds. However, it did not sustain this for long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> then <b>moved</b> northeast into a high shear environment and <b>it</b> weakened <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to the north. Leo made landfall on May 2 as a tropical depression. By this time, its convection had become separated from its circulation. Shortly afterwards, Leo dissipated overland.|$|R

5|$|The pouring {{process has}} an {{influence}} on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.|$|E
5|$|The spitzenkörper is a {{component}} of the endomembrane system found only in fungi, and is associated with hyphal tip growth. It is a phase-dark body that is composed of an aggregation of membrane-bound vesicles containing cell wall components, serving as a point of assemblage and release of such components intermediate between the Golgi and the cell membrane. The spitzenkörper is motile and generates new hyphal tip growth <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> forward.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
50|$|Ewiniar {{gradually}} weakened <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> over colder waters, {{and made}} landfall in South Korea on July 10 as a severe tropical storm, having briefly threatened {{to make landfall}} on impoverished North Korea. Ewiniar passed within 50 km of Seoul <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> across the country before becoming extratropical over the Sea of Japan the next day. Ewiniar had also earlier brushed the Ryūkyū Islands of Japan.|$|R

5|$|The C-SPAN network's core {{programming}} is {{live coverage of}} the U.S. House and Senate, with the C-SPAN channel emphasizing the United States House of Representatives. Between 1979 and May 2011, the network televised more than 24,246 hours of floor action. C-SPAN2, the first of the C-SPAN spin-off networks, provides uninterrupted {{live coverage of the}} United States Senate. With coverage of the House and Senate, viewers can track legislation <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> through both bodies of Congress. Important debates in Congress that C-SPAN has covered live include the Persian Gulf conflict during 1991, and the House impeachment vote and Senate trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998 and 1999. When the House or Senate are not in session, C-SPAN channels broadcast other public affairs programming.|$|E
5|$|Oceanic crust, {{which forms}} {{the bedrock of}} abyssal plains, is {{continuously}} being created at mid-ocean ridges (a type of divergent boundary) by {{a process known as}} decompression melting. Plume-related decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the Hawaiian islands, as well as the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. This phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and oceanic plateaus (two types of large igneous provinces). Decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> upwards under mid-ocean ridges. This upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new oceanic crust. Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate, usually associated with seafloor spreading. The age of oceanic crust is therefore a function of distance from the mid-ocean ridge. The youngest oceanic crust is at the mid-ocean ridges, and it becomes progressively older, cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid-ocean ridges as part of the process called mantle convection.|$|E
5|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.|$|E

5|$|Julian's comitatus, {{although}} only half its normal size, was of high quality, containing {{some of the}} best regiments in the Late Roman army, with an awesome combat reputation. All were palatini (top-grade regiments). A substantial proportion of his troops were of barbarian, mostly Germanic, birth. An analysis of known names of officers and men in the auxilia palatina infantry regiments suggests that anywhere between 33% and 50% of the effectives were barbarian-born (the Roman-born troops were mostly Gallo-Romans). Of the German-born recruits, many would probably have been Alamanni. There is little evidence that this affected their loyalty. On the contrary, the history of Julian's Gallic campaign shows that his barbarian troops were fiercely loyal and reliable. It is true that there were a few isolated cases of Germanic deserters who defected to the enemy, but these were mostly motivated by personal reasons, not by ethnic solidarity. The only recorded instance of the latter was an officer who allegedly alerted members of his own tribe that Julian was planning a campaign against them. In the vast majority of cases, it is clear that regimental loyalties prevailed over ethnic ones. This is evidenced by the fierce alacrity of Julian's troops to engage with the enemy and the determination with which they fought the battle (3 of the 4 tribuni killed at Strasbourg had barbarian names). Regarding training, the Roman troops were career professionals, constantly drilled in formation manoeuvres and combat techniques. Their most important advantage in a pitched battle was formation drill: the ability to hold one's position in a unit at regular intervals, and to replace fallen comrades, so that a unit maintains its shape and coherence <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> or engages.|$|E
