5|$|The {{hotel was}} opened by Swiss hotelier César Ritz in May 1906, {{eight years after}} he {{established}} the Hôtel Ritz Paris. After a weak beginning, the hotel began to gain popularity {{towards the end of}} World War I, and became popular with politicians, socialites, writers and actors of the day in particular. David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> during {{the latter half of the}} war, and it was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey. Noël Coward was a notable diner <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1914, Lady Diana Cooper's future husband, Duff Cooper, then a Foreign Office official, dined <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> {{with the}} Earl of Essex and his American wife, Adele Capell (née Grant) and Patrick Shaw-Stewart, and {{later that day}} {{announced}} that World War I had broken out to the party. Before the war began, the German and Austrian embassies both retained tables <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Restaurant. The hotel suffered during the war, and lost nearly £50,000 in 1915 alone; the ballroom was usually empty and lights went out by 10pm, but rooms were still in demand and the hoteliers believed it to be worth keeping open. Socialites such as Lady Cynthia Asquith, daughter-in-law of H. H. Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood were documented in her diaries to have dined <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> {{in the spring of}} 1916. The following year, she held a lavish dinner party with the likes of Osbert Sitwell, Gilbert Russell and Maud Nelke and Clare Tennant.|$|E

Although the band continued to tour regularly, the songs from Imaginos had already disappeared from their shows by the end of 1989, never to be performed live again.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, {{theatrical}} agent Walter Jordan encouraged Elmer Rice {{to dramatize}} an unpublished novel by Hayden Talbot. At the time, Rice {{was best known}} for his 1914 Broadway play On Trial, which featured the first use of flashback, a narrative technique he adapted from film, in a Broadway production. Rice's adaptation of Talbot's work, It Is the Law, again featured a story told in flashback. It ran for 125 performances <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Theatre, and was a modest success.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> to hotel guests only, as those staying <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E

Anna calls him back in and says she has cleared her evening. Will is exhilarated, before remembering that he is expected at his sister Honey's birthday party; Anna surprises him by offering to be his date.|$|E

5|$|Bell {{was then}} an {{employee}} of the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one point, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz.</b> From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.|$|E
5|$|Many {{novels of}} the Lost Generation feature {{scenes in the}} Ritz, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender Is The Night and Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Noël Coward's play Semi-Monde {{is perhaps the most}} notable work {{covering}} the hotel in detail, following the escapades of an extravagant, promiscuous fictional Paris elite between 1924 and 1926. In the Bret Easton Ellis novel Glamorama, a group of supermodels turned terrorists plant a home-made bomb in the Ritz, resulting in its destruction. In The Da Vinci Code, the protagonist, Robert Langdon, stays at the hotel while in Paris, as do Andrea Sachs and Miranda Priestly in Lauren Weisberger's The Devil Wears Prada. The final chapter of Ian Fleming's James Bond novel From Russia, with Love is set at the hotel. The villain, Rosa Klebb, stays in room 602 and engages in a battle with Bond which results in her death. In Julian Fellowes' novel Snobs (2004), those attending Earl Broughton's pre-marriage bachelor party are accommodated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though the {{reputation}} of tailoring on Savile Row is for made-to-measure suits, ready-to-wear clothes were introduced by Gieves & Hawkes, a company formed in 1974 by the merger of two separate businesses who both date from the late 19th century: Gieves, a Royal Navy tailor founded in Portsmouth; and Hawkes, a London-based cap-maker and tailor to the British Army. Hardy Amies Ltd further broadened the scope and appeal of tailoring in Savile Row: in 1961, he staged the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Hotel in London, he designed costumes for the 1966 England World Cup team, and for the 1968 film , and dressed the Queen, designing the gown used for the Silver Jubilee portrait in 1977. Hardy Amies founded the company in 1946, converting the bombed out shell of No.14. Though Amies sold the business and retired in 2001, the company is still operating from No. 14, now {{under the control of}} Fung Capital.|$|E

PiL played behind this screen with lights rear projecting their shadows on to the screen. Expecting a more traditional rock show, the audience reacted by pelting the projection screen with beer bottles and eventually pulling down the screen.|$|E
25|$|Gary Moore was {{the first}} guitarist {{approached}} to replace Rhoads, but he refused. Former Gillan guitarist Bernie Tormé replaced Rhoads once the tour resumed, though his tenure in the band would last less than one month. During an audition for guitarists in a hotel room, Osbourne selected Night Ranger's Brad Gillis to finish the tour. The tour culminated in {{the release of the}} 1982 live album Speak of the Devil, recorded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> in New York City. A live tribute album for Rhoads was also later released.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fourth}} show, Charlie Dominici {{was let go}} because the band was {{starting}} to feel the limitations of his voice based upon the vocal style they wanted. The band was looking for a singer with a style more like Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate, and Dominici's stage presence was not what they wanted for a front man. Shortly after, however, the band Marillion asked Dream Theater to open for them at a gig <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> in New York, so Dominici was given the opportunity to perform one last time. It would be another two years before Dream Theater had a replacement vocalist.|$|E
