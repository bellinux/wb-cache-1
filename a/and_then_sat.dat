5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked {{open the door to}} the office <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the duke of Suffolk's murder, Beaumont had been an {{associate}} of the by now recalcitrant Richard, duke of York, having been one of the duke's feoffees in May 1436 and March 1441, and possibly even acting as the duke's councillor on occasion. He had also joined York on the king's council during York's first Protectorate (March 1453 – January 1454). But as York drew further from the court, so Beaumont appears to have moved towards it; although he appears to have not been present at the first battle of St Albans in 1455, he had already stood with the king against York at the latter's stand-off with king at Dartford in 1452, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> in judgment on some of his men. He eventually joined the anti-Neville faction at court; although his wife was a Neville, her family had by now aligned themselves with the duke of York. He was amongst the party of lords that reported to parliament that the king was sick and they 'coud not rouse him' in March 1454. He was also an arbitrator between York and the king's party, headed by the duke of Somerset after the king's recovery in 1454; although Griffiths says not a 'strictly impartial' one. Indeed, Griffiths suggests that his appointment to the council on 15 April 1454, after the king's recovery and York's dismissal, was part of a concerted attempt to 're-balance' the council after the protectorate. He was even reported (although wrongly) to have been recruiting an army to march against London in 1454. He {{was one of the few}} Lords Temporal to remain in Henry VI's council in the closing years of the decade, by which time he was the queen's chief steward. He was also part of the royal commission set up by parliament in July 1455 to examine royal household expenditure; the trust the Queen placed in him was demonstrated on 28 January 1457 when he was appointed to the council of the young Prince of Wales, which had responsibility for his estate management, expenditure, personnel, and administration.|$|E

25|$|Waldeck's {{first contact}} with the art of ancient Mesoamerica {{was when he was}} hired by the {{publisher}} Henry Berthoud to prepare some plates for an 1822 book entitled Description of the Ruins of an Ancient City. This book was an English translation of the 1787 report on Palenque by Antonio del Río which had been commissioned for Charles III of Spain <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> unpublished in the National Archives of Spain. Waldeck's engravings were much more beautiful and artistic than the original drawings he worked from, and gave the monuments a decidedly Egyptian look, in line with his patron's views that the ancient Mesoamerican Native Americans were the Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E

I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E
500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> back and thought about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} section, the song [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You" [...] {{featured}} Madonna atop a piano, cloaked {{in a black}} shroud. She {{was surrounded by a}} circular video screen which showed imagery of waves splashing and rainfall. Madonna then performed [...] "Spanish Lesson", featuring a flamenco-influenced dance solo by Alexander Kolpakov. She played the guitar once again for [...] "Miles Away". [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] featured the Ukrainian-gypsy group, Kolpakov Trio, incorporating the gypsy wedding song, [...] "Lela Pala Tute". At the end of the song, Madonna marched ahead with a band of violin players {{to the front of the}} stage <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> aside with her dancers for a solo performance from Kolpakov Trio, who performed the traditional song [...] "Doli Doli". She returned to the stage for [...] "You Must Love Me", the Academy Award winning song from, Evita. The act ended with [...] "Get Stupid", a video interlude portraying global warming, famine and other global issues, while juxtaposing John McCain with Hitler and Barack Obama with Gandhi. In the final act, Madonna appeared on stage for a duet of the song [...] "4 Minutes" [...] with Justin Timberlake and Timbaland, both of them appearing on screens. A remix of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] followed, featuring elements from [...] "Feels Like Home" [...] and video screens depicting messages from the Bible, the Quran, the Torah and the Talmud. The electric guitar was played by Madonna for the performance of [...] "Ray of Light". She then sought audience participation, asking them to request for [...] "an oldie but goodie". Madonna sang the first verse and chorus of the requested song, before moving onto a rock version of [...] "Hung Up". After a brief video featuring a modern take on classic arcade games was played, Madonna returned on stage for the finale performance, [...] "Give It 2 Me", ending the song with a sing-a-long of the chorus. The show ended with the words [...] "Game Over" [...] appearing on the video screens.|$|E

[...] During the tenures of these senators, the candy desk was not fixed to one particular spot.

2500|$|With the {{publication}} of his eighth novel White Noise in 1985, DeLillo began a rapid ascendancy to being a noted and respected novelist. White Noise was arguably a major breakthrough both commercially and artistically for DeLillo, earning him a National Book Award for Fiction and a place among the academic canon of contemporary postmodern novelists. DeLillo remained as detached as ever from his growing reputation: when called upon to give an acceptance speech for the Award, he simply said, [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't be here tonight, but I thank you all for coming," [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> down. The influence and impact of White Noise {{can be seen in the}} writing of such authors as David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem, Jonathan Franzen, Dave Eggers, Martin Amis, Zadie Smith and Richard Powers (who provides an introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of the novel). Among the 39 proposed titles for the novel were [...] "All Souls", [...] "Ultrasonic", [...] "The American Book of the Dead", [...] "Psychic Data" [...] and [...] "Mein Kampf"; however, DeLillo acknowledged in a 2005 interview that White Noise was a fine choice, remarking [...] "Once a title is affixed to a book, it becomes as indelible as a sentence or a paragraph." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1800, McGready {{was joined}} at Red River by several area Presbyterian ministers, {{including}} William Hodge, John Rankin (whom McGready had recently appointed the minister for the Gasper River congregation), and the brothers, William and John McGee, the latter a Methodist minister who, some years later, wrote his {{account for the}} Methodist Missionary Magazine. [...] His narrative painted a vivid picture of the revival’s beginnings: [...] “All was silent until Monday, {{the last day of}} the feast. … [...] While Mr. Hodge was preaching, a woman in the East end got an uncommon blessing, broke through order, and shouted for some time <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> down in silence." [...] McGee continued, relating that most of the ministers were already gathered outside the meeting house while the people remained seated inside, unwilling to leave, when his brother, William, “felt such a power come on him that he quit his seat and sat down in the floor of the pulpit." [...] John McGee began to tremble as weeping erupted through the congregation. [...] The woman in the east end began to shout again and McGee started toward her just as someone reminded him that his Presbyterian hosts were “much for order” and would not “hear this confusion; go back and be quiet." [...] McGee turned to go back and was “near falling” when he changed his mind and “went through the house shouting and exhorting with all possible ecstasy and energy." [...] Using the term that came to be associated with the revival phenomenon of collapsing in a state of physical helplessness, McGee continued: [...] “The floor was soon covered with the slain; their screams for mercy pierced the heavens.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At 21:04 (UTC+3), on 8 June 2016, two {{perpetrators}} {{dressed in}} suits and ties {{arrived at the}} Max Brenner Cafe in the Sarona Market complex near HaArba'a Street in Tel Aviv. They inspected the area <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sat</b> down on chairs outside, ordering desserts. At 21:27 the perpetrators stood up and fired at the diners until one of the perpetrators' firearms jammed. He slammed the firearm {{on the floor and}} the perpetrators started to run away from the site. The perpetrators wounded 11 people. Four were critically wounded, and later succumbed to their wounds. Two others were in severe condition, two in moderate condition and four in light condition. An additional 14 people suffering from symptoms of anxiety received medical attention at the scene and at the hospitals. The two did not have an escape plan, an official of the Israel Security Agency said, after investigation, that they [...] "trusted in Allah". The perpetrators fled and split up, and at 21:40, one of the perpetrators was wounded and neutralized after a gunfight with a civil guard of Kol Yisrael and was taken to Ichilov Hospital in serious condition. The other unarmed perpetrator ran in a nearby street, near the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. He encountered an off-duty policeman (who was in plainclothes) and asked him for a glass of water and the unsuspecting policeman invited him into his home with his family. The man then rushed {{to the scene of the}} attack, leaving the perpetrator in his home. The family tried to speak to the perpetrator but he didn't respond and was stressed. The wife of the policeman said she didn't suspect anything and that she thought he was a man who ran from the attack. When the policeman saw the other perpetrator was dressed just like the man he invited into his home, he rushed back to his home and captured the perpetrator who tried to escape. While arresting him, one of the policemen called in to help entered the home with his weapon drawn. When he saw that the perpetrator was already captured, he returned his weapon to its sheath, at which point it discharged a bullet and one of the policemen was wounded from shrapnel.|$|E
