40|$|Cisplatin (cis-DDP) is a {{chemotherapy}} {{agent that}} {{is used as a}} treatment for several types of cancer. Unfortunately it could injure several areas of the cochlea, including outer hair cells in the Organ of Corti, the spiral ganglion and the stria vascularis. Cis-DDP has been shown to induce <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms appear to involve the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of antioxidant enzymes which can trigger cell death. Approaches to chemoprevention include the administration of antioxidants to protect against ROS. The Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761 o Ginkgoselect®) is known to have antioxidant proprieties with a free radicals scavenging effect, and protecting cells against apoptosis. It has been used for otoprotection study only in vivo model, with positive effects. One of the goal of this study was that to verify the protective effects of ginkgoselect on a mouse inner ear cell line (OC-k 3). Our data showed that Ginkgo biloba extract protects against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. The calcium ion (Ca 2 +) regulates hair and neuronal cells function in the inner ear. It’s involved in the mechanical signal transduction, and release of neurotransmitters. Changes in its intracellular concentration determines the cell’s fate. It’s a second messenger that regulates the activation of proteins involved in apoptosis. Calcium channel antagonist drugs was studied as another mechanism to protect cells from cisplatin ototoxicity. Flunarizine is a calcium blocker drug, currently used to treat diseases of the inner ear, such as vertigo. There are very few data on flunarizine protective effect against cisplatin damages. The PC 12 cell (rat pheochromocytoma cell line) within several days of NGF exposure, differentiate in sym-pathetic neurons, it’s therefore always used as a neuronal model. In this thesis we have been evaluated the cisplatin toxicity on these cells, undifferentiated and differentiated, and the ability of flunarizina to protect cells, in order to conduct a basic survey focused on the mechanism of both drugs. In sum, flunarizina is a good protector against the cisplatin toxicity, it’s able to preventing apoptosis by acting on expression of proteins involved in programmed cell death (14 - 3 - 3 β, protein kinase C and GAPDH). Present results are of great interest to conduct further investigations on spiral ganglion primary neurons cultures.

Treatment of 3 -day-old rat organ of Corti explants with these caspase inhibitors protected > 80 % of the auditory hair cells from cisplatin-damage initiated apoptosis. Dissociated cell cultures of 3 -day-old rat spinal ganglia treated {{with any of these}} three caspase inhibitors in addition to exogenous neurotrophin have highly significant increases in neuronal survival following cisplatin exposure. These results indicate that loss of <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> as a result of cisplatin-induced damage involves apoptosis and that blocking of this cell death pathway at the caspase level effectively rescues both hair cells and neurons.

40|$|Abstract Background Heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) protects {{inner ear}} cells from damage and death induced by e. g. heat or toxins. Benzoquinone {{ansamycin}} antibiotic geldanamycin (GA) was demonstrated to induce {{the expression of}} HSP 70 in various animal cell types. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} whether GA induces HSP 70 in the organ of Corti (OC), which contains the <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells,</b> and whether GA can protect these cells from toxicity caused by a common aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin. Methods To address these questions, we used the OC explants isolated from p 3 -p 5 rats. As a read-out, we used RT-PCR, ELISA and immunofluorescence. Results We found that GA at the concentration of 2 μM efficiently induced HSP 70 expression on mRNA and protein level in the OC explants. Confocal microscopy revealed that HSP 70 induced by GA is expressed by hair cells and interdental cells of spiral limbus. Preincubation of explants with 2 μM GA prior to adding gentamicin (500 μM) significantly reduced the loss of outer but not inner hair cells, suggesting different mechanisms of otoprotection needed for these two cell types. Conclusion GA induced HSP 70 in the <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> and partially protected them from toxicity of gentamicin. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of GA otoprotection may provide insights for preventative therapy of the hearing loss caused by aminoglycoside antibiotics. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that bcl- 2 prevents oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> in explants of the organ of Corti and dissociated cell cultures of the spiral ganglion. METHODS: Organ of Corti explants and dissociated spiral ganglion cell cultures obtained from 3 -day-old (P 3) rats or adult spiral ganglion cell cultures from 28 -day-old (P 28) rats were transduced with vectors containing a human bcl- 2 gene. Cultures were then exposed to neomycin, cisplatin or subjected to withdrawal of neurotrophin supplementation. Outcome measures included hair cell and neuron counts, mitochondrial membrane potential and a histological measure of apoptosis. RESULTS: Expression of bcl- 2 in the organ of Corti explants and neuronal cell cultures provided a significant level of protection against cell death. Bcl- 2 expression in the organ of Corti explants also protected mitochondria from loss of membrane potential and blocked an early step in the commitment of hair cells to apoptosis.

40|$|Neurosensory {{responses}} of hearing and balance are mediated by receptors in specialized neuroepithelial <b>sensory</b> <b>cells.</b> Any {{disruption of the}} biochemical and molecular pathways that facilitate these responses can result in severe deficits, including hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.

Damage to <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> is not reversible, and if sufficient damage and cell death have taken place, the resultant deficit may lead to permanent deafness.

Recently there has been an increased interest in the auditory research community to explore the regeneration of mammalian auditory hair cells and restoration of their function.

40|$|Objective: Cisplatinium {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used anticancer drugs. Side effects such as ototoxicity, {{nephrotoxicity}} and neurotoxicity limit to reach high doses. It mainly induces apoptosis in <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells.</b> Resveratrol is a polyphenol mostly found in grape skin and seed. It has anti-oxidant, neuroprotective and dose dependent antiapoptotic properties. It was claimed to protect side effects of some chemotherapeutic agents. In this study possible otoprotective effects of resveratrol were studied in House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 cell line. Materials and Methods: Cells were exposed to cisplatinium, resveratrol and their combination for 24 hours at different doses. Cell viability analysis, apoptosis and expression of 84 apoptosis related genes were determined in pre-optimized doses. Results: Resveratrol pretreatment of the cells before cisplatinium led to 33 % decrease in apoptotic cell count when they were compared with controls. Expression of apototic genes was decreased with cisplatinium and resveratrol combination.

40|$|Ears {{evolved in}} many groups of moths {{to detect the}} {{echolocation}} calls of predatory bats. Although the neurophysiology of bat detection has been intensively studied in moths for decades, the relationship between sound-induced movement of the noctuid tympanic membrane and action potentials in the <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> (A 1 and A 2) has received little attention. Using laser Doppler vibrometry, we measured the velocity and displacement of the tympanum in response to pure tone pulses for moths that were intact or prepared for neural recording. When recording from the auditory nerve, the displacement of the tympanum at the neural threshold remained constant across frequencies, whereas velocity varied with frequency. This suggests that the key biophysical parameter for triggering action potentials in the <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> of noctuid moths is tympanum displacement, not velocity. The validity of studies on the neurophysiology of moth hearing rests {{on the assumption that}} the dissection and recording procedures do not affect the biomechanics of the ear. There were no consistent differences in tympanal velocity or displacement when moths were intact or prepared for neural recordings for sound levels close to neural threshold, indicating that this and other neurophysiological studies provide good estimates of what intact moths hear at threshold...|$|R

Here we focus on inherited human disorders involving members of the cadherin superfamily. Most of the advances concern monogenic disorders. Yet, with the development of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studies, cad-herin genes are emerging as susceptibility genes in multifactorial disorders. Various skin and heart disorders revealed the critical role played by desmosomal cadherins in epidermis, hairs, and myocardium, which experience high mechanical stress. Of particular interest in that respect is the study of Usher syndrome type 1 (USH 1), a hereditary syndromic form of deafness.

40|$|The {{effect of}} sound {{stimulation}} on phosphoinositide turnover {{was investigated in}} the inner ear of the guinea pig. The perilymphatic spaces of the cochlea were perfused with [32 P]orthophosphate (32 Pi) and labeled lipids analyzed in the tissues of the lateral wall of the cochlea (stria vascularis and spiral ligament) and the basilar membrane (organ of Corti). Consistent with previous results, polyphosphoinositides rapidly incorporated 32 Pi comprising 70 - 80 % of labeled lipids in all tissues analyzed: phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdInsP 2) was 66 % of total [32 P]phospholipids in the lateral wall tissues and 45 % in the organ of Corti; phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PtdInsP) was 28 % in the lateral wall and 24 % in the organ of Corti. After 90 min of labeling the hydrolysis of lipids was measured by replacing the radioactive Pi with 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 in the perfusate for the 30 min "chase". Exposure of the ear to sound (100 dB white noise) during the chase significantly augmented the hydrolysis of [32 P]PtdInsP 2 in the organ of Corti by 20 % (P = 0. 01) {{but not in the}} lateral wall tissues. Since the organ of Corti contains the <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells,</b> the results suggest that the observed increased hydrolysis of PtdInsP 2 is associated with auditory processing in the inner ear...|$|R

In a number of biological systems these calcium levels are controlled by inositol trisphosphate (InsP 3), the second messenger of the phosphoinositide cascade. We have investigated whether the phosphoinositides function in the signal transfer in mammalian <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells.</b> Live isolated outer hair cells synthesize the lipids of the phosphoinositide cycle, phosphatidic acid (Ptd), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PtdInsP) and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdInsP 2). After one hour of incubation with [32 P]orthophosphate, Ptd constituted 21 +/- 7 % of labeled lipids, PtdIns 19 +/- 5 %, PtdInsP 28 +/- 7 % and PtdInsP, 33 +/- 7 %. Contractions were elicited in isolated cells after their membrane was permeabilized with Triton X- 100. Addition of calcium and ATP resulted in contractions (average, 7. 2 % of initial cell length) in 81 % of the cells studied; the omission of ATP or calcium (i. e. {{the presence of the}} calcium-chelator EGTA) reduced the incidence of contractions to 0 % and 17 %, respectively. In the absence of calcium, the putative second messenger, InsP 3, caused contractions in 63 % of the observed cells while the physiologically inactive agents inositol and inositol bisphosphate failed to elicit responses. The results are compatible with the suggestion that InsP 3 mediates contractility in outer hair cells...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Almost 90 % of {{all cases}} of congenital, non-syndromic, severe to {{profound}} inherited deafness display an autosomal recessive mode of transmission (DFNB forms). To date, 47 causal DFNB genes have been identified, but many others remain to be discovered. We report the study of two siblings born to consanguineous Algerian parents and affected by isolated, profound congenital deafness. METHOD: Whole-exome sequencing was carried out on these patients after a failure to identify mutations in the DFNB genes frequently involved. RESULTS: A biallelic nonsense mutation, c. 88 C > T (p. Gln 30 *), was identified in EPS 8 that encodes epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8, a 822 amino-acid protein involved in actin dynamics. This mutation predicts a truncated inactive protein or no protein at all. The mutation was also present, in the heterozygous state, in one clinically unaffected sibling and in both unaffected parents, and was absent from the other two unaffected siblings. It was not found in 120 Algerian normal hearing control individuals or in the Exome Variant Server database. EPS 8 is an F-actin capping and bundling protein. Mutant mice lacking EPS 8 (Eps 8 -/- mice), which {{is present in the}} hair bundle, the sensory antenna of the <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> that operate the mechano-electrical transduction, are also profoundly deaf and have abnormally short hair bundle stereocilia.

Stereocilia actin incorporation is remarkably slow and restricted to filament barbed ends in a small tip compartment, with minimal accumulation {{in the rest of}} the actin core. Shorter rows of stereocilia, which have mechanically gated ion channels, show more variable actin turnover than the tallest stereocilia, which lack channels.

40|$|AbstractA force-conveying {{role of the}} lipid {{membrane}} across various mechanoreceptors is now an accepted hypothesis. However, such a mechanism is still not fully understood for mechanotransduction in the hair bundle of <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> hair <b>cells.</b> A major goal of this theoretical assessment {{was to investigate the}} role of the {{lipid membrane}} in auditory mechanotransduction, especially in generating nonlinear bundle force versus displacement measurements, one of the main features of auditory mechanotransduction. To this end, a hair bundle model that generates lipid membrane tented deformation in the stereocilia was developed. A computational analysis of the model not only reproduced nonlinear bundle force measurements but also generated membrane energy that is potentially sufficient to activate the mechanosensitive ion channel of the hair cell. In addition, the model provides biophysical insight into 1) the likelihood that the channel must be linked in some way to the tip link; 2) how the interplay of the bending and stretching of the lipid bilayer may be responsible for the nonlinear force versus displacement response; 3) how measurements of negative stiffness may be a function of the rotational stiffness of the rootlets; and 4) how the standing tension of the tip link is required to interpret migration of the nonlinear force versus displacement and activation curves. These are all features of hair cell mechanotransduction, but the underlying biophysical mechanism has proved elusive for the last three decades...|$|R
40|$|Connexin gap {{junctions}} play {{an important}} role in hearing function, but the mechanism by which this contribution occurs is unknown. Connexins in the cochlea are expressed only in supporting cells; no connexin expression occurs in <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> hair <b>cells.</b> A gap junctional channel is formed by two hemichannels. Here, we show that connexin hemichannels in the cochlea can release ATP at levels that account for the submicromolar concentrations measured in the cochlear fluids in vivo. The release could be increased 3 - to 5 -fold by a reduction of extracellular Ca 2 + or an increase in membrane stress, and blocked by gap junctional blockers. We also demonstrated that extracellular ATP at submicromolar levels apparently affected outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility, which is an active cochlear amplifier determining cochlear sensitivity to sound stimulation in mammals. ATP reduced OHC electromotility and the slope factor of the voltage dependence and shifted the operating point to reduce the active amplifier gain. ATP also reduced the generation of distortion products. Immunofluorescent staining showed that purinergic receptors P 2 x 2 and P 2 x 7 were distributed on the OHC surface. Blockage of P 2 receptors eliminated the effect of ATP on the OHC electromotility. The data revealed that there is a hemichannel-mediated, purinergic intercellular signaling pathway between supporting cells and hair cells in the cochlea to control hearing sensitivity. The data also demonstrated a potential source of ATP in the cochlea...|$|R
40|$|Hair <b>cells,</b> the <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells,</b> are {{the sole}} afferent input to the spiral {{ganglion}} neurons (SGNs). HCs and adjacent organ of Corti supporting cells provide neurotrophic factors that prevent SGN degeneration. Following loss of hair cells, SGNs degenerate and gradually die. Most deafness, whether congenital, age-related, or due to noise, disease, trauma, or ototoxin, {{is a consequence}} of hair cell loss. Cochlear implants, the only means of restoring hearing to deaf people, electrically stimulate the SGNs, replacing the sensory function of hair cells. SGN degeneration compromises the efficacy of cochlear implants. For example, degeneration of the peripheral process raises the threshold for electrical stimulation, necessitating higher currents that reduce battery life and, by stimulating SGNs in a larger volume, reduce the precision of frequency representation. The goal of my research is to determine why SGNs degenerate or die so that therapies can be developed to prevent it. My approach to this goal focuses on answering two significant questions. First, because the death of SGNs does not occur immediately after hair cell loss implies that hair cells are not the sole source of neurotrophic support for SGNs. Some neurotrophic support must be available even after hair cells are gone. What are the sources of neurotrophic factors for SGNs after hair cells are lost and why are they ultimately insufficient to prevent SGN death? In Chapter II I answer this question by quantifying neurotrophic factor expression in regions accessible to the SGNs: the organ of Corti and the cochlear nucleus. Answering this question will identify the key endogenous factors that support SGNs, which will facilitate development of optimal therapies. Second, the fact that SGNs die {{over a long period of}} time raises the possibility that there is a difference between SGNs that die early and those that die weeks or months later. Is the time a cell dies purely stochastic or is there something distinctive about cells that die at different times? In Chapter III, I use microarray-based gene expression profiling to compare the initial population of SGNs at the onset of SGN death to a population of SGNs still surviving at a time when about half of the SGNs have already died. Identifying distinctive molecular features in the population of cells that can survive longer in the absence of hair cells may suggest therapeutic approaches to preventing SGN degeneration or death. Finally, Chapter IV addresses some of the molecular features identified by the microarray-based profiling by examining their role in SGN degeneration...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{members of}} the {{mammalian}} SLC 26 anion transporter family serve two fundamentally distinct functions. Whereas most members transport different anion substrates {{across a variety of}} epithelia, prestin (SLC 26 A 5) is special, functioning as a membrane-localized motor protein that generates electrically induced motions (electromotility) in <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> hair <b>cells</b> of the mammalian inner ear. The transport mechanism of SLC 26 proteins is not well understood, and a mechanistic relation between anion transport and electromotility has been suggested but not firmly established so far. To address these questions, we have cloned prestin orthologs from chicken and zebrafish, nonmammalian vertebrates that presumably lack electromotility in their auditory systems. Using patch-clamp recordings, we show that these prestin orthologs, but not mammalian prestin, generate robust transport currents {{in the presence of the}} divalent anions sulfate or oxalate. Transport is blocked by salicylate, an inhibitor of electromotility generated by mammalian prestin. The dependence of transport equilibrium potentials on sulfate and chloride concentration gradients shows that the prestin orthologs are electrogenic antiporters, exchanging sulfate or oxalate for chloride in a strictly coupled manner with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry. These data identify transport mode and stoichiometry of electrogenic divalent/monovalent anion exchange and establish a reliable and simple method for the quantitative determination of the various transport modes that have been proposed for other SLC 26 transport proteins. Moreover, the sequence conservation between mammalian and nonmammalian prestin together with a common pharmacology of electromotility and divalent antiport suggest that the molecular mechanism behind electromotility is closely related to an anion transport cycle...|$|R

KCNQ 4 is expressed predominantly in the <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> outer hair <b>cells,</b> which {{are critical for}} sound amplification. Results We sequenced KCNQ 4 from Japanese patients with sensorineural hearing loss, and identified a novel missense mutation encoding a Tyr 270 His located at the N-terminus of the highly conserved pore helix sequence. As this patient was not accessible to us and information about them was limited, we used molecular modeling to investigate whether this novel mutation is hypothetically pathogenic. A careful examination of an in silico structural model of the KCNQ 4 pore region revealed that the Tyr 270 His mutation caused an alteration in the electrostatic surface potential of the pore helix. Conclusion We propose two possible {{means by which the}} Tyr 270 His mutation causes hearing loss: a positively charged His 270 side chain might enhance the helix dipole moment of the pore helix, thereby destabilizing the helix and/or the pore region, or it might disturb transport of K + through the channel by electrostatic repulsion. </p...|$|R

In the in vitro model for acoustic overstimulation, isolated cochlear outer hair cells were subjected to a pressure jet emanating from a glass micropipette aimed at the cell body. The pressure jet was generated by the vibrating shaft of a minishaker, hydraulically coupled to the micropipette. Such stimulation was found to cause increases of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration in most <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>cells.</b> The calcium changes were sustained, and no evidence of recovery of the elevated levels were seen after the termination of the stimulus. A system was also developed to measure the pressures delivered to the cells. This system {{was based on a}} piezoresistive pressure transducer connected to a glass micropipette brought into the immediate vicinity of cells subjected to the pressure jet, allowing highly localized pressure changes to be measured. The peak pressure that could be generated by the stimulus system was found to be 144 dB SPL. Taking the middle ear transfer function into account, this level would correspond to approximately 120 dB SPL at the tympanic membrane during normal sound stimulation. Using laser heterodyne interferometry, the sound-induced vibrations of the low-frequency regions of the inner ear were investigated. The responses of the perfused isolated temporal bone preparation was found to be similar to that of living animals, both in terms of sharpness of tuning and the presence of nonlinearities. These characteristics were also reflected in the extracellularly recorded receptor potentials of the hair cells. The mechanical and electrical responses of the low-frequency regions of the cochlea were substantially different from the high-frequency regions, however. Methods were developed to load the organ of Corti with fluorescent dyes and to measure the fluorescence after various experimental manipulations, using video-enhanced microscopy. The fluorescence images were further processed off-line, using a computerized algorithm, to remove out-of-focus information. When the isolated temporal bone preparation was subjected to acoustic overstimulation, large increases of the calcium concentration of the outer hair cells were seen. In addition, overstimulation caused contractions of the hearing organ that were reversible after the termination of the stimulus. Both the calcium changes and the contraction response could be expected to have severe effects on the function of the inner ear.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hearing loss {{induced by}} ototoxicity is a {{worldwide}} problem despite {{the development of}} newer antibiotics and chemotherapy agents. The cellular mechanisms responsible for aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss are still poorly understood. We have developed two different methods of studying the dynamic cellular and subcellular changes in the chick <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> epithelium that occur during hair cell death. The first study was performed in mature chicks after a single, high dose injection of gentamicin, which results in the rapid loss of all hair cells in the basal third of the cochlea. Chicks were sacrificed at discrete time points after drug treatment, and transmission electron microscopy was performed to study the ultrastructural changes in basal hair cells {{during the course of}} cell death. We noted various changes in the cell morphology including accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, dispersion of the cytoplasmic polyribosomes, mitochondrial swelling, and cellular extrusion by 24 h after injection. The next two studies were performed using tissue cultures from mature avian <b>auditory</b> <b>sensory</b> epithelium. Cultured <b>cells</b> were labeled using vital fluorescent markers, and levels of intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species within hair cells were studied following aminoglycoside exposure. We identified a dose-dependent increase in the levels of intracellular calcium, which was blocked by an inhibitor of voltage-gated calcium channels. We also found that levels of reactive oxygen species in hair cells greatly increased after exposure to gentamicin, and this response was blocked by two different antioxidants. These studies serve to identify key cellular and molecular changes in hair cells in response to ototoxic drugs. Further study of these processes may lead {{to a better understanding of}} how ototoxicity is induced and to potential preventative interventions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDefects in myosin VIIa lead to {{developmental}} anomalies of the <b>auditory</b> {{and visual}} <b>sensory</b> <b>cells.</b> We sought proteins {{interacting with the}} myosin VIIa tail by using the yeast two-hybrid system. Here, we report on shroom 2, a submembranous PDZ domain-containing protein {{that is associated with}} the tight junctions in multiple embryonic and adult epithelia. Shroom 2 directly interacts with the C-terminal MyTH 4 -FERM domain of myosin VIIa and with F-actin. In addition, a shroom 2 fragment containing the region of interaction with F-actin was able to protect actin filaments from cytochalasin-D-induced disruption in MDCK cells. Transfection experiments in MDCK and LE (L fibroblasts that express E-cadherin) cells led us to conclude that shroom 2 is targeted to the cell-cell junctions in the presence of tight junctions only. In Ca(2 +) -switch experiments on MDCK cells, ZO- 1 (also known as TJP 1) preceded GFP-tagged shroom 2 at the differentiating tight junctions. ZO- 1 directly interacts with the serine- and proline-rich region of shroom 2 in vitro. Moreover, the two proteins colocalize in vivo at mature tight junctions, and could be coimmunoprecipitated from brain and cochlear extracts. We suggest that shroom 2 and ZO- 1 form a tight-junction-associated scaffolding complex, possibly linked to myosin VIIa, that bridges the junctional membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton, thereby contributing to the stabilization of these junctions...|$|R
