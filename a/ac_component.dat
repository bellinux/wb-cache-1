25|$|Ripple {{current is}} the <b>AC</b> <b>component</b> of an applied source (often a {{switched-mode}} power supply) whose frequency may be constant or varying. Ripple current causes heat to be generated {{within the capacitor}} due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current flow across the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor. The equivalent series resistance (ESR) {{is the amount of}} internal series resistance one would add to a perfect capacitor to model this.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} {{application}} for DC capacitors is similarly diverse. Smoothing capacitors are used to reduce the <b>AC</b> <b>component</b> of fluctuating DC voltage (such as in power supplies for radio and television transmitters), and for high voltage testing equipment, DC controllers, measurement and control technology and cascaded circuits for generation of high DC voltage. Supporting capacitors, DC-filter or buffer circuit capacitors are used for energy storage in intermediate DC circuits, such as in frequency converters for poly-phase drives, and transistor and thyristor power converters. They {{must be able to}} absorb and release very high currents within short periods, the peak values of currents being substantially greater than the RMS values.|$|E

In signal processing terms, DC offset can be reduced in real-time by a high-pass filter. For stored digital signals, subtracting the mean amplitude from each sample will remove the offset. Very low frequencies can look like DC bias but are called [...] "slowly changing DC" [...] or [...] "baseline wander".|$|E
50|$|In {{a segment}} of DCC-powered track, it is {{possible}} to power a single analog model locomotive by itself (or in addition to the DCC equipped engines), depending on the choice of commercially available base systems. The technique is known as zero stretching. Either the high or the low pulse of the zero bits can be extended to make the average voltage (and thus the current) either forward or reverse. However, because the raw power contains a heavy <b>AC</b> <b>component,</b> DC motors heat up much more quickly than they would on DC power, and some motor types (particularly coreless electric motors) can be damaged by a DCC signal.|$|E
