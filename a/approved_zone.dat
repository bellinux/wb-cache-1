40|$|Research PaperBritain has {{traditionally}} {{tried to protect}} its livestock, fish and shellfish production industries from many serious diseases by restricting imports of live animals- fish and shellfish to those from countries free of specified important diseases affecting particular classes of stock. Although the primary aim of the European Union has been to remove restrictions on trade between member states, the restriction of movements of stock to avoid the introduction of serious diseases into disease-free areas has also been enshrined in EU legislation. For aquaculture animals, the provisions enabling such controls were introduced in 1991 in directive 91 / 67 of the Council of the European Communities (OJ No. L 46 / 1). These allowed for the delineation of 'approved zones' free {{of one or more}} specified diseases within which introductions of susceptible species from outwith the approved zones can be banned. This paper considers the economics of establishing an <b>approved</b> <b>zone</b> in Great Britain for the diseases Marteilia refringens and Bonamia ostreae, to which the native flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, is susceptible. The granting of an <b>approved</b> <b>zone</b> requires submission of evidence to the Commission, from three years of intensive resting to establish the disease-free status of the area. In Great Britain, this process of testing of shellfish in relation to the diseases was completed in 1995 and the decision was to be made whether to proceed with an application for <b>approved</b> <b>zone</b> status for these diseases. The maintenance of an <b>approved</b> <b>zone</b> involves costs for the industry and national government in terms of additional monitoring of shellfish health status and the monitoring and application of controls on Imports. The bearing of these costs provides an uncertain gain in terms of a reduction in the risk of introduction of the disease(s) into the area, and consequent losses, both of current shellfish stocks and future production of shellfish. An appropriate methodology for analysing a decision of this sort, in which risk and uncertainty are central factors, is provided by statistical decision theory (Schlaifer 1959. Charnoff and Moses 1959. Raiffa and Schlaifer 1961) and specifically the use of decision trees. These have been found useful in a very wide range of applications from medicine (Keeler 1995) to accounting (Siedel 1991) to American football (Stoughton 1986). From the literature, it is clear that their main use has been in the business context (Coles and Rowley 1995, Boys 1990, Brookfield 1988). There is little in the literature to indicate their use in assisting national policy decision-making, yet risk and uncertainty is just as likely to be important in national decisions as business decisions. In this paper, the use of decision trees to analyse the potential gain to Britain from <b>approved</b> <b>zone</b> status for Marteilia and Bonamia is discussed. Particular problems addressed are those relating to the assessment of probabilities of disease outbreak, and issues relating to the time-frame of the analysis, given that the costs of enforcing an <b>approved</b> <b>zone</b> may be discontinued at any point (along with the <b>approved</b> <b>zone),</b> whereas the losses incurred {{in the event of an}} outbreak of the disease may continue for many years...|$|E

40|$|This study reviews Clark County 2 ̆ 7 s {{non-conforming}} zone change {{process from}} 1990 to 2002. A non-conforming zone change, sometimes {{known as a}} non-conforming zone boundary amendment is a proposed request that is not {{within the range of}} residential densities and/or non-residential intensities indicated on the applicable land use plan map, master plan, or concept plan. This research explores and examines two questions raised by the Clark County 2 ̆ 7 s new implementation plan, which was approved in April 2003 to amend the non-conforming zone change process. 1) Clark County assumed there was a public perception that non-conforming zone changes were being approved without regard to the master plan. Was this assumption correct? 2) Are decisions in <b>approving</b> non-conforming <b>zone</b> changes consistent among all levels of decision making? According to the new implementation plan, the change is an effort to improve the negative public perception that land use plans are unimportant because of the continuous number of <b>approved</b> non-conforming <b>zone</b> changes. In addition, the ordinance indicates the need to improve public participation in the non-conforming zone change process. The changes in the new non-conforming zone change process have been principally {{based on the assumption that}} the old regulations were not effective. There is no clear knowledge of what was deemed effective or ineffective in the old process because neither data nor interviews were collected to support the statements and subsequent changes made. In order to test the two hypotheses: 1) Yes, there were too many non-conforming <b>zone</b> changes <b>approved</b> that did not adhere to the master plan, and 2) Yes, consistency of decisions among levels of decision making is low. This research evaluates and analyses randomly selected 687 non-conforming zone change reports in Clark County. The results from the non-conforming zone change reports will be used to propose recommendations that can be used by the Clark County Department of Comprehensive Planning to help improve the planning process in general, restore public confidence, and improve the public 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the non-conforming zone change process...|$|R
