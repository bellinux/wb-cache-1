40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>assembly</b> that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the spanner nuts required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque wrench tool adapter that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face spanner wrench, contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut...|$|E

40|$|This thesis work is {{a result}} of studies done at Saab Surveillance, with the {{objective}} to evaluate cooling technologies and find out which of them that are or are not suited to be implemented on a generic house and plug-in units, meeting the higher thermal demands of the future. This task includes five products, all with their own pros and cons created by Thermacore, a company of advanced cooling technologies with its European head office located in Ashington, England. First up was to realize under which circumstances these products were supposed to operate. This included application areas like land, sea and air which all have different grades of requirements set for today’s generic houses and plug-in units. To find the answers for these factors a trip to England and Thermacore was made and together with their engineers, hypothetical thermal simulations could be developed but also gather a wide understanding of each technology´s possibilities and limits. When all the information was assembled an extended evaluation process could be completed. The result showed that the superior cooling technology differed depending on mainly two things. The first one was taken in regard of which application area it was supposed to operate in but also where it is being implemented either in a generic house or on a plug-in unit. In conclusion of this report it showed that for the plug-in unit the recommended technology for land and sea units was to be <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> pipe <b>assembly.</b> The construction contains four flattened heat pipes encapsulated in an aluminum plate. Regarding air applications and foremost the fighter jets, the most suited technology was the k-Core. It will endure the exposure of both high vibrations and shocks but above all in an effective way cool the system.

40|$|Integrated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) {{generally}} {{have a high}} output power and generate significant amounts of heat, which needs {{to be removed from}} the chip to ensure continued operation. Since IGBT chips are commonly mounted on a layered assembly structure which is in turn mounted onto <b>a</b> <b>heat</b> sink <b>assembly,</b> the thermal dissipation properties of the layered structure are crucial in keeping temperatures within operational boundaries. Traditionally, the selection of materials for the layered structure has been largely influenced by the thermal conductivity for heat dissipation, the similarity of the coefficient of thermal expansion for physical integrity of the structure and to a lesser extent, the weight of the material. These principles of material selection are indeed adequate for steady state operation of IGBTs. However, IGBTs are often installed in applications where they are subjected to pulsed operation, which is predominantly transient. During transient operation, it was found that thermal conductivity was not necessarily the best criterion to use for material selection within the layered structure. In certain instances, materials that absorbed heat rather than conducting it yielded lower temperatures and higher cooling rates, which in turn resulted in lower start temperatures in the next pulse. This study therefore proposes an additional material selection criterion, one based on the density-specific heat capacity product that should be used in conjunction with thermal conductivity to guide the material selection process, opening the door to material combinations for specific applications that could enhance chip lifespan and reduce deliamination. Materials with high density-specific heat capacity products could also potentially be used to compensate for the thermal "bottlenecking" effect.

The composite R-I assemblies used for thermal performance assessment includealuminum sheet, broken glazed tiles, expanded polystyrene (construction waste), sawdust (industrial waste), mineral fiber board (recycled content 38 %) and false ceiling panels (recycled content 90 %). These materials were placed in two different combinations as <b>a</b> composite <b>heat</b> barrier <b>assembly</b> for exposed concrete roof of the two model rooms in an educational building over the considered geographic location.

Over a period of a year under experimentation, the first and second retrofitted assembly resulted in 6 % and 19 % reduction in surface temperature respectively. The considered R-I materials for the experimentation have proved to be thermally efficient, lighter and cost effective solution for energy conservation inside the buildings. The R-I product can further be applied on larger roof areas by the designers to reduce the cooling load of the built environment as well as to increase the occupants comfort over the local climatic zone...|$|R
