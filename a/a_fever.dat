5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, <b>a</b> <b>fever</b> is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and <b>a</b> <b>fever</b> indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed <b>a</b> <b>fever,</b> which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop <b>a</b> <b>fever</b> and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived in}} London in early January, 1695. Upon {{his arrival in}} London, he was arrested on exaggerated charges, levied by Dudley, that he had conspired to {{withhold}} customs monies.

5|$|According to his autobiography, it {{was while}} he was in bed with <b>a</b> <b>fever</b> that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth and {{came up with the idea}} of natural selection. Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, <b>a</b> <b>fever,</b> vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E

Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the King had wished to be interred at Grandmont Abbey in the Limousin, but the hot weather made transporting his body impractical and he was instead buried at the nearby Fontevraud Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally <b>a</b> <b>fever,</b> dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E

Bromsulfalein test slightly positive (8 %). A hypoglycaemia, hypotension, high sensitivity to pilocarpine, vanished patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes and a positive Sawada test in urine were also observed.

5|$|In Malaysia, a {{decoction}} of {{the leaves}} and roots used to be prescribed as an antipyretic. The leaf juice is applied {{on the head of}} <b>a</b> <b>fever</b> patient. The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930. It instructs the reader to boil the roots of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis with the roots of Durio zibethinus, Nephelium longan, Nephelium mutabile and Artocarpus integrifolia, and drink the decoction or use it as a poultice.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Desha left Kentucky {{and assumed}} an alias. He went to New Orleans. From there, he {{traveled}} {{with a man}} named Thomas Early to San Antonio, Texas. When Early went missing during their travels, Desha fell under suspicion. A former Kentuckian living in Texas recognized Desha. Arrested soon after Early's body was found, Desha confessed to the murder after being recognized by a second man from Kentucky. A day before his trial was to start, Desha died of <b>a</b> <b>fever.</b> A legend soon arose that he had faked his death and fled to Hawaii, where he married a native woman and fathered several children.
