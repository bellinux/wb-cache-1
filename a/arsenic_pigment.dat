30|$|A multi-technique {{analytical}} approach, including XRF, Raman, and SEM–EDS analysis, {{was used}} to characterize the <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> used in the prints. Our study showed that natural orpiment was used in Set A and the artificial pigment (with one notable occurrence of natural orpiment) in Set B. Additionally, a characteristic distribution for the co-occurrence of specific blue pigments with natural orpiment or the artificial arsenic sulfide to obtain a green color was seen for each print set. Prints in Set A consistently feature Prussian blue and indigo mixed with natural orpiment whereas in prints from Set B artificial arsenic sulfide is mixed with Prussian blue, indigo, and ultramarine blue for the green. Our experimental results, along with historic documentation describing the production and sources of <b>arsenic</b> <b>pigments,</b> provide further understanding of <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> use in Japanese woodblock printing during the late Edo period.|$|R

30|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> in late Edo period Japanese woodblock prints {{with the goal of}} better understanding when artificial <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> were first produced and used in Japan. First, we used a multi-analytical approach to identify both natural orpiment and artificial arsenic sulfide in prints from the Waterfalls series by Katsushika Hokusai. We then examined historic sources to understand artificial <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> production in Asia during the nineteenth century. Based on our experimental findings and historic literary references, we propose that the orpiment used in the prints studied was sourced from China and the artificial arsenic sulfide was produced by the dry process method. The finding of natural orpiment in the prints belonging to the first edition printing and both artificial arsenic sulfide and ultramarine in the reproduction set aided in corroborating the production dates of the prints studied, where the colorants detected agreed well with a printing date of 1833 – 1835 for set A, and in the very late Edo period or early Meiji period in the case of Set B.|$|R
30|$|Visual {{observation}} cannot accurately {{distinguish between}} natural and artificial arsenic sulfides. Polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman microspectroscopy {{have been used}} to differentiate various classes of dry process artificial arsenic sulfides [2, 6, 7]. Recent work by Vermeulen et al. used PLM, Raman and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM–EDS) to identify an artificial <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment</b> in nineteenth century painted decorative panels in the Japanese tower in Laeken, Belgium [8]. The minimally invasive nature and high chemical sensitivity of analytical techniques such as XRF, Raman, and SEM–EDS makes them highly suitable as well for characterization of <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> in woodblock prints.|$|R
30|$|We {{recently}} {{described the}} use of an artificial <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment</b> in Japanese woodblock prints from the Meiji period (1868 – 1912): we now expand on our previous work by investigating <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> used in Japanese woodblock prints of the late Edo period (1615 – 1868) and early Meiji period. The series of eight prints A Tour of the Waterfalls in Various Provinces (Shokoku Taki Meguri), by Katsushika Hokusai, issued between 1833 and 1834 is known to have been reproduced from entirely new blocks {{at some point during the}} late Edo or early Meiji periods. The two sets, original and copies are characterized by visually distinct color palettes as well as several differences in the image. Two such sets in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art were analyzed with particular attention to the yellow, orange, and green printed areas. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, Raman microspectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed {{the use of}} natural orpiment in the original set and of artificial <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> in the reproduction set. In addition, the reproduction set features extensive use of ultramarine blue, the synthetic equivalent to lapis lazuli. This pigment, available commercially in Europe from 1830 onward has been documented in Japanese art so far only in a handful of late Edo period paintings. The results of our comparative analysis further highlight differences in pigment use between Edo and Meiji periods, and point to <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> as useful markers for the date of original production for popular prints of the Edo period.|$|R
2500|$|Two <b>arsenic</b> <b>pigments</b> {{have been}} widely used since their {{discovery}} – Paris Green and Scheele's Green. After the toxicity of arsenic became widely known, these chemicals were used less often as pigments and more often as insecticides. In the 1860s, an arsenic byproduct of dye production, London Purple was widely used. [...] This was a solid mixture of arsenic trioxide, aniline, lime, and ferrous oxide, insoluble in water and very toxic by inhalation or ingestion But it was later replaced with Paris Green, another arsenic-based dye. With better understanding of the toxicology mechanism, two other compounds were used starting in the 1890s. Arsenite of lime and arsenate of lead were used widely as insecticides until the discovery of DDT in 1942.|$|R
30|$|In {{characterization}} {{studies of}} <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments,</b> {{there is a}} high probability that conclusions regarding the exact nature of the compounds present are drawn prematurely. In many cases, the encountered arsenic sulfide is recognized as being a mineral orpiment while in reality it appears to be pararealgar - the yellow degradation phase of realgar - while in others, distinction between natural and artificial orpiment is not made. Contradictions about the exact nature of <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> can also be found in published scientific literature or pigment encyclopedias, sometimes confusing realgar with an arsenic sulfide glass of unknown composition [1]. So-called artificial orpiment can be produced using two different processes, wet and dry, using different starting materials [2, 3]. In any case, <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> are the result but the structure and properties of the reaction products can be different. To understand its composition and characteristics, a multi-technique approach is required. Each used technique, from SEM-EDX to Raman spectroscopy and polarized light microscopy, can increase the knowledge about the processes behind artificial arsenic sulfide. Although the use of such a pigment in a 20 th-century artifact seems rather uncommon, its good conservation state is even more striking when one considers how instable this material is over time.|$|R
30|$|Now {{that the}} <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment</b> {{found in the}} {{decorative}} panels of the Japanese tower {{has been identified as}} arsenic sulfide glass synthesized from arsenic trioxide and sulfur, further investigations will be conducted in order to investigate stability of the different forms of arsenic sulfide glass and the influence of media [25] and environmental factors on its degradation.|$|R
30|$|Geologically, {{orpiment}} (As 2 S 3) and realgar (As 4 S 4) occur together, and {{are often}} associated with antimonates and other sulphides [1, 30]. Orpiment and realgar were highly appreciated especially in Egypt and China for their rich yellow and red–orange shades [1, 170 – 174], even though the pigments were considered “unpleasant” by many artists, and not recommended to use in combination with copper and lead based pigments, such as verdigris and leadwhite [1, 30, 170]. Orpiment and realgar exist as minerals, as well as synthetic pigments [175], and of the two <b>arsenic</b> sulphide <b>pigments,</b> {{the first one is}} the most stable. Realgar, being unstable, was less often reported in works of art [1, 176 – 179]. It has a polymorphic photodegradation product, pararealgar As 4 S 4. Permanence of <b>arsenic</b> sulphide <b>pigments</b> is problematic, especially on exposure to the green region of the visible spectrum [174, 180]. Moreover, smaller particles are more readily degraded [174]. The sensitivity to green light has {{to be taken into account}} when lasers need to be used, such as during Raman spectroscopic analysis [177, 181, 182]. Arsenates (As 5 +) are formed from orpiment, realgar and emerald green degradation: these ions are water soluble and migrate throughout the whole painting, accumulating at interfaces between layers, around Fe/Mn rich particles, and according to the local pH conditions in the paint layer. Due to this water-based transport, appropriate cleaning solvents must be selected, and relative humidity controlled [180, 183]. It seems that polysaccharidic media, or egg yolk, negatively affect the stability of the <b>arsenic</b> sulphide <b>pigments</b> [184].|$|R
2500|$|The {{painting}} {{underwent a}} thorough cleaning and restoration in the National Gallery shortly before 1979. The scientists of the Gallery also investigated {{the technical aspects}} of the painting and the painting materials used by Tintoretto. [...] Main pigments in this painting are ultramarine, red lakes (kermes, madder and lac), malachite and azurite. Tintoretto also used the rare <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> realgar and orpiment. An illustrated pigment analysis can be found at ColourLex.|$|R
40|$|Realgar and orpiment, <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> used in {{historic}} paints, degrade {{under the influence}} of light, resulting in transparent, whitish, friable and/or crumbling paints. So far, para-realgar and arsenic trioxide have been identified as the main oxidation products of <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments.</b> This paper shows that after photo-degradation, various oxidation and migration processes take place. Synchrotron radiation (SR) micro-X-ray fluorescence (m-XRF) reveals arsenic to be distributed throughout the whole multi-layered paint system. Arsenic (As) K-edge micro-X-ray absorption near edge structure (m-XANES) analyses indicate the presence of an intact AsxSy pigment, arsenite compounds (As 3 +; As 2 O 3), and arsenate compounds (As 5 +); the latter are certainly present as calcium, lead, aluminium and iron arsenates. Sulfur (S) K-edge mu-XANES points to the conversion of the sulfide (S 2 -) group to a sulfate (SO 42 -) group, probably via an elemental sulfur (S- 0) or sulfoxide (S 2 +) compound. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and subsequent k-means clustering of multi-energy SR mu-XRF maps and mu-XANES were performed to identify the various arsenic species and visualize their distribution. The arsenates (As 5 +) are spread throughout the entire paint system and dominate the photo-degraded paint and ground layers, while the arsenite compounds (As 3 +) are located close to the intact <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment.</b> The oxidation of arsenic trioxide into arsenates likely takes place in aqueous solutions. The presence of As 5 + compounds in the paint systems indicates that the arsenic trioxide is dissolved by ambient water present in the paint. Arsenite and arsenate compounds are water soluble and are transported by water throughout the paint system. This knowledge is crucial for the conservation field, as {{this is the first time}} that (indirect) evidence of water transport within paintings has been given...|$|R
30|$|FitzHugh {{described}} the amorphous synthetic arsenic sulfide particles prepared through wet chemistry from thioacetamide solution round in morphology with a particle size of about 1  μm [13]. Grundmann and Rötter differentiated the extremely homogeneous, fine (1 – 2  μm in diameter) bright yellow particles when {{obtained from a}} thioacetamide solution described by FitzHugh from the even smaller (0.1 - 0.4  μm) particles obtained when prepared from hydrogen sulfide [3]. On the other hand, synthetic <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment</b> produced by the dry process is described as being likely to be composed of fine to medium particles [19] with an average size of 4  μm depending on the grinding [21]. The dry processes give rise to glassy arsenic sulfide cakes (Figure  4 b) that contain irregularly shaped and sized particles with conchoidal fractures after grinding {{as described in the}} literature [3, 19] and as observed in the cross-sections of the laboratory-made g-AsxSx (Figure  4 c). Because the pigment investigated in the frame of this study is an artificial <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment,</b> the size, and shape of the particles observed in Figure  3 tend to indicate a pigment obtained from a dry rather than from a wet process.|$|R
30|$|The {{degradation}} of realgar and orpiment is triggered by light within the wavelength range of 500 – 670  nm. The highest degradation efficiency {{is in the}} green part of the visible light spectrum (530 – 560  nm) [6]. In {{the first step of}} light induced degradation, realgar undergoes polymorphism and becomes friable and bright yellow, (AsxSy, para-realgar) and subsequently degrades further to a white phase (As 2 O 3, arsenolite). The photo-oxidation of orpiment, on the other hand, results directly in a white product (arsenolite), often appearing as a dirty/off white color or an ocherous material {{because of the presence of}} an overlying varnish [6, 7]. In objects painted with large fields of orpiment, the degradation is often not uniform, resulting in a mix of ivory to ochre yellow [8]. The degradation products of <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> have been observed and identified in painted works of art by visual observation, µRaman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction [9 – 18]. One limitation of using µRaman spectroscopy to study realgar is the danger of creating para-realgar during the analysis due to the pigment’s extreme photo-sensitivity. So far, para-realgar and arsenic trioxide have been consistently identified as the main oxidation products of <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments.</b> Recent synchrotron radiation-based arsenic (As) K–edge micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) studies following preliminary µFTIR studies revealed another set of degradation products, i.e. arsenate compounds (As 5 +) present as calcium, lead, aluminum and iron arsenates depending on the pigments and fillers surrounding the original <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> [5]. The arsenates (As 5 +) are the phases that spread throughout the entire multi-layered paint system and dominate the photo-degraded paint, ground, and varnish layers, while the arsenite compounds (As 3 +) seem to be located close to the intact <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment.</b> We hypothesized that arsenic trioxide has to be oxidized in its aqueous form (As(OH) 3) to convert into arsenate phases. It is well known that arsenates are transported in the environment as an oxide via water [19]. So the presence of As 5 + compounds in the paint systems indicates that the arsenic trioxide is dissolved by ambient water present in the paint and transported by water throughout the paint system. While the deleterious health effects of, for example, wallpapering rooms in damp climates with arsenical papers has been recognized since the nineteenth century, ours is the first thorough speciation and mobility study to be conducted for these pigments (see, for example, refs. [20 – 22]).|$|R
30|$|However, {{beyond the}} {{structural}} breakdown of realgar {{and the consequent}} change in color, further effects are implied {{as a result of}} the dissolution of arsenolite in aqueous media, its oxidation to arsenic pentoxide and reaction with cations to form insoluble arsenates [1, 11]. As a possible example of one of these effects, we report here an occurrence of the magnesium arsenate mineral, hörnesite [Mg 3 (AsO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O], that illustrates yet another potential alteration product of <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments.</b>|$|R
30|$|Offered {{by most of}} {{the artists}} colour makers since the early 1820 ’s, copper <b>arsenic</b> green <b>pigments,</b> more {{especially}} Emerald, were widely employed by many 19 th century painters, e.g. Manet, Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet and Cézanne. Progressively abandoned since {{the very beginning of the}} 20 th century because of their high toxicity, copper arsenic compounds are no longer available as artistic green pigments. In the light of this fact, overpaints containing Emerald had been most probably executed before the painting entry in the MRBAB collection in 1923.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we used a}} multi-technique {{approach}} {{in order to identify}} the <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment</b> used in the decorative panels of the Japanese tower in Laeken, Belgium. Our attention was drawn to this particular pigment because of its relatively good conservation state, despite its known tendency to fade over time when exposed to light. The pigment was used with different painting techniques, bound with oil and urushi in the lacquers and with an aqueous binder in the mat relief panels. In the latter case it is always applied as an underlayer mixed with ultramarine blue. This quite unusual pigment mixture also shows a good state of preservation.|$|R
30|$|The white {{crystalline}} material found associated with, {{and seemingly}} derived from, the yellow-orange <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> on the Fatimid folio fragment {{was determined to}} be the magnesium arsenate hörnesite, [Mg 3 (AsO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O]. While we have no record of treatment or other direct evidence to support an assignment of cause for this occurrence, the common usage of Mg-based reagents for the deacidification of art and archival works on paper–especially in archaeological fieldwork—suggests the possibility that in this instance the hörnesite may be a reaction product of such treatment. This conjecture may be supported by the apparent ease with which {{we have been able to}} synthesize hörnesite by aging, at high relative humidity and ambient temperature, a mixture of orpiment, realgar, and pararealgar applied on filter paper and treated with a MgCO 3 suspension, as well as by the well-documented sequestering of As by mobile Mg ions in As-bearing soils to form the arsenate. This work highlights the potential damage that can be sustained by works bearing <b>arsenic</b> sulfide-based <b>pigments</b> through exposure to aqueous deacidifying suspensions often used to treat works of art on paper and historic documents in museums and other institutions. Ultimately, in the case of the Fatimid folio, no conservation intervention was undertaken. The hörnesite presently exists on a scale that does not interfere with the aesthetic reading of the work of art, nor does it appear to present cause for concern with respect to long-term physical or chemical stability.|$|R
30|$|Raman {{spectra of}} the orange and yellow {{pigments}} were acquired in situ, while samples of the white crystals were removed for analysis. A Renishaw System 1000 coupled to a Leica DM LM microscope was employed.

40|$|A general {{re-examination}} of {{the artificial}} <b>arsenic</b> sulphide <b>pigments</b> orpiment, realgar and alacranite using polarised light microscopy (PLM), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) combined with energy and wavelength dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, WDX) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) revealed the following results: wet-process precipitation products of artificial orpiment consist of golden yellow, amorphous, spherical particles ranging from 0. 2 to 2 μm Ø. Dry-process roasting and/or sublimation products with an arsenolite/sulphur mixture consist mainly of amorphous golden yellow oval drops and spherules of amorphous arsenic sulphide glass (g-AsxSx) with a smooth surface ranging from 1 to 20 μm Ø in association with arsenolite crystal aggregates {{and members of the}} alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9). A bright lemon yellow to orange-red <b>arsenic</b> sulphide <b>pigment</b> on a sixteenth/seventeenth-century South German polychrome recumbent sculpture and a seventeenth-century Dutch painting attributed to Rembrandt's studio has been identified as an artificial orpiment produced with dry-process (roasting/sublimation) methods. The recumbent figure contains (i) yellow, orange or red-brown amorphous splintery fragments and spherules of arsenic sulphide glass of up to 25 μm Ø, (ii) yellow, brown or red-brown crystalline spherules and splintery fragments of alacranite, (iii) lemon yellow to red-brown agglomerates of arsenic sulphide glass, and (iv) colourless irregular fragments or octahedral crystals of arsenolite. This type can be classified as 'complex artificial orpiment'. The <b>arsenic</b> sulphide <b>pigment</b> in the yellowish paint layers of the Rembrandt studio painting proved to be very uniform bright yellow spherules (max. 9 μm Ø) of arsenic sulphide glass, which can be classified as 'purified artificial orpiment glass'. A deep red historic arsenic sulphide cake from the collection of the Landesmuseum Joanneum (Graz, Austria) called 'Realgar' {{turned out to be an}} amorphous arsenic sulphide glass matrix (approx. g-As 2 S 3) filled with numerous red crystal aggregates of alacranite (approx. As 8 S 9) in the form of spherules, which fill gas bubbles and pores with an average 3 μm Ø (max. 20 μm Ø). A very fine-grained light red arsenic sulphide powder called 'Realgar' from an archaeological excavation of a historic arsenic smelter near Strassegg (Steiermark, Austria) turned out to be a member of the alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9) in the form of idiomorphic crystals and complex twinned crystal aggregates (average 10 μm Ø, max. 30 μm Ø). All red-colored crystals or crystal aggregates of artificial arsenic sulphides that have been called 'realgar' in the past are in fact members of the alacranite solid solution series. The occurrence of pararealgar as a secondary photochemical reaction product is not exclusively linked with realgar, but can also form on members of the alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9) ...|$|R
30|$|K-edge XANES {{analyses}} {{carried out}} on the de Heem sample identified species containing As(III) and As(V). Figure  5 r shows the XANES data taken from an intact arsenic sulfide particle in {{the lower part of}} the paint layer (layer 5, red line), the upper part of the degraded paint layer (layer 5, blue line), the calcium-containing ground layer (layer 1, green line) and the top layer containing lead white (layer 6, black line). As expected the most reduced arsenic species in the paint sample, arsenic sulfide, is found in the intact particle (white line at 11, 870.0  eV, red line). The edge position matches the XANES of realgar and orpiment references (XANES references, see ref. [4]) reasonably well. The most oxidized arsenic species is found in the ground and the top layer (layers 1 and 6) (white line at 11, 875.5  eV). These spectra match the spectra of the arsenate (As 5 +) species. The reduced and oxidized species are present in the upper part of the orpiment-containing layer (layer 5). The reduced arsenic derives from the intact <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment</b> or arsenite (As 3 +), which is the photo-degradation product of orpiment.|$|R
30|$|Large mineral {{deposits}} of orpiment and realgar {{can be found}} in Asia (particularly in Southeastern China), making natural arsenic sulfides a common painting material in Chinese art starting in the fifth and sixth centuries [1, 9 – 12]. Despite the longstanding use of orpiment in Chinese painting, orpiment does not appear in Japanese paintings before the mid-seventeenth century, becoming more common by the nineteenth century [13, 14]. Previously published studies discuss a shift in the usage of natural to artificial arsenic sulfides as a yellow pigment during the late Edo period, but do not define an exact time period of this shift [15, 16]. Recent work from Luo et al. demonstrates the exclusive use of artificial arsenic sulfide as a yellow pigment for Japanese woodblock prints dated between 1864 and 1895 [17]. The authors cite the earliest known reference to artificial arsenic sulfide production in Japan, dating to 1846, where Takamatsu describes heating arsenical ore with sulfur to produce a yellow pigment [18]. Prior to 1846, the source and production of artificial <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> and their use in Japanese woodblock prints has not been well studied.|$|R
30|$|In this study, we expand {{upon the}} work of Luo et al. by characterizing <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigments</b> used in Japanese woodblock prints dated to 1833 – 1834. The prints studied herein are from a {{thematic}} series designed by Katsushika Hokusai titled A Tour of the Waterfalls in Various Provinces (Shokoku Taki Meguri). Hokusai’s landscapes from the Tempyō period (1830 – 1844) are revered for their unique rendering of natural scenes and dominant blue tones. The onset of the “blue revolution” during this time, primarily due {{to the introduction of}} Prussian blue in Japan, saw a shift in the color palette used, from soft tones to striking blues, greens and yellows. The collection of Japanese woodblock prints at The Metropolitan Museum of Art consists of approximately 255 works by Hokusai and his followers [19, 20]. Among them are two complete sets of the of the eight-print Waterfalls series (sixteen prints in total). Several examples from each set were published by Keyes and Morse in a study describing how the original print series was copied in the late Edo period or early Meiji period from entirely redrawn blocks [21]. The two sets are distinguished by slightly different color palettes and by several minor variations in drawing. In keeping with Keyes and Morse’s notation we will henceforth refer to the original set as Set A and the reproduction as Set B.|$|R
30|$|Among 165 {{samples taken}} from the tower for a {{complete}} technical study, a total of 24 samples containing <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment</b> and sampled on different floors were selected. The samples were numbered P 201.061 to P 210.036 for archiving. They were then mounted as cross-sections (C 87.129 to C 90.158) {{in order to be}} analyzed. The cross-sections were prepared by embedding the samples between acrylic resin cubes. The bulk sample was first fixed to a 1  cm 3 poly(methyl methacrylate) cube using a white PVA glue, after which the acrylic copolymer resin (Spofacryl®, Spofa Dental CZ- 10031, Prague) was poured on the sample and the second cube placed on top. The cross-sections thus obtained were left to dry, then polished with water until the sample surface was nearly exposed. Then, polishing was continued in set circumstances using Micro Mesh© polishing cloths in a sequence of grits (2400, 4000, 6000 and 8000  mesh) leading to a mirror-like surface. In the case of the reference samples, a JEOL Cross Section Polisher IB- 09010 CP (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used for 12  hours with a 4.0  kV accelerating voltage, 4.4 argon gas flow and a swinging stage. The cross-sections were photographed with an optical microscope Axio Imager 2 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) under visible and ultraviolet light (excitation bandpass filter from 390 to 420  nm) with magnifications up to 500 x.|$|R
40|$|A glass house {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of soil <b>arsenic</b> on photosynthetic <b>pigments,</b> chlorophyll-a and -b, and their correlations with rice yield and growth. The {{experiment was}} designed with three replications of six arsenic treatments viz. control, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 mg of As kg- 1 soil. Arsenic concentration in initial soil, to which the above mentioned concentrations of arsenic were added, was 6. 44 ± 0. 24 mg kg- 1. Both chlorophyll-a and -b contents in rice leaf decreased significantly (p 0. 05) {{from each other in}} control treatment though they differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from each other in 30 mg of As kg- 1 soil treatment. Among the five rice varieties, chlorophyll content in BRRI dhan 35 was found to be mostly affected with the increase of soil arsenic concentration while BRRI hybrid dhan 1 was least affected. Well correlations were observed between chlorophyll content and rice growth and yield suggesting that arsenic toxicity affects the photosynthesis which ultimately results in the reduction of rice growth and yield. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|Assigning {{accurate}} chronology to woodblock prints {{such as the}} Waterfalls {{series is}} challenging due to the commercial nature of print production. Woodblocks could be passed between publishers, and hundreds to thousands of print copies could be produced in a single printing. Additionally, the Waterfalls series prints {{were known to be}} heavily copied in the nineteenth century from a newly carved set of blocks; it is believed that more copies exist in public collections than originals [21, 33, 34]. We attempt to use the identification of both yellow and blue pigments in order to corroborate the production date of the prints studied. Multiple sources state that the Waterfalls series prints were first issued in 1833, and widely published in 1834 – 1835 [33, 35, 36]. The prints that use artificial arsenic sulfide (Set B) also used blue pigments Prussian blue, indigo, and ultramarine. This is unlike the prints with natural orpiment (Set A), which were found to use only Prussian blue and indigo, and highly unusual. Natural ultramarine, or lapis lazuli, was not native to Japan and was extremely costly; it is therefore unlikely that natural ultramarine was used for commercial woodblock prints. Artificial ultramarine, first synthesized in 1828 (independently by Gmelin in Germany and Guimet in France), became commercially available in Europe on large scale only after 1830 [37]. Taken together with the tentative dating to the late Edo—early Meiji period for Set B, and with the co-occurrence of artificial <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment,</b> so far only found in Meiji prints, the finding of artificial ultramarine in JP 1081 –JP 1088, is in line with the findings of Fitzhugh [14], who in her survey of Edo period paintings at the Freer Gallery identified artificial ultramarine only in later Edo period paintings by Hiroshige (1797 – 1858) and Hiroshige II (1826 – 1869).|$|R
30|$|Combining the {{technical}} results with information from period literary sources {{can assist in}} elucidating <b>arsenic</b> sulfide <b>pigment</b> origin and production methods. Despite the existence of artificial orpiment production in the West for hundreds of years, the earliest literary reference in English to artificial orpiment specifically produced in East Asia dates to 1831, in Samuel Gray’s A Supplement to the Pharmacopœia and Treatise on Pharmacology, which states that natural orpiment is “found in mines, yellowish green, with brilliant gold-coloured spangles; used by painters” and its artificial counterpart was synthesized “from orpiment, by sublimation; from China, Japan and the Burman empire” [32]. Additional documentary evidence from this period states that in Japan, imported orpiment was prepared {{for use as a}} pigment by grinding, and artificial orpiment was produced by the dry process, as learned from the Dutch [14, 16]. The first detailed description of artificial orpiment specific to Japan dates to approximately 1846, where Takamatsu describes the production of artificial orpiment by burning of arsenical stones with sulfur. Interestingly, Takamatsu performed chemical analysis of the artificially produced orpiment and demonstrated the presence of excess sulfur and no As 2 O 3, in agreement with our experimental findings [18]. Takamatsu also cites the low cost of artificial orpiment compared to gamboge, making it an appealing colorant to use for the production of woodblock prints. Based on the literary descriptions cited above, {{it is likely that the}} natural orpiment used in the prints we studied was imported from China, and that the artificial orpiment used was produced by sublimation of mineral orpiment (with or without sulfur added). This finding is consistent with our experimental results. It is not possible however to distinguish between artificial orpiment imported from China or produced in Japan due to the chemical similarities of the two dry process products.|$|R
50|$|Review of {{treatments}} of leprosy, especially on chaulmoogra oil. He made a special lecture on this title at the 13th Congress of the JapaneseAssociation of Leprosy in 1939 at Sendai. His review included treatments of leprosy with gold, silver, cupper, <b>arsenics,</b> iodine, timol, <b>pigments,</b> nonspecific immune therapies, sulfon drugs, vitamine, bacterial toxins, serum therapies, nutritional therapies; especially chaulmoogra oil. On sulphon-amids, he tested Therapol (paraamino-benzolsulfon amid) {{and found it}} was effective in 55.6% (10 cases) out of 18 cases. However, he concluded that with Therapol only, the sulphon-amids could not be expected as treatment of leprosy. On chaulmoogra oil, he reported it was effective in 30% in the Kyushu Sanatorium (he studied it between 1919 and 1930) and in 56.6% in Formosa (data between 1930 and 1939), while Hayashi Y. reported that it was effective in 50-80% of cases in the Zenshoen Hospital, Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium. He concluded that chaulmoogra oil was the only hopeful treatment for patients whose leprosy was not severe, and the mechanism was the activation {{of the immune system}} by stimulating the reticulo-endothlial system or lymphatic system. This was also the conclusion of his reports for Ph.D. in 1930.|$|R
40|$|Orpiment and realgar are {{yellow and}} red <b>arsenic</b> {{sulphide}} <b>pigments</b> {{that have been used}} since antiquity in works of art until the 19 thcentury, when their use was restricted due to their toxicity. With time, these pigments degrade to form colourless arsenic oxide. Different oxidation states of arsenic (+ 3 and + 5) in the degradation products have been recently found. Moreover, they have been identified throughout the whole painting layout from the panel until the varnish, suggesting the migration of degradation products through the paint layers. Besides changing the aspect, they might change the stability of the painting or painted object. Furthermore, they might represent a potential hazard for conservators when dealing with the work of art. Since a painting is in equilibrium with its environment, there is always water in motion inside the painting. It is therefore believed that the degradation products are migrating via water. However, the migration mechanism is still not well understood. This thesis aims to provide a better insight into the diffusion process of arsenites (As+ 3) and arsenates (As+ 5) in materials commonly found in paintings. For this, two different approaches were followed: In one hand, light aged painting reconstructions were analysed with FTIR microscopy and SEM-EDS to asses the effect of different grounds and relative humidity on the migration of arsenic. In all the samples, degradation products were found in the orpiment layer based on the As-O vibration, detected with FTIR microscopy. It was possible to identify arsenic in the ground layer close to the orpiment-ground interface for all samples with both techniques. However, due to the low intensity and the proximity to the interface of the arsenic found in the grounds, no conclusions could be drawn about its migration. On the other hand, in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and EIS measurements were performed on a set of samples to analyse the water, arsenates and arsenites diffusion through oil and two varnishes (dammar and mastic). The diffusion coefficients of water in oil, dammar and mastic were determined with both techniques. It was found that the water diffuses faster in oil than in the two varnishes. Despite being similar, mastic was found to be less stable than dammar since a decrease in its barrier properties with time was found. The diffusion of arsenates and arsenites in dammar and mastic was studied by EIS and the diffusion coefficients were calculated for the first time. It was found that the diffusion of arsenites in the coatings is faster than arsenates, which is in accordance to the diffusion of these species in water. EIS resulted in a promising technique in the study of diffusion of ions in coatings. Although {{further research is needed to}} fully understand the migration mechanism of arsenic in painting systems, this thesis provides a useful insight and a methodology with which the water and ion transport in coatings can be studied...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic is a {{well known}} {{carcinogenic}} element, that can harm not only human health but, plant and bacteria as well. Replicated experiments confirmed that, Arsenic accumulates in the different tissues {{in different parts of}} the plant and, adversely affects the growth and productivity of the plants. It is a threat for millions of population in terms of health and food security both. Therefore, a pot experiment was designed and conducted to investigate the effect of <b>arsenic</b> on photosynthetic <b>pigments,</b> Chlorophyll-a and –b, growth behavior, and its accumulation in the tissues of different parts of onion plants (Allium cepa). Test plants were subjected to pot experiment under natural conditions. Four pots were prepared to grow onion plants, irrigated with equal volume of different Arsenic solution (NaAs 3), 0. 00 mg/l, 0. 200 mg/l, 0. 600 mg/l, and 0. 800 mg/l concentration with one pot for control respectively, throughout the experiments. Both chlorophyll-a and -b contents in onion leaf increased significantly with the increase of water arsenic concentrations. The highest chlorophyll-a (0. 004847 /g) and chlorophyll-b (0. 006528 /g) contents were estimated in the onion leaf irrigated with 0. 800 mg/l of Arsenic whereas, in control plant it was lowest (chl-a 0. 002363 / and chl-b 0. 004092 /g). A high positive correlation was observed between water arsenic (R 2 = 0. 897 and 0. 963) & soil arsenic (R 2 = 0. 926 and 0. 919) with chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b respectively. High positive correlation was also observed even for onion growth verses soil arsenic and water arsenic (R 2 = 0. 994 and 0. 968) and water Arsenic with leaf biomass (R 2 = 0. 973) respectively. However, no Arsenic accumulation was detected in the tissues of different parts of the onion plants suggesting that, arsenic (NaAs 3) influenced the 40 K. Singh Sushant and A. K. Ghosh biochemistry of photosynthesis which ultimately resulted in the increase of onion growth and yield. Onion plants can be cultivated in the area where Arsenic containing water is being utilized for irrigating crops but, a chain of in-vitro studies are required to understand the biochemistry and mechanism that influenced growth and productivity of the onion plants.
