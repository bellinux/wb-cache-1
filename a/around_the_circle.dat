It later received archaeological attention, although it has not been excavated. Local folklore has grown up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> associating it with the Devil and with children petrified into rock. The Nine Stones are regarded as a sacred site by local Druids, who perform religious ceremonies there. The circle is adjacent to the A35 road and encircled by trees. The site is owned by English Heritage and is open without charge to visitors.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric {{units on}} the inner circle until later that day a Met multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District and the Met service was withdrawn.

5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E
5|$|In January 1867, Congressman Stevens {{introduced}} legislation {{to dissolve the}} Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion {{of the process of}} adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to {{a modified version of the}} amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Circle</b> that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.|$|E

The home of New Jersey Senator Joseph Sherman Frelinghuysen, Sr. was also located by the circle. Frelinghuysen had supported the construction of the circle, but moved away years later because of noise from the traffic.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{and also}} in other jurisdictions that have adopted mini-roundabouts, to drive across the central disc or dome when it is {{practicable}} to avoid it is an offence. Vehicles are required to treat the painted circle {{as if it were}} a solid island and drive around it. Some local authorities paint double white lines <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> to indicate this, but these require permission from the Secretary of State for Transport.

25|$|The circle. Each {{homotopy}} class {{consists of}} all loops which wind <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> a given {{number of times}} (which can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of winding). The product of a loop which winds around m times and another that winds around n times is a loop which winds around m+n times. So the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to (Z, +), the additive group of integers. This fact {{can be used to}} give proofs of the Brouwer fixed point theorem and the Borsuk–Ulam theorem in dimension 2.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> n times. Once you reach the nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E
25|$|Summer routes were {{introduced}} in 1932, cutting Sagene Ring's headway to fifteen minutes. Including slack a full round on the circle took 35 minutes. During a twelve-minute headway this went fine with three trams in each direction. The route {{could be done in}} 30 minutes, but without any slack. Oslo Sporveier ran the line with two trams per direction during the fifteen-minute headway services, but it was often difficult to keep the schedule with this scheme. During the summers 0 was combined with 13 so each service would run twice <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> and then run on the Gamlebyen Line. From 1937 the reduced service and 0 and 13 combination was also run on Sundays. From 1940 line 13 was moved to the Sinsen Line.|$|E
25|$|With his contemporaries, Willaert {{developed}} the canzone (a form of polyphonic secular song) and ricercare, which were forerunners of modern instrumental forms. Willaert also arranged 22 four-part madrigals for voice and lute written by Verdelot. In an early 4-part vocal work, Quid non ebrietas? (In some sources called the Chromatic Duo) Willaert uses musica ficta <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of 5ths {{in one of}} the voices resulting in an augmented 7th in unison with the ending octave, an outstanding experiment with chromatic enharmonicism. Willaert {{was among the first to}} extensively use chromaticism in the madrigal. Looking forward, we are given an image of early word painting in his madrigal Mentre che'l cor. Willaert, who was fond of the older compositional techniques such as the canon, often placed the melody in the tenor of his compositions, treating it as a cantus firmus. Willaert, with the help of De Rore, standardized a five-voice setting in madrigal composition. Willaert also pioneered a style that continued until the end of the madrigal period of reflecting the emotional qualities of the text and the meanings of important words as sharply and clearly as possible.|$|E
