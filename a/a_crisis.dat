5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} <b>a</b> <b>crisis,</b> {{a point in the}} progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After <b>a</b> <b>crisis,</b> a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{currency}} <b>crisis</b> is <b>a</b> type {{of financial}} crisis, {{and is often}} associated with <b>a</b> real economic <b>crisis.</b> <b>A</b> currency <b>crisis</b> raises the probability of <b>a</b> banking <b>crisis</b> or <b>a</b> default <b>crisis.</b> During <b>a</b> currency <b>crisis</b> the value of foreign denominated debt will rise drastically relative to the declining value of the home currency. Financial institutions and the government will struggle to meet debt obligations and economic crisis may ensue. Causation also runs the other way. The probability of <b>a</b> currency <b>crisis</b> rises when <b>a</b> country is experiencing a banking or default crisis. To offset the damage resulting from a banking or default <b>crisis,</b> <b>a</b> central bank will often increase currency issuance, which can decrease reserves to a point where a fixed exchange rate breaks. The linkage between currency, banking, and default crises increases the chance of twin crises or even triple crises, outcomes in which the economic cost of each individual crisis is enlarged.|$|R

50|$|Another {{topic of}} {{study is the}} impact of sudden stops on output.

5000|$|To {{address this}} {{ambiguity}} in the theory, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) [...] conducted an extensive empirical work for 20 countries over a 25-year sample {{and found that}} banking-sector problems not only are generally followed by <b>a</b> currency <b>crisis,</b> but also help to predict them. <b>A</b> currency <b>crisis,</b> on the other hand, does not help to predict the beginning of <b>a</b> banking <b>crisis,</b> but does help to predict the peak of <b>a</b> banking <b>crisis.</b> That is, although it doesn't cause the beginning of <b>a</b> banking <b>crisis,</b> <b>a</b> Balance-of-Payment <b>crisis</b> may help to deepen <b>an</b> existing banking <b>crisis,</b> creating thus <b>a</b> [...] "vicious cycle". This result is supported by Goldstein (2005), who found that with the existence of strategic complementarities between speculators and creditors in the model, {{an increase in the}} probability of one type of <b>crisis</b> generates <b>an</b> increase in the probability of the other type.

Worried about another growing adversary in the Venetian Gulf, the Republic of Venice tried to turn Skanderbeg's allies against him in order to weaken Alfonso's influence. Realizing his opportunity, Mehmed ordered an invasion of Albania. Skanderbeg, knowing the impetuous nature of the new Sultan and the effect it would have if his army were not immediately defeated, acted quickly. As soon as the Ottoman army was split into two separate forces, Skanderbeg attacked and defeated both Hamza and Tahip. Tahip was killed in battle whereas Hamza was captured and ransomed for 13,000 ducats along with his staff. Soon thereafter, Skanderbeg cajoled his former Venetian adversaries into easing Albanian-Venetic relations.|$|E
