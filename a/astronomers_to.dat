5|$|The star {{had been}} {{observed}} many {{times by the}} Hipparcos satellite, which allowed <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> calculate the orbital period of HD 209458 b very accurately at 3.524736 days.|$|E
5|$|When William Herschel {{discovered}} Uranus in 1781, the planet's orbit {{matched the}} law almost perfectly, leading <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> conclude {{that there had}} to be a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|As noted below, such a {{cloud of}} {{collectors}} would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small for Earth-based <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> observe.|$|E
50|$|Chevallier was {{the first}} British <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> {{institute}} regular and continuous observation of sunspots.|$|R
50|$|Pons {{was also}} the last <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> detect the comet, on April 1 1824.|$|R
50|$|Weidong Li, {{professor}} of astronomy, the first Chinese <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> discover a supernovae since 1054 A.D.|$|R
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp's {{activity}} and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations {{of the material}} streaming away from these jets allowed <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> measure the rotation period of the comet, which {{was found to be}} about 11 hours 46 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons of KOI 072.02 to the 1235 other Kepler Objects of Interest in Kepler's {{field of}} vision allowed <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> use models {{that led to the}} {{confirmation}} of KOI 072.02 as a planet {{with a high degree of}} certainty. KOI 072.02 was then renamed Kepler-10c. The planet's confirmation was announced at the Boston meeting of the American Astronomical Society on May 23, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Elemental abundances in the {{photosphere}} {{are well}} known from spectroscopic studies, but {{the composition of the}} interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> directly measure the composition of solar material.|$|E
50|$|He is {{regarded}} as the first <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> have made a recorded mention of the planet Mercury.|$|R

25|$|Fritz Zwicky was {{the first}} <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> observe on Mt. Palomar and {{was the father of}} the Sky Survey Technique.|$|R
5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, adaptive optics imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, {{even without a}} spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|In April 2017, {{using data}} from the SkyMapper {{telescope}} at Siding Spring Observatory, citizen scientists on the Zooniverse platform reported four candidates for Planet Nine. These candidates will be followed up on by <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> determine their viability. The project, which started on 28 March, completed their goals in less than three days with around five million classifications by more than 60,000 individuals.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian {{mechanics}} {{to predict}} {{the position of the}} then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.|$|E
50|$|Messier was {{the last}} <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> observe the comet as it {{moved away from the}} Sun, on October 3, 1770.|$|R
50|$|Shin Hirayama (extra=1868 - 1945) was {{the first}} Japanese <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} an asteroid. In 1900 he discovered 498 Tokio and 727 Nipponia.|$|R
50|$|John Lewis Tiarks, FRS (born Johann Ludwig Tiarks, 10 May 1789 - 1 May 1837) was the British <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> the North American Boundary Line Commission.|$|R
5|$|Spectroscopic {{analysis}} {{had shown}} that the planet had a mass about 0.69 times that of Jupiter. The occurrence of transits allowed <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> calculate the planet's radius, which had not been possible for any previously known exoplanet, {{and it turned out}} to have a radius some 35% larger than Jupiter's.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy has a {{total of}} 15 {{satellite}} galaxies, including M32 and M110. Nine of these lie in a plane, which has caused <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> infer {{that they have a}} common origin. These satellite galaxies, like the satellites of the Milky Way, tend to be older, gas-poor dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The first {{director}} of STScI, Riccardo Giacconi, announced in 1986 {{that he intended}} to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> use the telescope. The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers.|$|E
5000|$|Kremsmünster is a {{traditional}} place of culture, astronomy and natural science. For instance, Placidus Fixlmillner (1721-1791) was the first <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> compute the orbit of Uranus.|$|R
25|$|Yu Xi (fourth century AD) was {{the first}} Chinese <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> mention precession. He {{estimated}} the rate of precession as 1° in 50 years (Pannekoek 1961, p.92).|$|R

5|$|Theorists in {{astronomy}} endeavor to create theoretical models {{and from the}} results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Using the Very Large Telescope {{to study}} the motions of about 300 {{planetary}} nebulae, {{it has been shown}} that M87 has absorbed a medium-sized galaxy over the last billion years. The distinctive spectral properties of the planetary nebulae allowed <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> discover a chevron-like structure in M87's halo which was produced by the incomplete phase-space mixing of a disrupted galaxy.|$|E
5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E

50|$|Nicholas Kratzer (1487? - 1550) was a German mathematician, astronomer, and horologist. Much of Kratzer's {{professional}} life {{was spent in}} England, where he was appointed as <b>astronomer</b> <b>to</b> King Henry VIII.|$|R
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. The {{definition}} is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E
5|$|Finding more objects {{would allow}} <b>astronomers</b> <b>to</b> make more {{accurate}} {{predictions about the}} orbit of the hypothesized planet. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, when it is completed in 2023, {{will be able to}} map the entire sky in just a few nights, providing more data on distant Kuiper belt objects that could both bolster evidence for Planet Nine and help pinpoint its current location.|$|E
