5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 1. It steadily organized <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> westward, and resembled a tropical depression by July 7. However, surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics, and remained simply a low-pressure system. The wave produced tropical storm-force winds <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> through the Lesser Antilles on July 8, but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern Caribbean. Because it had tropical storm-force winds, the system was upgraded immediately to Tropical Storm Claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on July 8.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward {{from the cold}} front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 27. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> west into the Atlantic, it became more organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on September 1. Shear from an upper-level low to the southwest slowed the development of the storm and caused uncertainties in the National Hurricane Center's forecasts, as some models indicated that the depression would dissipate and others that it would become a hurricane. The depression gradually strengthened <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to the northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean, becoming Tropical Storm Maria on September 2 and reaching hurricane strength on September 4.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{entered the}} Atlantic on August23, developing into a tropical depression off the western coast of Africa {{two days later}} at 06:00UTC. The nascent depression steadily intensified <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Earl six hours after formation and further strengthening into a hurricane by 12:00UTC on August29. A weakness in the steering ridge, created by leading Hurricane Danielle, caused Earl to narrowly miss the northern Leeward Islands as it strengthened into a Category4 hurricane on August30. Intensification was temporarily stunted as the cyclone underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, but Earl ultimately attained peak winds of 145mph (230km/h) by 06:00UTC on September2. Increased shear and a second replacement cycle caused the hurricane to rapidly weaken thereafter. It weakened to a tropical storm by 00:00UTC on September4, and although the system briefly re-attained hurricane intensity <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> ashore near Liverpool, Nova Scotia, Earl transitioned into an extratropical cyclone twelve hours later. The extratropical low merged with another system over the Labrador Sea the next day.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia. A cold front {{across the region}} caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining moisture from the Gulf of Mexico with cool and stable air over the Carolinas. This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight in South Carolina, and eight in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} to {{a strong}} tropical storm <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it {{was still able to}} receive moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into northern Mexico.|$|E

5|$|During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575km (355mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over {{the next few}} days the depression gradually developed and organised further, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over {{the next few days}}, the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cindy was a {{tropical}} cyclone that briefly reached minimal hurricane {{strength in the}} Gulf of Mexico during July in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and made landfall in Louisiana. It was the third named storm and first hurricane of the season. Cindy was originally {{thought to have been}} {{a tropical}} storm at peak strength, but was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane in the post-storm analysis. Cindy initially formed on July3 just east of the Yucatán Peninsula in the Caribbean Sea. The depression soon made landfall on the peninsula and weakened before reemerging in the Gulf of Mexico on July4. The storm strengthened <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> north becoming a hurricane just before making landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, on July5. The storm weakened <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> overland and became extratropical on July7.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Edith rapidly {{weakened}} {{over the}} mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the Gulf of Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern {{portion of the}} Gulf of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.|$|E

Some downpours and high winds were reported. No ships reported tropical storm-force winds, though Barbados reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mb.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, {{the storm}} began a {{weakening}} trend {{and it turned}} towards the north. The next day, the storm—having weakened to Category 1 status—skirted the southeastern tip of Newfoundland. Debbie began to lose its tropical characteristics as it accelerated towards the northeast, and it weakened into a tropical storm early on August 25. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> over increasingly cold waters, it dissipated east of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, {{the storm}} {{deteriorated}} in organization as it continued northward. The lack of banding features indicated that by early on July 22, Becky was barely a tropical storm. The storm made landfall near Port St. Joe, Florida shortly thereafter, and weakened rapidly <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> inland; as a rainstorm, it progressed northward into the Midwestern United States and completely dissipated over Michigan.|$|E

5|$|On July10, PAGASA issued {{their final}} {{advisory}} on Tropical Depression Gorio <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> {{out of their}} area of responsibility. Hampered by an unfavorable upper-level environment, the depression barely intensified into a tropical storm early on July11. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the JMA named the system Soudelor reporting peak winds of 65km/h, (40mph). Later that day the JTWC reported that Soudelor had weakened into a depression; however they re-upgraded it to a tropical storm <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> closer to Hainan Province. Shortly before landfall in Leizhou Peninsula, China, the JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. After moving back over water in the Gulf of Tonkin, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression. The JMA, however, continued to monitor Soudelor until it made landfall near Fangchenggang, China several hours later.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Koni, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Gilas, caused {{moderate}} damage to areas of China and Vietnam in July2003. The eighth tropical storm in the western Pacific that year, Koni originated from a disturbance situated within the monsoon trough well east of the Philippines on July15. Tracking westward, intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> across the central Philippines on July17. Upon moving into the South China Sea, however, conditions allowed for quicker strengthening, and as such the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg), making it a severe tropical storm. However, atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July21, weakening the system. The tropical storm continued to weaken <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> over the Gulf of Tonkin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi, Vietnam the following day. Tracking inland, the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Koni to dissipate over Laos on July23.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Louisiana {{hurricane}} was {{a strong}} tropical cyclone that caused significant damage in parts of Louisiana in September1920. The second tropical storm and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from an area of disturbed weather on September16, 1920, northwest of Colombia. The system remained a weak tropical depression as it made landfall on Nicaragua, but later intensified to tropical storm strength <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> across the Gulf of Honduras, prior to making a second landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm quickly intensified <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> towards the north-northwest, reaching its peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (160km/h) prior to making landfall near Houma, Louisiana with no change in intensity. Afterwards, it quickly weakened over land, before dissipating on September23 over eastern Kansas.|$|E
