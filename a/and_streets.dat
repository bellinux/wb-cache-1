5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000people were housed in shelters, {{many of whom}} remembered Hurricane Iwa 10years prior. Because schools were canceled, traffic was light during the evacuation, <b>and</b> <b>streets</b> were clear by mid-morning. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage.|$|E

5|$|Although Nash was {{responsible}} for the street's general development, some individual buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and Sir John Soane, amongst others. By 1819, the Crown were receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established. At first, it was called New Street and became a dividing line between Soho, which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares <b>and</b> <b>streets</b> of Mayfair to the west. Carlton House did not last long following completion of the works and was demolished in 1829, to be replaced by Carlton House Terrace, also designed by Nash.|$|E

There are numerous monuments <b>and</b> <b>streets</b> dedicated to Allied politicians and generals, including Franklin Roosevelt and Bernard Montgomery in Brussels. The large numbers of British and American cemeteries and memorials, particularly in the Ardennes region associated with the Battle of the Bulge, meant that the legacy of the war was very visible.|$|E

5|$|Known to Māori as tī kōuka, {{the tree}} {{was used as a}} source of food, {{particularly}} in the South Island, where it was cultivated in areas where other crops would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, waterproof rain capes and cloaks, and sandals. Hardy and fast growing, C.australis is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks <b>and</b> <b>streets,</b> and numerous cultivars are available. The tree can also be found in large numbers in island restoration projects such as Tiritiri Matangi Island, where it was among the first seedling trees to be planted.|$|E

They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead.|$|E

40|$|Much {{has changed}} since the 1960 s when the first {{scholarship}} on contemporary graffiti appeared. The current paper {{is an attempt to}} outline and contextualize a number of recurrent challenges facing researchers of graffiti <b>and</b> <b>street</b> art, as well as developments that have taken place in this scholarly field. The aim of creating this outline is to assist in increasing the amount, and improving the quality, of future scholarship on graffiti <b>and</b> <b>street</b> art. We recognize, however, that although many of the challenges have at one time seemed insurmountable, over time they have lessened as graffiti <b>and</b> <b>street</b> art have grown as art movements, and because a small cadre of tenacious scholars focusing on graffiti <b>and</b> <b>street</b> art has published and taught in this area. An increasing, though limited, number of academic venues focused on graffiti <b>and</b> <b>street</b> art scholarship has slowly emerged. We also recognize that with increased scholarship that has laid the foundation, new avenues to explore graffiti <b>and</b> <b>street</b> art have become apparent...|$|R

5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing <b>and</b> <b>streets</b> had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E

In the didactic part of this thesis there are listed possibilities, concerning the potential usage of graffiti <b>and</b> <b>street</b> art themes {{in the frame of}} education, primarily in secondary school art education. The aim of this thesis is to offer a brief and concrete picture of current tendencies in the field of graffiti <b>and</b> <b>street</b> art in the above mentioned areas...|$|R
