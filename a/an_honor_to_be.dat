[...] Despite being {{hampered}} by a muscle pull, Bell still rushed for 210yards in 28carries against Wisconsin. [...] After the game, Bell noted that he [...] "couldn't cut as well as (he) would have liked," [...] but he played through the injury realizing that, as a senior, [...] "the coaches expect us to show the way." [...] On being named the UPI's Midwest Back of the Week, Bell noted, [...] "It's really <b>an</b> <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recognized like that, {{but you have to}} have a lot of help out there. [...] I thought Rick Leach was just super in the game. [...] He sure didn't look like a freshman. [...] And our offensive line did the job despite having so many sophomores in there." [...] Bell's 210-yard performance against Wisconsin stood as the school record in a season opener for 28years until Chris Perry rushed for 232 yards in the 2003 season opener against Central Michigan.|$|E

Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s <b>an</b> <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit."

Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts. Pearson, struggling with tinnitus, left {{as a result}} following the 1999 Beacon run. Trucks phoned his nephew, Derek Trucks, to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour. Trucks was very young, at age 20, and younger {{than any of the}} original members when the band formed. [...] "It was <b>an</b> <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of such a great institution from the start," [...] said Derek Trucks. [...] "When I first got the gig, I was just trying to maintain the spirit of the whole thing while hopefully bringing some fire to it, hoping to hold up my end while also expressing my own voice." [...] The Beacon run in 2000, captured on Peakin' at the Beacon, was ironically considered among the band's worst performances; an eight-show spring tour led to even more strained relations in the group. [...] "It had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing," [...] said Allman. Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him for the summer.|$|E
