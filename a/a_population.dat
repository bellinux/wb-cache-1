5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or decrease in population. A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with <b>a</b> <b>population</b> between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a Third Class city. A municipality with <b>a</b> <b>population</b> between 5,000 and 10,000 people is a Second Class city. And a municipality with <b>a</b> <b>population</b> over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with <b>a</b> <b>population</b> of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with <b>a</b> <b>population</b> of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or Third Class city. Municipalities with <b>a</b> <b>population</b> of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or Third Class city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the long-term impact of constant immigration on the dependency ratio in <b>an</b> SI <b>population</b> (<b>a</b> stationary <b>population</b> through constant immigration) {{in the context}} of the stable population model. Our analysis has three main findings. First, in SI <b>populations,</b> <b>a</b> younger <b>population</b> (<b>a</b> lower aging ratio) does not necessarily have a lower dependency ratio. An SI <b>population</b> has <b>a</b> lower dependency ratio than <b>a</b> closed stationary <b>population,</b> provided immigration is concentrated around the youngest working age in the host population. Second, under the same condition, selecting high-fertility immigrants increases the dependency ratio. Third, also under the same condition, substituting working-age immigrants with young (dependent) immigrants increases the dependency ratio. Using the United Nations model age structures of immigrants, our empirical illustration confirms these analytical results. ...|$|R
