Electrical {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>cork,</b> commercial cork agglomerates (for {{floor and}} wall coverings) and a recently developed composite of cork/TetraPak ® were studied.

The isothermal current characteristics and the samples conductivity were investigated under different conditions (electric field, temperature and environmental conditions: in air at ambient relative humidity (RH), dry air and vacuum), also the samples could be or not conditioned (dried in vacuum or in a P 2 O 5 atmosphere at room temperature). From these results the influence {{of water on the}} electrical properties <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>cork</b> could be seen.

The surface porosity features of cork stoppers can differentiate the three main commercial classes used nowadays: the porosity coefficient was 2. 4 %, 4. 0 % and 5. 5 % for premium, good and standard stoppers, respectively. Image analysis also distinguished defects in the cork structure: empty ant gallery; Coroebus undatus F. larvae gallery; and wetcork. Several predictive classification models of stoppers into quality classes were built using the results from cork stoppers surface characterization and a simplified model using the main discriminant features i. e. porosity coefficient and the RGB colour-type variables was presented. X-ray tomography {{was used as a}} non-destructive technique to study the internal structure <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers, allowing the visualization of some defects inside the cork stopper.

On average 35 % of the overall oxygen ingress occurred in the first 5 days, 59 % in the 1 st month and 78 % in the first 3 months. Microtomography images (voxel size of 50 µm) allowed the observation of lenticular channels development and geometry, and the quantification of void and high density regions (HDR) fractions.

They were easier to use than the ALKA and pre-manufactured outside of the bottling plant. This allowed for increased production speeds on the bottling line. Soon after the MaxiCap came the RingCrown closure. Invented in the early 1980s it was originally called MaxiCrown and later became known as RingCrown. The RingCrown is easier to use than its predecessors because it has an attached ring rather than a static pull off tab.|$|R

In this work, the dynamic crushing behaviour of agglomerated cork was experimentally studied, analysing the influence of the specimen thickness on the energy-absorption capacity, contact force, displacement, and strain. Dynamic crushing tests with specimens of four different thicknesses were performed in a drop-weight tower. An increase in the maximum contact force, displacement, and strain was observed when the impact-energy/thickness ratio increased. For each specimen thickness a linear variation of the maximum displacement and energy absorbed with the impact-energy/thickness ratio was found.

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the Spanish cork {{industry}} had lost its hegemonic position to Portugal, in the world market of manufactured cork. In this work we intend to demonstrate that one of the most important explanations of the consolidation of this country's leadership in the cork business lies in the formation and development of the industrial cork district of Aveiro (Santa Maria da Feira) in the north of Portugal. It was there where the growth of the Portuguese stopper industry took place and with this, the decisive orientation of this nation towards the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>cork,</b> substituting the traditional Portuguese trade in cork planks. We argue that the legislation that established the control of the industrial investment in Portugal, the so-called Industrial Conditioning {Condicionamento Industrial) did not restrict the opening of small cottage industries in the north, that fact being a determining reinforcement of the competitiveness of Aveiro in the world stopper trade. Another measure of major importance was the wage regulation covering this industry, being responsible for the wage differential favourable to the north comparing with the south and the centre of the country. Finally, we highlight the role of a big company (Amorim&Irmaos) in the formation and development of this industrial district, which became a leader firm in this sector at a world-wide level...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of sustainable development is the implementation of effective and sustainable waste management strategies. The present study focuses on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to different waste management strategies for <b>natural</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers, namely incineration at a municipal solid waste incinerator, landfilling in a sanitary landfill, and recycling. In the literature, there are no LCA studies analyzing in detail the end-of-life stage <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers {{as well as other}} cork products. In addition, cork is usually treated as wood at the end-of-life stage. Thus, the outcome of this study can provide an important insight into this matter. The results showed that different management alternatives, namely incineration and recycling, could be chosen depending on the impact category considered. The former alternative presented the best environmental results in the impact categories of climate change, ozone depletion and acidification, while the latter for photochemical ozone formation and mineral and fossil resource depletion. The landfilling alternative did not present the best environmental performance in any of the impact categories. However, when the biogenic carbon dioxide emission was assessed for the climate change category, the landfilling alternative was found to be the most effective since most of the biogenic carbon would be permanently stored in the cork products and not emitted into the atmosphere. A sensitivity analysis was performed and the results showed that there are various parameters that can significantly influence the results (e. g., carbon content in cork and decay rate of cork in the landfill). Thus, LCA studies should include a detailed description concerning their assumptions when the end-of-life stage is included in the boundaries since they can influence the results, and furthermore, to facilitate the comparison of different end-of-life scenarios. The present study and the obtained results could be useful for the decision-making process concerning public solid waste policies and industrial strategies...|$|R
40|$|Cork is {{the bark}} of Quercus suber tree. This bark has an amazing number of {{possible}} uses, particularly {{for the production of}} cork stoppers. Metals in cork can come from different sources; it could be from the field or the different industrial process that the cork suffers before the transformation to the final product [1]. There are different types <b>of</b> <b>corks</b> such as <b>natural</b> <b>cork</b> that is a 100 % natural product, agglomerated stoppers which can be manufactured by individual moulding or extrusion, and in both methods, the agglutinated substance used to connect the cork granules is approved for the use in food contact materials. These stoppers are entirely made from granulated cork from sub-products from the production <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>cork.</b> In the present work, cork samples from different steps of the industry process were analysed. The following chemical elements were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) : Vanadium (V), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Selenium (Se), Lead (Pb), Cobalt (Co), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn) and Strontium (Sr). The method for sample preparation of cork stoppers consisted on grinding and homogenizing samples, followed by an acid-assisted microwave digestion to destroy the organic matrix. For quality control purposes parameters such as repeatability, linearity of the calibration curve, blanks or recovery of spiked samples were monitored and complied with the acceptance criteria established by the laboratory. Several elements were present in the samples in amounts above the quantification limits (ppb or ppt level). However, and according to European legislation [2], the total amount of the elements found was always below the maximum limit.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 <b>Natural</b> <b>corks</b> {{have long}} been used as wine closures. However, they are {{associated}} with causing multiple adverse effects to the wine they are attempting to preserve. Alternative closures such as synthetic corks and screw caps were developed {{in order to reduce}} and/or eliminate these problems. However, the major cause of concern regarding these closures is of consumers' acceptance. The effect of how three types <b>of</b> closures (<b>Natural</b> <b>Cork,</b> Synthetic Cork and Screw Cap) affected wine consumers' perceptions of the quality of wine was examined in this study. This project was divided into two experiments. The first experiment determined if frequent wine consumers could detect sensorial differences between the three closure types. The second experiment ascertained if and how regular wine consumers' perceptions were altered based on the type of closure with which the wine samples were bottled. It was determined that the wine consumers could not significantly detect a difference between any of the three closure type samples based only on sensory stimuli.

For both <b>natural</b> and agglomerated <b>corks,</b> the Young's modulus was significantly and similarly affected by hydration, with a constant plateau value up to 50 % relative humidity (RH) and a mean value around 22 and 14 MPa, respectively. For higher RH, the increase in water content leads to {{a decrease in the}} material rigidity (Young's modulus < 10 MPa), which is attributed to water clusters formation between polymer chains. Technical stoppers revealed a similar profile, but with a much smaller impact of the water content and with overall lower Young's moduli values, around 5 MPa, throughout the RH range. The stiffness of synthetic closures was not affected by hydration, in agreement with the hydrophobic behavior of polyethylene. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis allowed us to identify a glass transition temperature (T (g)) in cork (around 0 A degrees C), and another one in agglomerated cork and technical stoppers (close to - 45 A degrees C, corresponding to additives).
