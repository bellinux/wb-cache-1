For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when it suddenly vanished, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages {{were sent to the}} National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E

25|$|Leopold de Rothschild, whose {{principal}} country residence was Gunnersbury Park, used Ascott {{at first}} as a hunting box, but realising the limitations imposed by its modest size, in 1874 he employed the architect George Devey to enlarge it. The present half-timbered house is largely {{the result of that}} commission. Devey attempted to design a house that rambled <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> grown and developed over centuries. The project became a lifetime work for Devey as the house was continually expanded during the remainder of the 19th century. The rambling and climbing shrubs he had planted as part of the design of the facades that Mary Gladstone described in her memoirs are no longer there.|$|E

500|$|The name Shaw {{is derived}} from the Old English word sceaga, meaning [...] "wood". The name Crompton is also of Old English derivation, from the words crom or crumb, meaning [...] "bent" [...] or [...] "crooked", and ton, for [...] "hamlet or village". A local {{historian}} stated that [...] "this name aptly describes the appearance of the place, with its uneven surface, its numerous mounds and hills, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been crumpled up to form these ridges". The University of Nottingham's Institute for Name-Studies has offered the suggestion that the name Crompton means [...] "river-bend settlement", which may reflect Crompton's location on a meander of the River Beal.|$|E

Bauer cautions about the need to distinguish between the receipt of information and its [...] "internalization"—the point at which it is deemed worthy of action—arguing that this is a complicated process: [...] "During the Holocaust, countless individuals received information and rejected it, suppressed it, or rationalized about it, were thrown into despair without any possibility of acting on it, or seemingly internalized it and then behaved <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> never reached them." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, Carol safely lands his plane and rushes to greet Liz on set. All they can muster on short notice is a polka band and a large cake with Fonzie on it—gifts that were intended to celebrate janitor Jadwiga's birthday. She proceeds to ruin the TGS goodnights and tear into the cake with her bare hands. In Jack's office, Liz and Jack share a drink as Liz's birthday wish. In the final scene, as Jack takes a drink, the program reverts to a pre-recorded segment and Jack says, [...] "That's more like it." [...] The episode ends with a live goodnight from the TGS stage by the cast of the episode, a la Saturday Night Live.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to be filmed, in September 2010. It was mainly filmed on a council estate in Bath, Somerset, while the scenes in the dollhouse were filmed in Dyrham Park. The Bristol estate was chosen because of its [...] "crisp architecture". The country house of Dyrham Park was chosen because of its {{staircase}} and checked flooring. The antiques were stripped out of the building and replaced with [...] "child-like" [...] furniture that was placed to look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been played with. Several designs of the dolls were made, trying to achieve the desired balance of a normal doll and a scarier, more [...] "crude"-looking one. The actors portraying the dolls were choreographed to move with stiff legs but swing their arms. In the scene in which Alex and the Doctor are in the kitchen they open and close the fridge as they are talking; this was not in the script, but improvised by Smith and Mays on set. Mays was invited to guest-star in the episode, and was drawn to the story because of the family element; he has a young son like George. The scene in which Purcell sinks into the carpet was filmed with actor Andrew Tiernan on a hydraulic platform that lowered him into green-coloured liquid.|$|E

There was also a rutter and a document, printed at Macau in 1590, containing valuable information on the China and Japan trade; Hakluyt observed that it was [...] "enclosed {{in a case of}} sweet Cedar wood, and lapped up almost an hundredfold in fine Calicut-cloth, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been some incomparable jewel".|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{considered}} a successful adaptation of licensed material to a video game, with critics describing {{it as one of}} the most faithful video game adaptations ever, such that moving the player-character was like walking on the set of the show. GamesRadar said that The Stick of Truth was to South Park as [...] was to the Batman franchise in terms of reverence to the source material while breaking new ground in video games. They praised the [...] "open-world South Park to explore, with a solid 12–14 hours of inside jokes, obscure references, and humor that pulls from 17 TV seasons' worth of social commentary and offensive humor." [...] Computer and Video Games said that the game contained so many references to the show's history that it made [...] appear sparse. Destructoid said that the ability to walk around the detailed town provided a sense of wonderment similar to exploring The Simpsons home town in [...] The visual translation was highlighted as a significant component of the game's success, appearing indistinguishable from an episode of the show and providing a consistent aesthetic that remained faithful to the series while being original to gaming. Some reviewers said that the art style was occasionally detrimental, obscuring objects and prompts, and that repetitive use of animations grew stale over the course of the game. Computer and Video Games said that Obsidian had built a game world that seemed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> always existed.|$|E

500|$|Louis Dow {{had died}} in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands' {{marriage}} then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a [...] "melancholic, a failure [...] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".|$|E

2500|$|Much like Germany, Austria {{was divided}} into American, British, French, and Soviet zones and governed by the Allied Commission for Austria. As {{forecast}} in the Moscow Declaration in 1943, [...] a subtle difference {{was seen in the}} treatment of Austria by the Allies. The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives, and Communists (until 1947), and residing in Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the Western Allies in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet. Thus, the creation of a separate Western Austrian government and the division of the country was avoidable.

One of his soldiers, Georgia volunteer William Andrews, wrote that Jackson was [...] "a very ordinary looking man of medium size, his uniform badly soiled <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> seen hard service. He wore a cap pulled down nearly to his nose and was riding a rawboned horse that did not look much like a charger, unless it would be on hay or clover. He certainly made a poor figure on a horseback, with his stirrup leather six inches too short, putting his knees nearly level with his horse's back, and his heels turned out with his toes sticking behind his horse's foreshoulder. A sorry description of our most famous general, but a correct one." [...] His horse was named [...] "Little Sorrel" [...] (also known as [...] "Old Sorrel"), a small chestnut gelding which ironically was a captured Union horse from a Connecticut farm. He rode Little Sorrel throughout the war, and was riding {{him when he was}} shot at Chancellorsville. Little Sorrel died at age 36 and is buried near a statue of Jackson on the parade grounds of VMI. (His mounted hide is on display in the VMI Museum.) ...|$|E

[...] She felt the house was acting, nothing seemed to be natural; objects did not wait to be seen but came crowding in on her, each with what amounted to its aggressive cry." [...] Naomi's deceased aunt's home in Twickenham is similarly described, though there is a suggestion of future redemption: [...] "the aunt's house was hollow, completely dead. But someone else would move in almost at once, and be here next spring, no doubt, to enjoy the cherry." [...] A third house is the home of Colonel and Violet Bent lived in Rushbrook, the house in Ireland that Karen briefly visited before returning to the Michaelis home in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London. But that Irish home is itself a replacement of an earlier great house, the ancestral home of Colonel Bent, which was burned during the Irish War of Independence.|$|E
