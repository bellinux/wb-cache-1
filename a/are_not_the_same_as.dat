5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> Servodrive subwoofers {{whose primary}} mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination {{in favor of}} a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E

25|$|Interest in polytheistic mythology revived {{during the}} Renaissance, with early works on mythography {{appearing}} in the sixteenth-century, such as the Theologia Mythologica (1532).

Notably, {{during the nineteenth century}} period of Romanticism, folktales and fairy tales were perceived as eroded fragments of earlier mythology (famously by the Brothers Grimm and Elias Lönnrot).|$|E

25|$|Segregation affects {{people from}} all social classes.

But their neighborhoods <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> those of whites having the same socioeconomic characteristics; and, in particular, middle-class blacks tend to live with white neighbors who are less affluent than they are. While, in a significant sense, they are less segregated than poor blacks, race still powerfully shapes their residential options.|$|E
25|$|Periodontal {{disease is}} the most common disease found in dogs and affects more than 80% of dogs aged three years or older. Its {{prevalence}} in dogs increases with age, but decreases with increasing body weight; i.e., toy and miniature breeds are more severely affected. Recent research undertaken at the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition has established that the bacteria associated with gum disease in dogs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in humans. Systemic disease may develop because the gums are very vascular (have a good blood supply). The blood stream carries these anaerobic micro-organisms, and they are filtered out by the kidneys and liver, where they may colonize and create microabscesses. The microorganisms traveling through the blood may also attach to the heart valves, causing vegetative infective endocarditis (infected heart valves). Additional diseases that may result from periodontitis include chronic bronchitis and pulmonary fibrosis.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, UCAS {{publishes a}} {{university}} entrance tariff table that converts IB and other qualifications into standardised [...] "tariff points", {{but these are}} not binding, so institutions are free to set minimum entry requirements for IB candidates that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> those for A level candidates. Most universities in the UK require IB students to take more courses than A-level students—requiring, for instance, four As and two Bs from an IB student, whereas an A-level student will only need an ABB—because each subject taken {{as a part of the}} IB gives a less broad coverage of a similar subject taken at A-level.|$|E

500|$|Linear transformations and the {{associated}} symmetries {{play a key role}} in modern physics. For example, elementary particles in quantum field theory are classified as representations of the Lorentz group of special relativity and, more specifically, by their behavior under the spin group. [...] Concrete representations involving the Pauli matrices and more general gamma matrices are an integral part of the physical description of fermions, which behave as spinors. For the three lightest quarks, there is a group-theoretical representation involving the special unitary group SU(3); for their calculations, physicists use a convenient matrix representation known as the Gell-Mann matrices, which are also used for the SU(3) gauge group that forms the basis of the modern description of strong nuclear interactions, quantum chromodynamics. The Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix, in turn, expresses the fact that the basic quark states that are important for weak interactions <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as,</b> but linearly related to the basic quark states that define particles with specific and distinct masses.|$|E
500|$|A {{spherical surface}} {{like that of}} the Earth {{provides}} a simple example. The location of any point on the surface can be described by two coordinates: the geographic latitude and longitude. Unlike the Cartesian coordinates of the plane, coordinate differences <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> distances on the surface, as shown in the diagram on the right: for someone at the equator, moving 30 degrees of longitude westward (magenta line) corresponds to a distance of roughly [...] On the other hand, someone at a latitude of 55 degrees, moving 30 degrees of longitude westward (blue line) covers a distance of merely [...] Coordinates therefore do not provide enough information to describe the geometry of a spherical surface, or indeed the geometry of any more complicated space or spacetime. That information is precisely what is encoded in the metric, which is a function defined at each point of the surface (or space, or spacetime) and relates coordinate differences to differences in distance. All other quantities that are of interest in geometry, such as the length of any given curve, or the angle at which two curves meet, can be computed from this metric function.|$|E
500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers {{on the idea that}} transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being {{a man or a woman}} irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E
