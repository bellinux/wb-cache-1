5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded {{by the forces}} affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} supply U.S. allies, much more {{production}} was required than was possible through the firms producing the M2 (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> M3 Half-track).

This led to IH producing for lend-lease the M5 Half-track and M9 as equivalents for the M3 and M2 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{revealed}} a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, {{he moved from}} London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> counterculture.|$|E

5|$|Most restorations of ceratopsians {{show them}} with erect hindlimbs but semi-sprawling forelimbs, which {{suggest that they}} were not fast movers. But Paul and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> species may have been as fast as rhinos, which can run at up to 56km or 35 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} exist in formal oxidation states other than +4 or +2.

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Old School and New School factions {{merged with the}} slavery controversy. The New School's enthusiasm for moral reform and voluntary societies was evident in its increasing identification with the abolitionist movement. The Old School, however, {{was convinced that the}} General Assembly <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> church should not legislate on moral issues that were not explicitly addressed in the Bible. This effectively drove the majority of Southern Presbyterians to support the Old School faction.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. He concluded that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger,</b> large-crested specimens represent males.|$|E

5|$|The {{success and}} economy of {{multiple}} rocket launchers (MRL) have {{led them to}} continue to be developed. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 launchers somewhat inspired by the earlier weapon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> BM-27. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type multiple launch rocket systems, including bomblet submunitions, remotely deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.|$|E
5|$|The {{uplifting}} {{and increased}} erosion exposed granitic {{rocks in the}} area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.|$|E
5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E

5|$|Although Canada was a {{major source}} of uranium ore and heavy water, these were {{controlled}} by the Americans. Anglo-American cooperation broke down, denying the Montreal Laboratory scientists access to the materials they needed to build a reactor. In 1943, the Quebec Agreement merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project. The Americans agreed to help build the reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects left, and John Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946. Two reactors were built at Chalk River. The small ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> NRX on 21 July 1947. NRX was for a time the most powerful research reactor in the world.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{were still}} not in {{agreement}} and some {{argued that the}} black color morph was a different species from the mostly white morph. This proposal was discounted by a 2001 study of the mitochondrial DNA of both. A 2009 study analyzed the differences in morphology, including color, meristic variation, spine, dermal denticles (tooth-like scales) and teeth of different populations. Two distinct species emerged: the smaller M. alfredi found in the Indo-Pacific and tropical east Atlantic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> M. birostris found throughout tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans. The former is more coastal while the latter is more ocean-going and migratory. A 2010 study on mantas around Japan confirmed the morphological and genetic differences between M. birostris and M. alfredi.|$|E
5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
