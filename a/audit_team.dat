40|$|Abstract Background Obstetric {{near-miss}} case reviews {{are being}} promoted as a quality assurance intervention suitable for hospitals in low income countries. We introduced such reviews in five district, {{regional and national}} hospitals in Benin, West Africa. In a cross-sectional study we analysed {{the extent to which}} the hospital <b>audit</b> <b>teams</b> were able to identify case management problems (CMPs), analyse their causes, agree on solutions and put these solutions into practice. Methods We analysed case summaries, womenâ€™s interview transcripts and audit minutes produced by the <b>audit</b> <b>teams</b> for 67 meetings concerning one woman with near-miss complications each. We compared the proportion of CMPs identified by an external assessment team to the number found by the <b>audit</b> <b>teams.</b> For the latter, we described the CMP causes identified, solutions proposed and implemented by the <b>audit</b> <b>teams.</b> Results <b>Audit</b> meetings were conducted regularly and were well attended. <b>Audit</b> <b>teams</b> identified half of the 714 CMPs; they were more likely to find managerial ones (71 %) than the ones relating to treatment (30 %). Most identified CMPs were valid. Almost all causes of CMPs were plausible, but often too superficial to be of great value for directing remedial action. <b>Audit</b> <b>teams</b> suggested solutions, most of them promising ones, for 38 % of the CMPs they had identified, but recorded their implementation only for a minority (8. 5 %). Conclusions The importance of following-up and documenting the implementation of solutions should be stressed in future audit interventions. Tools facilitating the follow-up should be made available. Near-miss case reviews hold promise, but their effectiveness to improve the quality of care sustainably and on a large scale still needs to be established. </p...|$|R
