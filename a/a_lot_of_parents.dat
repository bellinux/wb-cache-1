The study also investigates factors influencing pre-course expectations, and whether the students’ subsequent experiences in New Zealand match their pre-course expectations. The research uses a qualitative-interpretivist methodology. The study involves face-to-face interviews with the participants and uses semi-structured questions to elicit in-depth narratives. Interview data are analysed, similar responses are categorised and reported as themes of the findings. Research findings reveal that parents paid the tuition fees and living costs {{of most of the}} participants.

According to the World Bank (2002), aggregate household spending on tutoring at the pre-university level represents the largest household education expense (even compared to spending on private school tuition and fees). According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (1996), {{it is not}} uncommon for households with children in the secondary education level to spend up to 25 % of annual income on tutoring. Observing <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> deciding to invest in tutoring does not necessarily imply that there are corresponding high returns to tutoring. There may be imperfect information on payoffs, especially given that some of the returns are long-term, and that parents’ decisions may be affected by peer effects rather than by information on payoffs. It is therefore important to find out if such an investment pays off in terms of better education outcomes or if these resources would be better spent on improving the quality of the formal schooling system.

This international evolution causes national family law to be improved, which reinforces the rights of a child.

50|$|Hank {{starts a}} new year at his school and meets his new teacher, who has her {{students}} write an essay about their summer vacations. Hank {{has a hard time}} with homework and with staying on task, thus making his essay a difficult assignment. Meanwhile, his grandpa, Papa Pete, asks Hank and his friends Ashley Wong and Frankie Townsend (the Magic 3, the name Hank gave to himself and his friends) to put on a magic show at his bowling league game. However, his teacher made a statement to Hank saying she can't wait to see his creative report, so he has to do his report and perform for Papa Pete. Hank decides to make a model of Niagara Falls - the place where he spent his vacation - rather than write about it, but when he presents the project in class, he accidentally floods the classroom. Hank is given two weeks of punishment at school and at home. His punishment includes not being able to participate in the magic show for Papa Pete's bowling league. Finally, after <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> convincing, his <b>parents</b> allow him to do the magic show. It was a relief to all the people at the bowling alley because class bully and overall idiot Nick McKelty was performing in the Magic 3's place. The magic show happens, and McKelty gets laughed at for his lame performance and thrown off stage, where the Magic 3 performs a great magic trick and the audience applauds. In the end, things go well for Hank, as he also meets the new music teacher, Mr. Rock, during detention, and they instantly like each other. Mr. Rock helps Hank with his essay and talks with his parents about his learning disabilities, which no one knew Hank had.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis was to describe parents' experiences of having an infant born prematurely and experiences {{on the use of}} real-time videoconferencing in providing support to <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> preterm born infants at home. A descriptive qualitative method was chosen to achieve the overall goal of this thesis. Qualitative research interviews were used for data collection and qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis. All studies included in this thesis were conducted in collaboration with a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) {{in the northern part of}} Sweden. This thesis describes parents' reaction to the preterm birth as unexpected; they were not ready or prepared for it. The initial time after the birth felt surreal and it was hard to feel like a mother or a father. Parenting was experienced with anxiety as well as with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stressors. <b>Parents</b> were unacquainted with and had a great need for knowledge about preterm birth. The lack of knowledge was straining, as parents wanted to understand what was happening. Parents were worried about the infant getting ill, injured, and being affected for life, or not even surviving. Being close to their infant was vital. Fathers also wanted to be with their partner as they were protective over both mother and infant. The preterm birth made it possible for fathers to spend time with their infant and they thought that they had a stronger bond with their baby compared with those who had full-term children. Taking their infant home was experienced with mixed feelings, but this made it possible for the whole family to be together. The experience with most staff was regarded as positive as parents felt they were well treated. The opposite was also described - not being involved in the infant's care and in making decisions to the extent that they wanted. To be able to cope and feel confidence about caring for their infants, parents needed support, both at the NICU and after going home. Parents must be given the opportunity to share their experiences of having an infant born prematurely with others, especially the partner, nursing staff, and parents with children born prematurely. Having access to staff at all hours by videoconferencing was supportive and gave parents confidence in their new situation. However, the need to control the use of videoconferencing was expressed. The videoconference meetings were comparable with the meetings parents and certified pediatric nurses (CPNs) had at the NICU. Videoconferencing enabled CPNs to meet the whole family and to assess the overall situation at home; security could be provided to the family. The use of the equipment made them reflect on continuing and developing the use of videoconferencing, but it takes time to implement changes. Videoconferencing can be a way to offer support to families after bringing their preterm infant home. This implies a change in traditional nursing care in order to avail of perceived benefits using technology. The results in this thesis have implications for nursing staff meeting families with a child born prematurely as well as for parents with prematurely born infants. Understanding the specific needs <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> is <b>of</b> outmost importance for nursing staff to enable them to provide support and facilitate parenting. Meeting parents with openness and listening to their experiences can help them both as individuals and as a whole family.

5000|$|INEZI {{promotes}} Industriousness, good cooking {{skills and}} handiwork {{which are very}} good qualities for sustaining marriage. It is expected that young maidens who have these qualities attached to their beauty are attracted to their suitors who ask for their hands in marriage. Their costumes {{are made up of}} natural cosmetics like uye, nzu, uli,which are used to adorn their body with beautiful marks. They wore beads known as Olokpo on top of their nja which they wear on their waist. Their legs are adorned with anklets called akpulu-ulu. Their hair do is usually is I mbute (wigs). These attire drive men crazy.The last four days were marked with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> celebrations, <b>parents</b> came to town with plenty of foods and drinks to entertain family members, friends in-laws who came to celebrate with their daughters. The isi ikolobia helps with fetching fire woods and pounding of yams and fufu. During the opu ive ezi (outing rite), all the maidens assembled themselves at Ilo for beauty parade. Having dressed to kill, they danced and demonstrated and showed their beauty especially to the eligible bachelors. Every participants were involved except those who had married and gone to their husbands already within the period of long ceremony. It should be noted that some young men on having chosen some young girls to marry do not wait for them to finish the year long ceremony, for fear that men more handsome and richer than them would snatch them away. They rushed to finish everything and their heart throbs away before it become too late. In this regard such girls were made to have mock ezi known as iti udu before going to their husbands. For that reason, they were not required to come back and participate in the final ceremony.The young maidens during the parade carry udu (a small pot) which they beat as they parade with songs. This ceremony is known as ibi aka n'udu or iti udu. While the already married maidens parades while carrying chewing stick in their mouth the free maidens and not betrothed don't carry chewing stick. Therefore, chewing stick is a symbol to show that she is not free for suitors. This is fantastic and fascinating worth a colourful sight to behold. During the parade the most beautiful girl was noted and cheered but not giving any award except that she will have more suitors. After the ceremony the married maidens goes back to their husbands while those yet to be married wait for their time. It {{is important to note that}} its only the wayward girls never gets married months after the ceremony and during the ada masquerade such girls are usually sang with ( [...] Nma enwerodi na Nma ekilisi ada). This waiting period is very critical and tempting for parents and it is their onus to guide against their daughter having illicit affair so that they won't get pregnant during that period and therefore lose their chance of getting a better suitor. Girls with such misadventure are married off to old men who might probably be looking children. This is a humiliation to both parents and family members (this is another pointer that INEZI does not promote promiscuity nor illicit affair as insinuated).The beautiful maidens wear skimpy dresses that reveal their pointed breasts which suggests they are virgins those breasts dangles as they dances and sets their admirers on fire. It is also believed that ibi aka n'udu is a symbol of virginity as those who are not virgins are not allowed to pass through that rite. It was also said that ezi ceremony helps young men who were not thinking of marriage to start thinking in that direction.|$|R
