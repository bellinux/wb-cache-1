5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

He brought others with him; he wanted them involved. That's what made him so different: It felt like a five-player stampede moving toward you—and at his pace.

This would require forgoing any future Olympic competition. At the time, Jenner's agent George Wallach felt there was a four-year windowuntil the next Olympicsupon which to capitalize. Wallach reported that Jenner was being considered for the role of Superman, which ultimately went to Christopher Reeve. [...] "I really don't know how many offers we have," [...] Wallach claimed.

500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> want to freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually {{supposed to be a}} way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain. A bit exaggerated but that's what it feels like when you're so into someone".|$|E
500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Between the Times and the Tides are {{composed}} in alternate guitar tunings, except [...] "Fire Island" [...] which is composed in standard tuning. Speaking {{of the use of}} tunings on the album, Ranaldo said [...] "they're all brand-new tunings on this album, none of them are from the Sonic Youth period. They're things that started happening, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> sort of roll with it." [...] He further explained that [...] "Fire Island" [...] was the first song he composed in standard tuning since Sonic Youth's debut EP, released in 1982. [...] "Waiting on a Dream", the album's opening track, contains a guitar riff that, according to Damian Fanelli, resembles The Rolling Stones' 1966song [...] "Paint It, Black" [...] and [...] "Tomorrow Never Comes", the album's closing track, references The Beatles' 1966song [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows." ...|$|E

500|$|Lynch recalls {{having a}} happy childhood, {{although}} {{he suffered from}} bouts of agoraphobia in his youth, especially after having been scared by a screening of Henry King's 1952 film Wait till the Sun Shines, Nellie, when he was six years old. He would develop a brief habit of wearing three [...] neckties at a time, which he understands {{to have been a}} manifestation of his personal insecurity. He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world—" [...] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it was supposed to be. But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there's this beautiful world <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> look a little bit closer and it's all red ants".|$|E
500|$|Timbaland {{worked on}} seven songs for Björk’s 2007 album, Volta, {{including}} [...] "Earth Intruders", [...] "Hope", and [...] "Innocence" [...] and he later worked on tracks {{for the new}} Duran Duran album, Red Carpet Massacre, including one featuring his frequent collaborator Justin Timberlake. Later in the year, Timbaland produced songs for Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's LP, Strength & Loyalty and the song [...] "Ayo Technology" [...] on 50 Cent’s album Curtis. Timbaland also produced most of the tracks on Ashlee Simpson's third CD, Bittersweet World, including the song [...] "Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)". On April 3, 2007, Timbaland released a collaboration album featuring artists including 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Elton John, Fall Out Boy, Nelly Furtado, Missy Elliott, and others called Timbaland Presents Shock Value. A rivalry flared up between Timbaland and record producer Scott Storch in early 2007. The tension initially started on the single [...] "Give It to Me", when Timbaland anonymously backlashed Storch: [...] "I'm a real producer <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> the piano man". In an interview, Timbaland confirmed that {{he was talking about}} Storch. The dispute partly stemmed from controversy regarding writing credits for Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River".|$|E

A writer of Fox News Channel {{commented that the}} judges [...] "didn't want to stop {{listening}} to Melanie Amaro" [...] while she was singing a [...] "soaring rendition" [...] of the ballad. Simon Cowell said, [...] "I brought this show to America because I believe {{some of the greatest}} singers in the world are from this country, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> proved that. I think you, based on that performance tonight, to me, should be the winner of 'The X Factor,' because you're going to represent this country all over the world." [...] L.A. Reid also commented, [...] "That wasn't a $5 million performance. That was a $50 million performance." [...] Sarah Maloy of Billboard magazine felt that her performance was [...] "as powerfully and passionately [...] as she did the first time". Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised Amaro's rendition, writing that it contained a [...] "determined look on her face, lots of generous spreading of the arms, and plenty of big notes". Amaro eventually emerged as the winner of The X Factor, performing this song for the final time.|$|E

500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> know it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E
500|$|Wright {{wanted to}} write and direct a cop film because [...] "there isn't really any {{tradition}} of cop films in the UK... We felt that every {{other country in the}} world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none." [...] Wright and Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script. The first draft took eight months to develop, and after watching 138 cop-related films for dialogue and plot ideas and conducting over fifty interviews with police officers for research, the script was completed after another nine months. The title was based on the various two-word titles of action films in the 1980s and 1990s. In one interview Wright declared that he [...] "wanted to make a title that really had very little meaning...like Lethal Weapon and Point Break and Executive Decision." [...] In the same interview, Pegg joked that many action films' titles [...] "seem to be generated from two hats filled with adjectives and nouns <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just,</b> 'Okay, that'll do.'" [...] While writing the script, the film's director and writer, Edgar Wright, as well as Pegg, intended to include Frost as the partner for Pegg's character. Frost revealed that he would do the film only if he could name his character, and he chose [...] "Danny Butterman".|$|E
500|$|Mahone is {{depicted}} as an intelligent FBI agent with [...] "an amazingly sharp mind", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, [...] "It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking." [...] Mahone {{has been described as}} [...] "intellectually matched with Scofield", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the [...] "brains of the operation" [...] and Mahone as his [...] "arch-nemesis, sort of his equal {{on the other side of}} the law." [...] Michael and Mahone have been described as [...] "two sides of the same brilliant coin"; however, Mahone notes, [...] "there's one big difference between you and I (sic), Michael. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely." [...] Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he [...] "doesn't do everything he does because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's going to start to come out." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{sheet music}} {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] {{is written in}} common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Set in the key of A major, it follows the basic chord progression of A–E–D for the verse and A–E–Fm–D progression for the chorus, while Gaga's voice spans from A3 to D5 Gaga's references for the saxophone solo was E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen hence she ultimately asked Clarence Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument. Clemons told Rolling Stone that in January 2011, he was contacted by Gaga's management and {{they wanted him to}} play on Born This Way. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that he could record it on the coming Monday or Tuesday, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. Clemons flew from Florida to New York, and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "The Edge of Glory". She simply told Clemons, [...] "We'll put the tape on <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> play". The recording concluded by 3 a.m. after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised to get paid, since he [...] "would have done it for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." ...|$|E
500|$|Trailing the Minnesota Vikings 20–19 with 72 {{seconds left}} in the fourth quarter at the Metrodome in week 11, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate 22-yard pass on fourth and 17 to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory 22–20. In the Giants' three previous games, Simms had completed only six passes to wide receivers. In the Giants' victory he completed eight to wide receivers, four to tight end Mark Bavaro and 13 to his running backs—four to Ottis Anderson in the final two drives, three to Maurice Carthon, three to Joe Morris and three to Tony Galbreath. Simms commented years later, [...] "t's my favorite game in my career, because it's everything I always wanted to be as a player. I wanted to be tough, making big throws, immune to pressure, not worried about outcomes. It was truly like standing on the tee box in golf and there's trees on each side and water <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> go 'Man, I'm gonna rip it down the middle.' And no other thought crosses your mind." [...] The game has frequently been credited as a signature game of their season, and the Giants players celebrated the victory in the tunnel leading to their locker room and in the locker room itself in a raucous manner that was highly atypical for the team. [...] "They high-fived themselves silly", recalled Peter King. [...] "They were screaming and hooting and raising hell—happier than they had been all year." ...|$|E
500|$|With Rolling Stone, Clemons {{described}} how he recorded the saxophone solo with Gaga.

Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that {{he would be able to}} record it on the coming week, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. After accepting her request, Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "Hair". Before Clemons started work on the song, she explained the lyrics to him. [...] "It made so much sense," [...] he said. [...] "It's a story about growing up." [...] She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song, saying [...] "'We'll put the tape on <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.'". The recording was finished by 3:00 am, after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised for [...] "getting paid for this. I would have done it for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." [...] According to the sheet music [...] published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time. It is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals span from F3 to F5, and the song follows a basic sequence of F–C–Dm–B as its chord progression.|$|E
