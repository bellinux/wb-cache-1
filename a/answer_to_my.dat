500|$|At Hoover's inauguration on March 4, 1929, Taft recited part of {{the oath}} incorrectly, later writing, [...] "my memory is not always {{accurate}} and one sometimes becomes a little uncertain", misquoting again in that letter, differently. His health gradually declined over the near-decade of his chief justiceship, and he wrote in 1929, [...] "I am older and slower and less acute and more confused. However, as long as things continue as they are, and I am able to <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> place, I must stay on the court {{in order to prevent}} the Bolsheviki from getting control".|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Sedaka's {{career began}} a sharp decline, hastened by The Beatles' arrival {{on the radio}} and TV, {{and the rest of the}} {{so-called}} British Invasion. When describing the Beatles' effect on his career in the mid-1960s, Sedaka put it brusquely: [...] "The Beatles—not good!" [...] From 1964 to 1966, only three of his singles cracked the Hot 100: [...] "Sunny" [...] (No. 86, 1964), [...] "The World through a Tear" [...] (No. 76, 1965), and [...] "The <b>Answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Prayer" [...] (No. 89, 1965). His other singles from this era—"The Closest Thing To Heaven", [...] "I Hope He Breaks Your Heart", [...] "Let The People Talk", [...] "The Answer Lies Within" [...] and [...] "We Can Make It If We Try"—all missed the Hot 100, the same fate since Sedaka's third U.S. single, and became commercial failures.|$|E

60|$|I {{thanked him}} {{and made my}} way thither across the {{reception}} hall. The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> question was given at once.|$|E
60|$|I {{will write}} no more, {{that you may}} have the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> kind {{proposition}} as soon as possible. After the fortnight.|$|E

60|$|I roused my energies, and {{the next}} time the wily Beadle summoned me, I went. The Beadle was the blankest Beadle I have ever looked on when I <b>answered</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> name; and his discomfiture gave me courage to go through with it.|$|R
60|$|Before me here lies his <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> letter--my {{confession}} to him. How he trusts me, when even now he never doubts.|$|E
60|$|First, That cavilling {{here and}} there, at some expression, or little {{incident}} of my discourse, {{is not an}} <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> book.|$|E
60|$|Well and good! On {{that issue}} every Socialist is with them. But their <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{question}} is none the less wrong.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. You must <b>answer</b> {{accordingly}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> question. Don’t {{turn them}} away.|$|R
60|$|I {{received}} {{a dozen or}} more <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> advertisement, some of which were very amusing, and others very unsatisfactory.

60|$|The guide looks slowly {{all round}} him, and {{then looks at}} me. That is his <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> question. And that is enough.|$|E

60|$|The latter {{portion of}} this {{question}} was almost immediately <b>answered</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> satisfaction {{by the appearance of}} Miss Ruth, who came skipping down to me and calling out to me in that free and hearty manner with which a woman addresses a friend or near acquaintance, but never a suspected lover. She betrayed no more notion of the Lecks and Aleshine scheme than on the day I first met her.|$|R
6000|$|Then came my uncle's amazing telegram, his <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hostile note: [...] "Come {{to me at}} {{once you}} are wanted three hundred a year certain tono-bungay." ...|$|E

60|$|Bert. Bad men, when 'tis their interest, may do good. I must confess, I counselled Sancho's murder; And {{urged the}} queen by specious arguments: But, still suspecting that her love was changed, I spread abroad the rumour of his death, To sound the very soul of her designs. The event, you know, was <b>answering</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> fears; She threw the odium {{of the fact}} on me, And {{publicly}} avowed her love to you.|$|R

60|$|Then I bethought me of {{my prayer}} upon the pylon tower of Abouthis and of the <b>answer</b> given <b>to</b> <b>my</b> prayer, and {{wondered}} if that, too, were a dream.|$|R
