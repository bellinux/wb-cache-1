5|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by music critics for being musically diverse. One critic <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> {{out that it}} resembled some of McLaughlin's work that he released in the 1970s.

5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen {{by some as a}} {{political}} trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment. The federal parliament had notably amended the Constitution in order to create legal possibilities to condemn the party. The Vlaams Blok <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> at the problem of political nomination of judges, and again claimed that the lawsuit had been a political process coordinated with the Belgian Ministry of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> {{out that}} the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department {{had to contend with}} the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E

5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, 2004, a {{judge ruled}} {{that the police had}} {{reasonable}} justification to raid Goliath's. Defense lawyers countered that none of the anonymous information the police acted uponfor example that live sex shows were being staged and drugs sold on the premisesfeatured in the charges made against the seventeen men. They <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the police failed to call in the force's gay community liaison officer. Goliath's reopened {{a little more than a}} month after the raid.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Horner <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the tyrannosaur lineage {{had a history of}} steadily improving binocular vision. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E

5|$|Skate punk innovators <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> {{in other}} {{directions:}} Big Boys helped establish funkcore, while Venice, California's Suicidal Tendencies had a formative {{effect on the}} heavy metal–influenced crossover thrash style. Toward {{the middle of the}} decade, D.R.I. spawned the superfast thrashcore genre. Both developed in multiple locations. Sacramento's Tales of Terror, which mixed psychedelic rock into their hardcore sound, were an early influence on the grunge genre. D.C.'s Void {{was one of the first}} punk-metal crossover acts and influenced thrash metal.|$|E
5|$|The dodos on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for Sycorax's {{character}} {{may have come}} from the classical literature familiar to many in Shakespeare's day. Sycorax is similar to Medea, a witch in Ovid's Metamorphoses, in that both are powerful, magical female figures. Scholars have <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that Sycorax resembles the magical Circe from Greek mythology as well as perhaps a version of Circe found in the mythology of the Coraxi tribe in modern-day Georgia.|$|E

5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, Croatian {{historian}} Davor Marijan {{concluded that}} the battle was too complex for the HV and especially for the HVO. He <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the HV and HVO suffered from ineffective command structures and poor intelligence, noting that they had failed to detect {{the presence of the}} VRS 16th Motorised and the 1st Armoured Brigades early on. Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle, and his view is supported by Colonel General Novica Simić, commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade, assigned to Tactical Group 1, which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the experiment in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted {{that at the time of}} death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> out that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.|$|E
