Shaw, was hired. Shaw, a student at the time, had previously been hired on in 1930 as assistant entomologist to the college Experimental Station, but with the resignation of Farrar, his responsibilities would shift as he began to teach courses in beekeeping and pollinator ecology. In 1935, he was made an [...] "Instructor in Economic Entomology and Beekeeping" [...] while concurrently finishing his Ph.D. of entomology at Cornell University. In 1944, Shaw left to serve in the Second World War. Eventually, he would be promoted from being an instructor to an assistant professor in 1954. UMass would continue to offer beekeeping courses and maintain a beekeeping section of the entomology department right up through the 1970s, however it appears there was never another superintendent hired to replace Byard and much of the extension work to state beekeepers seems to have ceased. Professor Shaw went on to coauthor a comprehensive beekeeping and ecology textbook with UC Davis apiologist John Eckert. This textbook, intended to replace the beekeeping text of the same name by renowned apiculturalist E. F. Phillips, would be published for a total of seven editions from 1960 through 1977. Shaw retired in 1969 at the age of 61, he would be the first and last [...] "Professor of Beekeeping" [...] to do so as the position was abolished immediately after. Following his retirement, a student scholarship fund for the department of entomology was set up by the department in Shaw's name.|$|E
500|$|As the apiary {{became a}} {{research}} laboratory, classroom and an extension {{service to the}} state, the demand increased for these services and thus it became necessary to maintain additional hives. It is for these reasons that, in 1913, Dr. Gates hired John L. Byard as superintendent of the apiary. Some of Byard's responsibilities included performing wax extractions, running the college's apicultural exhibit at fairs and maintaining the hive yard from day to day. [...] He would continue to maintain the building, the equipment and the hives {{until his death in}} 1920; professors Henry T. Fernald and Arthur I. Bourne would continue his work until his successor arrived the following year. Gates had been promoted from an assistant to an associate professor in 1915, and had continued to work both as a lecturer and as the apiarist of the experimental station. From 1913 to 1914 he was made president of the National Beekeepers' Association, twice hosting conventions in Amherst concluding the college's winter and spring sessions of the college beekeeping school. However, in 1918 he left Amherst for a professorship at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, leaving his former position open for the two years that followed. Gates' and Byard's duties would be taken up by several different people in the next decade. From 1921 to 1923 all beekeeping and <b>apiology</b> work at the Experimental Station was taken up by Professor Norman Phillips, who soon resigned for a job at a commercial apiary. He was replaced by Professor Morton H. Cassidy, an alumnus of the college, who stayed for 3 more years but ultimately had to resign due to his severe asthma. In 1926, a Mr. Clayton L. Farrar was made instructor of beekeeping. Farrar, a graduate of Kansas Agricultural College, also performed extensive work on several entomology projects as a research assistant before leaving in 1931 to work at a Federal laboratory.|$|E

Subsamples of 10 to 100  µl were used performing qualitative analysis of the pollen spectrum and quantitative determination of maize pollen and total pollen counts according to VDI 4330 Part 3 (2007) under 400 -times magnification. For qualitative analysis of the surveyed pollen spectrum, all microscopically differentiated plant pollen were identified and documented (naming species, genus and family). The Melissopalynological Collection of Celle (von der Ohe and von der Ohe 2000) was used as a reference for identification. The taxonomic naming of plant species was carried out according to Zander (2002).|$|E
