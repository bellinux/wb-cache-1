5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, <b>arginine</b> <b>vasopressin</b> and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{absorption}} {{is affected}} by the release of interleukin-6 as this can cause the secretion of <b>arginine</b> <b>vasopressin</b> which, in turn, can lead to exercise-associated dangerously low sodium levels (hyponatremia).

25|$|The first {{ability is}} a hormone cycle {{that reduces the}} body's urine production. At about sunset each day, the body {{releases}} a minute burst of antidiuretic hormone (also known as <b>arginine</b> <b>vasopressin</b> or AVP). This hormone burst reduces the kidney's urine output well into the night so that the bladder does not get full until morning. This hormone cycle is not present at birth. Many children develop it {{between the ages of}} two and six years old, others between six and the end of puberty, and some not at all.|$|E
25|$|When a {{cigarette}} is smoked, nicotine-rich blood passes from the lungs {{to the brain}} within seven seconds and immediately stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; this indirectly promotes the release of many chemical messengers such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, <b>arginine</b> <b>vasopressin,</b> serotonin, dopamine, and beta-endorphin {{in parts of the}} brain. Nicotine also extends the duration of positive effects of dopamine and increases the sensitivity of the brain's reward system to rewarding stimuli. Most cigarettes contain 1â€“3 milligrams of inhalable nicotine. Studies suggest that when smokers wish to achieve a stimulating effect, they take short quick puffs, which produce a low level of blood nicotine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary control}} of {{cortisol}} is the pituitary gland peptide, ACTH, which probably controls cortisol by controlling {{the movement of}} calcium into the cortisol-secreting target cells.

2500|$|Vasopressin, {{also named}} {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), [...] <b>arginine</b> <b>vasopressin</b> (AVP) or argipressin, is a hormone synthesized as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and {{is converted to}} AVP. It then travels down the axon of that cell, which terminates in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). AVP has two primary functions. First, it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons. Second, AVP constricts arterioles, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure.|$|E

50|$|In the kidney, AVPR2's primary {{property}} is {{to respond to}} <b>arginine</b> <b>vasopressin</b> by stimulating mechanisms that concentrate the urine and maintain water homeostasis in the organism.

50|$|Felypressin is a non-catecholamine {{vasoconstrictor}} that is chemically {{related to}} vasopressin, the posterior pituitary hormone.

5000|$|... ==Function== AVPR1B {{is found}} in {{different}} parts of the body and thus has several influences and regulatory actions. <b>Arginine</b> <b>vasopressin</b> influences several symptoms related to affective disorders including significant memory processes, pain sensitivity, synchronization of biological rhythms and the timing and quality of REM sleep. Studies have shown that AVPR1B deficiencies produce behavioral changes that can be reversed when the peptide is replaced. These effects are expressed through contact with specific plasma membrane receptors. AVPR1B is responsible for fueling the effects of vasopressin on ACTH release. This interaction takes place as <b>Arginine</b> <b>Vasopressin</b> works with corticotropin releasing hormone to stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete ACTH. AVPR1b is then responsible for mediating the stimulatory effect of vasopressin on ACTH release. Several G proteins are also involved in the signal transduction pathways linked with AVPR1B. [...] These relationships depend on the level of receptor expression and concentration of vasopressin. For example, AVPR1B causes secretion of ACTH from the anterior pituitary cells in a dose-dependent relationship by activating protein kinase C via the Gq/11 protein.|$|E
50|$|Nephrogenic {{diabetes}} insipidus (also known as renal {{diabetes insipidus}}) {{is a form}} of diabetes insipidus primarily due to pathology of the kidney.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in the ability of the kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.|$|E
