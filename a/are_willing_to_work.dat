25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand model implies that by mandating a price floor above the {{equilibrium}} wage, minimum wage laws should cause unemployment. This is because {{a greater number of}} people <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at the higher wage while a smaller number of jobs will be available at the higher wage. Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded. An imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the low-skill labor market, as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage, whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment.|$|E
25|$|Child labour {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013), more than 250 million {{children}} are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013). Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.|$|E

500|$|While {{dopamine}} has {{a central}} role in mediating [...] "wanting" [...] — associated with the appetitive or approach behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli, detailed studies have shown that dopamine cannot simply be equated with hedonic [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure, as reflected in the consummatory behavioral response. Dopamine neurotransmission is involved in some but not all aspects of pleasure-related cognition, since pleasure centers have been identified both within the dopamine system (i.e., nucleus accumbens shell) and outside the dopamine system (i.e., ventral pallidum and parabrachial nucleus). [...] For example, direct electrical stimulation of dopamine pathways, using electrodes implanted in the brain, is experienced as pleasurable, and many types of animals <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> to obtain it. Antipsychotic drugs used to treat psychosis reduce dopamine levels and tend to cause anhedonia, a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Many types of pleasurable experiences—such as sex, enjoying food, or playing video games—increase dopamine release. All addictive drugs directly or indirectly affect dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens; these drugs increase drug [...] "wanting", leading to compulsive drug use, when repeatedly taken in high doses, presumably through the sensitization of incentive-salience. Drugs that increase synaptic dopamine concentrations include psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. These produce increases in [...] "wanting" [...] behaviors, but do not greatly alter expressions of pleasure or change levels of satiation. However, opiate drugs such as heroin or morphine produce increases in expressions of [...] "liking" [...] and [...] "wanting" [...] behaviors. Moreover, animals in which the ventral tegmental dopamine system has been rendered inactive do not seek food, and will starve to death if left to themselves, but if food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and show expressions indicative of pleasure.|$|E
2500|$|Strictly speaking, an {{operating}} system (and thus, a kernel) {{is not required}} to run a computer. Programs can be directly loaded and executed on the [...] "bare metal" [...] machine, provided that the authors of those programs <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> without any hardware abstraction or operating system support. Most early computers operated this way during the 1950s and early 1960s, which were reset and reloaded between the execution of different programs. Eventually, small ancillary programs such as program loaders and debuggers were left in memory between runs, or loaded from ROM. As these were developed, they formed the basis of what became early operating system kernels. The [...] "bare metal" [...] approach is still used today on some video game consoles and embedded systems, but in general, newer computers use modern operating systems and kernels.|$|E
2500|$|Polgár {{has rarely}} played in women's-specific tournaments or {{divisions}} {{and has never}} competed for the Women's World Championship: [...] "I always say that women should have the self-confidence that they {{are as good as}} male players, but only if they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and take it seriously as much as male players." [...] While László Polgár has been credited with being an excellent chess coach, the Polgárs had also employed professional chessplayers to train their daughters, including Hungarian champion IM Tibor Florian, GM Pal Benko, and Russian GM Alexander Chernin. Susan Polgár, the eldest of the sisters, 5½ years older than Sophia and 7 years older than Judit, {{was the first of the}} sisters to achieve prominence in chess by winning tournaments, and by 1986, she was the world's top-rated female chess player. Initially, being the youngest, Judit was separated from her sisters while they were in training. However, this only served to increase Judit's curiosity. After learning the rules, they discovered Judit was able to find solutions to the problems they were studying, and she began to be invited into the group. One evening, Susan was studying an endgame with their trainer, a strong International Master. Unable to find the solution, they woke Judit, who was asleep in bed and carried her into the training room. Still half asleep, Judit showed them how to solve the problem, after which they put her back to bed. László Polgár's experiment would produce a family of one international master and two grandmasters and would strengthen the argument for nurture over nature, but also prove women could be grandmasters of chess.|$|E
