40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the links between dispositional mindfulness, <b>body</b> comparison, <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. It was expected that mindfulness {{would be associated with}} less <b>body</b> comparison <b>and</b> more <b>body</b> satisfaction. Two models were tested: one exploring body comparison as a mediator between mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> an alternative model exploring mindfulness as a mediator between <b>body</b> comparison <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. In an online survey, 1287 Dutch women answered questions concerning dispositional mindfulness, <b>body</b> comparison, <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. Results showed that body comparison was related negatively to both dispositional mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction, whereas the two latter variables were related positively. Body comparison partially mediated the relation between mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. However, a stronger indirect effect was noted in the alternative model, where mindfulness partially mediated the link between <b>body</b> comparison <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction.

40|$|Prior {{literature}} {{examines the}} {{direct relationship between}} personality traits <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem. This article explores the possibility that self-esteem mediates this relationship. 165 undergraduate women and 133 men (age 18 - 21; 42. 6 % Hispanic, 28. 9 % Asian, 28. 5 % Caucasian) completed items measuring personality traits (Big Five), self-esteem, <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem. Path analyses were used to test for mediation. The analyses confirmed that in {{both men and women}} self-esteem mediated the relationship between three personality traits <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem: higher levels of conscientiousness, emotional stability, and extraversion were associated with higher self-esteem <b>and</b> consequently higher <b>body</b> esteem. Once self-esteem was included in the model the relationships between personality traits <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem were not significant, suggesting full mediation. In addition, the analyses revealed several racial/ethnic differences. In Asian American participants, self-esteem mediated the relationship between conscientiousness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem <b>and</b> between emotional stability <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem. In Hispanic Americans, self-esteem mediated the relationship between conscientiousness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem <b>and</b> between extraversion <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem. <b>And</b> in Caucasian Americans, self-esteem mediated the relationship between emotional stability <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem <b>and</b> between extraversion <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem. The most important contribution of this study is evidence for an indirect relationship between personality traits <b>and</b> <b>body</b> esteem, with this relationship being mediated by self-esteem. This has important implications for the study of personality and eating disorders in young adults, most particularly implying a need for more emphasis on self-esteem as a predictor of body image problems...|$|R

To clarify the specific status of head <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice, we sequenced 524 base pairs (bp) of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of 28 head <b>and</b> 28 <b>body</b> lice from nine countries. Ten haplotypes that differed by 1 - 5 bp at II nucleotide positions were identified. A phylogeny of these sequences indicates that these head <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice are not from reciprocally monophyletic lineages. Indeed, head <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice share three of the 10 haplotypes we found. F-ST values and exact tests of haplotype frequencies showed significant differences between head <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice. However, the same tests also showed significant differences among lice from different countries. Indeed, more {{of the variation in}} haplotype frequencies was explained by differences among lice from different countries than by differences between head <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice. Our results indicate the following: (1) bead <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice do not represent reciprocally monophyletic lineages and are conspecific; (2) gene flow among populations of lice from different countries is limited; and (3) frequencies of COI haplotypes can be used to study maternal gene flow among populations of head <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice <b>and</b> thus transmission of lice among their human hosts...|$|R

40|$|Research has {{indicated}} that body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and eating disorder interventions have historically targeted clinically diagnosed individuals. These interventions target specific predicting risk factors such as negative affect <b>and</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction.

The central questions were (i) whether the posited relationship between negative affect <b>and</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction could be replicated for a nonclinical population and (ii) if interventions that target mood would also lead to increases in self-perceived body satisfaction. The efficacy of mood interventions as a means to target body dissatisfaction was investigated.

The following day, key military staff moved into the embassy to establish headquarters for the UNITAF mission, with the main headquarters located within the chancery. The embassy complex itself was in disrepair; buildings had been stripped bare, a foot (0.3m) of debris and trash covered the floors of the chancery, <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> were found in some areas on the premises.

Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified.

5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot of trial and error.

Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} on the individual species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can leap out of the water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small animals can be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> to herd fish into shallow water. They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
