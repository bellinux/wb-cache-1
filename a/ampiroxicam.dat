50|$|Sultams are cyclic sulfonamides. Bioactive sultams {{include the}} {{antiinflammatory}} <b>ampiroxicam</b> and the anticonvulsant sultiame. Sultams are prepared analogously to other sulfonamides, {{allowing for the}} fact that sulfonic acids are deprotonated by amines. They are often prepared by one-pot oxidation of disulfides or thiols linked to amines. An alternative synthesis of sultams involves initial preparation of a linear sulfonamide, followed by intramolecular C-C bond formation (i.e. cyclization), a strategy that was used in the synthesis of a sultam-based deep-blue emitter for organic electronics.|$|E
40|$|An {{asymmetric}} {{approach for}} {{the synthesis of}} substituted δ-sultams with multiple synthetic handles is described. This study demonstrates the facile construction of a stereochemically diverse array of substituted δ-sultams, more specifically substituted 3, 4, 5, 6 -dihydro 1, 2 -thiazine 1, 1 -dioxides. A pivotal Mitsunobu alkylation/RCM sequence is used to assemble key allyl sultam building blocks possessing a C 3 stereogenic handle. All subsequent reactions are achieved {{with high levels of}} diastereoselectivity to afford enantiopure δ-sultams in good yields. Compounds containing the sulfonamide moiety have gained wide popularity due to their extensive chemical and biological profiles, making them promising candidates in drug discovery. 1 Sultams (cyclic sulfonamides), although not found in nature, 2 have also shown potent biological activity, including several with medicinal value. A brief survey of the literature reveals that there are more than 60 sultams with impressive biological activity. The more prominent include the antiepileptic agent sulthiame (1) (Figure 1), 3 brinzolamide (2) 4 for the treatment of glaucoma, the COX- 2 inhibitors <b>ampiroxicam</b> (3) 5 and S- 2474 (4), 6 novel benzodithiazine dioxides with both antiviral and anticancer activities (5), 7 a selective inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|AuthorIn the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease, potent disease-modifying drugs are still needed to halt progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration. We have previously shown that meloxicam, an oxicam non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), elicits a potent neuroprotective effect against 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl pyridinium (MPP(+)) -induced toxicity in human dopaminergic SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. This cyclooxygenase-independent neuroprotection of meloxicam is mediated via the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt pathway; however, the specific chemical structure involved in inducing neuroprotection remains unresolved. In this study, we therefore investigated the structure-specific for eliciting the neuroprotective effect by examining a series of NSAIDs against MPP(+) toxicity in SH-SY 5 Y cells. Three oxicam-bearing NSAIDs showed potent neuroprotective effects, although {{none of the other}} 10 oxicam-nonbearing NSAIDs (3 salicylates, 6 coxibs and 1 polyphenol) or 3 piroxicam analogs (including <b>ampiroxicam,</b> a precursor of piroxicam) exerted any neuroprotection. Tenoxicam and piroxicam prevented MPP(+) -induced reduction of phosphorylated Akt levels in cells: a protective mechanism similar to that of meloxicam. Therefore, the oxicam structure was likely to be responsible for exhibiting the neuroprotection by sustaining survival-signaling in dopaminergic cells. The present results raise the possibility that the oxicam-bearing NSAIDs may serve as potential therapeutic drugs to retard or terminate progression of Parkinson's disease via a novel mechanism...|$|E
