40|$|The {{stability}} and dynamic response characteristics of partially-filled tank vehicles are adversely {{influenced by the}} movement of the liquid cargo within the tank. The directional dynamics and stability characteristics of partially-filled tank vehicles are analyzed and enhanced through formulation of an optimal tank configuration, and analytical models for analyses of vehicle responses to steady and transient steering maneuvers, and combined steering and braking inputs. A generic tank cross-section is initially proposed based upon an analysis of the currently used tank configurations. Three different constrained multi-variable optimization functions are formulated and solved to derive optimal tank cross-sections corresponding to various liquid fill conditions. The performance potentials of the optimal tank configurations are initially evaluated in terms of the load transfer properties and static rollover threshold acceleration limit of a partly-filled tractor-semitrailer tank vehicle through development and analyses of a static roll plane model. The influence of tank geometry on the directional response and dynamic roll stability characteristics is further investigated through development and analyses of a constant-speed three-dimensional model of the tank vehicle. The static and dynamic roll response characteristics of the vehicle equipped with two optimal tanks are compared with those of the vehicle with conventional tanks, under various directional maneuvers and liquid fill conditions, to demonstrate the superior potential performance of the optimal tank designs. A three-dimensional quasi-static model of the partially-filled generic tank is further developed to study instantaneous liquid load shift in both the roll and pitch planes under simultaneous applications of lateral and longitudinal accelerations. The tank model is integrated into a comprehensive variable-speed three-dimensional model of an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>combination</b> to investigate the impact of cargo shift on the dynamic response of partially-filled tank vehicles under braking-in-a-turn maneuvers. The dynamic characteristics of tank vehicles are compared with those of the equivalent rigid cargo vehicles to demonstrate the destabilizing effects of the liquid load shift. The dynamic responses of tank vehicles are further investigated in view of variations in vehicle maneuvers, fill volume, road condition, and tank cross-section. From the study, it is concluded that liquid cargo movement within a tank tends to reduce roll stability limits and yaw stability limits of the vehicle, when operating on a dry road and a wet/slippery road, respectively. The performance limits can be considerably enhanced through the use of the proposed optimal design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Handling {{behaviour}} of <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles</b> <b>combination</b> is {{more complex}} and less predictable than that of non-articulated vehicles. It is usually difficult for drivers to maneuver a tractor semi-trailer during high speed emergency braking on split-mu road surface. Braking on this type of road surface, the conventional anti-lock braking systems will cause the vehicle deviate from the desired direction, or overmuch stopping distance. In this paper, a 3 -dof of tractor semi-trailer model was used to produce desired yaw rates which were compared with actual yaw rates. An active front steering control and four-channel ABS were integrated to improve the tractor semi-trailer lateral stability while braking on split-mu road surface, which will produce maximum braking force. A full function tractor semi-trailer model was built and assembled in multi-body dynamics software, and the dynamic analysis was performed on split-mu road surface. The simulation {{results show that the}} integrated system can improve the tractor semi-trailer lateral stability under braking on split-mu road surface...|$|R

40|$|Road safety {{associated}} with vehicle operation {{is a complex}} function of dynamic interactions between the driver, vehicle, road and the environment. Using different motion perceptions, the driver performs as a controller to satisfy key guidance and control requirements of the vehicle system. Considerable efforts {{have been made to}} characterize cognitive behavior of the human drivers in the context of vehicle control. The vast majority of the reported studies on driver-vehicle interactions focus on automobile drivers with little or no considerations of the control limits of the human driver. The human driver's control performance is perhaps of greater concern for <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>combinations,</b> which exhibit significantly lower stability limits. The directional dynamic analyses of such vehicles, however, have been limited either to open-loop steering and braking inputs or simplified path-following driver models. The primary motivations for this dissertation thus arise from the need to characterize human driving behavior coupled with <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and to identify essential human perceptions for developments in effective driver-assist systems and driver-adaptive designs. In this dissertation research, a number of reported driver models employing widely different control strategies are reviewed and evaluated to identify the contributions of different control strategies as well as the most effective error prediction and compensation strategies for applications to heavy vehicles. A series of experiments was performed on a driving simulator to measure the steering and braking reaction times, and steering and control actions of the drivers with varying driving experience at different forward speeds. The measured data were analyzed and different regression models are proposed to describe driverâ€™s steering response time, peak steer angle and peak steer rate as functions of driving experience and forward speed. A two-stage preview driver model incorporating curved path geometry in addition to essential human driver cognitive elements such as path preview/prediction, error estimation, decision making and hand-arm dynamics, is proposed. The path preview of the model is realized using near and far preview points on the roadway to simultaneously maintain central lane position and vehicle orientation. The driver model is integrated to yaw-plane models of a single-unit <b>vehicle</b> and an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The coupled driver-articulated vehicle model is studied to investigate the influences of variations in selected vehicle design parameters and driving speed on the path tracking performance and control characteristics of the human driver. The driver model parameters are subsequently identified through minimization of a composite cost function of path and orientation errors and target directional dynamic responses subject to limit constraints on the driver control characteristics. The significance of enhancing driver's perception of vehicle motion states on path tracking and control demands of the driver are then examined by involving different motion cues for the driver. The results suggest that the proposed model structure could serve as an effective tool to identify human control limits and to determine the most effective motion feedback cues that could yield improved directional dynamic performance and the control demands. The results are discussed so as to serve as guidance towards developments in DAS technologies for future commercial vehicles. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to address the problems}} of modeling, path planning and path following for an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> in a realistic environment and in the presence of multiple obstacles. In greater detail, the problem of the kinematic modeling of an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> is revisited through the proposal of a proper model in which the dimensions and properties of the vehicle can be fully described, rather than considering it as a unit point. Based on this approach, nonlinear and linear error kinematics models are proposed that are also able to account for the effect of the slip angles, a factor that can cause dramatic deterioration in the overall performance of the vehicle. Subsequently, two different concepts for addressing the problem of path following for <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are proposed. The first concept is based on a switching model predictive control architecture, which relies on multiple switching linear error dynamics models of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> to account for the effect of varying the slip angles and cruising speed as well as the mechanical and physical constraints of the vehicle. The second proposed control concept is a novel nonlinear sliding mode controller that introduces continuous sliding surfaces to reduce chattering effects while tracking a reference trajectory. The sliding mode controller is utilized based on the extracted nonlinear error coordinates of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated through multiple experimental tests on a small scale using a fully realistic <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Finally, in the path planning part of the thesis, artificial potential field and bug algorithms are addressed. More specifically, the potential field path planning algorithm is modified by considering the nonlinear kinematic model of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> and correspondingly adapting the repulsive and attractive coefficients. In the case of the well-known bug algorithm, a suitable navigation method for an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> for local path planning based on a minimum set of sensors and with decreased complexity for online implementation is also proposed. Furthermore, the performance of the modified potential field method has been experimentally evaluated in multiple path planning scenarios using the previously mentioned small-scale realistic <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> GodkÃ¤nd; 2015; 20150508 (thanay); NedanstÃ¥ende person kommer att disputera fÃ¶r avlÃ¤ggande av teknologie doktorsexamen.
