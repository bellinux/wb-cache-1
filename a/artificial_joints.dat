25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, <b>artificial</b> <b>joints,</b> edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements. As fiber, it competes with aramid in bulletproof vests.|$|E

60|$|And Hobbes carries this {{comparison}} {{so far as}} actually to give a drawing of the Leviathan--a vast human-shaped figure, whose body and limbs {{are made up of}} multitudes of men. Just noting that these different analogies asserted by Plato and Hobbes, serve to cancel each other (being, as they are, so completely at variance), we may say that on the whole those of Hobbes are the more plausible. But they are full of inconsistencies. If the sovereignty is the soul of the body-politic, how can it be that magistrates, who are a kind of deputy-sovereigns, should be comparable to joints? Or, again, how can the three mental functions, memory, reason, and will, be severally analogous, the first to counsellors, who are a class of public officers, and the other two to equity and laws, which are not classes of officers, but abstractions? Or, once more, if magistrates are the <b>artificial</b> <b>joints</b> of society, how can reward and punishment be its nerves? Its nerves must surely be some class of persons. Reward and punishment must in societies, as in individuals, be conditions of the nerves, and not the nerves themselves.|$|E

40|$|Resection of the odontoid {{process and}} {{anterior}} arch of the atlas results in atlantoaxial instability, which if left uncorrected {{may lead to}} severe neurological complications. Currently, such atlantoaxial instability is corrected by anterior and/or posterior C 1 –C 2 fusion. However, this results in considerable loss of rotation function of the atlantoaxial complex. From the viewpoint of retaining the rotation function and providing stability, we designed an <b>artificial</b> atlanto-odontoid <b>joint</b> based on anatomical measurements of 50 pairs of dry atlantoaxial specimens by digital calipers and 10 fresh cadaveric specimens by microsurgical techniques. The metal-on-metal titanium alloy joint has an arc-shaped atlas component, and a hollow cylindrical bushing into which fits a rotation axle of an inverted v-shaped axis component and is implanted through a transoral approach. After the joint was implanted onto specimens with anterior decompression, biomechanical tests were performed to compare the stability parameters in the intact state, after decompression, after <b>artificial</b> <b>joint</b> replacement, and after fatigue test. Compared to the intact state, <b>artificial</b> <b>joint</b> replacement resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} the range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone (NZ) during flexion, extension, and lateral bending (P <  0. 001); however, with regard to axial rotation, {{there was no significant difference}} in ROM (P =  0. 405), a significant increase in NZ (P =  0. 008), and a significant decrease in stiffness (P =  0. 003). Compared to the decompressed state, <b>artificial</b> <b>joint</b> replacement resulted in a significantly decreased ROM (P ≤  0. 021) and NZ (P ≤  0. 002) and a significantly increased stiffness (P <  0. 001) in all directions.

The <b>artificial</b> <b>joint</b> showed no signs of wear and tear after the fatigue test.
