Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation. Various risk factors contribute to DVT, though many at high risk never develop it.|$|E
5|$|According to Aonuma, the team's {{starting}} point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work {{as a foundation for}} the next title. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to , by that time considered the series' most memorable title. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E

5|$|Although William's main rivals were gone, {{he still}} faced rebellions over the {{following}} years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, {{the introduction of the}} Norman language as the language of the elites, <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> composition of the upper classes, as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, {{which may or may not}} have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Franklin asked Timothy Folger, {{his cousin}} twice removed (Nantucket Historical Society), a Nantucket Island whaling captain, for an answer.

Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the Gulf Stream and giving it the name by which it is still known today. He offered this information to Anthony Todd, secretary of the British Post Office, but it was ignored by British sea captains.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metabolism of warfarin.|$|E

5|$|The {{demolition}} of the arcades of Freedom Square began in October 2010. Excavation {{works for the}} foundations of the Parliament House began soon after demolition was complete.

Construction started later that year, and the steel frame of the structure was complete by early 2012. At this point, it began to be covered in limestone which had been quarried in Gozo, and cut into specific shapes in Italy, before being sent back to Malta. Between 120 and 150 workers were on the construction site every day, and it cost more than €90 million to build.|$|E

In Afghanistan, the expedition triggered reforms and drove political turmoil {{that culminated in}} {{the assassination of the}} Emir in 1919, which in turn precipitated the Third Afghan War. It influenced the Kalmyk Project of nascent Bolshevik Russia to propagate socialist revolution in Asia, with one goal being the overthrow of the British Raj.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing {{of the eyes}} and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30%–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30%–50%), fever (up to 20%), <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> color of stool or urine.
