5|$|Before {{the match}} against Sheffield Wednesday on 11 March 2007, the 1967 cup winning team were paraded at half time at Loftus Road to {{celebrate}} the 40th anniversary of the win. In the 2002–03 Second Division play-off final QPR wore <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> strip in reference to their Football League Cup victory. As of 2015, QPR's victory in the 1967 Football League Cup remains the only major trophy the club has won.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Melvin {{refused to}} {{transfer}} the case of Taylor Strauder, a black man, to a federal court following his indictment by <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> Ohio County grand jury {{for the murder of}} his wife. Strauder and his lawyers argued that he would not receive equal treatment in the West Virginia courts due to its all-white jury law and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1866 for a transfer to a federal court. Following Melvin's ruling, Strauder's murder trial proceeded in the Ohio County court in May 1873, and he was inevitably convicted by <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> jury. Strauder appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States, where his case Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 (1879) was decided on March1, 1880. The Supreme Court held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries {{for no other reason than}} their race violated the Equal Protection Clause, and Strauder's conviction was overturned due to the Ohio County court's violation of United States constitutional criminal procedure.|$|E
5|$|Other notable natives include Miss America 1986 Susan Akin; James Chaney, {{an activist}} {{who was one}} of three civil rights workers murdered in 1964; and Hartley Peavey, founder of Peavey Electronics {{headquartered}} in Meridian. The federal courthouse was the site of the 1966–1967 trial of suspects in the murder of Chaney and two other activists. For the first time, <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing.|$|E

5|$|Rare colours {{can appear}} {{unexpectedly}} in certain lines, for instance while <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> cocker is usually bred by selective breeding of very light golden strains, {{they can still}} appear very uncommonly to parents who are dark colored. A noted occurrence of this happened in 1943, when a grandson of My Own Brucie, Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1940 and 1941, was born all-white.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the club}} colours, sky blue and white, the club is often known by the nicknames Di blåe (Scanian: The Blues) and Himmelsblått (The Sky Blues). The home kit is sky-blue shirts, white shorts, and sky-blue socks. The away strip is black. Various {{alternative}} kits {{have been used for}} European play such as <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> kit introduced in the 1950s, and re-used for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, and all-black kits with sky-blue and golden trimmings were used for the European campaigns in 2005 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> panel of nine officers. The {{experiences}} Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.|$|E

5|$|Guèye had {{arranged}} {{for the creation of}} the Senegalese Ski Federation in 1979, and had initially expected to be unable to compete at the 1984 Olympics due to the qualification requirements and as he was recovering from an injury, but was informed by the International Olympic Committee several months prior that he would be allowed to represent Senegal. Guèye was the first black African to compete at the Winter Games; South Africa became the first African nation to compete at a Winter Games, in 1960, but with <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> team under apartheid.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1938, a {{state visit}} to France by the King and Queen was {{postponed}} {{for three weeks}} because {{of the death of}} the Queen's mother, Lady Strathmore. In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning. The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany. The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.|$|E
5|$|Polled Dorsets are <b>an</b> <b>all-white,</b> {{medium-sized}} sheep, prolific {{and able}} to breed out of season. The carcases are muscular with good conformation and the adults produce a thick fleece, which is free from dark fibers. Since its development, the number of Polled Dorsets registered in the United States has grown to exceed the number of Horned Dorsets. Without horns the sheep are easier to handle and there is much less risk of the rams hurting themselves or others by butting. The Polled Dorset is sometimes confused with the Australian Poll Dorset, but that breed did not start as a genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset breeding program.|$|E
50|$|Myers next {{offered the}} song to Sonny Dae & His Knights, <b>a</b> novelty <b>all-white</b> musical {{group led by}} Italian-American Paschal Vennitti.

50|$|Between 2014 and 2016, Melbourne City wore <b>a</b> mostly <b>all-white</b> home kit, which {{featured}} a vertical light and navy blue strip {{running down the}} right side of the kit. In the 2016/17 season, the home kit was again predominately white though the vertical strip was removed and was replaced with light blue sleeves and collar.|$|R
50|$|Gråsten Palace (Gråsten Slot) is {{best known}} for being the summer {{residence}} of the Danish Royal Family. It is located in Gråsten in the Jutland region of southern Denmark.

5|$|In 1961, Dave Russell {{joined the}} club from Bury who were, at the time, two {{divisions}} above Tranmere. Considered a shrewd businessman, Russell made some revolutionary changes. He developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. More visibly, he introduced <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> kit {{to set the}} team apart from local rivals, Division One club Everton; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. He also {{took advantage of the}} floodlights, regularly arranging home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays; Friday night games continued until the 1990s. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened. He became general manager in 1969, allowing Jackie Wright to take over.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{before a}} tour by the New Zealand rugby team, the South African {{government}} asked New Zealand to field <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> team (thereby excluding Māori players); the New Zealand Rugby Football Union refused and cancelled the tour. As rugby was very popular among white South Africans, this caused concern in that community. The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, {{by then the}} secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances. Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket. Efforts to put pressure on the International Cricket Conference (ICC) failed, and even when South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Before 1914, Southern Rhodesia's {{police force}} was the British South Africa Police (BSAP), first raised in 1889 and reconstituted {{into a more}} {{permanent}} form in 1896. This paramilitary, mounted infantry force was theoretically also the country's standing army. Organised along military lines, it served in the First and Second Matabele Wars of the 1890s, operated on Britain's side in the Anglo-Boer War of 1899–1902 (alongside the specially-raised Rhodesia Regiment), and by 1914 comprised about 1,150 men (including officers). Reserves existed {{in the form of}} the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> amateur force with a paper strength of 2,000 intended for mobilisation against local uprisings. Few doubted the Volunteers' enthusiasm, but they were not extensively trained or equipped; though perhaps useful in a Rhodesian bush skirmish, most observers agreed they would be no match for professional soldiers in a conventional war. In any case, the Volunteers' enlistment contracts bound them for domestic service only.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{volatile}} atmosphere in Miami, which presiding judge Lenore Carrero Nesbitt had termed a [...] "time bomb," [...] {{the trial was}} shifted to Tampa. Jury selection began on March 31, 1980. The trial was heard by <b>an</b> all-male, <b>all-white</b> jury. The lead prosecutor of the case was Janet Reno, later the U.S. attorney general.|$|R

5|$|Real Madrid has {{maintained}} the white shirt for its home kit {{throughout the history}} of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., {{one of the most famous}} teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MacBook Air, the MacBook {{follows the}} same design first {{seen in the}} MacBook Pro; however, it is rounder on the edges than {{previous}} laptops in the MacBook line. This model has <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> fingerprint-resistant glossy palm rest, unlike the grayish surface of its predecessor, and uses a multi-touch glass trackpad like the one found on the MacBook Pro. The video-out port is Mini DisplayPort. The bottom of the MacBook features a rubberized non-slip finish. The built-in battery of the late 2009 revision, a feature introduced {{earlier in the year}} with the MacBook Pro, is claimed by Apple to last seven hours compared with five hours in the older models. However, in tests conducted by Macworld, the battery was found to last only about four hours while playing video at full brightness with AirPort turned off. However, Apple's battery life was calculated with the brightness at the middle setting and while browsing websites and editing word documents, not with video and at full brightness. Gizmodo also reached about the same conclusion in their tests, but with AirPort turned on. The battery included in the mid-2010 model holds an additional five watt-hours over the previous model's and is claimed to last up to ten hours.|$|E
5|$|Millwall's {{traditional}} kit has predominantly {{consisted of}} blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks throughout their 125-year history. For the first 50 years, up until 1936, they {{played in a}} traditional navy blue, similar to the colours of Scotland national team. This colour was chosen because it paid homage to the Scottish roots of the club, with {{the nucleus of the}} first Millwall Rovers squad being from Dundee. In 1936, newly appointed Millwall manager Charlie Hewitt opted to change the kit colour from navy blue to a lighter royal blue, and the team have played in this colour for the best part of 74 years, with the exception of 1968–75 and 1999–2001, in which the team played in <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> strip. Their kit for the 2010–11 season celebrated the 125th anniversary of the club, with Millwall adopting the darker navy blue of their first strip. The club has retained this colour since. As for change colours, yellow or white has been a frequent choice. The club had a grey away kit for the 2002–03 season, and also a green and white striped away kit for the 2003–04 season. Millwall wore a special one-off camouflage kit to commemorate the centenary of the First World War against Brentford on 8 November 2014. It went on sale to fans, with proceeds going to Headley Court, a rehabilitation centre for injured members of the British Armed Forces.|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} the ruling in both the North and South was limited because whites and blacks tended to live in all-white or all-black communities. Initial {{integration}} in the South tended to be symbolic: for example, the integration of Clinton High School, the first public school in Tennessee to be integrated, amounted to admission of twelve black students to <b>a</b> formerly <b>all-white</b> school.|$|R

25|$|Hereford {{originally}} {{played in}} <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> strip, but their traditional colours are white shirts and black shorts. This {{dates back to}} the end of the Second World War when they used material from blackout curtains to make shorts when they ran out of white material. However, they occasionally reverted to <b>an</b> <b>all-white</b> strip, latterly in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons. Their away colours varied over the years, with predominantly yellow colours being used in later years.|$|E

May has spent time in Chicago working with Black Youth Project 100, whom she says cleared the way in legitimizing intentionally all-black, radical spaces, in turn {{paving the way for}} Assata's Daughters.|$|R
50|$|In 1945, she staged the longest-running {{performance}} of Shakespeare's The Tempest ever to play Broadway, with Arnold Moss as Prospero, Canada Lee as Caliban, and ballerina Vera Zorina as Ariel.

50|$|This can be {{reversed}} as a deliberate play on conventions, {{by having the}} evil character dress in white, {{as a symbol of}} their hypocrisy or arrogance. For example, Don Fanucci in The Godfather, Part II is an evil character, but wears <b>an</b> expensive <b>all-white</b> suit as <b>a</b> sign of his esteem, power and prestige. Sometimes protagonists can wear black too, as in Return of the Jedi, wherein Luke Skywalker wears black during the final battle.|$|R
