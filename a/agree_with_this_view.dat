500|$|Scholars have {{recognized}} {{since at least}} the Song dynasty (9601279) that some parts of the book could not have been written by Zhuangzi himself. [...] Since ancient times, however, its first seven chaptersthe nèi piān 內篇 [...] "inner chapters"have been considered to be the actual work of Zhuangzi, and most modern scholars <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view.</b> How many, if any, of the remaining 26 chaptersthe wài piān 外篇 [...] "outer chapters" [...] and zá piān 雜篇 [...] "miscellaneous chapters"were written by Zhuangzi has long been debated. [...] It is generally accepted that the middle and later Zhuangzi chapters are the result of a subsequent process of [...] "accretion and redaction" [...] by later authors [...] "responding to the scintillating brilliance" [...] of the inner chapters. [...] All of the 33 surviving chapters are accepted as compositions from the 4th to 2nd centuries BC.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} {{transport}} costs and trade barriers hinder {{the expansion of}} the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that tariff duties, exchange controls, import quotas and other non-tariff barriers to trade are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing. More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities. As a result, the amount of capital accumulation remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall. Consequently, prices will fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view.</b> Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of [...] "inward looking growth" [...] as opposed to [...] "outward looking growth".

5000|$|This view prospered in 19th century Methodism, {{although}} John Wesley did {{not hold}} to it himself. John Wesley clearly held to the penal substitution view. The governmental theory has been detailed by, among others, 19th-century Methodist theologian John Miley in his Atonement in Christ and his Systematic Theology (...) and 20th-century Church of the Nazarene theologian J. Kenneth Grider in his 1994 book A Wesleyan-Holiness Theology (...) [...] However, according to Roger Olson, it is incorrect to assert that all Arminians <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> because, as he states: [...] "Arminius did not believe it, neither did Wesley nor some of his nineteenth-century followers.

50|$|However, {{some historians}} do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> of history. Historian Daniel Lasker {{does not see}} the {{relationship}} of Christians and Jews in the same light. He contends that that the expulsions Jews in Spain faced in 1492 were {{the product of the}} revolts seen a century earlier in 1391. Even though the relationship might have been positive, it ended on a negative note. The expulsions of the Jews in various regions is that ending, {{with a wide range of}} reasons behind them not just religion. The reason for the Jews returning to regions they were expelled from was not acceptance as to what happened, but a sense of comfort and familiarity. While Lasker acknowledges that Jews and Christians as having some positive relationships he does not want to write off the tension of the area.|$|E

5000|$|Most people, {{following}} J.R.G.

[...] Turner calls this a [...] "sieve" [...] explanation, and the Turner explanation might be called the [...] "Turner sieve" [...] hypothesis. Maynard Smith <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> in his authoritative textbook. Nevertheless, the question is not definitively settled. The problem is connected to an even larger question, the evolution of evolvability.|$|R
5000|$|This case arose as a {{challenge}} to the conditions under which pretrial defendants are confined. The petitioners claimed that {{in the absence of a}} conviction, subjecting incarcerated defendants automatically to the same conditions as convicted felons was unconstitutional punishment. The federal district court <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> holding that defendants could only be deprived of liberty as a matter of [...] "compelling necessity".It was also determined that The Supreme Court felt that the possible innocence of pre-trial detainees should not prevent corrections officials from taking necessary steps to maintain their facility.|$|R
50|$|John Ruskin's seminal Modern Painters, {{the first}} volume of which was {{published}} in 1843, argued that it was the purpose of art to represent the world and allow the viewer to form their own opinions of the subject, not to idealise it. Ruskin believed that only by representing nature as accurately as possible could the artist reflect the divine qualities within the natural world. An upcoming generation of young artists, the first to have grown up in an industrial age in which the accurate representation of technical detail was considered a virtue and a necessity, came to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view.</b> In 1837 Charles Dickens began to publish novels attempting to reflect the reality of the problems of the present day, rather than the past or an idealised present; his writings were greatly admired by many of the rising generation of artists.|$|E
50|$|Maimonides in Mishneh Torah Avodat Kochavim chapter 1:1-2 writes:During {{the times}} of Enosh, mankind made a great mistake, and the wise men of that {{generation}} gave thoughtless counsel.

Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. perceived this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored.

60|$|The {{landlord}} <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> {{and after}} taking {{the sense of the}} company, and duly rehearsing a small ceremony known in high ecclesiastical life as the nolo episcopari, he consented to take on himself the chill dignity of going to Kench's. But to the farrier's strong disgust, Mr. Macey now started an objection to his proposing himself as a deputy-constable; for that oracular old gentleman, claiming to know the law, stated, as a fact delivered to him by his father, that no doctor could be a constable.|$|R
50|$|During the 1992 presidential campaign, then-candidate Clinton blasted President George H. W. Bush {{for giving}} China low-tariff trading {{privileges}} despite its human rights abuses. Secretary Christopher <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> {{and believed that}} the US should use economic pressure to force China to improve its human rights record. However, on May 26, 1994, President Clinton renewed China's low-tariff trading privileges, effectively delinking the human rights issue from China's trade relations with the US. U.S.-Sino relations improved as a result, with President Jiang Zemin visiting the U.S. in November 1997 and President Clinton visiting China in June 1998.|$|R
5000|$|In early July 2009, the Board of Directors of the LPGA {{received}} a letter from a group of top players on the Tour calling for Bivens' resignation with two years remaining in her contract. In the letter it was stated that [...] "the majority" [...] of LPGA <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view.</b> The letter came after the announcement that several long-time tournaments would not be returning in 2010 and amidst complaints from tournament directors that Bivens's management style and approach was counterproductive.

50|$|However, not all vocal {{teachers}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view.</b> Thomas Appell's 1993 book Can You Sing a HIGH C Without Straining? {{aimed to}} refute {{the theory that}} all singers switch registers at the same absolute pitch. Appell defined chest voice as resonance below the vocal folds and head voice as resonance above the vocal folds. He recorded examples {{of male and female}} singers changing from chest voice to head voice at different pitches in an attempt to prove that the transition pitch {{is a function of the}} intensity of the vocal tone and is not absolute. At higher vocal cord tension (intensity of singing), Appell shows that the pitch at which a singer transitions from chest to head voice will be higher. At lower vocal cord tension (intensity of singing), Appell shows that the pitch at which a singer transitions from chest to head voice will be lower.|$|E

60|$|Wyllard, drowsy as he was, <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> of the matter. He {{realized}} {{that it would have}} been quite impossible for Dampier to send them any assistance, and it was merely a question whether they should retrace their steps to the edge of the ice next morning and make him some signal. Against this there was the strong probability that he would not run in, if the gale and snow continued, and the fact that it was desirable to make the beach as soon as possible in case the ice broke up before they reached it. What was rather more to the purpose, Wyllard was quietly determined on pushing on.|$|R
60|$|Jack <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> so {{of course}} I gave in, though I could not in my heart approve of such a method of sneaking away.

Here we had no difficulty in retracing our steps to the village, where, having picked up our little companion, Njamie's son, who had been left to play with the little boys of the place, we embarked, swept down the stream, and were soon far beyond the chance of pursuit.|$|R
