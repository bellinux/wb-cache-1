5|$|Madam Butterfly is a 1904 opera by Giacomo Puccini about {{a romantic}} young Japanese bride who is deserted by her American officer husband soon <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> married. It {{was based on}} John Luther Long's short story written in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of M.frustrata was not {{mentioned}} in the original description, Kuo has elsewhere written of the edibility of North American Morchella. In general, morels should not be eaten raw, as they can trigger allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.

5|$|An {{alternate}} pathway of endocytic processing {{had also}} been demonstrated wherein certain proteins like fibrinogen and myoglobin can bind as a whole to MHC-II molecules <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> denatured and their disulfide bonds are reduced (breaking the bond by adding hydrogen atoms across it). The proteases then degrade the exposed regions of the protein-MHC II-complex.|$|E

5|$|Bravely Default {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four {{elemental}} crystals protected by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a religious group with influence across the world. Agnès Oblige, vestal of the Wind Crystal, is forced to begin a journey to awaken the crystals <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> consumed by darkness. Allying with Tiz Arrior, the sole survivor from Norende, amnesiac Ringabel, and Eternian defector Edea Lee, Agnès sets out to awaken the crystals and confront a greater evil responsible for events.|$|E
5|$|Females lay {{from ten}} to three hundred eggs at a time, {{depending}} on species, fertilising {{them with the}} stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit the eggs on moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried faeces, and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.|$|E

5|$|Incubation {{takes two}} weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching {{and covered with}} down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon's milk (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> capable of digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father {{for up to two}} weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|Termites are {{consumed}} {{by people in}} many different cultures around the world. In Africa, the alates are {{an important factor in}} the diets of native populations. Tribes have different ways of collecting or cultivating insects; sometimes tribes collect soldiers from several species. Though harder to acquire, queens are regarded as a delicacy. Termite alates are high in nutrition with adequate levels of fat and protein. They are regarded as pleasant in taste, having a nut-like flavour <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> cooked.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> formed, {{the stars}} in the {{globular}} cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other. As a result, the velocity vectors of the stars are steadily modified, and the stars lose any history of their original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the relaxation time. This is related to the characteristic length of time a star needs to cross the cluster as well as the number of stellar masses in the system. The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster, but the mean value is on the order of 109 years.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Gordon Pym {{was born}} {{on the island of}} Nantucket, famous for its fishing harbor and whaling. His best friend, Augustus Barnard, is the son of the captain of a whaling ship. One night, the two boys become drunk and decide, on Augustus's whim, to take {{advantage}} of the breeze and sail out on Pym's sailboat, the Ariel. The breeze, however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The Ariel is overtaken by the Penguin, a returning whaling ship. Against the captain's wishes, the crew of the Penguin turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. <b>After</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.|$|E
5|$|Borland {{left the}} group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal {{continued}} to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records, but DJ Lethal was asked to leave the band soon <b>after.</b> <b>They</b> <b>are</b> currently recording their sixth studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. <b>After</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> laid.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E

Jackson's former wife (Kate) {{and their children}} (Noah and Lilly) live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon and pilot Gordon Silberman. Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in Yellowstone National Park. When they find an area fenced off by the Army, Jackson and his children climb over the fence. They are caught and brought to the geologist Adrian, who has read Jackson's books. <b>After</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> released they meet Charlie Frost, who hosts a radio show from the park. After Jackson and his children leave, Adrian learns that the Earth is about to undergo drastic changes in a few hours, earlier than expected, with only four of the arks completed.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, unusual environments may {{preserve}} soft tissues. These lagerstätten allow paleontologists {{to examine}} the internal anatomy of animals that in other sediments are represented only by shells, spines, claws, etc. – if they are preserved at all. However, even lagerstätten present an incomplete picture of life at the time. The majority of organisms living at the time are probably not represented because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments, e.g. where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly by events such as mudslides; and the exceptional events that cause quick burial {{make it difficult to}} study the normal environments of the animals. The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms are expected to exist long before and <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> found in the fossil record– this is known as the Signor-Lipps effect.|$|E
