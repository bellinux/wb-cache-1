25|$|In 1955, {{the company}} started {{development}} of new semi-spaceframe chassis with a central backbone. This chassis used outriggers and a steel bulkhead to carry mounting points for doors. In contrast to the earlier chassis, the new design allowed for the seats to be mounted low (six inches from the ground) {{on either side of}} the backbone tunnel. The trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> from the Volkswagen Beetle was used for both the front and rear suspension, setting the precedent of all-independent suspension for TVRs in the future.|$|E
2500|$|The 8C 2900 was {{designed}} to compete in sports car races {{in general and the}} Mille Miglia in particular. [...] It used the 2.9L version of the 8C engine and was based on the 8C 35 Grand Prix racing chassis. As such, it had an inline 8-cylinder 2.9-litre engine using two Roots type superchargers fed by two updraught Weber carburettors and fully independent suspension with Dubonnet-type trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> with coil springs and hydraulic dampers at front and swing axles with a transverse leaf spring at the rear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{for this}} year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over [...] The 1982 model's rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
5000|$|Short long <b>arms</b> <b>suspension</b> — {{also known}} as [...] "unequal length A arm", one of the design {{parameters}} of double wishbone suspension ...|$|R
50|$|The two arms, the spindle, and the body, form a four-bar link. Use of {{the linkage}} {{at the lower}} {{suspension}} connection of either a MacPherson strut or a short long <b>arms</b> <b>suspension</b> readily gives an effective virtual ball joint outboard of the spindle, which is very useful for a suspension designer, allowing negative scrub radius whilst allowing the ball joints to move in and thus {{out of the way}} of the brakes. Some manufacturers use a double ball joint arm to replace both wishbones on a short long <b>arms</b> <b>suspension.</b> This provides further opportunity for optimising the geometry.|$|R
50|$|The term “bogie” {{refers to}} the links that have a drive wheel at each end. Bogies were {{commonly}} used as load wheels in the tracks of army tanks as idlers distributing the load over the terrain. Bogies were also quite commonly used on the trailers of semi trailer trucks. Both applications now prefer trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspensions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{engineer}} {{responsible for}} the chassis and suspension was Willy Black, who had designed and engineered the 600. The drivetrain and suspension {{were similar to those}} of the 600, with a rear-mounted flat-twin engine powering the rear wheels, leading <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> at the front, and semi trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> at the rear. The 700 used a steel monocoque structure, and was the first BMW automobile to do so.|$|E
50|$|The Pulsar 180 {{received}} upgrades like wider tyres, split seat, tank scoops, clip-on handlebars, 3D Pulsar logo, swing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> {{borrowed from}} Pulsar 200, and thicker forks. The power was increased to 17 PS.|$|E
50|$|The Pleasure {{features}} a 100cc engine with variomatic drive transmission system and an engine swing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> system.2013 saw {{a number of}} improvements in the Pleasure, and included a Pleasure Limited edition and the All New Pleasure.|$|E
50|$|A {{short long}} <b>arms</b> <b>suspension</b> (SLA) {{is also known}} as an unequal length double {{wishbone}} <b>suspension.</b> The upper <b>arm</b> is typically an A-arm, and is shorter than the lower link, which is an A-arm or an L-arm, or sometimes a pair of tension/compression arms. In the latter case the suspension can be called a multi-link, or dual ball joint suspension.|$|R
50|$|The B1000 was a {{remarkable}} van at the time; the unusually high loading capacity, two-stroke engine, front wheel drive and semi trailing <b>arms</b> <b>suspension</b> differed from the more traditionally constructed vans in the West. Being the only commercially available van in East Germany, the factory offered many body styles; a flatbed, a panel van, a people carrier, a box van and an ambulance were all available.|$|R

50|$|A widened {{version of}} the E30 front {{suspension}} and the drivetrain from the E30 325i {{were used in the}} BMW Z1 roadster. The BMW Z3 (E36/4) and BMW Compact (E36/5) rear suspensions are also very similar to the E30, but utilizing five-lug hubs. The BMW M Coupe uses a widened {{version of the}} same rear semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{inherent}} {{design of}} the trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> was that it favoured oversteer. Consequently, the BMW 3 Series Compact received mixed reviews from the automotive press; with some claiming the chassis was the most balanced of the E36 range, whilst others said that the car wandered and darted in a straight line, and was uncomposed in the corners.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycle sidecars {{were popular}} {{at the end}} of the 1950s, so the Model 120 was {{provided}} with a purpose built sidecar chassis, connected by a three point mounting which provided minimal alignment problems.

The structural model of the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> utilizes the solid works and aluminum alloys (AA 7079 -T 6) as a <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> material. The finite element analysis and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) technique are used to predict the response of <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> By utilizing the finite element analysis code, the dynamic analysis is performed.

50|$|The Chapman strut {{used the}} driveshafts as <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> thus {{requiring}} only {{the weight of}} one component rather than two. Jaguar's patented independent rear suspension (IRS) similarly reduced unsprung mass by replacing the upper wishbone <b>arms</b> of the <b>suspension</b> with the drive shafts, as well as mounting the brakes inboard in some versions.|$|R
50|$|The General Motors {{connection}} led {{to one of}} the suspension's most numerous uses, with {{a return}} to Europe for the pre-war Vauxhall Twelve and Vauxhall Fourteen from 1935 to 1938. The post-war Vauxhall Velox of 1949 reintroduced a similar trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> which is widely described as 'Dubonnet' suspension. However this suspension used torsion bars rather than coil springs and so Vauxhall themselves denied that this was the 'true' Dubonnet.|$|E
