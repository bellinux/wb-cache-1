40|$|Salmonella Livingstone is {{occasionally}} {{isolated from}} humans, <b>animals</b> and <b>feedstuffs</b> in Sweden. To follow {{the spread of}} infection and trace the source of isolates, adequate typing methods are needed. We have developed an automated typing system based on biochemical fingerprinting of bacteria (the PhP system) for typing of different Salmonella serotypes. The system measures the kinetics of various biochemical reactions of bacteria grown in liquid medium in microtiter plates and uses numerical techniques to identify biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) among the tested strains. In the present study we used a set of 16 highly discriminatory tests to differentiate strains of Salmonella of serotype Livingstone and evaluated the system for its discriminatory ability using a collection of 34 unrelated human isolates of S. Livingstone. We also used the system to investigate BPTs of 45 Livingstone strains isolated from <b>animals</b> and <b>feedstuffs</b> in Sweden between 1987 and 1991. Altogether 19 different BPTs were found among human isolate giving a diversity index (Di) of 0. 930. In contrast, most strains isolated from <b>animals</b> and <b>feedstuffs</b> in Sweden belonged to 2 dominating BPTs (Di = 0. 704). One of these contained 17 strains mainly isolated during 1992 whereas the other contained 18 strains isolated between 1987 and 1991. None of the Swedish human isolates were identical to those of <b>animals</b> and <b>feedstuffs.</b> These findings suggest that 2 different BPTs of Salmonella Livingstone strains are particularly common among <b>animals</b> and <b>feedstuffs</b> in Sweden {{and that they are}} not related to human cases of enteritis in this country. We also conclude that biochemical fingerprinting with the PhP system is a reliable and highly discriminatory method for detecting epidemic strains of Salmonella Livingstone...|$|R

50|$|Copper {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critically}} important of the trace minerals that are essential elements in numerous enzymes that support metabolic functions in most organisms. Since the early 1900s, copper has routinely been added to <b>animal</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> to support good health and normal development. Starting in the 1950s, there was increasing focus on the issue of bioavailability of trace mineral supplements which led to copper sulfate pentahydrate becoming the predominant source. Because of its high water solubility, and thus hygroscopicity, CuSO4 leads to destructive reactions in feed mixtures. These are notoriously destructive in hot, humid climates. Recognition that basic copper chloride would reduce feed stability problems led to issuance of patents on the use of the compound as a nutritional source.|$|E

50|$|By {{harvesting}} {{the layers}} of peat and draining the land the climatic conditions of the entire area were changed considerably. By {{the end of the}} 19th century the keeping of dairy cattle had spread to the area. In Bremen the use of peat for heating was banned because on many winters days the air pollution it caused had become unbearable. Coal, with its greater energy density, superseded peat. Right into the 1980s and 1990s, however, there was continued destruction of the moor. Major 'melioration' measures such as draining, deep ploughing (Tiefumbruch) and river regulation were supposed to increase the productivity of agriculture and even enabled arable farming. Intensive farming methods were used to grow maize as an <b>animal</b> <b>feedstuff.</b> These measures had been supported since the middle of the 20th century by various national and European subsidy programmes. This went so far that ditches dried out in summer, heath fires broke out and, during sustained periods of drought, the land was artificially watered.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Salmonella {{data from}} <b>animals,</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> and feed mills in Sweden between 1993 and 1997. During that period, 555 isolates were recorded from animals, representing 87 serotypes. Of those, 30 serotypes {{were found in}} animals in Sweden for the first time. The majority of all isolates from animals were S. Typhimurium (n = 91), followed by S. Dublin (n = 82). There were 115 isolates from cattle, 21 from broilers, 56 from layers and 18 from swine. The majority of these isolates were from outbreaks, although some were isolated at the surveillance at slaughterhouses. The number of isolates from the feed industry {{was similar to that}} of the previous 5 -year period. Most of those findings were from dust and scrapings from feed mills, in accordance with the HACCP programme in the feed control programme.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the brewing of beer, Alloa {{is the site of}} the former Carsebridge Distillery. According to Alfred Barnard, the Victorian historian of British distilling and brewing, the distillery was founded as a malt distillery by John Bald in 1799. In the 1840s it was converted into a grain distillery and by the time of Barnard's visit in the mid 1880s the distillery covered 10 acres, employed 150 people, and had an annual output of 1.4 to 1.7 million gallons of pure grain whisky. The distillery's owner John Bald and Co was one of five companies that combined to form the Distillers Company Limited in 1877. In 1902, a fire devastated the distillery, after World War I it was refitted and started producing yeast. This yeast production lasted until 1938. In 1956 the distillery was modernised, it expanded in 1966 and in the 1970s a new still house, cooperage and <b>animal</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> plant added. By 1980 the Carsebridge Distillery was the largest grain distillery in Scotland, however it closed in 1983 and was demolished in 1992.

Grading the cooked shrimp ashore gives the non-marketable fraction of too small shrimp, which is not meant for shelling. That fraction is produced all year alongside landings of shrimp and is used for feed-stuff as well. Both extra fractions are listed in the official statistics since 2000 for the first time. That year industrial shrimp made up 6 % of the total landings while the non-marketable, small cooked shrimp summed up to 7 %, respectively. Though being essential for specialised animal feeds they are commercially of very little value, making up to hardly 2 ‰ of the total turnover of the German shrimp fisheries...|$|R

Between 1954 and 1966 the mill was used for grinding <b>animal</b> <b>feedstuff</b> using newly installed electric rollers but also continued producing stoneground flour, too. The mill was sold to the local council in 1969 for £1 and after being renovated was opened in 1974 as a working museum. It is the last working English windmill north of the Humber, producing stoneground wholemeal flour from locally grown wheat. The mill is open to visitors all week, milling takes place from Wednesday to Sunday weather permitting.

The Mill dam once held back a 20 acre broad fed by the River. The water ran under the Mill street to reach the waterwheel, which was probably originally overshot. There has been a mill at this point since the time of the Domesday book. The last mill to work here was built of local brick and flint brought in from local beaches. The original waterwheel went fairly early on, first being supplemented by steam and then replaced by a turbine with half twist drive in 1912 and then later by diesel engines, although water was still used for cooling them. The mill carried on working until 30 November 1976, using its diesel power to mill <b>animal</b> <b>feedstuffs.</b> The watermill was worked in conjunction with the nearby Gimingham postmill until 1877. The original heavy diesel oil engine has been carefully preserved and stands on Mill Street just below the old mill. Gimingham Mill Lake is a very popular fishing location.
