5|$|The {{preceding}} {{section of}} the poem had dealt <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>length</b> with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing her line down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here ē' hoiai (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete {{the account of the}} descendants of Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, the descendants of Sisyphus are soon presented.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>length</b> {{on how to deal with}} the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying in the last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E

5|$|Edwin's renown comes {{largely from}} his {{treatment}} <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>length</b> by Bede, writing from an uncompromisingly English and Christian perspective, and rests on his belated conversion to Christianity. His united kingdom {{in the north}} did not outlast him, and his conversion to Christianity was renounced by his successors. When his kingship is compared with his pagan brother-in-law Æthelfrith, or to Æthelfrith's sons Oswald and Oswiu, or to the resolutely pagan Penda of Mercia, Edwin appears to be something less than {{a key figure in}} Britain {{during the first half of}} the 7th century. Perhaps the most significant legacies of Edwin's reign lay in his failures: the rise of Penda and of Mercia, and the return from Irish exile of the sons of Æthelfrith, which tied the kingdom of Northumbria into the Irish sea world for generations.|$|E
5|$|Eldred {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Oceanside, Long Island, New York by his mother after his father died. Eldred’s older brother, Hubert W. Eldred, was {{instrumental}} in starting Troop 1 of Oceanside, Long Island, New York in November 1910. Troop1 was fully uniformed and their appearance so impressed Chief Scout Executive James E. West that he asked the troop to serve as honor guard for the visit of Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting. West paid the expenses for the troop to travel to New York harbor for Baden-Powell's arrival {{in the morning of}} January 31, 1912. Baden-Powell inspected Troop1, and spoke with Eldred <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>length.</b> It is uncertain how Baden-Powell found out that Eldred's Board of Review was that afternoon, but he ended up attending it and being part of the Board of Review.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{itself was}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} House of Commons on 4 March 1907. The subject was debated in the House of Lords on 21 March, where the proposed changed to the Militia were strongly opposed. The bill had its second reading in the Commons on 9, 10, and 23 April, and was passed into Committee, where it was discussed <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>length</b> over nine days. The opposition to the bill, whilst verbose, was not very effective. Hugh Arnold-Forster, the previous War Secretary, argued that the Territorial Force would prove ineffective in opposition to conscripted Continental armies, whilst the Labour Party objected generally to any increase in military strength. Most of the opposition came from partisans of the existing system; {{as well as the}} implacable opposition from the Militia element, supporters of the Yeomanry objected to the reduction in their daily rates (from 5s. 6d. to 2s. 8d.), whilst Sir Howard Vincent led the opposition from the Volunteers against the stricter control of the new regulations. However, the strong Liberal majority saw off all opposition, and the bill moved for a third reading on 19 June, where it passed with 286 votes to 63. The opposition was mainly led by the Irish MPs, who voted against the government for reasons unrelated to the bill, and some of the Labour Party; most of the Unionists, save a few like Vincent or Charles Dilke, abstained rather than oppose.|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} method of solving queueing network control MDPs with uncontrolled arrivals is to truncate the state space by turning o ¤ arrivals <b>at</b> <b>some</b> queue <b>length.</b> However, this method requires large queue lengths to be accurate. This paper formulates approximate linear programs (ALPs) that give lower bounds average cost. Any di¤erential cost is allowed below <b>some</b> queue <b>length</b> {{but it is}} approximated by a linear form beyond that point. For reentrant lines and a certain approximation, we show that the ALP converges to the average cost as this queue length threshold becomes large. The result is analogous to Sennotts approximating sequence method for showing that truncated MDPs converge to the countable state space problem. The ALP method can have much faster convergence, as demonstrated in numerical tests. ...|$|R
