500|$|Nile Rodgers {{produced}} both {{volumes of}} the soundtrack, in addition to writing and performing the track [...] "Never Surrender" [...] in collaboration with songwriter/remixer Nataraj. Rodgers himself is a video game player, noting {{in an interview that}} [...] "30% to 40% of the [...] budget was spent in downtime playing video games. Since <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> was going to that part of the recording session, I decided {{to figure out what was}} so compelling about it, and I got hooked [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin Conran disputed {{this budget}} {{figure in a}} 2015 interview. “I take great issue with that [...] {{personally}} and I’d like someone to show me where <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> went,” says Kevin. “I don’t support those numbers and I never have. We walked into Jon Avnet’s office that first day and he said, ‘What {{do you want for}} the production?’ and we said $3million. We could have done a version of this film for $3million.

2500|$|Cleveland’s most {{important}} social movement could arguably be {{his contribution to}} the Minneapolis park systems. [...] In lending his unique touch to these parks and scenic byways, Cleveland established a park system that embodied his philosophy of open spaces, naturalistic design, {{and the importance of}} preserving these public spaces for future generations. [...] In the words of Cleveland himself: [...] “They [...] will have wealth enough to purchase <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> can buy, but all their wealth cannot purchase a lost opportunity, or restore natural features of grandeur and beauty, which would then possess priceless value…” [...] In this way, Cleveland inspired future generations of landscape architects to think before tearing down the natural landscape.|$|E
2500|$|... "Three {{years on}} a {{contract}} worth 30 million Belgian francs (£460,000) was a deal beyond VDB's wildest dreams. He never suspected that having <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> in his pocket would set off a terrible downward spiral. He won Het Volk and Liège–Bastogne–Liège before sinking into a doping controversy that was never satisfactorily explained (see below) - even though VDB was cleared by the courts. The team suspended him while the allegations were investigated and relations with their star rider never recovered. When he came back, he showed well in the '99 Vuelta before, remarkably, managing to finish in the front group of the world championship despite fracturing both hands en route. Contractually obliged to stay with Cofidis, VDB had a poor 2000 season. By this point, people in cycling were talking more about VDB's nights out than his riding." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Holden in The New York Times {{praised the}} [...] "taut, {{economical}} screenplay" [...] that [...] "digs into its characters' marrow (and into the perfectly selected details of domestic life) without wasting a word. That screenplay helps to ground a film whose visual imagination hovers somewhere between soap opera and a portentous pop surrealism." [...] USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and Mike Clark wrote, [...] "Diane Lane also reaches a new career plateau with her best performance since 1979's A Little Romance." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Stephen Hunter wrote, [...] "In the end, Unfaithful leaves you dispirited and grumpy: <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> spent, all that talent wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It's an ill movie that bloweth no man to good." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Unfaithful shows what a powerful, sexy, smart filmmaker Lyne can be. It's a shame he substitutes the mechanics of suspense for the real suspense {{of what goes on}} {{between a man and a}} woman, a husband and a wife." [...] Andrew Sarris, in his review for The New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Ultimately Unfaithful is escapism in its purest form, and I am willing to experience it on that level, even though with all the unalloyed joy on display, there's almost no humor," [...] and concluded that it was [...] "one of the very few mainstream movies currently directed exclusively to grown-ups." ...|$|E
