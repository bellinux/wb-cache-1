5|$|Furyū Noh (風流能) {{is little}} more than a dance piece {{characterized}} by elaborate stage action, often involving <b>acrobatics,</b> stage properties, and multiple characters.|$|E
5|$|Peking-opera {{performers}} use {{four main}} skills. The first two are song and speech. The third is dance-acting. This includes pure dance, pantomime, {{and all other}} types of dance. The final skill is combat, which includes both <b>acrobatics</b> and fighting with all manner of weaponry. All of these skills {{are expected to be}} performed effortlessly, in keeping with the spirit of the art form.|$|E
5|$|The Centro Cultural Agustín Ross {{houses the}} local public library, and has four {{exhibition}} rooms, an auditorium, a music room, {{and several other}} rooms in which workshops take place for yoga, <b>acrobatics,</b> theatre, and other disciplines for people of all ages. The restoration of the cultural centre prompted {{the creation of an}} independent organization called the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation).|$|E
5|$|Various {{performing}} art elements in sangaku {{as well as}} elements of dengaku (rural celebrations performed in connection with rice planting), sarugaku (popular entertainment including <b>acrobatics,</b> juggling, and pantomime), shirabyōshi (traditional dances performed by female dancers in the Imperial Court in 12th century), and gagaku (ancient music and dance performed in the Imperial Court beginning in 7th century) evolved into Noh and kyōgen.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court {{at a very}} early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial <b>acrobatics,</b> demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{atmosphere}} performers {{have disappeared}} from most {{sections of the}} park, including Medieval Faire. Two entertainment areas have remained constant in the section, a proscenium theatre and a stunt and acrobatic space surrounded by water. Currently named Wonderland Theatre, the indoor facility has hosted a variety of stage show revues, ice shows, and now an acrobatic production, Cirque Ambiente. A structure within Arthur's Baye initially featured a pirate diving and <b>acrobatics</b> show, which has changed now {{to have a more}} generic theme; it is currently branded Kinet–X.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is sexually mature at {{one to three}} years of age, but in healthy populations they breed after {{two to three years}} of age. A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial <b>acrobatics,</b> precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.|$|E
5|$|The song {{drew the}} {{attention}} of music blogs and received positive reviews from some critics but failed to chart anywhere. A music video for the song, which was directed by Motellet Film and Lo, was released on 5 October 2012. It shows the singer covered in black paint and performing <b>acrobatics</b> {{in the middle of}} a road and on a football field. Lo performed the track several times, including on the Swedish campaign Musikhjälpen and at Notting Hill Arts Club in London, United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{animals in}} zoos were {{typically}} held in poor conditions in small, cramped cages, and the Zoological Gardens presented no exception. As a result, its animals were frequently afflicted by disease, and also {{suffered from the}} harsh easterly winds of the Edinburgh climate. Despite these setbacks, the menagerie attempted to maintain its popularity by putting on concerts, <b>acrobatics</b> shows and displays of fireworks and Montgolfier balloons. Children were carried around the park {{on the back of}} the zoo's elephant, giving it a rare opportunity for exercise. Even with these entertainments, the Zoological Gardens were eventually forced to admit defeat. The park was closed and the site sold to a property developer in 1857. Nothing now remains of the house or its gardens.|$|E
5|$|Chronicles mention more castes {{than the}} four {{commonly}} known castes in the Hindu social system, some {{as many as}} seven castes. One traveller's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudras. The Zakaya or Lahud caste consisted of communities specialising in dance and <b>acrobatics.</b> People in the professions of sailing, hunting, weaving, cobblery, basket making and fishing belonged to specific castes or subcastes. The Antyajas caste provided many menial services to the wealthy. Brahmins enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society; only those Kshatriyas in the Sat-Kshatriya sub-caste (noble Kshatriyas) were higher in status.|$|E
5|$|Politically, the {{treatise}} was a success. At {{the time}} of writing On the Art of the Cinema, Kim's father Kim Il-sung was systematically rallying support for the younger Kim to prepare for his succession. By authoring the work, Kim Jong-il gained social and political power. He secured his father's confidence, thus making succession possible. Kim Jong-il continued to write on the arts until the 1990s and published treatises On the Art of Opera (1974), On the Art of the Drama (1988), On the Art of Dance (1990), On the Art of Music (1991), On Fine Art (1991), On Architecture (1991), On Juche Literature (1992), and On <b>Acrobatics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sibu Bike Week is {{an event}} that is held in December every year since 2011. It is a 3-day event aimed to bring all the enthusiasts of motocyclists, cars, audio systems, BMX, Zumba, and paintball to share their hobbies and experiences. It has {{attracted}} about 2,000 bikers around the world. Among the activities held during Sibu Bike Week are Miss Sibu Bike Week Pageant, Tattoo queen and King competition.

5|$|The 1990s {{brought the}} {{addition}} of the Wild Mouse, the only Wild Mouse roller coaster designed by Dutch company Vekoma. The roller coaster was built in 1985 and had previously operated at Wiener Prater in Austria and Alton Towers in England, before opening at Idlewild in 1993. Kennywood continued the Macdonald tradition of offering large-scale entertainment, presenting circuses, lumberjack and <b>acrobatics</b> shows, and stage performances at the new Hillside Theater. A large picnic area with several log pavilions and game fields was added in 1999. In {{the early years of the}} 21stcentury, additions to the waterpark doubled its size and led to a new name, Idlewild and Soak Zone.|$|E
5|$|The tour, {{divided in}} five segments, portrays {{a story in}} which Spears is a secret agent, who is chased by a stalker named Tormento Lancie; played by Rudolf Martin. The first section {{features}} her escaping from prison along with other female inmates. The second segment displays upbeat dance numbers and ends with a performance inspired by Marilyn Monroe. The third section features an Egyptian theme with fireworks and <b>acrobatics.</b> The fourth segment displays energetic routines and motorcycle costumes. The encore begins with a video interlude of Spears capturing the stalker, and is followed by two performances in which she defeats a group of ninjas.|$|E
5|$|Early {{coverage}} of P.N.03 by GameSpot and IGN highlighted the game's <b>acrobatics</b> and shooting. P.N.03s gameplay was initially {{similar to that}} of Devil May Cry: Vanessa attacked with two pistols and performed acrobatic moves like Devil May Crys protagonist, Dante. Feeling that it resembled Devil May Cry too closely, Mikami altered the game to reward players for performing defensive moves. Mikami wanted Vanessa to use guns, but the developers were unable to complete the animated graphics for weapons in time for release. The guns were substituted by energy bolts fired from the character's hands. In an effort to meet yearly sales goals, Capcom developed P.N.03 quickly and released it in March 2003. Many of Capcom's releases for the year had underperformed. Viewtiful Joe, another Capcom Five title, was delayed into the next fiscal year to decrease the possible sales that had to be offset. After leaving Capcom, Mikami later incorporated ideas he intended for P.N.03 into the 2010 title Vanquish.|$|E
5|$|Performers {{are first}} trained in <b>acrobatics,</b> {{followed}} by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, {{all based on}} the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school. Students previously trained exclusively {{in the art of}} performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians. They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe. In Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking-opera training school.|$|E

25|$|The {{player has}} many acrobatic {{maneuvers}} at their disposal. <b>Acrobatics</b> {{are also used}} in combat to vault over enemies, or hit them into the air. Sometimes when performing these <b>acrobatics,</b> the player is aided by Elika. There are magical plates that allow the player to perform even more complicated acrobatic feats via Elika. If the player fails to signal Elika's magic, they fall off of the plate, sometimes to their death.|$|E
