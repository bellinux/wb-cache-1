5|$|Marge and Lisa {{discover}} Bart's {{deception and}} inform the passengers {{that the virus}} is a hoax. As punishment, the furious passengers maroon the Simpsons in Antarctica and head home. While hiking toward a research station for help, they notice a group of penguins; Lisa is fascinated by {{the chance to see}} them up close, but Bart thinks that their lives are boring and says that the ice slide they are riding down is just one isolated moment of fun. Lisa tells him that capturing <b>and</b> <b>enjoying</b> <b>the</b> best moments in life can make it fun, and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, commenting on how much fun his life has been.|$|E

As he enjoys his summer working on papers for Cambridge {{societies}} and composing his poetry, Brooke leads {{a social life}} flirting with various women <b>and</b> <b>enjoying</b> <b>the</b> company of artists and other students. Brooke soon lusts for Nell, and his increased interest in her leads to unconventional encounters. They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration and love for the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E

5|$|The {{dispute between}} Norreis and his monks {{dragged on for}} years. The interdict of 1207–1213 caused further delays, {{but when it was}} lifted in 1213 the case against Norreis was finally heard. A papal legate visited the abbey and found that the monks were lacking in food, clothes, and other necessities. The liturgy was not being {{performed}} according to the monastic rule because the monks lacked the proper clothing. Charity to the poor had ceased, the monastic buildings were dilapidated, and the monks were forced to beg for their needs. The legate found that the abbot was living well, wearing non-monastic clothes, <b>and</b> <b>enjoying</b> <b>the</b> company of young women in his dwelling, while his monks suffered. Norreis was deposed from the abbacy by the papal legate in 1213.|$|E

Then during Rick Ross's verse the female {{members of the group}} appear posing in the background while Ross raps for the camera. Swizz Beatz and Rico Love make cameos alongside Ross. In a third scene, Diddy can be seen driving through the city at night in a black Bugatti Veyron. For the song's chorus, Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take the lead, ordering drinks in a bar <b>and</b> <b>enjoying</b> <b>the</b> night club. A fourth scene for T.I.'s verse sees the camera focus on T.I. serenading two women in an apartment. Throughout the video the images flicker between the various scenes. In the final part of the video, and during the bridge, all three members of the group appear outside against a backdrop of thick smoke and bright red fireworks. There is a final flash of fireworks before the camera fades completely, to black.|$|E

25|$|However, in 1211 Duke Bernard III of {{the younger}} Duchy of Saxony escorted his {{brother-in-law}} Valdemar, the recently papally recognised, but newly papally deposed archbishop, into the city of Bremen, de facto regaining the See <b>and</b> <b>enjoying</b> <b>the</b> support of Otto IV. The Bremians rejected Gerhard's claim and favoured Valdemar. Innocent inflicted several bans on Valdemar for his inobedience. Bernard fought the forces of Prince-Bishop Gerhard I, aiming at taking over the Bremian see, while Valdemar alienated Bremian ecclesiastical estates to finance Bernard's warfare. As a reaction Valdemar II, now allied with Innocent against Otto IV, recaptured Stade, while in 1213 Otto's elder brother Henry V, conquered it for Prince-Archbishop Valdemar. In 1215 Henry repelled another Danish attack on Stade.|$|E
25|$|In 1858 King Surendra {{bestowed}} upon Jung Bahadur Kunwar the honorific title of Rana, an old title denoting martial glory used by Rajput princes in northern India. He then became Jung Bahadur Rana, and the later prime ministers descended {{from his family}} added his name to their own in honour of his accomplishments. Their line {{became known as the}} house of the Ranas. Jung Bahadur remained prime minister until 1877, suppressing conspiracies and local revolts <b>and</b> <b>enjoying</b> <b>the</b> fruits of his early successes. He exercised almost unlimited power over internal affairs, taking for his own use whatever funds were available in the treasury. He lived in the high style of an Anglicised native prince in the British Raj, although unlike the Indian princes he was the ruler of a truly independent nation, an ally rather than a subordinate of the British.|$|E

25|$|Louis XIV {{had been}} willing to accept the bulk of the demands, {{including}} relinquishing several fortresses to provide for the Dutch Barrier, ceding Strasbourg and many of his rights in Alsace to accommodate a Reichsbarriere on the Empire's western frontier, and recognising the Protestant succession in England, but he could not agree to the terms regarding Spain, and in early June the King publicly rejected the Preliminaries, calling on his subjects for new efforts of resistance. Nevertheless, with French forces under pressure on other fronts Louis XIV was willing to manoeuvre for peace at Philip V's expense, and after the Preliminaries had been rejected he withdrew much of his army from Spain to encourage his grandson's voluntary abdication. However, by now Louis XIV had far less influence over Philip V than the Allies realised, and surrendering Spain was not something which the Spanish King, now firmly established on his throne <b>and</b> <b>enjoying</b> <b>the</b> support of the majority of his subjects, would countenance.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Coronation Street bosses told The Sun {{newspaper}} {{that there were}} no plans to retire the character of Betty, despite actress Betty Driver being 87 at the time, the oldest cast member in the soap. The character was described as [...] "highly valued", with executive producer Kieran Roberts saying, [...] "She is still going strong <b>and</b> <b>enjoying</b> <b>the</b> role. Betty is one of the Street’s great traditional characters who seem to have been there forever. It’s always been our aim to keep a great mix of contemporary stories with older, more traditional characters. Comedy and tragedy combined with very clever writing has always been a trademark of the Street." [...] Actor Rob James-Collier, who played Liam Connor in the soap, has deemed Betty to be one of Coronation Streets two best characters, alongside Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey). He explained: [...] "Betty Driver, who plays Betty can have no {{more than a couple of}} lines in a scene, but she’ll steal it off all the other actors with just a comedy reaction.

[...] Sound on Sights Ricky D thought it wise that the episode focused on Snow and Charming, [...] "without feeling the need to include multiple stories."
