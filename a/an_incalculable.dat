Jeremy had left the school in the summer of 2005, having made <b>an</b> <b>incalculable</b> {{contribution}} to the school's drama output for nearly three decades. A tribute in his honour was performed in early 2007, attended by many former pupils and teachers, in the newly opened Performing Arts Centre, for which Jeremy had campaigned for many years, yet tragically never saw.|$|E
25|$|These points {{represent}} {{the bright side}} of Tatar rule, but it also had its dark side. So long as a great horde of nomads was encamped on the frontier, the country was liable to be invaded by an overwhelming force. Fortunately, these invasions were not frequent, but when they occurred they caused <b>an</b> <b>incalculable</b> amount of devastation and suffering. In the intervals the people had to pay a fixed tribute. At first it was collected in a rough-and-ready fashion by Tatar tax-gatherers; by about 1259 it was regulated by a census of the population; and finally its collection was entrusted to the native princes, so the people were no longer brought into {{direct contact with the}} Tatar officials.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1907, there were {{calls from the}} valley {{population}} and Zermatt hoteliers for the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn to operate also im Winter. The SBB and the VZ refused to conduct such operations, however, due to the high costs that would result, and the consequent lack of profitability. Also, the danger of accidents due to avalanches and flooding was regarded as <b>an</b> <b>incalculable</b> risk. In addition, {{for a long time}} there was, {{on the part of the}} VZ, a stance that in any event Zermatt was not suited to being a winter resort. The Valais Council of State, which viewed the prospect of winter traffic positively, therefore considered the possibility of extending the obligation to operate the VZ to the winter months, at least for the section from Visp to St. Niklaus. As the concession text was limited to stipulating running times, and as, in the absence of any precedent, an amendment to the concession against the wishes of the concession holder would not be feasible, further efforts were abandoned until 1914. With the outbreak of World War I, the demand for continuous operations became obsolete for the time being.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} {{and again in the}} fall of 1933, German-Japanese {{relations}} were badly troubled when the SA took to beating up Asians studying at German universities, which led to a number of complaints to the Auswärtiges Amt from both the Japanese and Chinese governments that their nationals studying at German universities were not safe. Both the Japanese ambassador to Germany and the Chinese minister handed numerous notes of protest in 1933 to Prince Bernard von Bülow, the State Secretary at the Auswärtiges Amt (who {{should not be confused with}} his uncle of the same name who served as Chancellor in 1900–09), complaining about [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] propaganda in German newspapers, reports that the German government was planning on banning interracial marriage and sex, and almost all of the Chinese and Japanese students studying in Germany had been beaten up by the SA. A frustrated Bülow sent a memo to his superior, the Foreign Minister, Baron Konstantin von Neurath, asking if anything could be done to stop the SA from beating up Asians in Germany, saying he was tired of taking almost daily complaints from Japanese and Chinese diplomats about their nationals' being assaulted by the SA. In October 1933, the Japanese government warned its nationals not to visit Germany, saying the country was unsafe for Asians to be in, and in November 1933, the Chinese government issued a similar warning to its citizens not to visit Germany. Neurath persuaded Hitler to order the SA to stop beating up Asians, pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek was threatening to expel the German military mission to China and replace it with a French military mission if the assaults continued. In regards to Japan, Neurath noted it was advantageous to have so many scions of the Japanese elite studying at German universities, arguing that was <b>an</b> <b>incalculable</b> advantage to Germany in the long run. In November 1933, Hitler ordered the SA not to assault Asians in Germany anymore. At this time, Germany had much closer relations with China, to which a German military mission was attached to train the National Revolutionary Army than it did with Japan, and it was the complaints of the Chinese minister rather than the Japanese ambassador that were taken more seriously by the Auswärtiges Amt. At the same time, as the German military mission to China continued to grow together with German arms sales to China, which caused a number of Japanese complaints.|$|E
