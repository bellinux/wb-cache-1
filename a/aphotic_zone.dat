5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E
5|$|Living almost {{exclusively}} in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover with minimal effort; males contain more squalene in their livers than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight {{has found that the}} Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for long. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks.

50|$|The {{open ocean}} is {{relatively}} unproductive {{because of a}} lack of nutrients, yet because it is so vast, in total it produces the most primary productivity. The open ocean is separated into different zones, and the different zones each have different ecologies. Zones which vary according to their depth include the epipelagic, mesopelagic, bathypelagic, abyssopelagic, and hadopelagic zones. Zones which vary by the amount of light they receive include the photic and <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones.</b> Much of the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone's</b> energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of detritus.|$|R
5000|$|Much of the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone's</b> {{energy is}} {{supplied}} by the open ocean {{in the form of}} detritus. In deep water, marine snow is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive photic zone. Marine snow includes dead or dying plankton, protists (diatoms), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The [...] "snowflakes" [...] grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by microbes, zooplankton and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea mesopelagic and benthic ecosystems: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.|$|R
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones</b> by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} {{only a tiny fraction}} of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOffshore {{waters of}} the eastern Mediterranean Sea {{are one of the}} most {{oligotrophic}} regions on Earth in which the primary productivity is phosphorus limited. To study the unexplored function and physiology of microbes inhabiting this system, we have analyzed a genomic library from the eastern Mediterranean Sea surface waters by sequencing both termini of nearly 5000 clones. Genome recruitment strategies showed that the majority of high-scoring pairs corresponded to genomes from the Alphaproteobacteria (SAR 11 -like and Rhodobacterales), Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus and high-light adapted Prochlorococcus) and diverse uncultured Gammaproteobacteria. The community structure observed, as evaluated by both protein similarity scores or metabolic potential, was similar to that found in the euphotic zone of the ALOHA station off Hawaii but very different from that of deep <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones</b> in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.

MethodsWater samples were collected monthly (n = 92) between 2009 and 2011 in two points of the dam for physicochemical and biological analysis. ResultsThe pH, dissolved oxygen and water temperature showed {{significant differences between the}} photic and <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones</b> (p< 0. 05). The vertical variation of dissolved oxygen and water temperature, showed a profile of stratification. The phytoplankton community was represented by 11 functional groups: S 1, M, H 1, Lo, P, F, SN, J, W 2, MP and R. ConclusionsThe vertical variations were less pronounced than the temporal variations in the phytoplankton community. The Q index pointed out poor water quality, corresponding to the current state of eutrophication in the reservoir and it was sensitive to responsive to environmental and hydrodynamic changes in these systems, demonstrating to be an appropriate tool for monitoring and evaluating the quality of water in tropical semi-arid reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the prokaryotic biomass (from both abundance and cell volume measurements) and microbial community respiration (by ETS activity) in the main water masses of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea were studied. The {{data were collected from}} surface to the bottom depth (max 3600 [*]m) in July and December 2005. Prokaryotic abundance and microbial respiration were higher in summer than late-autumn and decreased with depth in accordance with the water masses. The opposite was found for the prokaryotic cell volumes that increased with depth and were higher in December. The cell carbon content varied within the water masses and study periods (range 9 – 34 [*]fg[*]C[*]cell− 1) and overestimations and underestimations of biomass there would have been by using the routinely adopted conversion factor (20 [*]fg[*]C[*]cell− 1).

25|$|Additionally, it is {{suggested}} that fluorescent tissues that surround an organism’s eyes are used to convert blue light from the photic zone or green bioluminescence in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> into red light to aid vision.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} {{absorption}} of electromagnetic radiation at one wavelength and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength. Thus any type of fluorescence depends {{on the presence of}} external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the photic zone, where there is not only enough light to cause biofluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it. The visual field in the photic zone is naturally blue, so colors of fluorescence can be detected as bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens. Green is the most commonly found color in the biofluorescent spectrum, yellow the second most, orange the third, and red is the rarest. Fluorescence can occur in organisms in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> as a byproduct of that same organism’s bioluminescence. Some biofluorescence in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> is merely a byproduct of the organism’s tissue biochemistry and does not have a functional purpose. However, some cases of functional and adaptive significance of biofluorescence in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> of the deep ocean is an active area of research.|$|E

40|$|Zonations of {{photosynthesis}} and photopigments in artificial cyanobacterial mats {{were studied}} with (i) oxygen and pH microsensors, (ii) fiber-optic microprobes for field radiance, scalar irradiance, and PSII fluorescence, and (iii) a light microscope {{equipped with a}} spectrometer for spectral absorbance and fluorescence measurements. Our analysis revealed the presence of several distinct 1 – 2 mm thick cyanobacterial layers mixed with patches of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Strong attenuation of visible light confined the euphotic zone to the uppermost 3 mm of the mat, where oxygen levels of 3 – 4 times air saturation and a pH peak of up to pH 8. 8 were observed under saturating irradiance (413 µmol photon m− 2 s− 1). Oxygen penetration was 5 mm in light and decreased to 1 mm in darkness. Volumetric oxygen consumption in the photic and <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones</b> of illuminated mat was 5. 5 and 2. 9 times higher, respectively, than oxygen consumption in dark incubated mats. Scalar irradiance reached 100 – 150 % of incident irradiance in the upper 0. 5 mm of the mat due to intense scattering in the matrix of cells, exopolymers, and carbonate precipitates. In deeper mat layers scalar irradiance decreased nearly exponentially, and highest attenuation coeffi-cients of 6 – 7 mm− 1 were found in cyanobacterial layers, where photosynthesis and photopigment fluorescence also peaked.

40|$|We {{examined}} the spatial distributions of picoplankton, nanoplankton, and microplankton biomass and physiological state {{relative to the}} hydrography of the Southern Ocean along 90 ° W longitude and across the Drake Passage in the late austral winter. The eastern South Pacific Ocean showed some large-scale biogeographical differences and size class variability. Microbial ATP biomass was greatest in euphotic surface waters. The horizontal distributions of microbial biomass and physiological state (adenylate energy charge ratio) coincided with internal currents (fronts) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In the Drake Passage, the biological scales in the euphotic and <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones</b> were complex, and ATP, total adenylate, and adenylate energy charge ratio isopleths were compressed due to {{the extension of the}} sea ice from Antarctica and constriction of the Circumpolar Current through the narrow passage. The physiological state of microbial assemblages and biomass were much higher in the Drake Passage than in the eastern South Pacific Ocean. The temperature of Antarctic waters, not dissolved organic carbon, was the major variable controlling picoplankton growth. Estimates of picoplankton production based on ATP increments with time suggest that production under reduced predation pressure was 1 to 10 μg of carbon per liter per day.

25|$|Oceanographers {{divide the}} ocean into {{different}} vertical zones defined by physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone includes all open ocean regions, {{and can be}} divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance. The photic zone includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Because plants require photosynthesis, life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see marine snow) or find another energy source. Hydrothermal vents are the primary source of energy in {{what is known as the}} <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> (depths exceeding 200m). The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagic.|$|E
25|$|Water absorbs {{light of}} long {{wavelengths}}, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back {{to reach the}} eye. Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the photic zone. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense {{as it is on}} the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.|$|E
500|$|The <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> can be {{subdivided}} into three different vertical regions, based on depth and temperature. First is the bathyal zone, extending from {{a depth of}} 1000metres down to 3000metres, with water temperature decreasing from [...] to [...] as depth increases. Next is the abyssal zone, extending from a depth of 3000metres down to 6000metres. The final zone includes the deep oceanic trenches, and {{is known as the}} hadal zone. This, the deepest oceanic zone, extends from a depth of 6000metres down to approximately 11000metres. Abyssal plains are typically in the abyssal zone, at depths from 3000 to 6000metres.|$|E
40|$|The abundance, morphotypes and biomass of the {{bacterial}} assemblages {{were investigated}} in the Ionian Sea by using two different methods: the epifluorescent microscopy technique for enumerating and sizing bacterial cells, and {{the determination of}} bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Five bacterial morphotypes were distinguished: cocci, rods, coccobacilli, vibrios and spirillae. The proportions of cocci were {{higher than those of}} other morphotypes at every depth, ranging from 39 % to 73 %. Both rod-shaped bacteria and coccobacilli were homogenously distributed in the water column, while the proportions of vibrios were rather variable. Spirillae occurred only in surface samples and disappeared below 100 m. The two methodologies were compared: LPS concentrations showed a highly significant correlation with the bacterial numbers (P< 0. 01; n= 88; r= 0. 68), but not with biovolumes, and different ratios between LPS concentrations and bacterial volumes were recorded for the photic and <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones</b> (3. 11 ± 1. 35 and 0. 96 ± 0. 37 ng LPS per µm 3 respectively). LPS-derived cell carbon content on average was 23 fg C cell- 1, similar to the C amount derived by mean cell biovolume (19 fg C cell- 1) and the biomass from two highly correlated methods (P< 0. 01; n= 95; r= 0. 59). Our results confirm that the widely used factor of 20 fg C cell- 1 (Lee and Furhman, 1987) should be plausible for studying the biomass of the natural microbial populations in the study area. Nevertheless, the wide variability of the cell size classes, also along the whole water columns, questions the applicability of a constant conversion factor for all the marine ecosystems. Consequently, locally derived biomass estimates of bacteria are essential in order to obtain an accurate evaluation of the bacterial role in biogeochemical cycles...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} N 2 fixation {{rates from}} oceanic zones that {{have traditionally been}} ignored as sources of biological N 2 fixation; the aphotic, fully oxygenated, nitrate (NO 3 -) -rich, waters of the oligotrophic Levantine Basin (LB) and the Gulf of Aqaba (GA). N 2 fixation rates measured from pelagic aphotic waters to depths up to 720 m, during the mixed and stratified periods, ranged from 0. 01 nmol N L- 1 d- 1 to 0. 38 nmol N L- 1 d- 1. N 2 fixation rates correlated significantly with bacterial productivity and heterotrophic diazotrophs were identified from aphotic as well as photic depths. Dissolved free amino acid amendments to whole water from the GA enhanced bacterial productivity by 2 to 3. 5 and N 2 fixation rates by ~ 2 fold in samples collected from aphotic depths while in amendments to water from photic depths bacterial productivity increased 2 to 6 fold while N 2 fixation rates increased {{by a factor of}} 2 to 4 illustrating that both BP an heterotrophic N 2 fixation are carbon limited. Experimental manipulations of aphotic waters from the LB demonstrated a significant positive correlation between transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) concentration and N 2 fixation rates. This suggests that sinking organic material and high carbon (C) : nitrogen (N) micro-environments (such as TEP-based aggregates or marine snow) could support high heterotrophic N 2 fixation rates in oxygenated surface waters and in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones.</b> Indeed, our calculations show that aphotic N 2 fixation accounted for 37 to 75 % of the total daily integrated N 2 fixation rates at both locations in the Mediterranean and Red Seas with rates equal or greater to those measured from the photic layers. Moreover, our results indicate that that while N 2 fixation may be limited in the surface waters, aphotic, pelagic N 2 fixation may contribute significantly to new N inputs in other oligotrophic basins, yet it is currently not included in regional or global N budgets...|$|R
40|$|Background/Question/Methods: The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is {{a dynamic}} {{ecosystem}} influenced multiple processes that can greatly alter water conditions. This ecosystem {{is affected by the}} gulf loop current dynamics that brings warm nutrient poor water from the Caribbean, freshwater input by the Mississippi river, natural seeps and leaks of hydrocarbons from the ocean floor, and more recently, anthropogenic influences of the Deepwater horizon oil spill and eutrophication due to agriculture along the Mississippi river basin. Microbial communities form the base of complex food webs in the GOM, but we know little about how these communities vary in response to these naturally occurring fluctuations in environmental conditions, as well as in response to anthropogenic disturbances. The current study will investigate spatial and temporal variation in microbial community at different depths across a stratified sampling grid in the northwestern GOM. Seawater samples were collected on biannual cruises at 5 sites in cruise 1 and 11 sites during cruise 2. Seawater samples were collected at 4 depths representing distinct pelagic zones. Next-generation sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq was used to capture the microbiome of from each sample. Analysis of microbial community diversity and composition was conducted to assess spatial, temporal, and depth variation among samples as well as how these patterns are related to broader oceanographic features at the time of collection. Results/Conclusions: This study will help establish an important baseline regarding natural fluctuations in microbial communities across these different environmental influences. Initial results indicate that microbial communities were highly variable among sampling sites for both cruises, but no clear geographic patters emerged. Depth was a major factor influencing diversity and composition of microbial communities. Microbial composition displayed clear depth stratification between photic and <b>aphotic</b> <b>zones.</b> Differences among depths were driven in part by increased abundance of Cyanobacteria in the photic depths, and higher abundance of Crenarcheota in aphotic depths. Samples collected during cruise 1, which occurred in spring months showed higher overall microbial diversity compared to samples from cruise 2 during late summer months. Ongoing analysis is focused on relating these observed patterns of microbial diversity and composition to oceanographic features such as water chemistry, chlorophyll a concentration, temperature, and megafauna abundance and currents during the time of collection. Combining these data will allow for a more complete image of what factors are controlling these essential communities in the GOM...|$|R

5000|$|Crucially, {{this process}} is {{believed}} to only occur {{in the absence of}} light (or as some other function of depth). In the ocean, this leads to a vertical separation of nitrification from primary production, and confines it to the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone.</b> This leads to the situation whereby any nitrate in the water column must be from the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> and must have originated from organic material transported there by sinking. Primary production fuelled by nitrate is, therefore, making use of a [...] "fresh" [...] nutrient source rather than a regenerated one. Production by nitrate is thus referred to as new production.|$|E
50|$|The {{fraction}} of primary production that is exported to the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> is generally higher when primary production occurs in short (seasonal) bursts, {{than when it}} occurs more evenly spread out across a year.|$|E
50|$|Fluorescence {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} {{absorption}} of electromagnetic radiation at one wavelength and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength. Thus any type of fluorescence depends {{on the presence of}} external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the photic zone, where there is not only enough light to cause biofluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it. The visual field in the photic zone is naturally blue, so colors of fluorescence can be detected as bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens. Green is the most commonly found color in the biofluorescent spectrum, yellow the second most, orange the third, and red is the rarest. Fluorescence can occur in organisms in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> as a byproduct of that same organism’s bioluminescence. Some biofluorescence in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> is merely a byproduct of the organism’s tissue biochemistry and does not have a functional purpose. However, some cases of functional and adaptive significance of biofluorescence in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> of the deep ocean is an active area of research.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, it is {{suggested}} that fluorescent tissues that surround an organism’s eyes are used to convert blue light from the photic zone or green bioluminescence in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> into red light to aid vision.|$|E
50|$|For {{information}} on animals {{that live in}} the deeper areas of the oceans see <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone.</b> Generally, these include life forms that tolerate cool temperatures and low oxygen levels, but this depends on the depth of the water.|$|E
50|$|In {{the deep}} ocean, marine snow is a {{continuous}} shower of mostly organic detritus {{falling from the}} upper layers of the water column. It is a significant means of exporting energy from the light-rich photic zone to the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone</b> below. The term was first coined by the explorer William Beebe as he observed it from his bathysphere. As the origin of marine snow lies in activities within the productive photic zone, the prevalence of marine snow changes with seasonal fluctuations in photosynthetic activity and ocean currents. Marine snow {{can be an important}} food source for organisms living in the <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> particularly for organisms which live very deep in the water column.|$|E
50|$|The {{deep sea}} {{starts at the}} <b>aphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> the point where {{sunlight}} loses most of its energy in the water. Many life forms that live at these depths {{have the ability to}} create their own light a unique evolution known as bio-luminescence.|$|E
