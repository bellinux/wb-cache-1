5000|$|Accordingly, {{and despite}} being very {{much out of}} fashion, a {{resurgence}} {{of interest in the}} role of <b>amitosis</b> in mammalian proliferation has been building over the past two to three decades. A review of the resulting literature not only affirms the involvement of <b>amitosis</b> in cell proliferation, it also explores the existence of more than one amitotic mechanism capable of producing [...] "progeny nuclei" [...] without the involvement of [...] "mitotic chromosomes." [...] One form of <b>amitosis</b> involves fissioning, a nucleus splitting in two without the involvement of chromosomes, and has been reported in placental tissue as well as in cells grown from that tissue in rats (Ferguson and Palm, 1976), in human trophoblasts (Cotte et al., 1980), and in mouse trophoblasts (Kuhn, Therman and Susman, 1991). <b>Amitosis</b> by fissioning has also been reported in mammalian liver cells (David and Uerlings, 1992) and human adrenal cells (Magalhaes, Pignatelli, and Magalhaes, 1991). Chen and Wan (1986) not only reported <b>amitosis</b> in rat liver, but also presented a mechanism for a four-stage amitotic process whereby chromatin threads are reproduced and equally distributed to daughter cells as the nucleus splits in two.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Amitosis</b> ( [...] + mitosis) is cell {{proliferation}} {{that does not}} occur by mitosis, the mechanism usually identified as essential for cell division in eukaryotes. The polyploid macronucleus found in Ciliates divides amitotically. While normal mitosis results in a precise division of parental alleles <b>amitosis</b> results in a random distribution of parental alleles. Ploidy levels of >1000 in some species means both parental alleles can be maintained over many generations, while species with fewer numbers of each chromosome will tend to become homozygous for {{one or the other}} parental allele through a process known as phenotypic or allelic assortment.|$|E
50|$|Paramecium reproduces asexually, by binary fission. During reproduction, the macronucleus splits by {{a type of}} <b>amitosis,</b> and the {{micronuclei}} undergo mitosis.

5000|$|There {{are also}} {{multiple}} reports of <b>amitosis</b> occurring when nuclei bud {{out through the}} plasma membrane of a polyploid cell. Such a process {{has been shown to}} occur in amniotic cells transformed by a virus (Walen, 2002) as well as in mouse embryo fibroblast lines exposed to carcinogens (Sundaram et al., 2004). A similar process called extrusion has been described for mink trophoblasts, a tissue in which fissioning is also observed (Isakova and Shilaova, 2002). Asymmetric cell division has also been described in polyploid giant cancer cells and low eukaryotic cells and reported to occur by the amitotic processes of splitting, budding, or burst-like mechanisms (Zhang, Wang, and Zhang; 2012). Similarly, two different kinds of <b>amitosis</b> have been described in monolayers of Ishikawa endometrial cells (Fleming, 2014) ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{does not}} involve maximal {{condensation}} of chromatin into chromosomes, observable by light microscopy as they line up in pairs along the metaphase plate. It {{does not involve}} these paired structures being pulled in opposite directions by a mitotic spindle to form daughter cells. Rather, it effects nuclear proliferation without the involvement of chromosomes, unsettling for cell biologists {{who have come to}} rely on the mitotic figure as reassurance that chromatin is being equally distributed into daughter cells. The phenomenon of <b>amitosis,</b> even though it is an accepted as occurring in ciliates, continues to meet with skepticism about its role in mammalian cell proliferation, perhaps because it lacks the reassuring iconography of mitosis. Of course the relatively recent discovery of copy number variations (CNV's) in mammalian cells within an organ, significantly challenges the age-old assumption that every cell in an organism must inherit an exact copy of the parental genome to be functional. Rather than CNV's resulting from mitosis gone awry, some of this variation may arise from <b>amitosis,</b> and may be both desirable and necessary. Furthermore, it is well to remember that ciliates possess a mechanism for adjusting copy numbers of individual genes during <b>amitosis</b> of the macronucleus.(Prescott, 1994) ...|$|E
50|$|In most ciliates, a macronucleus can divide during asexual {{reproduction}} to form new daughter macronuclei, {{through a process}} called <b>amitosis.</b> However, in karyorelicteans, the macronuclei are unable to divide. Instead, they must be produced by division and differentiation of a micronucleus every time, even during {{asexual reproduction}}.|$|E
50|$|Ciliates {{reproduce}} asexually, {{by various}} kinds of fission. During fission, the micronucleus undergoes mitosis and the macronucleus elongates and undergoes <b>amitosis</b> (except among the Karyorelictean ciliates, whose macronuclei do not divide). The cell then divides in two, and each new cell obtains {{a copy of the}} micronucleus and the macronucleus.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} that is accumulating about <b>amitosis</b> suggests that such processes are, indeed, {{involved in the}} production of the breathtaking 37 trillion or so cells in humans, perhaps particularly during the fetal and embryonic phases of development when the majority of these cells are produced, perhaps within the complexity of implantation, perhaps when large numbers of cells are being differentiated, and perhaps in cancerous cells.|$|E
50|$|Division of the macronucleus occurs by <b>amitosis,</b> and the {{segregation}} of the chromosomes occurs {{by a process}} whose mechanism is unknown. This process is not perfect, and after about 200 generations the cell shows signs of aging. Periodically the macronuclei must be regenerated from the micronuclei. In most, this occurs during conjugation. Here two cells line up, the micronuclei undergo meiosis, some of the haploid daughters are exchanged and then fuse to form new micronuclei and macronuclei.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{of their}} non-dividing somatic macronuclei, the karyorelicteans {{were thought to}} {{represent}} an intermediate evolutionary stage between the hypothetical ancestor of ciliates {{that did not have}} nuclear dualism, and the other more [...] "advanced" [...] ciliates which had both nuclear dualism and macronuclei that could divide by <b>amitosis.</b> The name of the group therefore makes reference to their supposedly [...] "primitive" [...] nuclei. This theory has since been superseded, as molecular phylogenies have shown that the karyorelicteans are not the most [...] "primitive" [...] or basally-branching group of ciliates.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the passage}} {{of more than a}} century since its {{description}} by Walther Flemming (more celebrated for describing mitosis) and others (Child, 1907; Macklin, 1914) the process has not received much attention. Using [...] "mitosis in mammalian cells" [...] as a search term in the Medline data-base calls up more than 10,000 studies dealing with mitosis, whereas [...] "amitosis in mammalian cells" [...] retrieves the titles of fewer than 50 papers. Not surprisingly, this absence of data has led many scientists to conclude that <b>amitosis</b> does not exist, or is minimally important-if any means of proliferation can be deemed [...] "minimally important" [...] while the war on cancer is not yet won.|$|E
5000|$|P. caudatum feed on {{bacteria}} and small eukaryotic cells, such as yeast and flagellate algae. [...] In hypotonic conditions (freshwater), the cell absorbs water by osmosis. It regulates osmotic pressure {{with the help}} of bladder-like contractile vacuoles, gathering internal water through its star-shaped radial canals and expelling the excess through the plasma membrane. [...] When moving through the water, they follow a spiral path while rotating on the long axis. Paramecium have two nuclei (a large macronucleus and a single compact micronucleus). They cannot survive without the macronucleus and cannot reproduce without the micro-nucleus. [...] Like all ciliates, Paramecia reproduce asexually, by binary fission. During reproduction, the macronucleus splits by a type of <b>amitosis,</b> and the micronuclei undergo mitosis. The cell then divides transversally, and each new cell obtains a copy of the micronucleus and the macronucleus.|$|E
5000|$|Additional {{examples}} of non-mitotic proliferation, and important insights into underlying mechanisms, {{have resulted from}} extensive work with polyploid cells. Such cells, long acknowledged to exist, were once believed simply to be anomalous. Accumulating research, including in the liver(Duncan et al. 2010) now suggests that cells containing multiple copies of the genome are importantly involved in a cell's ability to adapt to its environment. A couple of decades of {{research has shown that}} polyploid cells are frequently [...] "reduced" [...] to diploid cells by <b>amitosis</b> (Zybina et al.). For instance, naturally occurring polyploid placental cells have been shown capable of producing nuclei with diploid or near-diploid complements of DNA. Furthermore, Zybina and her colleagues have demonstrated that such nuclei, derived from polyploid placental cells, receive one or two copies of a microscopically identifiable region of the chromatin, demonstrating that even without the reassuring iconography of identical chromosomes being distributed into [...] "identical" [...] daughter cells, this particular amitotic process results in representative transmission of chromatin. Studying rat polyploid trophoblasts, this research group has shown that the nuclear envelope of the giant nucleus is involved in this subdivision of a highly polyploid nucleus into low-ploidy nuclei (Zybina and Zybina). Polyploid cells are also at the heart of experiments to determine how some cells may survive chemotherapy. Erenpreisa and colleagues have shown that following treatment of cultured cells with mitosis-inhibiting chemicals (similar to what is used in some chemotherapy), a small population of induced polyploid cells survives. Eventually this population can give rise to [...] "normal" [...] diploid cells by formation of polyploid chromatin bouquets that return to an interphase state, and separate into several secondary nuclei (Erenpreisa et. al., 2011). Intriguing phenomena including controlled autophagic degradation of some DNA as well as production of nuclear envelope-limited sheets accompanies the process (Erenpreisa et al. 2002). Since neither of these depolyploidizations involves mitotic chromosomes, they conform to the broad definition of <b>amitosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} <b>amitosis</b> {{particularly}} {{suited to the}} formation of multiple differentiated nuclei in a reasonably short period of time has been shown to occur during the differentiation of fluid-enclosing hemispheres called domes from adherent Ishikawa endometrial monolayer cells during an approximately 20-hour period. (Fleming 1995; Fleming, 1999) Aggregates of nuclei from monolayer syncytia become enveloped in mitochondrial membranes, forming structures (mitonucleons) that become elevated as a result of vacuole formation during the initial 6 hours of differentiation (Fleming 1998; Fleming, 2015a). Over the next 4 or 5 hours, chromatin from these aggregated nuclei becomes increasingly pycnotic, eventually undergoing karyolysis and karyorrhexis in the now-elevated predome structures (Fleming, 2015b). In other systems such changes accompany apoptosis but not in the differentiating Ishikawa cells, where the processes appear to accompany changes in DNA essential for the newly created differentiated dome cells. Finally, the chromatin filaments emerging from these processes form a mass from which dozens of dome nuclei are amitotically generated (Fleming, 2015c)over a period of approximately 3 hours with the apparent involvement of nuclear envelope-limited sheets.|$|E

His doctoral thesis, Untersuchungen über das Verhältnis der von Arnold beschriebenen Kernformen zur Mitose und Amitose (Investigations {{into the relationship}} of the nuclear forms described by Arnold to mitosis and <b>amitosis),</b> was an in-depth study of cell division. Upon graduation, Reinke completed a 6-month internship at the Pathology Institute of the University of Zurich. There, he studied under Edwin Klebs. Reinke developed a collegial relationship with Otto Lubarsch, who at that time was an assistant in the Institute. On completion of his internship, Reinke served as a ship's doctor on the passenger liner Weiland bound for Brazil where he visited some members of his family. He returned to Germany in 1893 to complete a second internship as a junior physician in Dahmen, Mecklenburg. Subsequently, Professor Albert von Brunn offered Reinke the position of first demonstrator at the Anatomical Institute of the University of Rostock, perhaps through the intercession of Dr Lubarsch. There he achieved his habilitation, or Venia Legendi, a postdoctoral qualification common to many European academic systems that entitles the holder to supervise doctoral candidates and is thus essential for an academic career. His habilitation thesis, reviewed and defended before committee, was entitled Zellstudien (Cellular Studies), an investigation of the cell structure in the germ layer of the human skin. Specifically, he investigated leukocytes, the cells of the conjunctive tissue, collagenous and elastic fibers, pigment, and cell differentiation.|$|E
40|$|Copy number {{variations}} are {{widespread in}} eukaryotes. The unusual genome architecture of ciliates, in particular, with its process of <b>amitosis</b> in macronuclear division, provides a valuable {{model in which}} to study copy number variation. The current model of <b>amitosis</b> envisions stochastic distribution of macronuclear chromosomes during asexual reproduction. This suggests that <b>amitosis</b> is {{likely to result in}} high levels of copy number variation in ciliates, as dividing daughter cells can have variable copy numbers of chromosomes if chromosomal distribution during <b>amitosis</b> is a stochastic process. We examined chromosomal distribution during <b>amitosis</b> in Chilodonella uncinata, a ciliate with gene-size macronuclear chromosomes. We quantified 4 chromosomes in evolving populations of C. uncinata and modeled the amitotic distribution process. We found that macronuclear chromosomes differ in copy number from one another but that copy number does not change as expected under a stochastic process. The chromosome carrying SSU increased in copy number, which is consistent with selection to increase abundance; however, two other studied chromosomes displayed much lower than expected among-line variance. Our models suggest that balancing selection is sufficient to explain the observed maintenance of chromosome copy during asexual reproduction...|$|E

This amitotic division provides a special opportunity for studying the roles of mitotic proteins in segregating acentric chromatin. The Smc 4 protein is a core component of the condensin complex that plays a role in chromatin condensation and has also been associated with nucleolar segregation, DNA repair, and maintenance of the chromatin scaffold. Mutants of Tetrahymena SMC 4 have remarkable characteristics during <b>amitosis.</b> They do not form microtubules inside the macronucleus as normal cells do, and {{there is little or no}} bulk DNA segregation during cell division.

The division velocity of free nuclei in rice endosperm varied with the internucleus distance. Comparing to a cluster, the division velocity increased when the free nuclei were separated from each other.

Metakaryotic nuclei that were treated during <b>amitosis</b> with RNase A and stained with acridine orange or fluorescent antibody to ssDNA revealed large amounts of ssDNA. Without RNase treatment metakaryotic nuclei in <b>amitosis</b> stained strongly with an antibody complex specific to dsRNA/DNA. Images of amitotic figures co-stained with dsRNA/DNA antibody and DAPI indicated that the entire interphase dsDNA genome (B-form helices) was transformed into two dsRNA/DNA genomes (A-form helices) that were segregated in the daughter cell nuclei then retransformed into dsDNA.

40|$|Microspectrophotometric {{analysis}} of the DNA content of nuclei {{in various parts of}} Chara zeylanica Willd. revealed that the amount of DNA in the nucleus of an internodal cell equals twice the amount of DNA in the nucleus of a sperm, while the half-anaphase stage of the same nodal cells contains the same amount of DNA as the nuclei of the male gametes. The DNA content of the nuclei of internodal cells may rise as much as 50 times higher than that of the gametes. However, in the oldest (most basal) internodal cells, the DNA content of the minute nuclei falls again to the basic (1 C) amount. Measurements of sister nuclei derived by <b>amitosis</b> indicated that both nuclei have equal amounts of DNA; this was interpreted as further evidence that <b>amitosis</b> is not a disorganized process or manifestation of degeneration.

This method provided optically ideal conditions {{for the study of}} muscle fibers with oil immersion, phase contrast time-lapse cinematography at 1 frame per minute without apparent damage for periods as long as 10 days.

Multinuclear muscle fibers have been shown with cine technique to result from both myoblast fusion and polar extension of preformed (explanted) muscle tissue. Myoblast fusion was the only demonstrable way of giving rise to multinucleation. Nuclear membrane "wrinkling" was shown to be merely a temporary distortion that occurred during nuclear migration and rotation. It is suggested that this phenomenon may be responsible for numerous reports of <b>amitosis</b> in the genesis of muscle fibers. The histological development of new straps resulted from an orderly sequence of events. Included in these were polar extension, nuclear migration, rotation, and fixation.

40|$|Cases of "distributive c-mitosis" (the term {{does not}} mean that {{colchicine}} has been used) in plant endosperm are described, in which the chromosomes of metaphase type (two-chromatid chromosomes) are distributed at random because of phragmoplast activity in a process similar to non-disjunction. There is some evidence that chromosmal fibres can be formed within the phragmoplast under special circumstances; during "distributive c-mitosis" some kinetochores show active movements due to cooperation with chromosomal fibres formed in the phragmoplast; while other chromosomes, as indicated by their arrangements and shape, are moved without any activity of kinetochores. Some components of the phragmoplast have the fastest movements occurring in mitosis. Some cases are described in which the phragmoplast divides telophase and interphase nuclei into two or more groups and moves the pieces a considerable distance apart.

40|$|Ciliates contain {{two types}} of nuclei: a {{micronucleus}} and a macronucleus. The micronucleus serves as the germ line nucleus but does not express its genes. The macronucleus provides the nuclear RNA for vegetative growth. Mating cells exchange haploid micronuclei, and a new macronucleus develops from a new diploid micronucleus. The old macronucleus is destroyed. This conversion consists of amplification, elimination, fragmentation, and splicing of DNA sequences on a massive scale. Fragmentation produces subchromosomal molecules in Tetrahymena and Paramecium cells and much smaller, gene-sized molecules in hypotrichous ciliates to which telomere sequences are added. These molecules are then amplified, some to higher copy numbers than others. rDNA is differentially amplified to thousands of copies per macronucleus. Eliminated sequences include transposonlike elements and sequences called internal eliminated sequences that interrupt gene coding regions in the micronuclear genome. Some, perhaps all, of these are excised as circular molecules and destroyed. In at least some hypotrichs, segments of some micronuclear genes are scrambled in a nonfunctional order and are recorded during macronuclear development. Vegetatively growing ciliates appear to possess a mechanism for adjusting copy numbers of individual genes, which corrects gene imbalances resulting from random distribution of DNA molecules during <b>amitosis</b> of the macronucleus. Other distinctive features of ciliate DNA include an altered use of the conventional stop codons...|$|E
30|$|Cyclin domain is a helical domain for protein recognition, which exists {{mostly in}} cyclin {{superfamily}} proteins {{but also in}} transcription factor II B and Retinoblastoma with different copies and forms of distribution (Gibson et al., 1994). Cyclin domain equips cyclin proteins with key function of conditioning the enzyme activity of cyclin-dependent kinases, which participate in the molecular regulation {{of the events of}} cell cycle and transition into the next phases (Zhang et al., 1999).

There is no evidence of fusion of the large mononuclear wandering cells; on the other hand, {{there is some evidence that}} they arise by <b>amitosis</b> of the nuclei without division of the cytoplasm, which increases in bulk. They contain a large central area of more or less granular character which takes up neutral red with great avidity.

40|$|Definite {{hyperplasia}} {{of cells}} {{occurs in the}} skin lesions of the infectious myxoma of rabbits, more visible in such stages in which the intercellular basophilic substance is rather scanty (fig. 2). The increase in number of cells {{is the result of}} simplified forms of mitosis (modified type of mitosis, pseudoamitosis) which might readily be mistaken for <b>amitosis</b> in their final stages. Budding (figs. 20, 28, 29, 30) as well as constriction of the nucleus (figs. 18, 31, 32), and the formation of giant-cells (figs. 33, 34) are not rare. During the entire process the nuclear membrane does not desintegrate as in typical mitosis. Division of the cytoplasm following division of the nucleus has been demonstrated (fig. 17). Typical mitosis is practically absent. The cells which undergo hyperplasia present remarkable changes in their dimension, shape, and structure. The nucleus and cell-body are considerably enlarged (figs. 6, 7, 8). The shape of the nucleus is modified (figs. 8, 10, 15). Hypertrophy of nuclein, either as an intranuclear network (spireme?, figs. 9, 23), or in the form conspicuous, deeply staining masses which appear not to be homogeneous but to be composed of small particles closely clumped ("mulberries"?, figs. 12, 13, 14, 25, 26) occurs in most cells. While some of these pictures are probably related to necrosis of the cells as started by most of the previous workers, it is lekely that some of them may represent developmental stages of the modified mitosis (pseudoamitosis) here reported. In fact, fine cytological details not ordinarily preserved in necrotic cells (figs. 35, 36, 37) may be demonstrated in the socalled myxoma-cells subtted to approved cytological methods of study (fixation in B- 15 and P. F. A. - 3, staining in iron-hematoxylin) ...|$|E
40|$|As {{result of}} finding {{numerous}} plasma {{cells in the}} omenta of rabbits injected with tuberculo-protein, a method to induce the production {{of large numbers of}} these cells has been discovered. The tissues in which they were pronouncedly increased were the subserosal connective tissues of the omentum, body wall, and intestinal wall. The precursor of the plasma cells is a primitive connective tissue cell. As this cell develops into the typical Marshalkó plasma cell there is a progressive increase in the basophilia of the cytoplasm, the nucleus becomes eccentric, a condensation of the chromatin occurs near the nuclear membrane, and there is a loss of the nucleoli. At the time when the nucleus assumes the eccentric position, the clear area appears {{in the center of the}} cytoplasm. The early cells are capable of reproducing themselves by mitosis, while the typical mature cells divide by <b>amitosis.</b> The mature plasma cells often have muddy, spongy cytoplasm which contains acidophilic or hyaline granules as the cells grow old or begin to degenerate. The cells with granules or hyaline bodies usually have pycnotic or fragmented nuclei. These cells are the final stage reached by some plasma cells. Others, when degenerating, show vacuoles and signs of senility. Those with the granules and hyaline bodies are the so called Russell body cells. Plasma cells developed in greatest numbers after our largest injections of tuberculo-protein. The differentiation into young, mature, and senile forms was most clearly recognizable when some days had been allowed to elapse after the last large injection of the stimulating agent. A description of the plasma cell as viewed supravitally has been given. The cells are met in the blood stream as well as in the tissues. They are characterized by their deep yellowish gray cytoplasm, indistinct eccentrically placed nuclei, and large numbers of mitochondria. The plasma cells differ from lymphocytes, in that they did not develop in large numbers after direct stimulation of the lymph nodes with tuberculo-protein. The young plasma cells also differ in morphology from the young lymphocytes. When plasma cells were found in the lymph nodes they were in the connective tissue cords. The plasma cell is a definite entity, having a maturation cycle. It is stimulated to great proliferation by certain toxic irritants...|$|E
