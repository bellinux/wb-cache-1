The paper divides {{environmental}} risk control modes of residential projects into four types: static and non-integrated mode, static <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> mode, dynamic <b>and</b> non-integrated mode, <b>and</b> dynamic <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> mode. The paper elicits that the dynamic <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> {{environmental risk}} control mode for residential projects {{is better than}} other three kinds of modes by comparing four kinds of dissimilarity modes of environmental risk control system. The Dynamic <b>and</b> <b>Integrated</b> Environmental Risk Control System(DIERCS) for residential projects is established. The establishment of Dynamic <b>and</b> <b>Integrated</b> Environmental Risk Control System(DIERCS) for residential projects is based on dynamic <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> environmental risk control mode; therefore, it is necessity {{to carry on a}} study to the dynamic <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> environmental risk control mode of residential projects first from the theory.

Ported versions generally feature different graphics and additional gameplay options—for example, moving defense bunkers, zigzag shots, invisible aliens, and two-player cooperative gameplay. Ports on earlier systems like the Atari home consoles featured simplified graphics, while later systems such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and PlayStation featured updated graphics. Later titles include several modes of gameplay <b>and</b> <b>integrate</b> new elements into the original design. For example, Space Invaders Extreme, released on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, integrated musical elements into the standard gameplay. A spin-off for WiiWare, Space Invaders Get Even, allows players to control the aliens instead of the laser cannon.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{was part of}} a plan drawn up by the JNA aimed at securing the Dubrovnik area and then proceeding north-west to link up with the JNA troops in northern Dalmatia via western Herzegovina. The offensive was accompanied by a significant amount of war propaganda. In 2000, Montenegrin President Milo Đukanović apologized for the siege, eliciting an angry response from his political opponents and from Serbia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted two Yugoslav officers for their involvement in the siege and handed a third over to Serbia for prosecution. The ICTY indictment stated that the offensive was designed to detach the Dubrovnik region from Croatia <b>and</b> <b>integrate</b> it into a Serb-dominated state through an unsuccessful proclamation of the Dubrovnik Republic on 24 November 1991. In addition, Montenegro convicted four former JNA soldiers with prisoner abuse at the Morinj camp. Croatia also charged several former JNA or Yugoslav Navy officers and a former Bosnian Serb leader with war crimes but no trials have yet resulted from these indictments.|$|E

The avionics were said to include radar, Inertial navigation system, Head-up display, and Multi-function displays. Competing bids came from Thomson-CSF with a variant of the Radar Doppler Multitarget (RDY), SAGEM with a similar avionics package to those used in the ROSE upgrade project, and Marconi Electronic Systems with its Blue Hawk radar. FIAR's (now SELEX Galileo) Grifo S7 radar was expected to be selected due to the company's ties with the PAF. In February 1998, Pakistan and China signed a letter of intent covering airframe development. Russia's Klimov offered a variant of the RD-33 turbofan engine to power the fighter. In April 1999, South Africa's Denel offered to arm the Super 7 with the T-darter beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile (AAM), rather than the previously reported R-Darter. Previously in 1987, Pratt & Whitney offered the Super-7 project three engine options; PW1212, F404, and PW1216, with local manufacturing in either China or Pakistan. Rolls Royce offered its RB199-127/128 turbofan engine; this plan was scrapped in 1989.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 A large {{literature}} {{has emerged in}} the last 10 years using high-frequency (intraday) asset returns to estimate lower-frequency phenomena, several of which being conditional daily return variance and its components jump variation <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> variance. We propose several new estimators of jump variation <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> variance. We base the first set on the jump detection work of Lee and Mykland (2008). Simply, these estimate jump variation by summing the hard-thresholded or naively shrunk squared returns (<b>and</b> estimate <b>integrated</b> variance as the residual of realized variance). In the second set, we appeal to Johnstone and Silverman (2004, 2005) for their discrete Bayesian model of a sparse signal plus noise and argue for its use {{as a model of}} high-frequency asset returns with jumps. Within this model, we derive optimal estimators of jump variation <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> variance. In a simulation analysis, we find outperformance of our estimators against the established. In an empirical analysis we find dramatically different estimates of jump variation <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> variance based on the estimation scheme, suggesting careful attention must be paid to the method of decomposing conditional daily return variance into jump variation <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> variance...|$|R

5|$|The 2005 final was Vieira's last match as an Arsenal player; {{he joined}} Juventus in the close season for a {{combined}} total fee of €20million. Wenger's decision {{to sell his}} captain was made so the team could benefit from Fàbregas, who broke into the first eleven during the season. In later years, Wenger deviated from his usual counter-attacking style, and imposed a fluent system, with less emphasis on physicality. The immediate seasons after Arsenal relocated to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 saw Wenger sell several experienced players, <b>and</b> <b>integrate</b> more young talent, {{as a means of}} fostering an identity with the club. Financing for the stadium however meant Arsenal prioritised its expenditure instead of the squad and trophies. Though Wenger managed to solidify the club’s position in the Premier League's top four and secure the necessary funds to pay back its debtors, the 2005 Cup win represented Arsenal's last silverware for nine years. In 2014, he led Arsenal to a record-equalling 11th FA Cup, and became the record equalling most successful manager in the competition's history a year later, as his side beat Aston Villa.|$|E
5|$|Whether the PAVN 2nd Division {{had been}} {{rendered}} ineffective or not was uncertain, as U.S. military intelligence {{did not know}} the whereabouts of the enemy unit or their intentions. Since January 1968, the North Vietnamese had been fighting continuously with U.S. and other allied military forces in I Corps, so their resupply capabilities were overstretched, and their soldiers were not given the opportunity to rest before the Tet Offensive. Thus, following the failed attack on Đà Nẵng, North Vietnamese General Chu Huy Mân, Commander of Military Region 5, made the decision to pull the 2nd Division into the mountains where they could rest, resupply, <b>and</b> <b>integrate</b> their replacement manpower before going on the offensive again. Mân ordered Cương to split the 2nd Division into two fighting arms; one regiment would tie down the Americans in the Que Son Valley, {{while the rest of the}} division would withdraw to their base areas near Laos, to link up with the 70th Transport Regiment. Then, their next target would be Khâm Đức and the surrounding areas; Mân told his senior officers that they would attack Khâm Đức to force an American retreat.|$|E
