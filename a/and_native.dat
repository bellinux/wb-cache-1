30|$|In general, we find {{substitution}} elasticities between migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> above ten, that is, {{in a range}} typically {{considered to}} indicate perfect substitution but not {{too far away from}} imperfect substitution. Our estimations highlight the importance of differentiation by task and qualification and of properly accounting for their heterogeneity. Qualification is crucial, indeed, if we consider different task groups: migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> with low formal qualification show higher substitutability than migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> with medium or high formal qualification. With regard to migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> with medium qualification, we find that they are better substitutes in manual tasks and relatively worse substitutes in interactive tasks. Surprisingly, in interactive tasks highly qualified migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> are good substitutes.|$|R

30|$|When {{we look at}} {{labour demand}} {{aggregated}} over all formal qualification groups (but disaggregated by year, task and experience), we estimate an overall inverse elasticity of substitution between migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> of 0.0622, which corresponds to an elasticity of roughly 16. The task-specific elasticities of substitution {{are in the range}} between 9.6 and 14.4. These estimates are close to the threshold between perfect and imperfect substitutes which frequently in the literature is assumed to be at a value of 10 (though sometimes higher values are still considered as imperfect substitutes). We find that migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> are better substitutable in manual routine tasks and somewhat worse substitutable when carrying out interactive tasks. However, when we consider only aggregates over all qualification levels, {{it is not clear whether}} the elasticities really reflect the substitutability between migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives.</b> These estimates may be affected to some extent by the different assignment of migrants <b>and</b> <b>natives</b> to qualification groups.|$|R
