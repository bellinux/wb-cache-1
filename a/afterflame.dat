40|$|A {{method is}} described, {{that allows a}} quick and simple testing of the burning {{behaviour}} of plastics. It takes into account ignition {{time as well as}} <b>afterflame</b> time; properties that are characteristic for the burning behaviour of a particular plas-tic material. The procedure is easy to perform, it does neither require injection-moulded samples nor expensive equip-ment. The method provides a classification of the burning behaviour. It is especially suitable for a screening of plastic materials complementing established methods like UL- 94, GWFI and LOI, and may find application in the development of flame retardants...|$|E
30|$|The ASTM and UFAC {{tests are}} {{commonly}} used {{in the development and}} quality control assessment of barrier materials. For non-woven, highloft battings, quality control measures generally include the measurement of weight, thickness, uniformity, and a burn test (draft proposed TB 117 (10)). These tests are qualitative, with specific guidelines for assessing fire performance of the barrier materials. Since fire barrier materials are generally expected to be self-extinguishing, other test methods for such materials include measurements of the time of <b>afterflame</b> and afterglow and the extent of fire damage in terms of char length, hole size or weakened sample length.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Industrial {{textiles}} {{is designed}} with engineering structure textiles. Transportation textiles {{is one of}} the main types of industrial textiles. Automobile seat fabric {{is one of the}} decorative materials in automobile textile fabrics. The fabric should have soft handle, good air permeability, coordinate color, luxury and generous pattern, wear-resisting, anti-fouling, flame retardant, certain friction factor and antistatic property. In recent years, requirements for automobile textiles of safety, health, environmental protection is more and more high. In order to evaluate the automobile seat woven fabric quality, need to have a simple and effective standard. Quality indexes should be comprehensive. The test method of quality index should be operable. In the existing relevant standards, the test content is not consistent. The existing relevant standards are national standards, textile industry standards and automotive industry standards. Within textile industry standard FZ/T 24005 - 2010 wool textiles for chair, the technical requirements include safety specification, classification rules, physical quality rating, internal quality rating, appearance quality rating. For flame retardant performance, must meet the following requirements: damaged length ≤ 200 mm, <b>afterflame</b> time ≤ 15 s. Within national standard GB 8410 - 2006, flammability of automotive interior materials, for flame retardant performance, must meet the following requirements: burning rate ≤ 100 mm/min. Within automotive industry standard QC/T 633 - 2009 the seats of passenger vehicles, for safety specification, seat fabric must meet the B grade in GB 18401. Based on some effective standard, established suitable standard for automobile seat woven fabric. The standard covers quality evaluation content, performance levels and the methods of test to be used to determine these performance levels...|$|E
