Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|E
2500|$|Now <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the living}} creatures, I saw a wheel {{on the earth}} beside the living creatures, {{one for each of}} the four of them. As for the {{appearance}} of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. Book of Ezekiel Chapter 1:15-18, Bible, English Standard Version ...|$|E
2500|$|British occultist Aleister Crowley {{reported}} witnessing what {{he referred}} to as [...] "globular electricity" [...] during a thunderstorm on Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire in 1916. [...] He was sheltered in a small cottage when he [...] "noticed, with what I can only describe as calm amazement, that a dazzling globe of electric fire, apparently between six and twelve inches (15–30cm) in diameter, was stationary about six inches below {{and to the right}} of my right knee. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight shock {{in the middle of my}} right hand, which was closer to the globe than any other part of my body." ...|$|E

2500|$|Callery did {{not begin}} {{composing}} the series' main theme until after reading two or three scripts, and {{did not see the}} opening graphics until after the second episode, at which point he had [...] "a framework for a theme that [...] hoped would work". At this time, Callery said he started [...] "fooling around" [...] with ideas for the theme, and eventually settled on one that he felt had a [...] "sneaky and fun" [...] quality, adding, Jessica Jones [...] "has dry humor, a real edge to her. But there was something to this character that had a little whisker of playfulness in there, like a cat or something." [...] After creating the theme, Callery expanded it, adding a [...] "fun" [...] rhythmic quality, and eventually fully orchestrating it to include a piano, which he played himself, as well as instruments such as the acoustic bass, and additional sound design. Regarding the electric guitar's entrance, Callery pointed out that it got [...] "bigger there because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the graphics, the lights got a little more strobe-y. So that's when I decided the electric guitar might be a kind of neat add there so that the whole piece will arc a little more." ...|$|E

I thought of Lady... <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the {{chronometers}} and instruments, and of you all <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the beautiful vessel slipping along through the water with scarce a stitch of canvas. I pray that she may be spared many years to the Mission, and that we may have grace to use her, as she ought to be used, to His glory.|$|E

"Aye, {{that may}} be," [...] Hiram replied reflectively; [...] "but you see yonder sleepy heads {{declared}} they would turn in because another night had surely come, and I {{was trying to}} persuade them they would be spending the day in slumber, which <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the matter is wrong, even though we may not venture out." ...|$|R
60|$|Copeland! Stop a moment. Was it {{yesterday}} I visited Copeland's works, and saw them making plates?

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film three stars, commenting: [...] "Cape Fear is {{impressive}} moviemaking, showing Scorsese {{as a master}} of a traditional Hollywood genre {{who is able to}} mold it to his own themes and obsessions.

60|$|I {{could feel}} that Beverly-Jones grew {{depressed}} as {{he showed me}} round. I was sorry for him, but unable to help. I realized that there were certain sections of my education that had been neglected. How to be shown things and make appropriate comments {{seems to be an}} art in itself. I don't possess it.

6000|$|... "There is {{a coffee}} service of china in the salon," [...] said M. Paul, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the six {{green and white}} dinner-plates; the four dishes, the cups and jugs to match.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; and that, no doubt, is his {{argument}} {{when he sees}} me. He is delighted to have me down at Tretton, and, to tell the truth, I do not feel the slightest animosity toward him.

60|$|I {{always had}} been, I still am, a passionate student of social problems. The world of to-day with its roaring machinery, the unceasing toil of its working classes, its strife, its poverty, its war, its cruelty, appals me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. <b>I</b> love {{to think of}} the time that must come some day when man will have conquered nature, and the toil-worn human race enter upon an era of peace.|$|R
60|$|Am I finding {{fault with}} you {{and the rest of}} the populace? No--I assure you I am not. For I know the human race's limitations, and this makes it my duty--my {{pleasant}} duty--to be fair to it. Each person in it is honest in one or several ways, but no member of it is honest in all the ways required by--by what? By his own standard. Outside of that, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, there is no obligation upon him.|$|R

60|$|He {{handed me}} the open book. I started <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the picture. In this reconstructed animal of a dead world there was {{certainly}} a very great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist.|$|E
60|$|I felt my face fire up <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Joe. I hope one {{remote cause}} of its firing {{may have been}} my {{consciousness}} that if I had known his errand, I should have given him more encouragement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wasn't it admirable," [...] cried Marlow {{interrupting}} his narrative. [...] "Admirable!" [...] And <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> dubiously <b>at</b> {{this unexpected}} enthusiasm he started justifying it after his own manner.|$|R
6000|$|Sol {{joined in}} the laugh until his wife plucked his sleeve, and whispered {{something}} in his ear. In an instant his face became at once mysterious and demure. [...] "I owe you an apology," [...] he said, turning to Rand, but in a voice ostentatiously pitched high enough for Miss Euphemia to overhear: [...] "I see I have made a mistake. A resemblance--only a mere resemblance, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you now--led me astray. Of course you don't know any young lady in the profession?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{added the}} sleeper quietly, [...] "her {{favorite}} color, as you know. She fades and fades <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her," [...] he went on. [...] "She is gone. I only see you, {{under a new}} aspect. You have a pistol in your hand. Opposite to you, there stands the figure of another man. He, too, has a pistol in his hand. Are you enemies? Are you meeting to fight a duel? Is the lady the cause? I try, but I fail to see her." ...|$|R
