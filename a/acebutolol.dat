50|$|<b>Acebutolol</b> is well absorbed {{from the}} GI tract, but {{undergoes}} substantial first-pass-metabolization, {{leading to a}} bioavailability of only 35% to 50%. Peak plasma levels of <b>acebutolol</b> are reached within 2 to 2.5 hours after oral dosing. Peak levels of the main active metabolite, diacetolol, are reached after 4 hours. <b>Acebutolol</b> has a half-life of 3 to 4 hours, and diacetolol a half-life of 8 to 13 hours.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acebutolol</b> {{undergoes}} extensive hepatic metabolization {{resulting in}} the desbutyl amine acetolol which is readily converted into diacetolol. Diacetolol is as active as <b>acebutolol</b> (equipotency) and appears {{to have the same}} pharmacologic profile. Geriatric patients tend to have higher peak plasma levels of both <b>acebutolol</b> and diacetolol and a slightly prolonged excretion. Excretion is substantially prolonged in patients with renal impairment, and so a dose reduction may be needed. Liver cirrhosis does not seem to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the parent drug and metabolite.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acebutolol</b> (trade names Sectral, Prent) is a {{beta blocker}} for the {{treatment}} of hypertension and arrhythmias.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acebutolol</b> {{may not be}} {{suitable}} in patients with Asthma bronchiale or COPD due to its bronchoconstricting (β2 antagonistic) effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) {{has been found}} in 10 to 30% of patients under treatment with <b>acebutolol.</b> A systemic disease with arthralgic pain and myalgias has been observed in 1%. A lupus erythematosus-like syndrome with skin rash and multiforme organ involvement is even less frequent. The incidence of both ANA and symptomatic disease under <b>acebutolol</b> is higher than under Propranolol. Female patients are more likely to develop these symptoms than male patients. Some few cases of hepatotoxicity with increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST) have been seen. Altogether, 5 to 6% of all patients treated have to discontinue <b>acebutolol</b> due to intolerable side effects. When possible, the treatment should be discontinued gradually in order to avoid a withdrawal syndrome with increased frequency of angina and even precipitation of myocardial infarction.|$|E
50|$|The drug has {{lipophilic}} properties, {{and therefore}} crosses the blood-brain barrier. <b>Acebutolol</b> has no {{negative impact on}} serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides). No HDL decrease has been observed. In this regard, it is unlike many other beta blockers which have this unfavourable property.|$|E
50|$|The drug {{works in}} {{hypertensive}} patients with high, normal, or low renin plasma concentrations, although <b>acebutolol</b> {{may be more}} efficient in patients with high or normal renin plasma concentrations. In clinically relevant concentrations, a membrane-stabilizing effect {{does not appear to}} play an important role.|$|E
50|$|Some beta {{blockers}} (e.g. oxprenolol, pindolol, penbutolol, labetalol and <b>acebutolol)</b> exhibit intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). These agents {{are capable of}} exerting low-level agonist activity at the β-adrenergic receptor while simultaneously acting as a receptor site antagonist. These agents, therefore, {{may be useful in}} individuals exhibiting excessive bradycardia with sustained beta blocker therapy.|$|E
50|$|Medication {{is often}} used to address some symptoms. Melatonin {{supplements}} and trazodone are commonly used to regulate sleep disturbances. In combination with exogenous melatonin, blockade of endogenous melatonin production during the day by the adrenergic antagonist <b>acebutolol</b> can increase concentration, improve sleep and sleep timing and aid in improvement of behaviour. Other medications (such as risperdal) are sometimes used to regulate violent behavior.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acebutolol</b> is a {{cardioselective}} {{beta blocker}} with ISA (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; see article on pindolol). It is therefore more suitable than non cardioselective beta blockers, {{if a patient}} with asthma or {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) needs treatment with a beta blocker. (For these reasons, it may be a beta-blocker of choice in inclusion in Polypill strategies). In doses lower than 800mg daily its constricting effects on the bronchial system and smooth muscle vessels are only 10% to 30% of those observed under propranolol treatment, but there is experimental evidence that the cardioselective properties diminish at doses of 800mg/day or more.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{characterize}} transport of <b>acebutolol</b> through the corneal epithelium. Cultured normal rabbit corneal epithelial cells (RCEC) were used to investigate the drug transport. Primary RCEC were seeded on a filter membrane of Transwell-COL? insert coated with fibronectin and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F- 12 with various supplements. Measurements of <b>acebutolol</b> permeability through RCEC layer were carried out to assess transcellular permeability coefficient (Ptranscell) in the absence or presence of inhibitors. Paracellular permeability coefficient (Pparacell) was calculated by permeability coefficient of hydrophilic drugs (Pcell). The transcellular permeability of <b>acebutolol</b> from apical side to basal side (A-to-B) showed concentration-dependency. The <b>acebutolol</b> flux in the A-to-B direction was smaller than that of opposite direction. Sodium azide, verapamil, and cyclosporin A enhanced the transcellular permeability of <b>acebutolol</b> in the A-to-B direction. <b>Acebutolol</b> permeability through an excised rabbit cornea was also increased by verapamil. Thus, it was suggested that <b>acebutolol</b> was actively secreted via P-glycoprotein in a corneal epithelium...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acebutolol</b> (Sectral) {{was used}} {{successfully}} {{in a clinical}} trial involving thirty-two hypertensive patients. Twenty-three patients received <b>acebutolol</b> at a dosage of 400 - 800 mg daily as sole treatment and nine patients receivedcon-current treatment with thiazide diuretics. In both groups of patients there was a substantial fall in diastolic and systolic pressure to levels within the normotensive range. The combination of <b>acebutolol</b> with thiazide diuretics was a particularly effective form of anti-hypertensive treatment where a greater anti-hypertensive effect was required. <b>Acebutolol</b> did not significantly slow the heart rate.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{efficacy of}} nitrendipine and <b>acebutolol</b> was assessed during a 40 -week double-blind randomized trial in 60 hypertensive blacks. Nitrendipine (mean dose 32 mg/day) and <b>acebutolol</b> (414 mg/day) were administered in monotherapy in increasing dosage and mefruside was added in patients not controlled by monotherapy. The recumbent and standing blood pressures were reduced (P less than 0. 01 or less) during monotherapy with nitrendipine and <b>acebutolol,</b> but {{the magnitude of}} blood pressure reduction was greater (P less than 0. 05 or less) during nitrendipine dosing. Pulse rate decreased (P less than 0. 01) during <b>acebutolol</b> whereas nitrendipine induced a nonsignificant increase. Both treatments induced no changes in serum electrolytes, creatinine, urea, uric acid, lipids, plasma renin activity, and plasma and urinary aldosterone. The overall incidence of side effects was similar with both treatments but four patients discontinued nitrendipine because of headache. The addition of mefruside to nitrendipine or <b>acebutolol</b> produced a further fall of blood pressure in patients not controlled with monotherapy. Monotherapy with nitrendipine or <b>acebutolol</b> offers an effective, safe first-line antihypertensive treatment in blacks entered in this study; with the described dosages and therapeutic schedule, nitrendipine was somewhat more effective than <b>acebutolol.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Whole body {{hyperthermia}} against {{malignant neoplasms}} has a limited temperature {{because of the}} clinical critical thermal maximum. This study was carried out to determine whether <b>acebutolol</b> or diltiazem could raise a critical temperature of dogs, Twentyfour male mongrel dogs were anesthetized with a large dose of morphine (2 mg/kg), and randomly divided into 3 groups. Control (group C : n = 8) received only whole body hyperthermia (WBH). Group A (n = 8) received WBH and <b>acebutolol,</b> and Group D (n = 8) received WBH and diltiazem. The heart rate in control dogs increased by 53 % at 43 ﾂｰC from base line, whereas it increased by only 7 % and 9 % {{in the presence of}} <b>acebutolol</b> and diltiazem, respectively. Similarly, both <b>acebutolol</b> and diltiazem significantly improved the myocardial oxygen extraction ratio and myocardial lactate extraction ratio so well as endocardial electrocardiogram ST segment elevation. Consequently, cardiac output and LVdp/dt max at 43 ﾂｰC were significantly improved by both <b>acebutolol</b> and diltiazem. Seventy-five percent and 87. 5 % of dogs administered <b>acebutolol</b> and diltiazem survived respectively, whereas none of control dogs survived at 44 ﾂｰC. In conclusion, <b>acebutolol</b> or diltiazem improves the myocardial oxygen demand-supply balance during hyperthermia.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} <b>acebutolol,</b> a cardioselective #-adrenergic blocking agent, on the anginal pattern and exercise tolerance in 44 patients with chronic stable angina. There were 43 males and one female, {{with a mean age}} of 57 years (range 48 - 73 years). The study consisted of an initial 4 -week, single-blind placebo control phase, followed by a 3 -week, single-blind dose-titration phase using increasing doses of <b>acebutolol</b> and by two 5 -week double-blind phases that in-cluded randomization to <b>acebutolol</b> or placebo and crossover. A 1 -week withdrawal schedule followed each treatment phase. All patients kept a diary of anginal frequency and nitroglycerin consumption. Capsule counts of returned medication were made at each visit. Exercise treadmill tests were performed at entry into the study and on the final day of each of the four phases. <b>Acebutolol</b> produced a significant decrease in the frequency of angina attacks, consumption of nitroglycerin and exercise capacity. Resting and peak exercise values were significantly reduced. Heart rates were reduced by 16 % and 18 %, respectively (p < 0. 002) and rate-pressure products by 17 % and 30 %, respectively (p < 0. 002). At effective antianginal dosages, <b>acebutolol</b> had no significant adverse effects on pulmonary func-tions. No clinical side effects of <b>acebutolol</b> necessitated drug discontinuance. <b>Acebutolol</b> is a well-tolerated #-blocking drug that significantly reduces spontaneous anginal frequency...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acebutolol</b> and {{propranolol}} {{were compared}} in forty-five Black African {{patients in a}} double-blind randomized trial carried out at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria. After a wash-out period of 6 weeks, including placebo administration for the last 4 of those weeks, twenty-seven patients were given <b>acebutolol</b> once daily and eighteen were given propranolol twice daily for 12 weeks,followed by a tapering-offperiod of 2 weeks, making a total of 14 weeks on active treatment. The two beta-receptor blocking drugs were effective in controlling hypertension with final daily doses ranging from 160 to 320 mg in the propranolol group and 400 to 800 mg in the <b>acebutolol</b> group. The supine systolic blood pressure responses with <b>acebutolol</b> were statistically significant and better than those elicited by propranolol. <b>Acebutolol</b> produced less (resting) bradycardia than did propranolol; this {{may be related to}} acebutolol's intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The only unpleasant side-effects reported in this study were slight dizziness in two patients treated with propranolol and slight tiredness in one patient treated with <b>acebutolol.</b> No significant abnormal changes were noted in laboratory tests or chest Xsrays. Electrocardiography detected supraventricular tachyarrythmia in five patients: this disappeared {{by the end of the}} study. <b>Acebutolol</b> was shown to be a safe, effective and reliable antihypertensive drug, at least comparable to and probably slightly better than, propranolol in the treatment oj hypertension in Black Nigerians.

40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of {{intravenously}} administered <b>acebutolol</b> (1 - 20 mg every 4 hours for 24 hours) on cardiac rhythm and performance, we studied 72 patients with evolving myocardial infarction. Twenty-five patients were treated with <b>acebutolol</b> beginning 6 hours after the first {{increase in the level}} of plasma creatine kinase. Enzymatically estimated infarct size was compared with that of 25 controls matched for predicted infarct size. Observed infarct sizes were not significantly different in the 2 groups (37 +/- 5 and 30 +/- 5 CK-gram equivalents, respectively). Mean heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, and cardiac output declined from control values during treatment with <b>acebutolol,</b> but remained within the normal range. Mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusive pressure were unchanged. In a group of 22 treated patients matched with 22 control subjects for frequency of ventricular extrasystoles, <b>acebutolol</b> effected a prompt reduction in frequencies of ventricular extrasystoles and repetitive arrhythmias, whereas values were not significantly changed in controls during the corresponding intervals. Accordingly, <b>acebutolol</b> may be a useful antiarrhythmic agent in selected patients with acute myocardial infarction with adversely altering haemodynamic stability or enzymatically estimated infarct size...|$|E
40|$|Twenty eight {{patients}} were randomly allocated into treatment or placebo groups.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of <b>acebutolol</b> in suppressing ventricular ectopy was evaluated in 60 males (average age 59 years) using 24 -hour Holter recordings and a double-blind, randomized, crossover protocol. <b>Acebutolol,</b> 200 mg and 400 mg thrice daily, was compared with placebo. Only patients who had a mean of at least 30 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) per hour on three 24 -hour control Holter record-ings were included. Analysis of Holter recordings revealed greater than 70 % reduction in VPCs/hour from control levels during <b>acebutolol</b> therapy in over 50 % of the 60 patients; dose-related reduction in {{the mean number of}} single and paired VPCs and ventricular tachycardia episodes (p < 0. 05) by acebutolol; and signifi-cant, asymptomatic reduction in resting heart rate and blood pressure. All side effects were transient. Acebut-olol was discontinued because of side effects in one patient only.

40|$|A three-month open, {{multicentre}} trial {{was carried out}} in 2132 hypertensive patients under uncontrolled conditions in general practice, to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of <b>acebutolol</b> when given orally as a single morning dose, in the range of 200 to 1200 mg/day. Concomitant antihyper-tensive therapy was given to 702 patients. Forty-five patients, out of 1893 who were eligible for analysis, showed inadequate blood pressure control and were withdrawn from the study. There were 602 reports of side-effects or adverse reactions attributed to <b>acebutolol</b> in 584 patients, necessitating 120 withdrawals from the trial.

40|$|Metoprolol and <b>acebutolol,</b> two {{supposedly}} cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, {{were tested}} in 11 healthy men against propranolol, a non-selective drug, for their effect on plasma free fatty acid concentrations before and after insulin. The fasting concentrations of free fatty acid were significantly reduced after <b>acebutolol</b> and propranolol, and their return to normal after insulin was delayed. Metoprolol had no significant effect on free fatty acid levels either before or after insulin. Although both selective and non-selective beta-blocking drugs {{should be expected to}} delay the return of free fatty acid values to normal after insulin, in contrast to propranolol and <b>acebutolol,</b> metoprolol had no such effect.

Fluorescence techniques were used to study the partition coefficient of β-blockers, the influence of drugs on membrane fluidity and the drugs–membrane binding. Moreover, small and wide angle X-ray scattering techniques were {{used to evaluate the}} β-blockers effect on long range bilayer order and hydrocarbon chain packing. The gathered results highlighted the importance of electrostatic interactions between propranolol and <b>acebutolol</b> with membranes. Furthermore, both β-blockers exhibited a membrane-fluidizing effect and the capacity to disturb the membrane organization. In general, propranolol unveiled a more pronounced effect on membrane fluidity and structure than <b>acebutolol.</b> In the current study, the obtained results were also correlated with the cardioprotective properties of the β-blockers studied...|$|E
