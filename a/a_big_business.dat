25|$|English {{teaching}} is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>business</b> in Taiwan, with Taiwan, {{as part of}} its project to reinvigorate the Taiwan Miracle, aiming to become a trilingual country—fluent in Mandarin, Taiwanese, and English. Many teachers come from English-speaking countries, such as the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, and enjoy salaries of about $30,000–$50,000 per year at a low cost of living, with opportunities to manage or open one's own school and make several times that amount a year.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{development}} of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter {{for use in the}} summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>business,</b> cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.|$|E

25|$|Austin offered Parker the {{opportunity}} to move to Nashville, Tennessee, where music was becoming <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>business,</b> but for reasons unknown Parker turned him down. Instead, Parker decided to stay in Temple Terrace, Florida, with his family, perhaps {{to avoid having to}} fill in paperwork that could expose his illegal status. Within a year, he had {{the opportunity}} to become a legal citizen of the United States – a new law allowed illegal aliens the chance to become citizens in return for their promise to fight for the country during World War II, if required. He served in the peacetime army as a precondition for taking advantage of that, but he never subsequently applied to become a citizen. Parker decided against registering, possibly to prevent his previous Army record from becoming public.|$|E
25|$|Being {{the former}} capital {{and now the}} partial capital {{of the state and}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>business</b> hub, many central and state {{government}} and corporate offices are in Cuttack. The service sector is quite large. The people of nearby districts are heavily depended on the city for their livelihood, contributing to the service sector and, thus, the floating population. The presence of Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), the largest rice research institute in Asia, adds to the importance of Cuttack in the agricultural map of the country. The presence of Odisha High Court and the SCB Medical & College, the largest medical institution in the state, further nourishes the service sector. Education is a major industry due to large number of universities, colleges, schools and coaching centres and caters to the neighbouring districts.|$|E
25|$|Every time a great fire struck, the {{material}} and monetary expenses necessitated for resurrecting a devastated Edo were tremendous. Hence, {{the influence of a}} great fire on consumer prices as well as economic prospects could ripple from Edo and affect the entire Japan. The frequent occurrence of great fires can therefore be said as a major driving factor that supported the economic growth of Edo. On the contrary, the reconstruction cost also became an enormous burden for the shogunate and contributed to its troubled financial conditions. Also suffering from the economic pressure were the chōnin. It is not unimaginable that a merchant running <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>business</b> could be reduced to living in a nagaya after a great fire. When it came to the shogunate's budget, among expenditures allocated to the chōnin, those related to fire prevention and firefighting also accounted for the largest proportions.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{popularity}} of pet keeping in the modern sense rose during the Victorian era, animals became a fixture within urban culture as commodities and decorative objects. [...] Pet keeping generated a commercial opportunity for entrepreneurs. [...] By the mid-nineteenth century, nearly twenty thousand street vendors in London dealt with live animals. [...] Also, {{the popularity}} of animals developed a demand for animal goods such as accessories and guides for pet keeping.

2500|$|In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import {{and export}} of alcohol were {{prohibited}} by the Eighteenth Amendment, Prohibition. The {{result was that}} in cities illegal alcohol became <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>business,</b> largely controlled by racketeers. The second Ku Klux Klan grew rapidly in 1922–25, then collapsed. Immigration laws were passed to strictly {{limit the number of}} new entries. The 1920s were called [...] the Roaring Twenties due to the great economic prosperity during this period. Jazz became popular among the younger generation, and thus the decade was also called the Jazz Age.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Yates' two-part drama Sex Traffic was {{broadcast}} on Channel 4. It won eight BAFTA Awards including Best Editing for Mark Day, who regularly worked with Yates {{on many of}} his television projects and short films. Day commented on his collaboration with Yates saying that [...] "we are very good friends because we have {{spent so much time}} together." [...] He also said, [...] "David shoots in a similar style from piece to piece, although this wasn’t quite as frantic as State of Play." [...] Yates was nominated for another Directors Guild of Great Britain Award for his direction of Sex Traffic and won his second BAFTA for Best Drama Serial at the British Academy Television Awards. Being a British-Canadian production, Sex Traffic gained four wins at Canada's annual television award ceremony, the Gemini Awards, including Best Dramatic Mini-Series. Spanning across two parts, the three-hour-long drama reveals how the trafficking of young women into slavery is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>business</b> which operates throughout Europe; both parts were acclaimed for their [...] "shocking" [...] portrayal of such a sensitive topic.|$|E
