500|$|The Artemiz also {{possesses}} an [...] "intelligent counterweight". Its fulcrum {{is balanced}} on a stub {{at the rear}} of the arm so that its weight is decoupled from the arm and its centre of gravity low. A rider, with a small indentation for the fulcrum, can be moved incrementally along the stub to adjust tracking weight. The pendulum is tuned to 2Hz, outside the range of warps and vibrations from footfalls. Bias is adjustable by spring and a threaded counterweight. The arm is wired using Isoda wire made to Roksan's specification. One end is terminated by cartridge tags, and the other has gold-plated RCA phono jacks. The wire has one join, in the <b>arm</b> <b>base,</b> where the thin cartridge wires are melded with sturdier phono leads.|$|E

Commercial models were then sent to Special Forces in Vietnam, who reported great success with the weapon. This led to its being adopted as the Army's main combat rifle starting in 1964.

5000|$|The {{base was}} first {{constructed}} as a Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>base</b> in 1938, {{when it was}} known as RNAS Arbroath (HMS Condor). It was opened on 19 June 1940. From the outset it was a training base, primarily involved in the training of naval aviators. A purpose-built 'aircraft carrier' sized landing area was constructed on the airfield and it, along with another similar facility at nearby East Haven, Angus, HMS Peewit was used to train aircrew in deck landing operations. In October, 1940, the base was attacked by Luftwaffe He-111 bombers, operating from Norway, which resulted in minor damage (then valued at £1000) being sustained to some Squadron buildings. Throughout the war years the base was additionally used as a rest area. Operational Squadrons from aircraft carriers would take it in turn to spend rest periods whilst their ships were undergoing maintenance at Scottish Naval ship repair facilities.|$|E
