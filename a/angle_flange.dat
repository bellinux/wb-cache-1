The 2 -D CFD diffuser model grids are developed by GAMBIT, while the flow field analysis has been carried out using commercial software FLUENT. This study focuses on the effect of flange’s angles as a varied parameter on velocity at diffuser entrance. All models have the same dimensions in diffuser length, entrance diameter, exit diameter and flange height but differ in flange <b>angle.</b> <b>Flange</b> angles of these tested models vary from − 25 ° to + 25 °, where flange angles were measured to vertical axis. Present model verification indicates a good agreement between present numerical work and previous published experimental work. The numerical simulation shows the created vortices behind flange that cause pressure drop which increases mass flow rate through the diffuser. The results indicate also that the right flange angle at 15 ° is the optimum angle that accelerates flow at diffuser entrance. The increase of velocity at this optimum flange angles is higher than the case of normal angle, where the expected increase in the generated power by wind turbine can reach 5 % more compared with normal flange...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-In {{the current}} {{practice}} of analysis {{and design of}} steel-frame building structure, the actual behaviour of beam-column connection is generally simplified to the two idealized extremes of either fully regid behaviour or ideally pinned behaviour. However, most connections used in current practice actually exhibit semi-rigid deformation behaviour that can contribute substantially to overall displacements of the structure and to the distribution of member forces. So it is very necessary that studying the behavior of these semi-rigid connections under cyclic reversal loading. Three full-scale specimens of angles steel using H-section members had been conducted. The specimens were subjected to cyclic reversal loading simulating earthquake effects on a steel moment-resisting force. The objective {{of the work is}} to determine the behavior of these connections under cyclic reversal loading well into the inelastic range and to ascertain the effect of design parameters such as column flange stiffener, pre-tension of bolts and the <b>angles</b> <b>flange</b> thickness on the overall behavior. Observations were made concerning the response of the connections and its elements in terms of strength, stiffness and energy dissipation. Information on the design of these connections is presented. The hysteretic behavior of angles beam-column connections under cyclic loading is presented in this paper. Rotational stiffness, the carrying capacity and ductility of top-seat and web angles connections are analyzed. It is concluded that angles connections can possess the relative high stiffness, strength and excellent ductility as moment-resisting components in the seismic design of frames.

The present work deals with numerical simulation related to draw bending and springback of U- shaped parts.

The Dynaform 5. 8 software was used to simulate the forming process, in which the blank holder force varies in four steps between 0 and 50 kN.

It is also necessary to determine possible effect of coupled work of deck beam grid and booms on their stress-strain state. Methodology. To reach {{the purpose of the}} study the testing of the existing bridge was conducted. To measure strains (stresses) in the span elements we used the strain gages glued to <b>flange</b> <b>angles</b> of stringers and floor beams and to fillets of lower <b>flange</b> <b>angles</b> of stringers in the points of their support on floor beams. To measure deflections of the truss, stringers and floor beams from static loads we used Aistov’s and Maksimov’s deflectometers, that were installed on lower boom in the middle of span 0 - 1, as well as on both stringers and floor beams in the middle of the span. Deflectometers were fastened to the span and, by wire communication, to the ground surface. Findings. Stress-strain state of the point of connection of the stringers with the floor beams on condition of their staged interposition was obtained and analyzed.

40|$|The {{current work}} investigates {{the effect of}} warm forming process {{parameters}} on springback of AA 3003 brazing sheets, comprising a modified AA 3003 core with a lower melting point AA 4045 clad layer used to promote brazing. Three temper conditions were considered including O-, H 22 - and H 24 -temper. Two custom tooling sets were designed to form U-shaped channels, allowing forming temperature, blank holding force and lubricant type to be varied. The forming temperature range considered was from room temperature to 300 °C. The formed specimen cross sections were measured and the net shape was evaluated {{in terms of the}} measured versus ideal sidewall angle. Tensile tests were conducted to characterize material behaviour for the range of temperature considered in the forming experiments. The results showed thermal softening and increased strain-rate sensitivity at elevated temperature in the O-, H 22 -, and H 24 -tempers, which results in lower forming stresses and thus lower springback. The room temperature strength is recovered after warm forming. Ductility increased significantly at elevated temperature; however, the harder temper conditions exhibited negative strain hardening for high temperatures at strains beyond the ultimate tensile strength. The experiments revealed that springback reduced steadily for all three tempers as the forming temperature was increased from room temperature to 250 °C. The effect of temperature on springback was relatively small for the O-temper condition, but significant for the high-strength tempers. At a forming temperature of 250 °C, the H 22 -and H 24 -tempers exhibited springback reduction of 95 % and 92 %, in terms of deviation from the ideal sidewall angle, relative to springback at room temperature, respectively. The stress-strain data was used to create a numerical model for predicting springback after U-channel forming. One challenge in developing constitutive model parameters for this work was the negative hardening response exhibited by the harder temper conditions at higher temperatures. This caused numerical instabilities, requiring the use of approximate fits to the material response. The sidewall <b>angle</b> deviation and <b>flange</b> <b>angle</b> were predicted after springback. The numerical models qualitatively captured the reduction in springback with increase in forming temperature, but quantitative differences in the predicted and measured extent of springback exist. Sensitivity analysis using the model showed that friction coefficient and constitutive fit had a large influence on predicted springback. Future studies should address the complex material response data at elevated temperature and develop a more detailed temperature- and strain-rate dependent constitutive model...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand of reducing the body weight of automobiles, the utilization of advanced high strength steel has increased dramatically in recent years. However, high residual stress and redundant strain caused by the traditional cold roll forming process is still an outstanding problem. Under such circumstances, the Chain-die forming method is developed as a novel sheet metal forming approach which combines roll forming and stamping processes. A Chain-die former employs discrete die blocks which run on a chain track with significant virtual roll radius, simulating a roll forming process. Meanwhile, individual pairs of die blocks deform the sheet metal gradually acting as a stamping process. Through the enlargement of virtual roll radius, the peak longitudinal strain developed during the forming process is dramatically decreased (contained in the elastic region), leading to significantly reduced residual stress and almost no redundant deformation. Due to low longitudinal strain, the cross-sections of the product {{can be considered as}} a plane strain state throughout the entire forming process, allowing utilization of 2 -D plane strain simulations to represent for 3 -D simulations. In this paper, using 2 -D FE stamping simulations and 3 -D FE Chain-die forming simulations in assisting die design for a Chain-die formed threshold product using AHSS material is discussed. The results show 2 -D stamping simulations are able to predict the average forming angles of 3 -D simulation results with high accuracy and much higher efficiency.

The present study has risen out of specific cases of floor system cracks which are not immediately detrimental to the structural integrity of the floor system and which do not at the outset seem related to a usual design basis load effects. The cases forming the central focus of this report are: (1) The 1 - 474 Shade-Lohmann Bridge over the Illinois River south of Peoria, (2) The 1 - 74 Bridge over the Vermilion River at Danville, and (3) The 1 - 74 Bridge over the Sangamon near Mahomet in Champaign County. The following is seen: Case 1 : Cracking due to forces not associated with vertical vehicle loading. That is, evidence is strong that cracking arises from longitudinal load transmitted through the out of plane flexure of the floor beam web in the segment between the connection clip <b>angles</b> and the <b>flange</b> at either end. Calculations show that a very modest induced longitudinal deformation is associated with substantialloca 1 stresses at the web to flange junction which is the site of the cracking.

A repair detail to reduce member forces has been suggested and is evaluated. Case 3 : The development of a fatigue crack at a cope detail associate with a reasonable stress state for the damage observed, but with poor correlation with a limited controlled vehicle test and predictions of bridge behavior using a grid model.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of steel and}} composite frames has traditionally been carried out by idealizing beam-to-column connections as either rigid or pinned. Although some advanced analysis methods have been proposed to account for semi-rigid connections, the performance of these methods strongly depends on the proper modeling of connection behavior. The primary challenge of modeling beam-to-column connections is their inelastic response and continuously varying stiffness, strength, and ductility. In this dissertation, two distinct approaches—mathematical models and informational models—are proposed {{to account for the}} complex hysteretic behavior of beam-to-column connections. The performance of the two approaches is examined and is then followed by a discussion of their merits and deficiencies. To capitalize on the merits of both mathematical and informational representations, a new approach, a hybrid modeling framework, is developed and demonstrated through modeling beam-to-column connections. Component-based modeling is a compromise spanning two extremes in the field of mathematical modeling: simplified global models and finite element models. In the component-based modeling of angle connections, the five critical components of excessive deformation are identified. Constitutive relationships of angles, column panel zones, and contact between <b>angles</b> and column <b>flanges,</b> are derived by using only material and geometric properties and theoretical mechanics considerations. Those of slip and bolt hole ovalization are simplified by empirically-suggested mathematical representation and expert opinions. A mathematical model is then assembled as a macro-element by combining rigid bars and springs that represent the constitutive relationship of components. Lastly, the moment-rotation curves of the mathematical models are compared with those of experimental tests. In the case of a top-and-seat angle connection with double web angles, a pinched hysteretic response is predicted quite well by complete mechanical models, which take advantage of only material and geometric properties. On the other hand, to exhibit the highly pinched behavior of a top-and-seat angle connection without web angles, a mathematical model requires components of slip and bolt hole ovalization, which are more amenable to informational modeling. An alternative method is informational modeling, which constitutes a fundamental shift from mathematical equations to data that contain the required information about underlying mechanics. The information is extracted from observed data and stored in neural networks. Two different training data sets, analytically-generated and experimental data, are tested to examine the performance of informational models. Both informational models show acceptable agreement with the moment-rotation curves of the experiments. Adding a degradation parameter improves the informational models when modeling highly pinched hysteretic behavior. However, informational models cannot represent the contribution of individual components and therefore do not provide an insight into the underlying mechanics of components. In this study, a new hybrid modeling framework is proposed. In the hybrid framework, a conventional mathematical model is complemented by the informational methods. The basic premise of the proposed hybrid methodology is that not all features of system response are amenable to mathematical modeling, hence considering informational alternatives. This may be because (i) the underlying theory is not available or not sufficiently developed, or (ii) the existing theory is too complex and therefore not suitable for modeling within building frame analysis. The role of informational methods is to model aspects that the mathematical model leaves out. Autoprogressive algorithm and self-learning simulation extract the missing aspects from a system response. In a hybrid framework, experimental data {{is an integral part of}} modeling, rather than being used strictly for validation processes. The potential of the hybrid methodology is illustrated through modeling complex hysteretic behavior of beam-to-column connections. Mechanics-based components of deformation such as angles, flange-plates, and column panel zone, are idealized to a mathematical model by using a complete mechanical approach. Although the mathematical model represents envelope curves in terms of initial stiffness and yielding strength, it is not capable of capturing the pinching effects. Pinching is caused mainly by separation between <b>angles</b> and column <b>flanges</b> as well as slip between angles/flange-plates and beam flanges. These components of deformation are suitable for informational modeling. Finally, the moment-rotation curves of the hybrid models are validated with those of the experimental tests. The comparison shows that the hybrid models are capable of representing the highly pinched hysteretic behavior of beam-to-column connections. In addition, the developed hybrid model is successfully used to predict the behavior of a newly-designed connection...|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} has been performed characterizing the in-plane fiber-dominated properties, under both static and fatigue loading, of advanced composite materials. To the author's knowledge, no study has been performed to date investigating fatigue characteristics in the transverse direction. This information {{is important in the}} design of bonded composite airframe structure where repeated, cyclic out-of-plane bending may occur. Recent tests characterizing skin/stringer debond failures in reinforced composite panels where the dominant loading in the skin is flexure {{along the edge of the}} frame indicate failure initiated either in the skin or else the flange, near the flange tip. When failure initiated in the skin, transverse matrix cracks formed in the surface skin ply closest to the flange and either initiated delaminations or created matrix cracks in the next lower ply, which in turn initiated delaminations. When failure initiated in the flanges, transverse cracks formed in the <b>flange</b> <b>angle</b> ply closest to the skin and initiated delamination. In no configuration did failure propagate through the adhesive bond layer. For the examined skin/flange configurations, the maximum transverse tension stress at failure correlates very well with the transverse tension strength of the composites. Transverse tension strength (static) data of graphite epoxy composites have been shown to vary with the volume of material stressed. As the volume of material stressed increased, the strength decreased. A volumetric scaling law based on Weibull statistics can be used to predict the transverse strength measurements. The volume dependence reflects the presence of inherent flaws in the microstructure of the lamina. A similar approach may be taken to determine a volume scale effect on the transverse tension fatigue behavior of graphite/epoxy composites. The objective of this work is to generate transverse tension strength and fatigue S-N characteristics for composite materials using 3 -point flexure tests of 90 deg graphite/epoxy specimens. Investigations will include the volume scale effect as well as frequency and span-to-thickness ratio effects. Prior to the start of the experimental study, an analytical study using finite element modeling will be performed to investigate the span-to-thickness effect. The ratio of transverse flexure stress to shear stress will be monitored and its values predicted by the FEM analysis compared with the value obtained using a 'strength of materials' based approach...|$|R
