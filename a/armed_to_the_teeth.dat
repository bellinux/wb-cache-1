Jinnah {{played an important role}} in the founding of the All India Home Rule League in 1916. Along with political leaders Annie Besant and Tilak, Jinnah demanded [...] "home rule" [...] for India—the status of a self-governing dominion in the Empire similar to Canada, New Zealand and Australia, although, with the war, Britain's politicians were not interested in considering Indian constitutional reform. British Cabinet minister Edwin Montagu recalled Jinnah in his memoirs, [...] "young, perfectly mannered, impressive-looking, <b>armed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> with dialectics, and insistent on the whole of his scheme".|$|E
500|$|Journeys between star {{systems are}} {{achieved}} by [...] "jumping" [...] through jump nodes and traveling through subspace, while shorter intra-system distances are done by [...] "hopping" [...] into subspace at any time. All ships in a mission either [...] "jump" [...] or [...] "hop" [...] {{to make their}} entries and exits. The game's starship designs are clearly distinguishable between the three races. Terran starships tend to be plain and practical, the Vasudans' starships are artistic with sleek lines and curves, and the enemies' ships—the Shivans—are sharp, pointy and asymmetrical in insidious black and red colors. FreeSpace 2 also features humongous capital ships, hundreds of {{times larger than the}} fighters, and <b>armed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> with beam weapons and flak guns. These ships are commonly scripted to seek each other out and engage in massive duels.|$|E
2500|$|Julesburg was a {{prominent}} way station on the Overland Trail. [...] It consisted of a stagecoach station, stables, an express and telegraph office, a warehouse, and a large store that catered to travelers going to Denver along the South Platte.

[...] One mile west was Fort Rankin (later Fort Sedgwick) with a complement of one company of cavalry, about sixty men, under Captain Nicholas J. O’Brien.

2500|$|Pietrzak's mother, Henryka Pietrzak-Varga has {{repeatedly}} stated {{she believes the}} murders were racially motivated, as her son and daughter-in-law were not affluent individuals. On November 11, 2008 (Veteran's Day), Pietrzak's mother composed a formal letter to president-elect Barack Obama in which she discussed what her son and daughter-in-law had endured, and the possible primary motive for the murders. In this letter, Henryka stated: [...] "If it was a robbery, why didn't they come when nobody was home instead of {{in the dead of}} night, <b>armed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth?</b> ... What was it about my son and daughter-in-law that inspired such hatred and loathing?" [...] Seven months later on July 27, 2009, the Obama administration responded with generic form letter of the type issued to all soldiers killed in combat. When knowledge of this indirect, insincere reply reached the news media, the Obama administration issued an apology.|$|E
2500|$|Successful pirate crews would capture {{or buy a}} {{small ship}} to begin with and then [...] "trade up" [...] to larger ones. However {{changing}} ships many times was not the norm and most crews would stick {{with one or two}} ships. A pirate would make the switch from a small to large vessel for the advantages a small ship could not provide or to replace a ship that was damaged or needed such extensive repairs that could not be done by the crew. When a ship was captured, it had to be converted into a vessel suitable for the pirates needs. This meant knocking down cabin walls and lowering the forecastle to create a flush deck, allowing greater utilization of deck space in engagements and storage of armaments. [...] Any unnecessary decorations or structures would be stripped off and as many guns as possible were fit. What was left when they were finished was a sleek, <b>armed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> ship with as much thought to speed and efficiency as possible.|$|E
2500|$|That night dark {{storm clouds}} swirl around the house. Suddenly, the four glowing pods {{land on the}} roof. An alien crew emerges, made up of Skip (J. K. Simmons), the tough commander, Tazer (Thomas Haden Church), a muscle-bound dude <b>armed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth,</b> Razor (Kari Wahlgren), a lethal female alien soldier, and Sparks (Josh Peck), a four-armed techie, who is the only non-threatening intruder. Since the aliens knocked over the {{satellite}} dish Ricky and Tom are sent to fix it. Ricky then reveals to Tom that he lied about his car breaking down, and his age; Ricky is actually in college and is 21 years old, five years older than Bethany. Ricky makes Tom fix the satellite dish by himself but it is beyond repair. Investigating further, Tom and Jake (who unexpectedly shows up on the roof) discover the aliens. Ricky is captured and implanted with a mind control device. The aliens, called [...] "Zirkonians", lay claim to the planet. Like a puppet, Ricky grabs the boys – but Tom and Jake break free and {{get back in the}} house.|$|E

60|$|For {{three years}} the Transvaal had been <b>arming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> So many modern magazine-rifles had been {{imported}} {{that there were}} enough to furnish five to every male burgher in the country. The importation of ammunition was on the same gigantic scale. For what were these formidable preparations? Evidently for a war with Great Britain, and not for a defensive war. It {{is not in a}} defensive war that a State provides sufficient rifles <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> every man of Dutch blood in the whole of South Africa. No British reinforcements had been sent during the years that the Transvaal was obviously preparing for a struggle. In that one eloquent fact lies a complete proof as to which side forced on a war, and which side desired to avoid one. For three weeks and more, during which Mr. Kruger was silent, these preparations went on more energetically and more openly.|$|R

It appears that Hariri won't do it, which is both a moral and a politically intelligent decision. Instead he and his country are left floating, trying to avoid violence that may only benefit Hezbollah and watching Saudi and Syrian mediation whose outcome for Lebanese sovereignty is likely to be tragic." ...|$|R

Wilmont has been bitten and Soo quickly puts a bullet through his brain after a standoff between Wilmont and Rader. A helicopter flies overhead but rather than offer help it drops a bomb on the hospital where uninfected were taking refuge and then begins tailing Soo and Rader. The two are able <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> chopper and take cover in an abandoned building.

Rader begins annihilating the monsters by blowing up gas stations and buildings, only to look up and see a stealth bomber drop a nuclear device on the city.
