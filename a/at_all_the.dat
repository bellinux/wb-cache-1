5|$|Clint Eastwood {{is dressed}} as the Man with No Name from the Dollars Trilogy films. The film Paint Your Wagon is {{referenced}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode. The film does star Eastwood and Lee Marvin and was directed by Joshua Logan, but the writers did not base their parody or the song on the film <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> man in the film that confronts Clint Eastwood is modelled after Lee Van Cleef.|$|E
5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to {{kill and}} eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the females have hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> male leaps and runs away.|$|E

5|$|In precocial species, {{the mothers}} invest little in nest {{building}} {{and some do}} not build nests <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters {{spend more time in}} the nest than those with larger litters.|$|E
5|$|Many academics, {{including}} William Holdsworth, a man {{considered to}} be one of the best legal academics in history, maintain that this period saw a decline in the standard of teaching <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Inns. From 1640 onwards no readings were held, and barristers such as Sir Edward Coke remarked at the time that the quality of education at the Inns of Court had decreased. Holdsworth put this down to three thingsâ€”the introduction of printed books, the disinclination of students to attend moots and readings and the disinclination of the Benchers and Readers to enforce attendance.|$|E

Later versions included the Y-1560, which had 72 detonators; the Y-1561, which had 32; and the Y-1562, which had 132.

5|$|The entire Homicide cast {{returned}} {{for the second}} season.

5|$|The {{privileges}} {{have been}} lost and eroded over time.

The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked.|$|E

5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessiveâ€“compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} in the Senate, Rowan {{returned}} to Kentucky, where he served as {{the first president of}} the Louisville Medical Institute and the Kentucky Historical Society. In 1840, he was appointed to a commission to prosecute land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico, but resigned his commission in 1842 because of failing health. He died July 13, 1843 and was buried on the grounds of Federal Hill, his estate in Bardstown. According to tradition, Stephen Collins Foster, a distant relative of Rowan's, was inspired to write the ballad My Old Kentucky Home after a visit to Federal Hill in 1852, but later historians have been unable to conclude whether or not Foster ever visited the mansion <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> mansion is now owned by the state of Kentucky and forms the centerpiece of My Old Kentucky Home State Park.|$|E
