5|$|Although not {{permitted}} under the US National Electric Code, it is technically {{possible to have}} a “plug and play” PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling plug and play solar systems available on the web, but there is <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because it was out of range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|When the {{spacecraft}} was installed atop the Dnepr, launch {{was scheduled to}} occur on 25 February, at 13:57 UTC. Prior to this, a practice countdown was scheduled for 19 February. Several hours before the practice was scheduled to begin ISC Kosmotras announced that the launch had been delayed, {{and as a result}} the practice did not take place. The delay was caused by <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> the second stage manoeuvring engines did not have a sufficient quantity of reserve fuel.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of}} the videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E

5|$|In foreign affairs, Walter {{negotiated}} with Scotland in 1195 {{and with the}} Welsh in 1197. Scotland claimed Northumbria, or northern England. Negotiations broke down, but {{relations between the two}} countries remained good throughout the rest of Richard's reign. Talks with the Welsh began after the English lords Roger Mortimer and William de Briouze expanded into Welsh territory in 1195, causing <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> the Welsh lord Rhys ap Gruffydd would strike back across the border. In 1196, Walter quickly suppressed a popular uprising in London led by William Fitz Osbern. FitzOsbern was an orator who harnessed the discontent of the poor residents of London against high taxes. His oratory provoked a riot in London, and he was apprehended and hanged on Walter's orders.|$|E
5|$|The {{case for}} {{excluding}} Oswiu from {{any role in}} Wighard's election {{is based on the}} theory that Bede misinterpreted a letter from Vitalian to Oswiu as stating that Oswiu was involved in the selection. The historian Nicholas Brooks points out that although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian's letter, Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit's replacement, not least of which was <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid, who was in Kent and Mercia at the time, not be selected as the new archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Oswiu's involvement in Wighard's selection as an attempt to help restore the Anglo-Saxon church, and perhaps as the beginning of steps to secure York as an archbishopric. Brooks points out that one reason Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium. As it had been the normal practice up until then to have it sent out to England by the papacy, Wighard's travel to Rome would indicate the papacy's approval of his election and ensure the validity of his consecration.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} was controversial in Lillehammer, both amongst {{the general public}} and politicians. The chief of administration had doubted whether he should recommend construction. The original plans had called for both a large and normal hill, but lack of funding meant that the normal hill was never built, meaning that the number of competitions in the hill would be severely limited. The cost overruns were largely created by errors in the plans, which estimated too little earthwork to fill the hillside, and not enough blasting. To cut costs, a floodlighting system was taken out of the plans, so the venue could not be used during the evenings, limiting the amount of time the venue could be used. It was also <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> very few locals were able to jump on such a large hill. Many politicians stated in 1972 that the money should have been spent instead on an indoor hall for handball. The first trial jump was made by Helge Nordstrand, while Jan Stenbekk is credited with the first hill record, at 110.5meters.|$|E

5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the use of anticoagulation to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, there had been <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further {{as a result of}} treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend heparin or low molecular weight heparin in the initial treatment, followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts discourage the use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, anticoagulants are started, while no anticoagulants are given if there is no reduction.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{attempted}} {{to build up}} a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful rulers after her. Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained {{towards the end of the}} King's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{idea was}} an {{attractive}} one because initial construction {{was to be}} financed {{by the private sector}} via sales of revenue bonds, allowing state highway funds to be used for other important projects. The new toll road would also reduce traffic, and thus maintenance costs, on existing roads. There was also <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> if Kansas lagged behind in turnpike construction, it might be bypassed by toll roads in other states, leaving it at an economic disadvantage. The toll concept also had the benefit of ultimately putting the financial burden on the drivers who actually used the road, instead of using tax revenue that had been collected from residents statewide. There was a some opposition to the plan, from both government officials and citizens, due to concerns that the toll revenue might not cover the repayments to investors, bankrupting the turnpike authority and burdening the state government with the remaining debt. There were also worries about the possibility of the turnpike requiring maintenance before the bonds had been repaid. Some critics also felt that the high speeds typical of turnpike driving were unsafe. As right-of-way for the project was obtained, the turnpike drew opposition from farmers and ranchers, who objected to the turnpike bisecting their property, making it difficult to access disjointed parcels of land.|$|E
