6000|$|... "No, I {{was waiting}} to tell you that--and {{something}} else, and didn't tell you because you seemed angry with me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to speak to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he replied. [...] "I knew it {{was against}} the Law, but I wanted to save Unc Nunkie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> if I asked your consent to pick it you would refuse me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} thing, now," [...] said I. [...] "I am not the least afraid with you, yet I could have run from the Miss Grants. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of your cousin too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, utter {{repudiation}} of such cases was the line {{taken by the}} last generation; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> my mother would be very severe.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> from that, that my remark was but discouragement, {{wearing the}} dress of comfort. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not quite right}} in--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will put}} it off until to-morrow,' Ethelberta murmured gloomily; 'I have a bad headache, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> cannot stay with you after all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{intention}} was bad enough," [...] Duane went on. [...] "It was a ticklish place for me. You see, he was half drunk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> his gun might go off. Fool careless he was!" ...|$|E
60|$|Another pause full {{of mistrust}} followed. Necessity, they say, is mother of invention, but fear, too, is not barren of ingenious suggestions. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{he would ask}} me point-blank for news of my other self.|$|E
60|$|This {{sibilant}} whispering irritated him, and me. I {{tugged at}} his coat. He snarled incoherently, and swore. She caught her breath. He looked at her sharply, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> he would wake himself into a rage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{has gone}} through a great deal, poor child, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> there <b>is</b> much more for her to suffer, whether he recovers or not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, George, do {{explain it}} to me. It is so stupid not to understand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> of opening my mouth for fear of blundering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] said Julian, [...] "that I {{met your}} Majesty at Master Chiffinch's, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> {{had the misfortune}} to displease you; but----" ...|$|R
6000|$|And Ellie blushed, and said, [...] "Yes, Tom; I did {{not like}} coming here at first; I was so much happier at home, where it is always Sunday. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of you, Tom, at first, because--because--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had taken}} {{a step in the}} dark, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> for Cynthia. I had {{undertaken}} to give her happiness. Was I certain that I could succeed? The glow of chivalry had left me, and I began to doubt.|$|E
6000|$|... "I daren't--I tried," [...] and {{the girl}} quivered in Miss Schuyler's grasp. [...] "If I could have warned him I would not have told you; but Joe saw me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid.</b> I told him to come at nine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] began Mary, [...] "would {{you mind}} {{being a little}} quieter? My father <b>is</b> asleep upstairs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> that you will wake him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Until," [...] I answered, [...] "the magician comes who {{can make}} me believe it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid,</b> Lady Delahaye, that he has passed me by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so--I think <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> for {{none of my}} {{feelings}} seem to me ever to change, except that <b>I</b> get harder, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid,</b> bitterer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} hear more, but they walked away <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to follow them," [...] {{continued}} Dora. [...] "I thought I had better tell you and perhaps you'd know what to do. I didn't want to worry mother or my aunt." ...|$|E
60|$|We toiled all day, {{not merely}} because {{the horse was}} {{exceedingly}} valuable to us, {{but also for the}} reason that he had a rope attached to his neck <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> he might become entangled in the fallen timber and so starve to death.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a long story. I've been a {{prisoner}} twice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> I was about done {{for when the}} guards up and ran away from the prison and let me and a crowd of Cubans escape. How can I {{get back to my}} ship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not much; only <b>I</b> must go <b>and</b> {{get another}} list made out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> {{able to come}} in again before church.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have flown}} into a passion, dearest Helena; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> shall make you fly into a passion, too. Blame Mrs. Tenbruggen; don't blame me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I cannot; she {{has gone}} into a convent for a month, near Beaulieu, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> the Sisters would not let me through their gates." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I only hoped so. I feared I {{might be}} wrong. But I began to find holding myself back {{was getting too}} hard, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{somebody}} else might come along who {{had the power to}} rouse you. I believe you can be roused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was on Friday. Yes, I {{remember}} it was Friday, because I {{went into the}} school-room to get my pencil, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> Hal would jump out upon me, and looked in first to see whether {{he was going to}} be tiresome; but he was gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{to ask her}} to give it. But {{the landlady}} here is not a very scrupulous person. She told me she looked at the poor creature's linen while it was drying by the fire. The name marked on it was, 'Van Brandt.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are at the}} Lodge," [...] {{she said}} quietly. [...] "You called to see Mr. Sabin this morning, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> you must have quarrelled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Lucy," [...] {{said her}} brother; [...] "he {{was coming up}} to see Ponto's shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> he <b>was</b> {{thinking}} more about the dog than you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray do {{spare me}} a minute, Ethel, for I have {{something}} that I must say to you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> you won't like it--so do listen kindly." ...|$|R
6000|$|I held {{my breath}} {{for a moment in}} amazement. Since when had {{thoughts}} like this come to her? I knew then that the days of her childhood were numbered indeed, that, underneath the fresh joyous grace of her delightful youth, the woman's instincts were stirring. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|How {{heavy and}} fast he was! The line slipped off <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of the drag. I threw it off--no easy matter with that weight on it--and then the line whistled. The {{sailfish}} was running straight toward B.'s boat and, I calculated, should {{be close to}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} get back sooner," [...] he said; [...] "the case was desperate, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to leave it. You will find a key on the chimney-piece--throw it out to me, and I can let myself in; I {{told them not to}} bolt the door before I went out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> {{they will}} <b>be</b> the last this year. Poor thing! She found it hot enough; {{but they were}} so {{full-blown}} that one could not wait." ...|$|R
60|$|STEPHEN. I {{have not}} studied law. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>I</b> have not the {{necessary}} push--I {{believe that is}} the name barristers give to their vulgarity--for success in pleading.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Sam, it is {{carrying}} a joke too far; still, {{it is only a}} trick off duty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> that it <b>is</b> beyond my power to interfere." ...|$|R
