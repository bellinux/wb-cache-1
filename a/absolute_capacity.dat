6000|$|Goldsmith writes {{fully and}} {{accurately}} {{in the tradition}} of the old historic idea of what a poet was. The poet, the vates, was the supreme and absolute critic of human existence, the chorus in the human drama; he was, to employ two words, which when analysed are the same word, either a spectator or a seer. He took a situation, such as the situation of a woman deserted by a man before-mentioned, and he gave, as Goldsmith gives, his own personal and definite decision upon it, entirely based upon general principles, and entirely from the outside. Then, as in the case of The Golden Treasury, he has no sooner given judgment than there comes a bitter and confounding cry out of the very heart of the situation itself, which tells us things which would have been quite left out of account by the poet of the general rule. No one, for example, but a person who knew something of the inside of agony would have introduced that touch of the rage of the mourner against the chattering frivolity of nature, [...] "Thou'll break my heart, thou bonny bird." [...] We find and could find no such touch in Goldsmith. We have to arrive at the conclusion therefore, that the vates or poet in his <b>absolute</b> <b>capacity</b> is defied and overthrown by this new method of what may be called the songs of experience.|$|E

Let us assume, for simplicity's sake, that the lowest Man's skull has twice the capacity of that of the highest Gorilla.* ([Footnote] *It has been affirmed that Hindoo crania sometimes contain as little as 27 ounces of water, which would give a capacity of about 46 cubic inches. The minimum capacity which I have assumed above, however, is based upon the valuable tables published by Professor R. Wagner in his [...] "Vorstudien zu einer wissenschaftlichen Morphologie und Physiologie des menschlichen Gehirns." [...] As the result of the careful weighing of more than 900 human brains, Professor Wagner states that one-half weighed between 1200 and 1400 grammes, and that about two-ninths, consisting for the most part of male brains, exceed 1400 grammes. The lightest brain of an adult male, with sound mental faculties, recorded by Wagner, weighed 1020 grammes. As a gramme equals 15.4 grains, and a cubic inch of water contains 252.4 grains, this is equivalent to 62 cubic inches of water; so that as brain is heavier than water, we are perfectly safe against erring on the side of diminution in taking this as the smallest capacity of any adult male human brain. The only adult male brain, weighing as little as 970 grammes, is that of an idiot; but the brain of an adult woman, against the soundness of whose faculties nothing appears, weighed as little as 907 grammes (55.3 cubic inches of water); and Reid gives an adult female brain of still smaller capacity. The heaviest brain (1872 grammes, or about 115 cubic inches) was, however, that of a woman; next to it comes the brain of Cuvier (1861 grammes), then Byron (1807 grammes), and then an insane person (1783 grammes). The lightest adult brain recorded (720 grammes) was that of an idiotic female. The brains of five children, four years old, weighed between 1275 and 992 grammes. So that it may be safely said, that an average European child of four years old has a brain twice as large as that of an adult Gorilla.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Autoassociative fuzzy implicative {{memories}} (AFIMs) are {{models that}} exhibit optimal <b>absolute</b> storage <b>capacity</b> {{and an excellent}} tolerance with respect to incomplete or eroded patterns. Thus, they can be effectively used for the reconstruction of gray-scale images. In practice, however, applications of AFIMs are confined to images of small size due to computational limitations. This paper introduces a class of sparsely connected AFIMs (SCAFIMs) that circumvent this computational overhead and, therefore, {{can be used for}} the reconstruction of large images. We show that SCAFIMs exhibit optimal <b>absolute</b> storage <b>capacity</b> and tolerance with respect to incomplete or eroded patterns. Furthermore, we compare the performance of SCAFIMs with their corresponding fully connected AFIM both theoretically and by means of computational experiments...|$|R
