She is ranked in the top 10 {{throughout}} the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading, even if they make loud disturbances around her. Clannad fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo can be aggressive is a very strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is very athletic. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student. Tomoyo appears in Key's fifth game, , as the main heroine.|$|E

500|$|The 1983 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the longest}} season ever recorded at that time. The 1983 Pacific {{hurricane season}} started on May15, 1983 in the eastern Pacific, and on June1, 1983 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. [...] During the 1983season, there were 21 named storms, which was slightly less than the previous season. Furthermore, eight storms reached major hurricane status, or Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). The decaying 1982–83 El Niño event likely contributed to this level of activity. That same El Niño influenced <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

In 1897, the magazine reported that {{she had lived in}} retirement in Brighton for the past thirty-five years. Her attachment to the city, the article suggested, was due to childhood memories of visiting there with King William. The article also stated that because Lord Munster's health was failing, the Countess was living in [...] "comparative seclusion", though her lifestyle was also attributed to a love of a [...] "quiet, literary, and artistic life". She died on 9 October 1906, having been widowed five years.|$|E

500|$|The {{work has}} been {{described}} by Laura Saetveit Miles, a University of Bergen Professor of medieval literature, as [...] "one of the most admired fifteenth-century Middle English lyrics [...] offers, within a deceptively simple form, an extremely delicate and haunting presentation of Mary (the 'mayden / þat is makeles') and her conception of Christ ('here sone')". Primarily, the text celebrates the Annunciation of Mary as described in Luke 1:26, but also widely references concepts from the Old Testament. Michael Steffes of University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point notes that [...] "'I syng of a mayden' is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> and very beautiful meditation on the inward aspects of the Annunciation, on the immediate consequences of Mary's acceptance of Gabriel's message." [...] The concept of the choice of Mary is an important subtlety in the text. Derek Pearsall writes: ...|$|E

2500|$|The guqin is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> instrument, with a {{range of}} about four octaves, and its open strings are tuned in the bass register. Its lowest pitch is about two octaves below middle C, or the lowest note on the cello. Sounds are {{produced}} by [...] open strings, stopped strings, and harmonics. The use of glissando—sliding tones—gives it a sound reminiscent of a pizzicato cello, fretless double bass or a slide guitar. The qin is also capable of a lot of harmonics, of which 91 are most commonly used and indicated by the dotted positions. By tradition the qin originally had five strings, but ancient qin-like instruments with 10 or more strings have been found. The modern form has been standardized for about two millennia.|$|E

With 4 {{children of his}} own, he financially supported his family and another three through his work. Chmagh also supported his sister’s family after insurgents killed her husband. Chris Helgren, then Reuters' chief photographer in the region, launched a plan to employ and train Iraqis, with more local knowledge and access to areas now perilous for Westerners. Helgren said: [...] "There are few 'good news' stories to be had in this war and wars by definition are tales of violence. And to get there, drivers like Saeed Chmagh are indispensable.” [...] "Saeed had a reputation of being fiercely loyal and appeared fearless to me. If you ever needed to get quickly to a dangerous area, passing chicanes of barbed wire and boobytraps, Saeed was your man. But he also had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet,</b> loving side and spoke often of his kids." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of all {{cylinder}} layouts without {{balance shaft}} a straight eight design has very low inherent vibration, while the side-valve layout contains {{the moving parts}} of the valve train within the cast-iron block, enabling it to be very quiet compared to an overhead valve configuration (as in the contemporary Buick engines). Combined with a substantial exhaust manifold and effective intake and exhaust muffling {{this can lead to}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> vehicle, both internally and externally. At the time of its use a quiet engine was thought to be a mark of quality in an automobile. Bores need be of small diameter to keep the engine length down and so strokes must be long to obtain larger displacements - such configurations (called [...] "undersquare") exhibit good low-rpm torque and are capable of slow idle speeds, enhancing both drivability and quietness. While Chrysler vehicles had similar engines they were not targeted for the lower middle price range enabled by General Motors' manufacturing expertise and volumes of the time.|$|E
2500|$|When the qin is played, {{a number}} of {{aesthetic}} elements are involved. The first is musicality. In the second section of [...] "Pingsha Luoyan", for example, the initial few bars contain a nao vibrato followed by a phase of sliding {{up and down the}} string, even when the sound has already become inaudible [...] The average person trained in music may question whether this is really [...] "music". Normally, some players would pluck the string very lightly to create <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> sound. For some players, this plucking isn't necessary. Instead of trying to force a sound out of the string one should allow the natural sounds emit from the strings. Some players say that the sliding on the string even when the sound has disappeared is a distinctive feature in qin music. It creates a [...] "space" [...] or [...] "void" [...] in a piece, playing without playing, sound without sound. In fact, when the viewer looks at the player sliding on the string without sounds, the viewer automatically [...] "fills in the notes" [...] with their minds. This creates a connection between player, instrument and listener. This, of course, cannot happen when listening to a recording, as one cannot see the performer. It can also be seen as impractical in recording, as the player would want to convey sound as much as possible towards a third audience. But in fact, there is sound, the sound coming from the fingers sliding on the string. With a really good qin, silk strings, and a perfectly quiet environment, all the tones can be sounded. Since the music is more player oriented than listener oriented, and the player knows the music, he/she can hear it even if the sound is not there. With silk strings, the sliding sound might be called the qi or [...] "life force" [...] of the music. The really empty sounds are the pauses between notes. However, if one cannot create a sound that can be heard when sliding on a string, it is generally acceptable to lightly pluck the string to create <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> sound.|$|E
2500|$|Bordeaux {{had to wait}} {{three years}} to get their revenge {{in one of the}} dirtiest finals, in which the whistle was held by <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> and blasé Englishman, Billy Williams (who, four years later was to get the English RFU to buy some land for Twickenham). Kicks in the shins succeeded blows in the face. Spectators joined in and booed the kickers in a very poor and sad match. A {{reporter}} appalled at what he saw commented: [...] "I’ve never seen thug fights in the seediest parts of town, but that is probably what it looks like.” Bordeaux won the next three finals, all against Stade. The rivalry was enhanced by the huge number of France players on the pitch. When France battled New Zealand for its first ever international match in 1906, it had 5 Stade Français and 4 Stade Bordelais players, the highest tallies for any club. The First World War {{put an end to the}} rivalry as neither of the two Stades regained their past glory.|$|E
