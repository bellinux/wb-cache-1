For the event, Paralympic <b>athletes</b> <b>were</b> given rooms at a hotel {{on the outskirts of}} Toronto while Olympic <b>athletes</b> <b>were</b> housed downtown and received gifts; at a dinner, the Paralympians were relegated to a different dining room. A Canadian Paralympic Committee spokesperson told The Spectator that the committee scrambled during the Paralympics to have their athletes included, and with their limited funding they could not afford the perks received by the Olympic athletes.|$|E

5|$|A notable venue {{not found}} at the 1956 Games was an Olympic Village, where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d'Ampezzo had a {{population}} of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it would put many of them out of business. <b>Athletes</b> <b>were</b> billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.|$|E

The number of Australian athletes increased to three, five, five and six at the next four games, respectively, and all of the <b>athletes</b> <b>were</b> alpine skiers. The participation decreased to four in 1998 and climbed back up to six in 2002. Australia won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992, and has medalled at every games since then.

An investigation into their ages was launched by the IOC to determine whether it was necessary to disqualify them, thus Tweddle's standing could have been changed to 2nd, giving her a silver medal.
