5|$|In the meantime, the RAAF has {{implemented}} several {{measures to}} keep the Hornets in service. These include a structural refurbishment program, increased monitoring of fatigue-related issues as well as repainting the aircraft and frequently washing them to reduce the risks posed by corrosion. In 2015 the Defence Science and Technology Group conducted new statistical analysis of the Hornets' structural condition which found that the airframes were less fatigued than previously believed, and so able to remain in service {{for a longer period}} than planned if necessary. This finding was accepted by the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness – Australian Defence Force. As of September 2017, none of the RAAF Hornets were subject to flying restrictions due to airframe fatigue. However, the cost of maintaining the <b>ageing</b> <b>aircraft</b> in service has been increasing.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's <b>ageing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would participate in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
25|$|The RAAF {{contingent}} {{was also}} expanded, growing to include three squadrons—No. 35 Squadron, flying Caribou STOL transports, No. 9 Squadron flying UH-1 Iroquois battlefield helicopters and No. 2 Squadron flying Canberra bombers. Based at Phan Rang Air Base in Ninh Thuan province the Canberras flew many bombing sorties, {{and two were}} lost, while the Caribou transport aircraft supported anti-communist ground forces and the Iroquois helicopters were used in troop-lift, medical evacuation and as gunships from their base at Vung Tau in support of 1 ATF. At its peak it included over 750 personnel. During the war RAAF CAC-27 Sabre fighters from No. 79 Squadron were also deployed to Ubon Air Base in Thailand as part of Australia's SEATO commitments. However, the Sabres took no part in direct hostilities against North Vietnam, and were withdrawn in 1968. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) also made a significant contribution, which consisted of a destroyer on six-month rotations deployed on the gun-line in a shore bombardment role, the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam, and a RAN Clearance Diving Team. The <b>ageing</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier HMAS Sydney, after being converted to a troop-ship, was used to convey the bulk of Australian ground forces to South Vietnam. Female members of the Army and RAAF nursing services also served in Vietnam from the outset, and as the force grew the medical capability was also expanded with the 1st Australian Field Hospital established at Vung Tau on 1 April 1968.|$|E

In Australian service, the ship would have been named HMAS Australia, and would operate as a helicopter carrier until a later decision on the acquisition of Sea Harriers was made.

40|$|Abstract. The AP- 3 C Orion {{aircraft}} is {{the oldest}} aircraft in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) inventory.

To develop and underpin the <b>ageing</b> <b>aircraft</b> management plan and transition to the supplementary fatigue management standards, the RAAF collaborated with the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, the United States Navy (USN) and other operators to form the P- 3 C Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP).
