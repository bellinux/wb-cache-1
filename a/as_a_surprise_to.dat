5|$|Egypt in 2015 {{reportedly}} {{expressed an}} interest again in the JF-17 despite buying French and Russian planes earlier that year. This has come <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> analysts who had considered the possibility of Egypt acquiring the JF-17 to be lost.|$|E
5|$|Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann: Governor Swann's {{daughter}} and Will's love interest; Swann is {{taken by the}} pirate crew of the Black Pearl. Knightley came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Verbinski; {{he had not seen}} her performance in Bend It Like Beckham and was impressed by her audition.|$|E
5|$|According to plan, the Syrians {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern Golan Heights, {{just south of the}} Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E

5|$|Pre-election public-opinion polls {{had promised}} victory to the communists. Thus the total {{defeat of the}} PZPR and its {{satellite}} parties came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> all involved: {{after the first round}} of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat—all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} not commercially acclaimed, which came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Sire {{since they had}} insisted the band record with Gouldman {{in an effort to}} {{increase}} fan-base; it peaked at number fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and only charted outside of the US in Sweden. The album was not critically acclaimed either, as it received several mixed articles by reviewers, who insisted the album to be less playable than their first four albums.|$|E
5|$|At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, a {{preliminary}} teaser trailer (labeled as TR2N {{and directed by}} Joseph Kosinski) was shown <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> convention guests. It depicted a yellow Program engaged in a light cycle battle with a blue Program, and it prominently featured Jeff Bridges reprising his role as an aged Kevin Flynn (from the first film). At {{the end of the}} trailer, the yellow Program showed his face, which appeared identical to Flynn's earlier program Clu (resembling the younger Flynn in Tron).|$|E

5|$|Following {{his fifth}} Stanley Cup win, with Toronto, the New York Rangers claimed Olmstead in the Intra-League Draft on June 4, 1962. This came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Olmstead, {{who refused to}} report to the team. The Canadiens offered to acquire him from the Rangers, within a month; Olmstead demanded an {{immediate}} trade. Since no deal came, he retired at the age of 35. During his 14-year NHL career, Olmstead scored 181goals and 421assists, for 602points; in the playoffs, he collected 59points, in 115games. In his 14seasons, Olmstead appeared in the Stanley Cup final 11times. He won five times, four of them with the Montreal Canadiens, and once with the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> both Carol and Kogălniceanu, {{who had not been}} informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E

5|$|Scalia took a broad {{view of the}} Eleventh Amendment, which bars certain {{lawsuits}} against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 dissent in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., Scalia stated {{that there was no}} intent {{on the part of the}} framers to have the states surrender any sovereign immunity and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, Chisholm v. Georgia, came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil {{prepared for what}} {{was seen as an}} imminent conflict. PedroII was the main reason for Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|The McLaughlin Planetarium {{was closed}} on November 5, 1995. The {{president}} of the ROM stated that {{the closure of the}} planetarium was due to a combination of falling attendance and a declining interest in space, and that the closure was necessitated by provincial budget cuts. The decision came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> many, as attendance had rebounded in recent years, and the planetarium was one of few in North America at the time that was turning a profit. The closure meant that 40 people lost their jobs.|$|E

500|$|The {{choice of}} Fore River came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{complete}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the European bidders. Britain's reaction {{in particular was}} scathing: Sir John H. Biles, a professor and well-known naval architect, decried the bidding process as [...] "unethical": ...|$|R
5|$|The violin concerto {{stands out}} from {{previous}} concertos with its connected movements. There is no break {{between the first}} and second movements, with a bassoon note held between the two. The bridging passage between the last two movements begins almost immediately after the slow movement. The melody is similar to that of the opening, which hints at the cyclic form of the piece. The linking was designed to eliminate applause between movements. This would have come <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Mendelssohn's audience, who, unlike today's, were used to applauding between movements.|$|E
5|$|This outcome came also <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> {{most of the}} Targowica Confederates, who had wished only {{to restore}} the status quo ante bellum (Commonwealth magnate-favoring Golden Freedoms) and had {{expected}} that {{the overthrow of the}} 3 May Constitution would achieve that end, and nothing more. The last bid to restore the reformed Commonwealth came with the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794. The uprising failed and resulted in the Third Partition in 1795, in which the country lost all its remaining territories and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E

5|$|Kentikian {{successfully}} defended her titles against Sarah Goodson of the Philippines by a {{third round}} technical knockout on February 29, 2008. Goodson, who had fought almost exclusively in lower weight classes before, was overpowered by Kentikian and the referee ended the fight {{after a series of}} body punches in round three. In her next title defense on May 10, 2008, Kentikian beat Mary Ortega from the United States with a first round technical knockout. Ortega, who had previously fought against well-known opponents such as Elena Reid and Hollie Dunaway, was knocked down twice by straight right hands during the first 90seconds of the fight. When Kentikian had Ortega pinned against the ropes again, the referee stepped in shortly before the end of round one. The quick stoppage came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> many, including television commentator Regina Halmich, who had expected a hard-fought bout.|$|E
5|$|Neither the mutiny nor {{the popular}} {{uprising}} came entirely <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the French authorities. The colonial government's first large scale crackdown on the VNQDD in 1929 had substantially damaged the party, which had modelled {{itself on the}} Chinese Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek. The crackdown also {{had the effect of}} increasing the violent tendencies within what remained of the VNQDĐ. Its remaining leadership was now willing to intensify preparations for a violent overthrow of colonial rule to create an independent Vietnamese republic. Most of the party's leadership ranks, but not its lower-ranking members and affiliates, seem to have concluded that they were too weak and too closely spied on by the Sûreté to have a meaningful chance of success. At the most optimistic, they could hope to trigger a spontaneous uprising; at the worst, the subsequent French reprisals would transform them into anti-colonial martyrs. Finally, there was disagreement or a communication problem over the timing of the insurrection: after Hoc had ordered the postponement of the mutiny, Nhu still proceeded.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2007, Odex {{initiated}} {{legal action}} against a third Internet Service Provider, Pacific Internet. Odex sought to have Pacific Internet disclose the personal information of about 1,000 subscribers. The closed-door hearing was held on 23 August 2007 in the Subordinate Courts, where District Judge Earnest Lau ruled that Pacific Internet {{did not have to}} reveal its subscribers' personal information. Lau believed that Odex was not the correct party to make the application, despite having permission to prosecute on behalf of the Japanese anime studios. The decision came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> many, and Odex quickly announced its intent to appeal. Although Lau denied Odex the court order, he warned that the right to privacy was no defence for copyright infringement.|$|E
