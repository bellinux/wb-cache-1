6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} that day, my dear," [...] she said, [...] "when we went furnishing together. And I would have all the wrong things. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My poor dear Lance, is {{this the}} only quiet place you could find? <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> us all neglect you, and never complained!' exclaimed Wilmet, kissing his hot forehead.|$|E

60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. For {{a little}} then: <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me, near <b>you</b> always.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{promise to}} submit {{the point to}} <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> do the yielding. As for me, I shall be adamant. Nothing I like better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Away <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> her go away? You {{let your}} sister {{go away and}} be a--a woman of the town? You never loved her--you never had any pity for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> the {{goldfinch}} {{sing in the}} alder near in spring-- [...] Toll slowly. [...] Let her build her {{nest and}} sit all the three weeks out on it, [...] Murmuring not at anything.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} Bob was quiet. Then he said, [...] "Sometimes I blew in for supper <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me stay and smoke. When you put up the barn, you sent for me to help you raise the logs. The English tenderfoot hadn't located in the valley then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--she {{knew nothing}} till he {{declared}} himself. And to-day, this very morning, she has bade me come to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> know it. <b>And</b> she sent <b>you</b> her love." ...|$|R
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE. I wanted to; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> me. <b>You</b> {{insisted on}} my marrying Roosenhonkers-Pipstein.|$|R
5000|$|... “You don’t {{defend him}} <b>and</b> <b>you</b> don’t <b>let</b> him defend himself!” commented a Mumbai Crime Branch senior.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly, certainly,' said Mr. Stebbing, in {{the tone}} of one {{delivered}} from great alarm. 'I will write at once to my solicitor at Avoncester.' Then turning on his wife, 'How was it that I never heard this before, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me go and make a fool of myself?' ...|$|E
60|$|COLLINS. Why {{should you}} give {{yourself}} the trouble, maam? Send for the greengrocer, maam: thats {{the secret of}} easy housekeeping. Bless you, it's his business. It pays him <b>and</b> <b>you,</b> <b>let</b> alone the pleasure in a house like this [Mrs Bridgenorth bows in acknowledgment of the compliment]. They joke about the greengrocer, just as they joke about the mother-in-law. But they cant get on without both.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was not satisfied. All {{your thought}} was for your sister. You {{did not trust}} Wolf, but you saw Kit trusted you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> him run a risk. So {{long as he was}} not at Las Palmas, the risk did not matter. Wolf was the cheat you thought. When he'd done with Kit he sold him and the others to the French captain." ...|$|E
60|$|CURATE. <b>And</b> <b>you,</b> Charles, <b>let</b> me {{hope your}} {{feelings}} are in solemn congruence with this momentous step.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is too {{delicate}} a matter to--to--I believe I would rather write it or whisper it to <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> decide for yourself whether you want it talked out or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Och--wirra sthrue then, <b>and</b> will <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me go? just listhen to that," [...] {{and another}} angry peal rang out, loud and repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yours! I am {{not talking}} of yours. What {{is to become}} of Mary with such a man as that? and this Spanish woman, who, if she does not deserve all that has been said of her, no doubt soon will?--no education, no principles, {{breaking}} out of her convent! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> yourself be drawn into calling it Mary's duty to run into such company as that! You are not fit to protect her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'll {{agree to}} make phrases like that, right along, {{and get them}} into 'The Round-Robin' somehow, I'll say four thousand," [...] said Fulkerson. [...] "You think it over now, March. You talk it over with Mrs. March; I know you will, anyway; and I might as well make a virtue of advising you to do it. Tell her I advised you to do it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me know before next Saturday what you've decided." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't {{realized}} it--but {{you must}} {{take care of your}} complexion. You're horribly sunburned, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> your hair blow all over your face. It's barbarous not to wear a mask when you ride. Your Pa doesn't look after you properly. I would ask you to stay to the dance to-night if your skin were only white, instead of red. You're old enough to know better, Virginia. Mr. Vance was to have driven out for dinner. Have you seen him, Clarence?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Sputnikmusic {{gave the}} album four stars, {{describing}} Terria as [...] "not a perfect album, but an immense <b>and,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> it be, absorbing one." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You'll {{have to get}} out, Oliver," [...] it said. [...] "Clear out in your sloop {{with the}} folks you have with <b>you</b> <b>and</b> we'll <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go. You're mighty lucky in getting the option." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{your heart}} I feign myself fallen--ah, heavier burden, [...] Darling, of sorrow and pain than ever shall rest there! I take you [...] Into these friendless arms of mine, that you cannot escape me; [...] Closer and closer I fold you, {{and tell you}} all, and you listen [...] Just as you used at home, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> my sobs and my silence [...] Speak, when the words will not come--and you {{understand}} and forgive [...] me. [...] --Ah! no, no! but I write, with the wretched bravado of distance, [...] What you must read unmoved by the pity too far for entreaty.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I am,' said Genevieve, slowly, 'I {{must not}} let you love me on false pretences, dearest Mrs. Kendal. I {{do not think it}} is all for--for his sake--but indeed, though I must esteem Mr. Hope, I do not believe I could ever feel for him as--' then {{breaking}} off. 'I pray you, with all my heart, dearest friend, never to speak to me of marriage. I am the little governess, and while Heaven gives me strength to work for my aunt, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me call this my home, I am content, I am blessed. Oh! do not disturb and unsettle me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A stranger, {{and worse}} than a stranger," [...] the general continued, so pleased with the logical {{perfection}} of his position that he almost smiled, and certainly softened toward Burnamy. [...] "It isn't a question of liking you, Mr. Burnamy, but of knowing you; my daughter likes you; so do the Marches; so does everybody who has met you. I like you myself. You've done me personally a thousand kindnesses. But I know very little of you, in spite of our three months' acquaintance; and that little is--But you shall judge for yourself! You were in the confidential employ {{of a man who}} trusted you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> him betray himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know it would; I want to tell; {{but some}} things even <b>you</b> couldn't forgive; <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> go of me, I'm afraid I can't keep afloat.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You’re a fine sort of shipmaster," [...] exclaimed the indignant Captain Bowers. [...] "First {{you throw}} away your ship, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> <b>let</b> your {{passengers}} shift for themselves." ...|$|R
5000|$|Will {{you fight}} tor Flag, <b>and</b> Freedom, will <b>you</b> <b>let</b> the foeman come? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} there be either dirt or hurt in a well-regulated place?" [...] {{answered}} Touchwood--"Why should not men {{be able to go}} about their affairs at night, in such a hamlet as this, without either endangering necks or noses?--Our Scottish magistrates are worth nothing, sir--nothing at all. Oh for a Turkish Cadi, now, to trounce the scoundrel--or the Mayor of Calcutta to bring him into his court--or were it but an English Justice of the Peace that is newly included in the commission, they would abate the villain's nuisance with a vengeance on him!--But here we are--this is the Cleikum Inn.--Hallo--hilloa--house!--Eppie Anderson!--Beenie Chambermaid!--boy Boots!--Mrs. Dods!--are you all of you asleep and dead?--Here have I been half murdered, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me stand bawling at the door!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a man," [...] {{answered}} Father Brown gravely; [...] "and {{therefore have}} all devils in my heart. Listen to me," [...] {{he said after}} a short pause. [...] "I know what you did--at least, I can guess the great part of it. When you left your brother you were racked with no unrighteous rage, to the extent even that you snatched up a small hammer, half inclined to kill him with his foulness on his mouth. Recoiling, you thrust it under your buttoned coat instead, and rushed into the church. You pray wildly in many places, under the angel window, upon the platform above, and a higher platform still, from which you could see the colonel's Eastern hat like the back of a green beetle crawling about. Then something snapped in your soul, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> God's thunderbolt fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|And Linda, his best-loved daughter, was saying, [...] "I was yours {{ever since}} I can remember. I {{had only to}} think of you for the earth to become empty to my eyes. When you were there, I could see no one else. I was yours. Nothing is changed. The world belongs to you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me live in it." [...] . She dropped her low, {{vibrating}} voice to a still lower note, and found other things to say--torturing for the man at her side. Her murmur ran on ardent and voluble. She {{did not seem to}} see her sister, who came out with an altar-cloth she was embroidering in her hands, and passed in front of them, silent, fresh, fair, with a quick glance and a faint smile, to sit a little away {{on the other side of}} Nostromo.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been down}} to see Mr. Robins this afternoon, Wilbur," [...] she said, pretending to brush some {{invisible}} dust {{from the bottom of}} her nice black cashmere skirt for an excuse to avoid looking at him, [...] "and he's agreed to take you on trial. It's a real good chance--better than you could expect. He says he'll board <b>and</b> clothe <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go to school in the winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God keep you, Gervais," [...] she murmured. [...] "You {{will take}} the safe-conduct, <b>and...</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will <b>let</b> me know when you are safe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} I mean. You are very {{imperious}} in managing your own affairs, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> must <b>let</b> me be so equally in mine." ...|$|R
