5|$|The {{king was}} already {{advanced}} in {{age at the}} time of his death, being over fifty years old, to judge by the incisor teeth, which <b>are</b> <b>worn</b> and corroded by the impurities of which the Egyptian bread was full.

5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and <b>are</b> <b>worn</b> down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E

5|$|Many {{pictures}} {{depict the}} countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include pollarded willows, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes and meadows with streams. A particular {{feature is the}} use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. The muted or bright red coats <b>are</b> <b>worn</b> usually by a small figure, depicted from behind. The paintings generally represent typical villages. Portraits of the Kesslers, and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, are exceptions. A painting of a 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded {{the question of}} whether or not, and to what degree, Heterodontosaurus showed the continuous tooth replacement that is typical for other dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known at that time lacked any indications of continuous tooth replacement: The cheek teeth of the known skulls <b>are</b> <b>worn</b> uniformly, indicating that they formed simultaneously. Newly erupted teeth are absent. Further evidence was derived from the wear facets of the teeth, which were formed by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. The wear facets were merged into one another, forming a continuous surface along the complete tooth row. This surface indicates that food procession was achieved by back and forth movements of the jaws, not by simple vertical movements which was the case in related dinosaurs such as Fabrosaurus. Back and forth movements are only possible if the teeth <b>are</b> <b>worn</b> uniformly, again strengthening the case for the lack of a continuous tooth replacement. Simultaneously, Thulborn stressed that a regular tooth replacement was essential for these animals, as the supposed diet consisting of tough plant material would have led to quick abrasion of the teeth. These observations led Thulborn to conclude that Heterodontosaurus must have replaced its entire set of teeth at once on a regular basis. Such a complete replacement could only have been possible within phases of aestivation, when the animal did not fed. Aestivation also complies with the supposed habitat of the animals, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when food was scarce.|$|E

5|$|The western magpie, G. tibicen dorsalis was {{originally}} {{described as a}} separate species by A. J. Campbell in 1895 and {{is found in the}} fertile south-west corner of Western Australia. The adult male has a white back and most closely resembles subspecies telonocua, though it is a little larger with a longer bill and the black tip of its tail plumage is narrower. The female is unusual in that it has a scalloped black or brownish-black mantle and back; the dark feathers there are edged with white. This area appears a more uniform black as the plumage ages and the edges <b>are</b> <b>worn</b> away. Both sexes have black thighs.|$|E

Very formal occasions require jackets to <b>be</b> <b>worn,</b> whereas less formal occasions do not, and only the waistcoat <b>is</b> <b>worn.</b> On semi-formal occasions, the jacket <b>is</b> not <b>worn,</b> but a long-sleeved shirt <b>is</b> <b>worn</b> under the waistcoat.

5|$|Inland batik or batik kraton (Javanese court batik) is {{the oldest}} form of batik {{tradition}} known in Java. Inland batik has earthy colour such as black, indigo, brown, and sogan (brown-yellow colour made from the tree Peltophorum pterocarpum), sometimes against a white background, with symbolic patterns that are mostly free from outside influence. Certain patterns are reserved for royalty, while other <b>are</b> <b>worn</b> on specific occasions. At a Javanese wedding for example, the bride wears specific patterns at each stage of the ceremony. Noted inland batiks are produced in Solo and Jogjakarta, cities traditionally regarded as the centre of Javanese culture. Batik Solo typically has sogan background and is preserved by the Susuhunan and Mangkunegaran Court. Batik Jogja typically has white background and is preserved by the Yogyakarta Sultanate and Pakualaman Court.|$|E
5|$|The Sable Island {{horses are}} a feral horse {{population}} that is entirely unmanaged: they {{are not subject to}} any kind of interference. Observational research, which is considered noninvasive to the herd, has been conducted by various entities over several decades. The population in recent years (2009 and onward) has varied between 400 and 550 animals. Due to the lack of predators, older horses often die of starvation after their teeth <b>are</b> <b>worn</b> down by a lifetime of exposure to sand and marram, a tough grass. A lack of nutritional food on the island limits the horses' size, and the offspring of those removed from the island and raised on better diets are significantly larger.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} <b>are</b> <b>worn.</b> Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E
