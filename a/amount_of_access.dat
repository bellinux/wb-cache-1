30|$|The federated set-up between tenant and {{provider}} poses important challenges. While {{techniques for}} federated authentication[5, 6] allow user {{data to be}} securely shared between tenant and provider, the provider still completely evaluates the tenant policies. This approach causes two main problems: (i) it forces the tenant to disclose sensitive access control data, such as lists of patients being treated by a physician. Although the tenant may trust the provider with the data in the SaaS application, {{it does not necessarily}} trust the provider with this sensitive on-premise application data and wants to keep it confidential. Moreover, stringent regulatory requirements such as HIPAA[7] or the European DPD[8] even forbid the hospital to share this data. (ii) This approach limits policy evaluation performance by having to fetch the required data. Many <b>of</b> the <b>access</b> control policies require large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> control data and fetching this data from the tenant takes a considerable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} recent {{findings}} regarding diversity queries over objects {{embedded in a}} low-dimensional vector space. Among the many contexts of interest, we mention spatial Web objects, which are abundant in location-based services that let users attach content to places. Typical queries aim at retrieving the best set of relevant objects that are well distributed over a region of interest. Existing methods for answering diversified top-k queries are too costly, as they evaluate diversity by accessing and scanning all relevant objects, even if only a small subset thereof is needed. Our proposal, named SPP, is an algorithm that, while finding exactly the same result as MMR (one {{of the most popular}} diversification algorithms), does not require retrieving all the relevant objects and, indeed, minimizes the number <b>of</b> <b>accessed</b> objects.

40|$|Given {{the scale}} of today's {{distributed}} storage systems, the failure of an individual node is a common phenomenon. Various metrics have been proposed to measure {{the efficacy of the}} repair of a failed node, such as the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> data download needed to repair (also known as the repair bandwidth), the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> data <b>accessed</b> at the helper nodes, and the number of helper nodes contacted. Clearly, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> data <b>accessed</b> can never be smaller than the repair bandwidth. In the case of a help-by-transfer code, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> data <b>accessed</b> is equal to the repair bandwidth. It follows that a help-by-transfer code possessing optimal repair bandwidth is access optimal. The focus of the present paper is on help-by-transfer codes that employ minimum possible bandwidth to repair the systematic nodes and are thus access optimal for the repair of a systematic node. The zigzag construction by Tamo et al. in which both systematic and parity nodes are repaired is access optimal. But the sub-packetization level required is $r^k$ where $r$ is the number of parities and $k$ is the number of systematic nodes. To date, the best known achievable sub-packetization level for access-optimal codes is $r^{k/r}$ in a MISER-code-based construction by Cadambe et al. in which only the systematic nodes are repaired and where the location of symbols transmitted by a helper node depends only on the failed node and is the same for all helper nodes. Under this set-up, it turns out that this sub-packetization level cannot be improved upon. In the present paper, we present an alternate construction under the same setup, of an access-optimal code repairing systematic nodes, that is inspired by the zigzag code construction and that also achieves a sub-packetization level of $r^{k/r}$.

50|$|Socioeconomic {{status is}} both a strong {{predictor}} of mental health status and a key predictor of mental health inequalities across populations. Socioeconomic status and mental health problems have an inverse relationship, as socioeconomic status decreases, mental health problems increase. It seems clear how the stressors associated with poverty and low socioeconomic status, can compromise an individual's ability to maintain a positive sense of well-being {{and the absence of}} mental health problems. Data shows that the effects are strongest for children, but effects reach adults and adolescents as well. Socioeconomic status is not only a predictor of development of mental health problems but also an important determinant of access to positive and proper mental health care and resources. Utilizing proper resources to maintain positive mental health is not only costly and therefore unaffordable for specific populations, but the resources are also not properly distributed between regions and communities. Communities living in the deepest poverty have the highest need for mental health resources, but have the least <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to them. Access means many things in this case, including the physical presence of resources, the legitimacy of resources, the affordability of resources if they exist, ability to get to such resources (i.e. transportation), and level of comfort reaching out to resources due to stigmas. For example, in terms of legitimacy, in a poor community, there may be an affordable mental health care provider that the community has access to but that care provider may not provide proper mental health services.|$|E
