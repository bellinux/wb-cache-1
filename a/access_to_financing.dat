25|$|Historically, the Nigerian Power Sector {{has been}} plagued by blackouts. Economists {{estimate}} that power outages have cost Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, billions of dollars in imported diesel for generators and lost output. In a study conducted by the World Bank, a lack of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> and electricity were cited as Nigeria's main obstacles to development, surpassing corruption. President Jonathan has overseen the privatisation of Nigeria's power sector with the end goal being the establishment of an efficient and reliable power supply infrastructure for the Nigerian population. The Power Holding Company of Nigeria, which acted as the nation's electricity provider, has been broken up into 15 firms, with Nigeria handing over control of state electricity assets to 15 private bidding companies. The Nigerian government contracted for the services of CPCS Transcom Limited, a Canada-based consulting firm specialising in transportation and energy infrastructure projects, to act as the transaction adviser for the handover of state electricity assets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> is {{essential}} for a successful development and growth of the private sector. In the absence of finance, enterprises cannot develop, innovate, and compete with other firms in other countries which offer more favorable <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance.</b> This paper makes use of the Enterprise Survey conducted with a representative stratified random sample of 6, 006 Turkish firms for the 2015 fiscal year <b>to</b> evaluate the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> conditions in the nation. Moreover, data from the Enterprise Surveys Database for a comparison group of countries and 2013 survey for Turkey are employed to put the current survey in perspective. Keywords.

30|$|<b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> in {{the model}} was {{specified}} as categorical variable where “very severe obstacle” category {{was used as the}} reference. As shown in Table 1, the estimated coefficients for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> dummy variables were found to be positive and statistically significant at 5 % level when the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> was “not an obstacle”, “moderate obstacle” and “major obstacle”. The marginal effects were found to be 0.01, 0.018 and 0.008, respectively and were statistically significant at 5 % level. With the dummy variable “minor obstacle” the coefficient was found to be positive with marginal effect of 0.008 but statistically significant at 10 % level of significance. The overall implication of the finding on <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> was that, holding other factors constant, MSE decision to innovate was constrained by the MSEs’ varying levels of as <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance.</b> Thus based on the estimation results presented in Table 1, reducing the severity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> from “very severe obstacle” level to “not an obstacle” level increases the probability that the MSE would innovate by 1.0259 %. This finding resonates with the study findings by Ayyagari, et al., (2007); Gebreeysus (2009) and Kiraka, et al., (2013) that found <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> a statistically significant determinant of the decision by an MSE to engage innovation.|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to further}} our {{understanding}} of channels through which <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> impacts innovation. Particularly, we focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as a potentially significant channel. SMEs {{are expected to be}} especially sensitive <b>to</b> changes in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> due <b>to</b> limited <b>financing</b> options compared <b>to</b> large enterprises. Hence, we hypothesize that incremental improvements in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> can stimulate SMEs to increase innovative activities all else equal. In order to test our hypothesis we use micro level data on European SMEs with an observable propensity to innovate displayed by their output of inventions. We assume that a higher output of inventions is strongly associated with higher innovativeness of the firm. We use data on SME patenting activities as a measure of invention output and a European Commission <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Finance</b> Index (SMAF) as the main measure of SME <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance.</b> Our results indicate that changes in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> are expected <b>to</b> translate into a higher innovative output by EU SMEs after three years.

We use data for 10, 888 firms across 30 African countries and the results using the subjective measure show that the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> constraint exerts a significant negative effect on firm growth.
