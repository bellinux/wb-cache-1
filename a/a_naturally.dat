5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular diagnostics {{has become more}} important, so has the debate about patenting of the genetic discoveries at its heart. In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with breast cancer. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that <b>a</b> <b>naturally</b> occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E
5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. <b>A</b> <b>naturally</b> occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E

5000|$|UNS C69100, {{also known}} as Tungum alloy, CW700R and CZ127, is a bronze copper alloy. It has <b>an</b> <b>naturally</b> {{occurring}} oxide layer, which on exposure to reagents develops into a very thin protective coating. Tungum resists both pitting and crevice corrosion in marine environments/atmospheres. This offers excellent service-life, even at intermittent duty in the corrosive [...] "splash" [...] zone.|$|R
5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is <b>a</b> <b>naturally</b> occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, it was {{determined}} that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is <b>a</b> <b>naturally</b> occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E
5|$|Jacobs are {{typically}} hardy, low-maintenance animals with <b>a</b> <b>naturally</b> high resistance to parasites and hoof problems. Jacobs {{do not show}} much flocking behaviour. They can be skittish if not used to people, although with daily handling they will become tame and make good pets. They require shelter from extreme temperatures, but the shelter can be open and simple. They tend to thrive in extremes of heat and cold and have good or excellent foraging capabilities. They can secure adequate nutrition with minimal to no supplementation, even {{in the presence of}} suboptimal soil conditions.|$|E

5|$|Many number systems, {{such as the}} {{integers}} and the rationals enjoy <b>a</b> <b>naturally</b> given group structure. In some cases, such as {{with the}} rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.|$|E
5|$|McLean's favoured {{position}} is {{as a central}} midfielder, but he can also play as a left midfielder. He {{has said that he}} favours playing in the centre because he can get more of the ball and influence play more than when he is on the left. He is <b>a</b> <b>naturally</b> attacking player and when playing in the centre he makes runs to and beyond the striker which adds an extra dimension to his team's play.|$|E
5|$|Submarine springs found {{along the}} coast of Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula produce water with <b>a</b> <b>naturally</b> low pH (relatively high acidity) {{providing}} conditions similar to those expected to become widespread as the oceans absorb carbon dioxide. Surveys discovered multiple species of live coral that appeared to tolerate the acidity. The colonies were small and patchily distributed, and had not formed structurally complex reefs such as those that compose the nearby Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperial}} pheasant {{is a rare}} bird found in the forests of Vietnam and Laos.
