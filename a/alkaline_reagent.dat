40|$|The {{reduction}} of interfacial tension between acidic oils and floodwater {{is one of}} the most important mechanisms of improved oil recovery. The predominant oil recovery techniques are micellar and alkaline flooding. In such processes, surfactant is adsorbed at the oil-water interface and thus reduces the interfacial tension creating conditions for oil mobilization a displacement. In the micellar process, commercial surfactants are injected along with the aqueous phase, while in the alkaline process surfactants are produced in situ by a reaction between acids in the oil and the injected <b>alkaline</b> <b>reagents.</b> A precise and accurate method for monitoring and measuring both equilibrium and transient interfacial tension is required to help to develop an understanding of the mechanisms that govern the interactions of acidic oils with <b>alkaline</b> <b>reagents.</b> For this purpose, an apparatus has been set up based upon the drop shape method for the determination of surface and interfacial tension. An interfacial activity model has been proposed to predict the equilibrium interfacial tension behavior of acidic oil/surfactant enhanced alkaline systems. The model accounts for a mixed interfacial layer and mixed micelle formation by the un-ionized acid, ionized acid and added surfactant. A mass action model is adopted for the formation of micelles in conjunction with an empirical relationship for the change in the critical micelle concentration. The agreement between model predictions and experiments is satisfactory and confirms the mechanisms proposed. For the acidic oil/alkali system, it has been found that un-ionized acid adsorbs onto the interface along with ionized acid resulting in lower interfacial tension, but fails to produce ultra low values because the ionic strength is not constant as the pH varies. Also it has been found that the acid lowers the interfacial tension of the oil/added surfactant systems by simultaneously adsorbing onto the interface, and reducing the critical micelle concentration of the added surfactant. A mechanistic interpretation of the transient interfacial tension behavior arising from the interactions between acidic oil and surfactant-alkaline systems is developed. A physico-chemical model based on Nernstian theory of convective diffusion, Langmuirian theory of interfacial sorption kinetics, and electrical interfacial phenomena has been invoked to account for the transient nature of the interfacial tension. The results show that the interfacial tension arising from the interaction of these chemical combinations with model acidic oil exhibits a marked transient behavior. The magnitude of interfacial tension variations changes not only with alkali concentration but also with surfactant concentration. The pertinent sorptive rate constants that characterize transient behavior are precisely estimated by correlating experimental interfacial tension data with the proposed model. A very good overall agreement is obtained between the experimental values and those predicted by the model. A better model of the interactions between acidic oil and alkaline solutions has been developed. The improvement is mainly related to an enhanced measurement technique, modification of the adsorption isotherms as well as the kinetic equations. These changes allow for the co-adsorption of the un-ionized acid along with the ionized acid at the interface. The extension of the acidic oil/alkaline model to incorporate an additional pre-formed surfactant is also accomplished by a modification of the adsorption isotherms, of the micellar relationship and of the resulting equilibria.

40|$|In this work, {{citric acid}} {{production}} by Yarrowia lipolytica ATCC 20346 was studied in a laboratory-scale Membrane Recycle Bioreactor {{composed of a}} stirred fermenter coupled to a flat-membrane cross-flow microfiltration (CFMF) unit. By {{increasing the number of}} production cycles, citrate productivity (R-p) tended to reduce {{in spite of the fact}} that the production medium had been integrated with vitamins, whereas the yield factor for citric acid production on glucose was found to be approximately constant. By operating with partial cell discharge (when using either the production media enriched with amounts of nitrogen and essential nutrients equivalent to the mass of cells disposed of, or the growth medium), it was possible to obtain the expected microbial biomass with no or very limited citrate excretion. To minimise the contribution of the cell growth phase to the overall citrate productivity and yield on glucose, it would be convenient to subdivide the process into the following stages: growth phase, yeast recovery by CFMF; Ist prolunged fed-batch production using a pi-I-controller as an indirect feedback of simultaneous substrate and <b>alkaline</b> <b>reagent</b> feeding; yeast recovery by CFMF; 2 nd prolunged fed-batch production...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{treatment}} {{systems are}} being employed increasingly to treat acid mine drainage. Nevertheless, conventional calcite- or organic matter-based systems {{are prone to}} clogging and passivation (loss of permeability or reactivity) when treating high metal concentrations, and do not remove satisfactorily divalent metals such as Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb, etc. In the present study, a novel “Dispersed Alkaline Substrate ” (DAS) consisting of a fine-grained <b>alkaline</b> <b>reagent</b> (calcite or MgO) mixed with a coarse inert matrix (wood chips) was used to treat waters with high metal concentrations. The coarse inert matrix of DAS ensures a high permeability of the bulk substrate, while the small alkaline grains can react almost completely before the growing layer of precipitates impedes further dissolution. Calcite sand was used in calcite-DAS to remove Al, Fe(III), Cu and Pb almost completely from AMD with pH ≈ 3 and mean net acidity of 1500 mg/L as CaCO 3. Caustic magnesia (MgO) dust was used in MgO-DAS to deplete 300 mg/L Zn and 30 mg/L Mn to below ICP-AES detection limit. Depth profiles of chemical parameters and hydraulic conductivity were regularly measured in laboratory column studies during over one year. The experiments show that DAS combines high reactivity, good hydraulic performance and maximum durability of the alkaline reagents...|$|E
40|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD) {{generated by}} some coal mines in New Zealand is currently {{treated by the}} addition of <b>alkaline</b> <b>reagents</b> which neutralize acidity, triggering the precipitation of dissolved metals as insoluble hydroxides. Some trace metals (Ni, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb) are discharged into receiving water bodies due to incomplete hydroxide precipitation at circum-neutral pH. This study investigated the incorporation of lignite-derived humic substances (HS) for metal complexation and removal during AMD treatment by Ca(OH) 2 and CaCO 3 neutralization. For Ca(OH) 2 neutralization, addition of HS (regardless of dosing sequence) enhanced the removal of Zn, Cu, and Cd, probably due to the incorporation of metal-humate complex into settling flocs (via aggregation, co-precipitation, and adsorption) that were subsequently removed by sedimentation. However, additional removal of Ni and Pb was statistically indeterminate, which was ascribed to the low complexation affinity of Ni and high removal of Pb by adsorption onto Fe/Al hydroxides. Conversely, for CaCO 3 neutralization, addition of HS only marginally enhanced Cd removal, with the removal of metals probably dominated by adsorption onto the abundant undissolved calcite. Equilibrium speciation modelling showed that about 25 % and 38 % of the remaining Cu and Pb in the treated AMD were complexed with HS, while only 5 % of remaining Cd and less than 1 wt% of remaining Ni and Zn were organically complexed. In the AMD-receiving water bodies, about 20 mg l- 1 of HS would be required for complete complexation (> 95 %) of Cu and Pb and 50 mg l- 1 for Cd, whereas Zn and Ni complexation would not occur at natural stream HS concentrations.

40|$|The {{proportions}} {{and absolute}} numbers of different lymphocyte populations were determined using <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase-labelled <b>reagents</b> {{in the whole}} peripheral blood of 22 patients with Crohn's disease. Monoclonal mouse anti-T cell antibody (OKT 3) was used to identify T cells, polyvalent F(ab') 2 anti-human immunoglobulin for B cells, C 3 b for C 3 b-receptor bearing cells, and soluble IgG antibody-antigen complexes for Fc(gamma) -receptor bearing cells. Endogenous myeloperoxidase served to distinguish monocytes. Application of this methodology to whole blood avoids the inevitable loss of cells which accompanies separation of mononuclear cells from blood and therefore permits precise enumeration of lymphocyte populations in the circulation. No significant difference from healthy adult controls was observed {{in any of the}} lymphocyte subsets tested...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken with two objectives in view, firstly, {{to study the}} possibility of transforming diacylamides into N-halogen derivatives by the interaction with <b>alkaline</b> potassium hypobromite <b>reagent,</b> and secondly, to investigate {{the transformation of the}} cyclic imides into β-amino acids in the Hofmann rearrangement reaction. Since the latter reaction may involve the formation of N-halogen compounds as intermediates, it seemed desirable to prepare several of the unknown N-halogen derivatives or the cyclic imides...|$|R
