25|$|On August 14, 2009, the Decemberists {{played in}} Pittsburgh, PA at the Benedum Center. During the show, {{the band members}} {{performed}} a skit where they ran up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> participating in a fictitious battle at Fort Pitt.|$|E
25|$|Women {{also were}} working on the platform, distributing the basics of fruit, matches, and candy bars for those who were unable to go inside. One of their most {{important}} jobs were to answer questions, including those surrounding the canteen and the basics of the North Platte and Nebraska. Another important job was to tend to those on the hospital trains who were unable to enter the building. The men on the trains were naturally treated the same as those who went inside. Magazines, religious literature, and decks of cards were also distributed to the servicemen on the trains. If they were unable to disembark from the cars, women would walk up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> distributing goods or hand up materials from the ground to the windows.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the film}} was finished, a showing was planned at the Museum of Modern Art. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) {{surrounded}} the building, in a protest led by Elaine Parker. Gregg Kilday of the Los Angeles Times interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that [...] "About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They walked up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and were very belligerent. In my estimation they were determined not to like the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental {{to the image of}} blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. [...] "It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art." ...|$|E
5000|$|In November 1906, {{immediately}} {{after her husband}} received word that he was finally deposed, he went into St. Andrew's church and walked up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> [...] "mourning <b>the</b> death of his ministerial life." [...] Mrs. Crapsey came over from the rectory and kissed him.|$|R
60|$|THE CALIFORNIAN (issuing {{from his}} berth, and walking up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> as before, till quiet is restored). I haven't got any sister, and my name ain't Willis, and it ain't Campbell. I'm very sorry, because I'd like to oblige you any way I could.|$|R
60|$|Clive {{returned}} to the chapel by the little door near to the Vestiarium. All the congregation had poured out by this time. Only two ladies were standing near the pulpit; and Sherrick, with his hands rattling his money in his pockets, was pacing up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|R
2500|$|From December 26 to December 31, 1969, Weatherman {{held the}} last of its National Council {{meetings}} in Flint, Michigan. Flying to the event, Dohrn and Jacobs ran up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> of the airplane, seizing food, frightening the passengers. The meeting, dubbed the [...] "War Council" [...] by the 400 people who attended, adopted Jacobs' call for violent revolution. Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the [...] "armed struggle." [...] Reminding the delegates {{of the murder of}} Sharon Tate and four others on August 9, 1969 by members of the Manson Family. [...] "Dig it," [...] Dohrn said approvingly. [...] "First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner {{in the same room with}} them, they even shoved a fork into a victim’s stomach! Wild!" [...] She then held up three fingers in what she called the [...] "Manson fork salute." [...] Over the next five days, the participants met in informal, random groups to discuss what [...] "going underground" [...] meant, how best to organize collectives, and justifications for violence. In the evening, the groups reconvened for a mass [...] "wargasm"—practicing karate, engaging in physical exercise, singing songs, and listening to speeches. The [...] "War Council" [...] ended with a major speech by John Jacobs. J.J. condemned the [...] "pacifism" [...] of white middle-class American youth, a belief which they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor. He predicted a successful revolution, and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high-energy culture of [...] "repersonalization" [...] brought about by drugs, sex, and armed revolution. [...] "We're against everything that's 'good and decent' in honky America," [...] Jacobs said in his most oft-quoted statement. [...] "We will burn and loot and destroy. We are the incubation of your mother's nightmare." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE curtain rises, {{disclosing}} the ushers of {{the theater}} still moving up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> Cries of [...] "Program!" [...] "Program!" [...] are heard. There is a buzz of brilliant conversation, illuminated with flashes of opera glasses and the rattle of expensive jewelry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, anyway, I {{belong to}} the round church," [...] said Peg comfortably, [...] "and so the devil can't catch ME at the corners. I haven't been to Carlisle church for over three years. I thought I'd a-died {{laughing}} the last time I was there. Old Elder Marr took up the collection that day. He'd {{on a pair of}} new boots and they squeaked all the way up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> And every time the boots squeaked the elder made a face, like he had toothache. It was awful funny. How's your missionary quilt coming on, Cecily?" ...|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{report of}} a black dog was in France in AD 856, when one was said to materialise in a church even though the doors were shut. The church grew dark as it padded up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> as if looking for someone. The dog then vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.|$|R
5000|$|Aloha Airlines Flight 243 {{suffered}} a decompression which tore an 18 ft section of fuselage {{away from the}} plane. The only fatality was flight attendant C.B. Lansing who was blown out of the airplane. Flight attendant Michelle Honda was thrown violently to the floor during the decompression but, despite her injuries, crawled up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> reassuring passengers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! well!" [...] {{cried the}} {{commercial}} drummer. [...] "To be sure I met that fellow. The way I noticed him {{was because he}} acted so queer. He didn't want to sit still, but kept walking up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> from one car to another. I saw the conductor talk to him once or twice, too." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{they went}} out, {{and finding the}} verger at the Cathedral door, he being a great friend of Miss Stanbury's, they walked up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> and Dorothy was {{instructed}} as to what would be expected from her {{in regard to the}} outward forms of religion. She was to go to the Cathedral service on the morning of every week-day, and on Sundays in the afternoon. On Sunday mornings she was to attend the little church of St. Margaret. On Sunday evenings it was the practice of Miss Stanbury to read a sermon in the dining-room to all of whom her household consisted. Did Dorothy like daily services? Dorothy, who was more patient than her brother, and whose life had been much less energetic, said that she had no objection to going to church every day when there was not too much to do.|$|E
60|$|The legend now {{crosses the}} Atlantic, and {{comes down to}} our own {{immediate}} time. In a certain church of our city, not many evenings ago, there was a contribution for a charitable object. A fervid preacher had poured out his whole soul in a rich and tender discourse, which had at least excited the tears, and perhaps the more effectual sympathy, of a numerous audience. While the choristers sang sweetly, and the organ poured forth its melodious thunder, the deacons passed up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> and along the galleries, presenting their mahogany boxes, in which each person deposited whatever sum he deemed it safe to lend to the Lord, in aid of human wretchedness. Charity became audible,--chink, chink, chink,--as it fell, drop by drop, into the common receptacle. There was a hum,--a stir,--the subdued bustle of people putting their hands into their pockets; while, ever and anon, a vagrant coin fell upon the floor, and rolled away, with long reverberation, into some inscrutable corner.|$|E
60|$|March {{spent the}} rainy Sunday, {{on which they}} had fallen, in {{wandering}} about the little city alone. His wife said she was tired and would sit by the fire, and hear about Mayence when he came in. He went to the cathedral, which has its renown for beauty and antiquity, and he there added to his stock of useful information {{the fact that the}} people of Mayence seemed very Catholic and very devout. They proved it by preferring to any of the divine old Gothic shrines in the cathedral, an ugly baroque altar, which was everywhere hung about with votive offerings. A fashionably dressed young man and young girl sprinkled themselves with holy water as reverently {{as if they had been}} old and ragged. Some tourists strolled up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> with their red guide-books, and studied the objects of interest. A resplendent beadle in a cocked hat, and with along staff of authority posed before his own ecclesiastical consciousness in blue and silver. At the high altar a priest was saying mass, and March wondered whether his consciousness was as wholly ecclesiastical as the beadle's, or whether somewhere in it he felt the historical majesty, the long human consecration of the place.|$|E

60|$|Next came rumours {{that even}} the Nunnery itself was haunted, {{especially}} the chapel. Here voices were heard talking, and Emlyn Stower, who was praying there, came out vowing {{that she had seen}} a ball of fire which rolled up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> centre of it a man's head, that seemed to try to talk to her, but could not.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, all Paris {{was busy with}} {{preparations}} for the marriage. The Louvre is upon {{one side of the}} River Seine, its principal front being toward the river, with a broad street between. There are no buildings, but only a parapet wall on the river side of the street, so that there is a fine view of the river and of the bridges which cross it, from the palace windows. Nearly opposite the Louvre is an island, covered with edifices, and connected, by means of bridges, with either shore. The great church of Notre Dame, where the marriage ceremony was to be performed, is upon this island. It has two enormous square towers in front, which may be seen, rising above all the roofs of the city, at a great distance in every direction. Before the church is a large open area, where vast crowds assemble on any great occasion. The interior of the church impresses the mind with the sublimest emotions. Two rows of enormous columns rise to a great height on either hand, supporting the lofty arches of the roof. The floor is paved with great flat stones, and resounds continually with the footsteps of visitors, who walk to and fro, up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> looking at the chapels, the monuments, the sculptures, the paintings, and the antique and grotesque images and carvings. Colored light streams through the stained glass of the enormous windows, and the tones of the organ, and the voices of the priests, chanting the service of the mass, are almost always resounding and echoing from the vaulted roof above.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] the {{stranger}} assented. [...] "Then I didn't {{know what to}} do, for a minute. The porter was a pretty thick-headed darky, but he was lion-hearted; and his idea was to lay hold of a burglar wherever he could find him. There were plenty of burglars in the aisle there, or people that were afraid of burglars, {{and they seemed to}} think the porter had a good idea. They had hold of one another already, and now began to pull up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> in a way that reminded me of the old-fashioned mesmeric lecturers, when they told their subjects that they were this or that, and set them to acting the part. I remembered how once when the mesmerist gave out that they were at a horse--race, and his subjects all got astride of their chairs, and galloped up and down the hall like a lot of little boys on laths. I thought of that now, and although it was rather a serious business, for I didn't know what minute they would come to blows, I couldn't help laughing. The sight was weird enough. Every one looked like a somnambulist as he pulled and hauled. The young lady in the stateroom was doing her full share. She was screaming, 'Won't somebody let me out?' and hammering on the door. I guess it was her screaming and hammering that brought the conductor at last, or maybe he just came round in the course of nature to take up the tickets. It was before the time when they took the tickets at the gate, and you used to stick them into a little slot at the side of your berth, and the conductor came along and took them in the night, somewhere between Worcester and Springfield, I should say." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{returned}} to the drawing-room I found the company seated round the fire listening to the parson, who was deeply ensconced in a high-backed oaken chair, the work of some cunning artificer of yore, which had been brought from the library for his particular accommodation. From this venerable piece of furniture, with which his shadowy figure and dark weazen face so admirably accorded, he was dealing out strange accounts of the popular superstitions and legends of the surrounding country, with which he had become acquainted {{in the course of}} his antiquarian researches. I am half inclined to think that the old gentleman was himself somewhat tinctured with superstition, as men are very apt to be who live a recluse and studious life in a sequestered part of the country and pore over black-letter tracts, so often filled with the marvelous and supernatural. He gave us several anecdotes of the fancies of the neighboring peasantry concerning the effigy of the crusader which lay on the tomb by the church altar. As it was the only monument of the kind in that part of the country, it had always been regarded with feelings of superstition by the good wives of the village. It was said to get up from the tomb and walk the rounds of the churchyard in stormy nights, particularly when it thundered; and one old woman, whose cottage bordered on the churchyard, had seen it through the windows of the church, when the moon shone, slowly pacing up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> It was the belief that some wrong had been left unredressed by the deceased, or some treasure hidden, which kept the spirit in a state of trouble and restlessness. Some talked of gold and jewels buried in the tomb, over which the spectre kept watch; and there was a story current of a sexton in old times who endeavored to break his way to the coffin at night, but just as he reached it received a violent blow from the marble hand of the effigy, which stretched him senseless on the pavement. These tales were often laughed at by some of the sturdier among the rustics, yet when night came on there were many of the stoutest unbelievers that were shy of venturing alone in the footpath that led across the churchyard.|$|E
2500|$|Malley's brought its {{bird cage}} {{along to the}} second location. [...] A former shopper wrote about the store's features: [...] "Toys, Santa, Candy, a Soda Fountain, Fur Salon, Beauty Salon, Bridal Registry, but most importantly, on the 2nd floor, by the blue elevators, across from <b>the</b> Photo Studio <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> from <b>the</b> Restaurant, in the Children's Shoe {{department}} was a big beautiful bird cage, about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide." ...|$|R
5000|$|He said, [...] "Everybody has a club or an {{association}} or some kind—lumber jacks, undertakers, rug weavers, even garbage collectors—so I don’t {{see why we}} can’t have one, too." [...] All during the flight, Rube kept saying, [...] "No—leave us alone; we’re doing fine." [...] C.D. {{turned to me and}} he said, [...] "And no girls. Only boys." [...] And he went up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> of <b>the</b> plane, repeating that this club would be just for boys.|$|R

From these and other anecdotes that followed, the crusader appeared to be the favourite hero of ghost stories throughout the vicinity. His picture, which hung up in the hall, was thought by the servants to have something supernatural about it; for they remarked that, in whatever part of the hall you went, the eyes of the warrior were still fixed on you. The old porter's wife, too, at the lodge, who had been born and brought up in the family, and was a great gossip among the maid servants, affirmed that in her young days she had often heard say that on Midsummer eve, when it is well known all kinds of ghosts, goblins, and fairies become visible and walk abroad, the crusader used to mount his horse, come down from his picture, ride about the house, down the avenue, and so to the church to visit the tomb; on which occasion the church door most civilly swung open of itself: not that he needed it; for he rode through closed gates and even stone walls, and had been seen by one of the dairymaids to pass between two bars of the great park gate, making himself as thin as a sheet of paper.|$|E
60|$|For now it {{came into}} my mind that I could not very well settle there {{for the rest of}} my life; I could not, in fact, tie myself to any place without sacrificing certain other {{advantages}} I possessed; and the main thing was that by taking root I should deprive myself of the chance of looking on still other beautiful scenes and experiencing other sweet surprises. I was wishing that I had come a little earlier on the scene to have had time to borrow the key of the church and get a sight of the interior, when all at once I heard a shrill voice and a boy appeared running across the wide green space of the churchyard. A second boy followed, then another, then still others, and I saw that they were going into the church by the side door. They were choir-boys going to practice. The church was open then, and late as it was I could have half an hour inside before it was dark! The stream was spanned by an old stone bridge above the ford, and going over it I at once made my way to the great building, but even before entering it I discovered that it possessed an organ of extraordinary power and that someone was performing on it with a vengeance. Inside the noise was tremendous--a bigger noise from an organ, it seemed to me, than I had ever heard before, even at the Albert Hall and the Crystal Palace, but even more astonishing than the uproar was the sight that met my eyes. The boys, nine or ten sturdy little rustics with round sunburnt West Country faces, were playing the roughest game ever witnessed in a church. Some were engaged in a sort of flying fight, madly pursuing one another up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and over the pews, and whenever one overtook another he would seize hold of him and they would struggle together until one was thrown and received a vigorous pommelling. Those who were not fighting were dancing to the music. It was great fun to them, and they were shouting and laughing their loudest only not a sound of it all could be heard on account of the thunderous roar of the organ which filled and seemed to make the whole building tremble. The boys took no notice of me, and seeing that there was a singularly fine west window, I went to it and stood there some time with my back to the game which was going on at the other end of the building, admiring the beautiful colours and trying to make out the subjects depicted. In the centre part, lit by the after-glow in the sky to a wonderful brilliance, was the figure of a saint, a lovely young woman in a blue robe with an abundance of loose golden-red hair and an aureole about her head. Her pale face wore a sweet and placid expression, and her eyes of a pure forget-me-not blue were looking straight into mine. As I stood there the music, or noise, ceased and a very profound silence followed--not a giggle, not a whisper from the outrageous young barbarians, and not a sound of the organist or of anyone speaking to them. Presently I became conscious of some person standing almost but not quite abreast of me, and turning sharply I found a clergyman at my side. He was the vicar, the person who had been letting himself go on the organ; a slight man with a handsome, pale, ascetic face, clean-shaven, very dark-eyed, looking more like an Italian monk or priest than an English clergyman. But although rigidly ecclesiastic in his appearance and dress, there was something curiously engaging in him, along with a subtle look which it was not easy to fathom. There was a light in his dark eyes which reminded me of a flame seen through a smoked glass or a thin black veil, and a slight restless movement about the corners of his mouth as if a smile was just on the point of breaking out. But it never quite came; he kept his gravity even when he said things which would have gone very well with a smile.|$|E

60|$|For the teacher's {{last call}} {{had been in}} October and had been occasioned {{by the fact that}} the irrepressible Teddy would persist in going to school with his pockets filled with live crickets and in driving them {{harnessed}} to strings up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> when <b>the</b> teacher's back was turned.

50|$|A {{witness to}} the attacks, {{journalist}} Carey McWilliams wrote,Marching {{through the streets of}} downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find.

On the second chorus, the scenery changed completely, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> came Scottish Pipers.
