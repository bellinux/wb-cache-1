25|$|A second {{consideration}} is the rotational energy {{stored in the}} wheels. The pinewood derby car converts gravitational potential energy into translational kinetic energy (speed) plus rotational energy.

2500|$|At 6:28a.m., {{two minutes}} {{ahead of the}} time set as H-Hour, Schroeder's unit {{was in the first}} wave of 20LCVPs to {{disembark}} on Utah Beach. Schroeder's own assault boat, commanded by navy Lieutenant (j.g.) Abraham Condiotti of Brooklyn, New York, was the first to hit the beach. In his boat were 32men, including Brigadier General Roosevelt. He recalled to a television interviewer in 2008 that [...] "80percent of the guys on the boat were sick" [...] due to the rough seas and, as his landing craft in the first wave neared the shore, Allied forces were still shelling Company F's designated landing site on Utah Beach.

[...] He held his [...]45-caliber pistol above the waist-high water as he waded the final [...] from his landing craft to the beach. In the lead landing craft, he covered the remaining distance as quickly as possible due to enemy fire. The soldiers encountered machine gun fire from German pillboxes and artillery shelling, underwater mines, barbed wire, and trenches. His company's mission was to break up the enemy's fortified seawall and then liberate a village five miles inland. Half of his men were casualties and Schroeder himself was shot twice in the left arm. He was hospitalized in England and later in South Carolina and almost had his arm amputated due to the severity of his wounds. [...] Asked later if {{he knew that he was}} the first soldier on the beach, he said, [...] "I knew my company was in the first wave, but I didn't know I was actually going to be the first ashore.

2500|$|The Braves {{returned}} to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, {{a crowd of}} 53,775 people showed up for the game—a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on NBC. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing. Although Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed in the Braves' bullpen, where relief pitcher Tom House caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students [...] sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful Craig Sager actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now WWSB-Channel 40) in Sarasota. As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer Milo Hamilton, calling the game on WSB radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: [...] "Henry Aaron, {{in the second inning}} walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715! There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate. And listen to this crowd!" [...] Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully addressed the racial tension— or apparent lack thereof— in his call of the home run: [...] "What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>moment</b> for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron. ...And {{for the first time in}} a long time, that poker face in Aaron shows the tremendous strain and relief of what it must have been like to live with for the past several months." [...] On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd and final home run as a Braves player. Thirty days later, after Aaron decided not to retire, the Braves traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roger Alexander and Dave May. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate Del Crandall, who was now managing the Brewers. On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke baseball's all-time RBI record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213. That year, he also played in his last and 24th All-Star Game (25th All-Star Game selection); he lined out to Dave Concepción as a pinch-hitter in the second inning. This All-Star Game, like the first one he played in 1955, was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium.|$|E

40|$|The {{aetiology}} of osteoporotic vertebral fractures is multi-factorial, and {{cannot be}} explained solely by low bone mass. After sustaining an initial vertebral fracture, {{the risk of}} subsequent fracture increases greatly. Examination of physiologic loads imposed on vertebral bodies may help to explain a mechanism underlying this fracture cascade. This study tested the hypothesis that model-derived segmental vertebral loading is greater in individuals who have sustained an osteoporotic vertebral fracture compared to those with osteoporosis and no history of fracture. Flexion moments, and compression and shear loads were calculated from T 2 to L 5 in 12 participants with fractures (66. 4 ± 6. 4 years, 162. 2 ± 5. 1 cm, 69. 1 ± 11. 2 kg) and 19 without fractures (62. 9 ± 7. 9 years, 158. 3 ± 4. 4 cm, 59. 3 ± 8. 9 kg) while standing. Static {{analysis was used to}} solve gravitational loads while muscle-derived forces were calculated using a detailed trunk muscle model driven by optimization with a cost function set to minimise muscle fatigue. Least squares regression was used to derive polynomial functions to describe normalised load profiles. Regression co-efficients were compared between groups to examine differences in loading profiles. Loading at the fractured level, and at one level above and below, were also compared between groups. The fracture group had significantly greater normalised compression (p = 0. 0008) and shear force (p < 0. 0001) profiles and a trend for <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> flexion <b>moment</b> profile. At the level of fracture, <b>a</b> significantly <b>greater</b> flexion <b>moment</b> (p = 0. 001) and shear force (p < 0. 001) was observed in the fracture group. <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> flexion <b>moment</b> (p = 0. 003) and compression force (p = 0. 007) one level below the fracture, and <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> flexion <b>moment</b> (p = 0. 002) and shear force (p = 0. 002) one level above the fracture was observed in the fracture group. The differences observed in multi-level spinal loading between the groups may explain a mechanism for increased risk of subsequent vertebral fractures. Interventions aimed at restoring vertebral morphology or reduce thoracic curvature may assist in normalising spine load profiles. © 2006 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
