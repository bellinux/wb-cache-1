50|$|In the bi-grid type of tetrode, both grids are {{intended}} to carry electrical signals, so both are control grids. The first example to appear in Britain was the Marconi-Osram FE1, which was designed by H.J. Round, and became available in 1920. The tube {{was intended to be}} used in a reflex circuit (for example the single-valve ship receiver Type 91)where the same valve performed the multiple functions of rf amplifier, af amplifier, and diode detector. The rf signal was applied to one control grid, and the af signal to the other. This type of tetrode was used in many imaginative ways in the period before the appearance of the screen-grid valve revolutionised receiver design.One application is shown in the illustration. This is recognisable as an <b>AM</b> <b>telephony</b> transmitter in which the second grid and the anode form a power oscillator, and the first grid acts as a modulating electrode. The anode current in the valve, and hence the RF output amplitude, is modulated by the voltage on G1, which is derived from a carbon microphone.A tube of this type could also be used as a direct conversion CW receiver. Here the valve oscillates as a consequence of coupling between the first grid and the anode, while the second grid is coupled to the antenna. The AF beat frequency is audible in the headphones. The valve acts as a self-oscillating product detector.Another, very similar application of the bi-grid valve was as a self oscillating frequency mixer in early superhet receivers One control grid carried the incoming rf signal, while the other was connected into an oscillator circuit which generated the local oscillation within the same valve. Since the anode current of the bi-grid valve was proportional both to the signal on the first grid, and also to the oscillator voltage on the second grid, the required multiplication of the two signals was achieved, and the intermediate frequency signal appeared in an appropriately tuned circuit connected to the anode. In all of the applications mentioned, the bi-grid tetrode acted as an analogue multiplier (analog multiplier) which multiplied together the signals applied to the two grids.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”Voice over Internet Protocol is {{a steady}} growing market. It saves {{a lot of}} money for {{providers}} as well as for users. However, spammers could also transmit their messages over this service. This so called Spam over Internet <b>Telephony</b> <b>is</b> more difficult to filter than e-mail spam, because its content is not available in advance. Two kinds of Spam over Internet <b>Telephony</b> can <b>be</b> differentiated: Spam over Internet Tele-phony via Proxy and Direct Spam over Internet Telephony. Direct Spam over Internet <b>Telephony</b> <b>is</b> the direct transmission of unsolicited messages to a lot of user equipment. Therefore, this is the most dangerous form of Spam over Internet Telephony, because no proxy is passed, which could be able to filter the message flow. A solution to face Direct Spam over Internet <b>Telephony</b> <b>is</b> still missing. This gap is closed by the proposed caller pre-validation mechanism. The basic idea is to get more information about an incoming direct call. Only calls of existing participants are connected. The caller is trusted if his existence can be validated successfully.

This article investigates {{the demand for}} IP telephony by using conjoint analysis. Projecting IP telephony demand also contributes to Japanese info-communication policy discussions. Two points are made. First, IP <b>telephony</b> <b>is</b> still currently considered an optional supplement or an add-on service option of high-speed BB Internet access services in Japan rather than a close substitute of existing {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS). At this point, we find little evidence that many households will promptly forsake their fixed line service for IP telephony. Second, we conclude that the key condition for the proliferation of IP <b>telephony</b> <b>is</b> the complete guarantee of quality of service (QoS), including voice quality, number portability, fax usage and emergency access, comparable to or exceeding that of existing POTS. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mobile <b>telephony</b> <b>is</b> rapidly {{becoming}} {{a wide spread}} mobile technology. The technological possibilities for context-aware features are increasing, although only few services exist in real consumer settings. In an exploratory case study of high level mobile telephone users, the context measures {{that are relevant to}} mobile <b>telephony</b> <b>are</b> studied. Starting with three measures, location, time and identity, a fourth context measure is also found, leading to the measure of social situation to be important to users as well. The study concludes that the use of mobile <b>telephony</b> <b>is</b> highly influenced by this limited set of context measures but that these are not necessarily the same as the users wish to see facilitated by technology. It also suggests that when developing contextaware features for mobile communication, supporting these four pieces of information should be prioritized.
