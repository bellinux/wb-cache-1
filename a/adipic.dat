25|$|The {{precursor}} to nylon, <b>adipic</b> acid, is produced {{on a large}} scale by oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol with nitric acid.|$|E
25|$|Reaction {{with two}} α-hydrogen atoms in ketones creates oximes, {{which may be}} further {{oxidized}} to a carboxylic acid, or reduced to form amines. This process {{is used in the}} commercial production of <b>adipic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|Carboxylic acids {{are used}} in the {{production}} of polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and food additives. Industrially important carboxylic acids include acetic acid (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), acrylic and methacrylic acids (precursors to polymers, adhesives), <b>adipic</b> acid (polymers), citric acid (beverages), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (chelating agent), fatty acids (coatings), maleic acid (polymers), propionic acid (food preservative), terephthalic acid (polymers).|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 1935, Gerard Berchet, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Carothers, produced a half-ounce of polymer from hexamethylenediamine and <b>adipic</b> acid, creating polyamide 6-6, the substance that would {{come to be known as}} Nylon. It was difficult to work with because of its high melting point, but Bolton chose this polyamide as the one to develop commercially. He selected Dr. George Graves to work with Carothers on the project. Eventually Graves supplanted Carothers as the leader of the polyamide project. In addition, dozens of chemists and engineers worked on refining polyamide 6-6 into a viable commercial product.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{polyester}} polyols {{are based}} on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as <b>adipic</b> acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols {{are based on}} reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to polyisocyanurate (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.|$|E
25|$|A low {{temperature}} example is work by Kitagawa, et al. {{who used a}} two-dimensional oxalate-bridged anionic layer framework as the host and introduced ammonium cations and <b>adipic</b> acid molecules into the pores to increase proton concentration. The result {{was one of the}} first instances of a MOF showing “superprotonic” conductivity (8 x 10−3 S/cm) at 25°C and 98% relative humidity (RH). They later found that increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cations introduced into the pores could enhance proton conductivity even more. In this {{low temperature}} regime that is dependent on degree of hydration, it has also been shown that proton conductivity is heavily dependent on humidity levels.|$|E
