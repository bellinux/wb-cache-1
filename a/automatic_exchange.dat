5|$|There was a {{post office}} in Meander by 1888, {{probably}} started the previous year. Prior to this there was an unofficial post office, a mail depot run by locals. The post office continued in a separate building until then postmaster, Harold Taylor, retired in 1977. After this post function was a service provided by the local store. There was a manual telephone exchange in the post office building. This was replaced with an <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> in June 1975.|$|E
25|$|In October 2015, the European Union and Liechtenstein {{signed a}} tax {{agreement}} {{to ensure the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of financial information in case of tax disputes. The collection of data started in 2016, and is another step to bring the principality in line with other European countries with regard to its taxation of private individuals and corporate assets.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, {{the first one}} or two digits of {{telephone}} numbers in metropolitan areas were alphabetical, with each letter representing a distinct number on the telephone dial. Each one-letter or two-letter code signified an exchange within an urban area. Rural and regional areas typically relied on manual exchanges, or only one <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> for the whole town, so rural and regional numbers did not feature these letter prefixes.|$|E
50|$|Within a short time, telecom {{switching}} products {{suited to}} Indian conditions {{appeared in the}} form of small rural <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> (RAXs) and medium size switches as SBMs for towns. This was followed by higher capacity digital switches known as main <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> (MAXs). C-DOT technology spread across the country through its licensed manufacturers..|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of letters}} on dials was {{proposed}} in 1917 by W. G. Blauvelt of AT&T. Large cities like New York would ultimately require a seven-digit number, but some {{tests in the}} early 1900s indicated that the short-term memory span of many people could not handle seven digits and many dialling errors due to memory lapse might occur (the documentation for these tests is lost). Hence the first Panel <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> cutover in 1915 in Newark, New Jersey used [...] "semiautomatic" [...] operation with the local operator keying the number for the caller. And as large cities would have both manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> for some years, the numbers for manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{would have the same}} format (originally MULberry 3456, with three letters then four numbers), which could be either spoken or dialled.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, Almon Strowger, of Kansas City, Missouri, was {{inspired}} by the idea of manufacturing <b>automatic</b> telephone <b>exchanges</b> that would not require switchboard operators. He founded the Strowger <b>Automatic</b> Telephone <b>Exchange</b> Company in 1891, which held the first patents for the <b>automatic</b> telephone <b>exchange.</b> Subsequently, in 1901, Strowger helped form the Automatic Electric Company to which he leased his patents exclusively.|$|R
25|$|However, Switzerland did {{not want}} to be seen as an {{obstacle}} to closer tax cooperation among EU-member states and decided to support the international efforts to adequately tax cross-border investment income. The retention tax agreed with the European Union (EU) in the taxation of savings income agreement is a suitable and efficient means of doing so. The EU is committed to eliminating existing loopholes in the system of taxation of savings income. Switzerland has expressed to the EU its willingness in principle to correspondingly adjust the taxation of savings income. Here it should be noted that Switzerland has adopted the OECD standard on administrative assistance and that the Federal Council rejects the <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information. Since July 1, 2005, Switzerland has charged a withholding tax on all interest earned in the personal Swiss accounts of European Union residents.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the data}} {{generated}} from the onboard sensors and by cockpit activity is digitally recorded throughout the length of an entire mission. This information can be replayed in the cockpit or easily extracted for detailed post-mission analysis using a data transfer unit that {{can also be used}} to insert mission data to the aircraft. [...] The Gripen, like the Viggen, was designed to operate as one component of a networked national defence system, which allows for <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information in real-time between Gripen aircraft and ground facilities. [...] According to Saab, the Gripen features [...] "the world's most highly developed data link". The Gripen's Ternav tactical navigation system combines information from multiple onboard systems such as the air data computer, radar altimeter, and GPS to continuously calculate the Gripen's location.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, the OECD {{introduced}} its Common Reporting Standard (CRS) {{proposed for the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information (AEOI) through its Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. The G-20 gave a mandate for this standard, {{and its relation to}} FATCA is mentioned on page 5 of the OECD's report. Critics immediately dubbed it [...] "GATCA" [...] for Global FATCA. [...] Ironically however, so far the US has refused to sign up to CRS.|$|E

25|$|Early exchanges were {{electromechanical}} systems using motors, shaft drives, rotating {{switches and}} relays. Some types of <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> were the Strowger switch or step-by-step switch, All Relay, X-Y, panel switch and the crossbar switch.|$|R

2500|$|Lack of reciprocity. There is no US {{legislation}} to allow reciprocity, {{and as of}} 2017, no reciprocal data exchanges have taken place. The model IGA states: [...] "The Parties are committed to working with Partner Jurisdictions and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on adapting the terms of this Agreement and other agreements between the United States and Partner Jurisdictions to a common model for <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information, including the development of reporting and due diligence standards for financial institutions." [...] The president's budget for year 2014 included a proposal to allow the Treasury Secretary to collect information {{which could be used}} for FATCA reciprocity. [...] The proposal stated that its intent was to [...] "facilitate such intergovernmental cooperation by enabling the IRS to reciprocate in appropriate circumstances"; however, the proposal did not request to allow the Secretary to have further transmittal authority. The president's federal budget proposals of 2014, 2015 and 2016 did not list either costs or revenues for reciprocity implementation in any of the coming 10 years—thus assuming that this collection was either cost neutral or, more logically, it would be interpreted as not budgeted.|$|E

5000|$|On a trunk, on-hook and {{off-hook}} signals {{must pass}} in both directions. In a one-way trunk, the originating or A board sends a short for off-hook, {{and an open}} for on-hook, while the terminating or B board sends normal polarity or reverse polarity. This [...] "reverse battery" [...] signaling was carried over to later <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>exchanges,</b> or dial service, {{came into}} {{existence}} in the early 20th century. Their purpose was to {{eliminate the need for}} human switchboard operators who completed the connections required for a telephone call. Automation replaced human operators with electromechanical systems and telephones were equipped with a dial by which a caller transmitted the destination telephone number to the automatic switching system.|$|R

Two further Philips PRX205 electronic exchanges were introduced in 1975 in Central as a relief exchange to the Strowger unit and 1976 at West due to a shortage of lines on the Ericsson of Beeston CB switchboard.|$|R
