500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 24 November 1941, the 1st Battle Squadron, Barham, Queen Elizabeth, and Valiant, with an escort of eight destroyers, departed Alexandria to cover the 7th and 15th Cruiser Squadrons as they hunted for Italian convoys in the Central Mediterranean. The following morning, the , commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Diedrich von Tiesenhausen, detected the faint engine noises of the British ships and moved to intercept. By {{the afternoon}} the submarine and the 1st Battle Squadron were on reciprocal courses and von Tiesenhausen ordered his boat to battle stations around 16:00. An <b>ASDIC</b> <b>operator</b> aboard {{one of the leading}} destroyers, , detected the submarine at 16:18 at an estimated range of , but the contact was disregarded as it subtended an angle between 40 and 60 degrees wide, far larger than a submarine. U-331 thus passed through the screen and was only in a position to fire her torpedoes after the leading ship, Queen Elizabeth, had passed her by and the second ship, Barham, was closing rapidly. Von Tiesenhausen ordered all four bow torpedo tubes fired at a range of [...] at 16:25. Possibly due to her closeness to Valiants bow wave and discharging the torpedoes, the boat's conning tower broached the surface and was fruitlessly engaged by one of the battleship's [...] "pom-pom"s at a range of about [...] The boat dived out of control after she broached, reaching an indicated depth of , well below her design depth of , before she stabilised without any damage. U-331 was not attacked by the escorting destroyers and reached port on 3 December. Von Tiesenhausen was not certain of the results of his attack and radioed that he had hit a Queen Elizabeth-class battleship with one torpedo.|$|E
50|$|Hedgehog solved one of {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems, keeping ASDIC contact at short ranges. As range shortened, so did the time taken for the sound pulse to reach, and then return from, the target. Eventually, the <b>ASDIC</b> <b>operator</b> received an echo almost simultaneously with the emitted pulse, a so-called 'instantaneous echo', making target tracking difficult. Hedgehog allowed the target to be attacked while within the usable range of the ASDIC equipment.|$|E
50|$|Operating for {{the first}} time with the Eastern Fleet at Colombo in Ceylon, Commander Bill King on 13 July had put himself in a {{position}} known as One Fathom bank in order to intercept Japanese traffic between Penang and Singapore. They waited until the 17th when submerged, the <b>ASDIC</b> <b>operator</b> alerted King to the sound of propellers, and the watch soon spotted a Japanese submarine; that being I-166.|$|E
2500|$|U-517 {{took nearly}} {{the whole day}} to manoeveure itself into {{position}} after picking up transmissions of success against the convoy by U-165. By 15:00, rain had reduced visibility again and air cover was withdrawn. During that time, the minesweeper , escorting the merchant Sarnolite, were ordered to join with the convoy. At 17:15, off Gaspé point, U-517 let the convoy pass over him before firing three torpedoes at three merchants which were sailing close to each other. The torpedoes struck the merchants Mount Pindus, Oakton and Mount Taygetus in rapid succession. Within 15 minutes of the torpedoing, all three merchants had sunk. Q-083 recovered 78 survivors in total from the three ships, later landing them in Gaspé. The other escorts, including Vegreville began dropping depth charges {{in an effort to}} prevent U-517 from targeting the last ship of the convoy Bencas. They made no contact with U-517; however, in an effort to draw off the escorts, U-517 launched a pillenwerfer, an underwater-launched noise maker meant to hide the U-boat from the <b>asdic</b> <b>operators.</b> U-517 suffered some damage to the outer hull from the depth charge attack, but made its escape. At 16:55 Arrowhead ordered the Fairmile motor launches to pick up survivors. Bencas was sent on to Gaspé escorted by Truro and Sarnolite by Vegreville. Arrowhead continued to search for the submarine in the approaches to Gaspé, supported by the Fairmiles and later joined by two aircraft, the minesweeper [...] and corvettes [...] and [...] Arrowhead and the Fairmiles returned to Gaspé at 20:30.|$|R
50|$|In July 1941 Upholder {{encountered}} two Italian cruisers - the Giuseppe Garibaldi and the Raimondo Montecuccoli - steaming {{at about}} 22 knots and escorted by destroyers. Wanklyn {{originally intended to}} attack the Montecuccoli but shortly before firing the <b>ASDIC</b> <b>operator</b> gave the cruisers an even higher speed, of around 28 knots, which meant that Upholder {{did not have a}} good enough position to attack her and so Wanklyn switched the attack to the Garibaldi. Upholder fired two torpedoes one of which was claimed as a hit but did not sink Garibaldi, though it did put her in port and out of action for some time.|$|E
50|$|He had {{significant}} {{parts in the}} war films The Dam Busters (playing Guy Gibsons batman, Crosby), Bridge on the River Kwai and The Longest Day. He {{can also be seen}} in films such as The Ladykillers, Sea of Sand, Angels One Five and The Cruel Sea (in which he was the <b>ASDIC</b> <b>operator).</b> He also made hundreds of British TV appearances in programmes such as Minder (as Dunning, episode Get Daley!, 1984) and a notable role in All Creatures Great and Small. Goodwin was a staple of the popular 1980s sitcom, Thats My Boy. His last major television appearance was playing the part of Joss Shackleton, father to Vera Duckworth, in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street in the early 1990s.|$|E

U-331 was not attacked by the escorting destroyers and reached port on 3 December. Von Tiesenhausen was not certain of the results of his attack and radioed that he had hit a Queen Elizabeth-class battleship with one torpedo.|$|E
