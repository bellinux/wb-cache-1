40|$|Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is a {{promising}} tool material which is utilized to cut difficult-to-machine {{materials used in}} aerospace industry. Because of its ultra-hardness, electrical discharge grinding (EDG), a variation of electrical discharge machining, is often adopted to manufacture PCD tools to reduce manufacturing time. This paper investigates the quality of PCD inserts manufactured by two different EDG eroding methods: " 2 -step machining" and " 3 -step machining". Surface roughness and residual stress were investigated after EDG process. An orthogonal cutting experiment was conducted to test the performance of each PCD <b>insert.</b> PCD tools <b>machined</b> with the two methods do not have significant difference in surface roughness. The residual stress status changed from compressive to tensile after EDG process. Also, after being eroded by 3 -step EDG process, there was an over 30 % declination of residual stress compared with 2 -step machining. The results of the orthogonal cutting test showed that the wear amount and the thrust force of PCD <b>inserts</b> <b>machined</b> by 3 -step EDG were smaller for the CTB 010 insert and the CTX 002 insert. In contrast, the CTM 302 machined by 3 -step EDG did not show obvious improvement in tool wear resistance during the cutting tests...|$|R

In this technique, a newly developed program is used to process the profile data measured using a Form Talysurf profilometer, and to further generate the NC tool path for form error compensation.

Using the developed technique, the initial residual form error upon the completion of primary grinding is minimized. Subsequently, the residual form error is compensated by modifying the NC tool path. With this technique, the speed of convergence of the residual form error has improved markedly. The grinding result shows that, after just one compensation cycle, a form error of approximately 0. 3 mu m in PV is achieved...|$|R

The neutron sensitivity of boron-lined detectors has been enhanced {{by a factor of}} 3 without a corresponding increase in the unwanted gamma sensitivity by the use of multiple cathode assemblies and additional structures within their sensitive volume. This has also helped in substituting 90 % enriched 10 B isotope with indigenously available 40 % material.

The use of PEEK <b>inserts</b> <b>machined</b> to suit the extra cameral volume in gamma compensated ion chambers has improved the V/I characteristics and compensation factor. Development of fission counters with indigenous fissile materials has resulted in neutron sensitivity up to 0. 2 cps/nv.

Specifications for fission detectors designed for high gamma background in for PFBR have been derived on the basis of tests on available counters. ABSTRA...|$|R
