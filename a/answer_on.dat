5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat {{did not try to}} give the <b>answer</b> <b>on</b> this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, it is at least open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E
5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. She {{pointed out that}} historical buildings are often used in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not <b>answer</b> <b>on</b> whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same <b>answer</b> <b>on</b> a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

25|$|Although the Nestorian {{community}} traced {{their history}} to the 1st century, the Church of the East first achieved official state recognition from the Sassanid Empire in the 4th century with the accession of Yazdegerd I (reigned 399–420) to the throne of the Sasanian Empire. In 410 the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, held at the Sasanian capital, allowed the Church's leading bishops to elect a formal Catholicos (leader).

25|$|Suspecting warlike {{intentions}} on {{the part}} of the Chinese, Bremer sailed to the Macao Roads on 13February to confer with Elliot. He found that the Nemesis was en route to Canton to demand ratification of the convention and had orders to wait until the night of 18February for an <b>answer.</b> <b>On</b> the morning of 19February, the Nemesis returned without a reply, and all doubt regarding the hostile intentions of the Chinese ended when the ship came under fire from North Wangtong. Later that evening, Qishan and Elliot's intermediary Paoupang arrived in Macao in a chop-boat, announcing Qishan's refusal to sign the treaty and demanding ten more days to consider it. However, Elliot replied that fair means have been exhausted. Bremer detached the Calliope, Samarang, Herald, Alligator, Modeste, and Sulphur under Captain Thomas Herbert to prevent further defensive preparations. In response, a proclamation from the Lieutenant-Governor of Canton, Eleang, announced a $30,000 reward for the heads of Bremer or Elliot, and $50,000 for anyone who could seize them alive, among other rewards.|$|E

500|$|Other {{suggestions}} {{for the performance}} context of the poem include Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff's argument that it {{was intended as a}} reply to the ritual abuse spoken by women at some festivals of Demeter. [...] However, Hugh Lloyd-Jones disputes this, arguing that this ritual abuse [...] "could hardly have provoked an <b>answer</b> <b>on</b> this or any other occasion". [...] The poem might itself have been performed in an analogous ritual context, but these festivals would probably also have included women, and the poem seems to have been intended to be performed for an all-male audience.|$|E

500|$|The speech {{received}} [...] "relatively little {{coverage from}} the media", Time magazine claimed 20 years later. John Kornblum, senior US diplomat in Berlin {{at the time}} of Reagan's speech, and US Ambassador to Germany from 1997 to 2001, said [...] " [...] wasn't really elevated to its current status until 1989, after the wall came down." [...] The muted response in the Western media contrasted with the reaction from the East: East German Politburo member Günter Schabowski considered the speech to be [...] "absurd", and the Soviet press agency TASS accused Reagan of giving an [...] "openly provocative, war-mongering speech." [...] Ironically, it was Schabowski who {{two and a half years}} later, on the 9th November 1989, became the person to open the wall by providing a slightly mistaken <b>answer</b> <b>on</b> a press conference about changes in travel regulations for East German citizens.|$|E
