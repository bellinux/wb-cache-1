40|$|The {{process of}} adipogenesis {{involves}} a complex program of gene expression that includes down-regulation {{of the gene}} encoding Hes- 1, a target of the Notch signaling pathway. To determine if Notch signaling affects adipogenesis, we exposed 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes to the Notch ligand Jagged 1 and found that differentiation was significantly reduced. This effect could be mimicked by constitutive expression of Hes- 1. The block {{was associated with a}} complete loss of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) induction and could be overcome by retroviral expression of either C/EBPα or PPARγ 2. Surprisingly, small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated reduction of Hes- 1 mRNA in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells also inhibited differentiation, suggesting an <b>additional,</b> <b>obligatory</b> role for Hes- 1 in adipogenesis. This role may be related to our observation that both Notch signaling and Hes- 1 down-regulate transcription of the gene encoding DLK/Pref- 1, a protein known to inhibit differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. The results presented in this study establish a new target downstream of the Notch-Hes- 1 pathway and suggest a dual role for Hes- 1 in adipocyte development...|$|R
40|$|AI and AII cat retinal {{amacrine}} {{cells have}} highly varicose non-uniform, neuritic processes. Processes of both types were reconstructed via {{a computer system}} using serial electron micrographs. These reconstructions were analyzed for (a) varicosity volume, surface area, and length, (b) "neck" volume, surface area, and length, (c) number of microtubules within the varicosity, (d) number of microtubules within the "neck," and (e) volume and surface area of mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and large smooth vesicular bodies within the processes. Correlation of these parameters revealed a linear relationship {{between the number of}} microtubules in the necks and mean neck cross-sectional area (rs = 0. 780, P less than 0. 001), while microtubule number within the varicosities showed no correlation with varicosity volume (rs = 0. 239, P greater than 0. 2). Varicosity volume did, however, correlate strongly with the summed volume of mitochondria and smooth vesicular bodies contained within the varicosity for both cell types examined. The ratio between membranous organelle volume and varicosity volume for AI amacrine processes of 1 : 6. 97 (rs = 0. 927), differed from the ratio of 1 : 1. 80 for the AII amacrine processes (rs = 0. 987). Similar relationships were observed in other nonvaricose neurites such as optic tract axons. Membranous organelles appear to contribute an <b>additional</b> <b>obligatory</b> volume to the cytosol that can be as much as seven times the organelles' direct volume. These observations suggest that both the cytoskeletal components, and the membrane organelles play a direct role in determining neurite shape...|$|R

40|$|T {{immune system}} plays {{a central role}} before and during parturition, {{including}} the main physiological processes of parturition: uterine contractions and cervical ripening. The immune system comprises white blood cells and their secretions. Polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages invade the cervical tissue and release compounds, such as oxygen radicals and enzymes, which break down the cervical matrix to allow softening and dilatation. During this inflammatory process, white blood cells undergo chemotaxis, adherence to endothelial cells, diapedesis, migration and activation. Factors that regulate white blood cell invasion and secretion include cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor and interleukins. Glucocorticoids, sex hormones and prostaglandins, affect cytokine synthesis. They also modulate the target cells, resulting in altered responses to cytokines. On the other hand, the immune system has profound effects on the hormonal system and prostaglandin synthesis. In animals, nitric oxide has marked effects on uterine quiescence during gestation.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} repetitive diving and the long term effect of compression/decompression on the distribution or loss of minerals, electrolytes, and prptem metabolites in men subjected to standard Navy diving procedures. FINDINGS No consistent carry-over effect was observed following a 28 -day inter-dive interval for dives to 6. 7 ATA using air. Reduction in urine output with concomitant decreases in solute excretion during the first 24 post-dive hours was obviated by a deliberate increase in fluid intake. Ketosteroid excretion decreased some-what following the first dive series and significantly so for 10 days post exposure after the second series 28 days later, a fact which suggests an extended adrenal response to diving stresses. Serum electrolyte and mineral parameters showed no con-sistent pattern in either intra- or inter-dive variability. APPLICATION Since alterations in biochemical responses have been observed for several days following exposure to hyperbaric environments, it appears that caution should be exercised with respect to frequent repetition to pressure exposures. <b>Additional</b> work is <b>obligatory</b> to ascertain the extent and significance of the biochemical phenomena discussed...|$|R
40|$|Achieving robust {{combustion}} {{while also}} yielding low hydrocarbon (HC) emissions {{is difficult for}} the first cycle of cranking during the cold start of a Port Fuel Injected (PFI) Spark Ignition (SI) engine. Cold intake port wall and valve temperatures, near-atmospheric manifold pressure, and low port air velocity combine to create an adverse environment for fuel delivery - the process of injecting and vaporizing liquid fuel to create a combustible air-fuel mixture. As a result, {{only a small fraction}} of the injected fuel mass contributes to the combustible mixture; the fraction is less than 10 % at cold ambient temperatures. With fast light off catalysts, the first cycle produces a significant portion of the total trip emissions. The low fuel delivery fraction results in high residual liquid fuel in both the port and cylinder; this fuel contributes significantly to the exhaust HC emissions. Since the first cycle engine control is open-loop, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) must determine how much fuel to inject under given conditions - temperature, pressure, and for a given fuel. Fuel properties play a significant role in first cycle fuel delivery, since the energy available for vaporization is a limiting factor in fuel delivery. The effect of fuel properties on fuel delivery for the first cycle was quantified at a wide range of cold start temperatures by using a skip-firing strategy to simulate the first cycle of cranking on a production PFI engine. Four fuels between 1083 and 1257 Driveability Index (DI) were tested, and the fuel delivery results have been correlated to properties of the ASTM distillation curve. The fractional distillation point that correlates to fuel delivery is a function of temperature - at colder temperatures, the results(cont.) correlate with the more volatile end of the <b>distillation</b> curve. Fuel <b>delivery</b> results for the fuels were also simulated with a thermodynamics-based fuel delivery model based on partial equilibrium with the charge air. by Kevin R. Lang. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: Cecal {{intubation}} is not achieved in 2 - 23 % of colonoscopies. The efforts made by physicians {{to visualize the}} remaining colon {{and the number of}} missed significant lesions are unknown. This study evaluates 1) the reasons for incomplete colonoscopy, 2) the rates of complete colonic evaluation after incomplete colonoscopy, and 3) the number of (pre-) malignant lesions missed by incomplete colonoscopy. Patients and methods: In this population-based cohort study index colonoscopies were performed between September and December 2005. Prospectively collected data from consecutive patients with an incomplete colonoscopy were analyzed. For up to 18 months after the index colonoscopy, any further examinations performed in these patients were identified retrospectively. These secondary examinations included: repeat colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT) colonography, barium enema, abdominal CT scan, and surgery involving the colorectum. Results: Of 5278 colonoscopies, 511 were incomplete (9. 7 %). The most frequent causes of incomplete colonoscopy were looping of the scope (20. 4 %), patient discomfort (15. 3 %), and obstructing tumor (13. 9 %). Secondary examination was performed in 278 patients (54. 4 %) after incomplete colonoscopy. Patients undergoing surveillance after colorectal cancer (CRC) (78. 9 %) and those with anemia (73. 1 %) most frequently received a secondary examination. Incomplete colonoscopies due to stenosis (78. 9 %), severe inflammation (77. 8 %) or an obstructing tumor (74. 6 %) were most frequently followed by a secondary examination. In all of the follow-up examinations, CRC was diagnosed in 18 patients (3. 5 %) and advanced adenoma in four patients (0. 8 %). Conclusions: In 4. 3 % of the patients, advanced neoplasia was missed by incomplete colonoscopy. Our data therefore suggest that <b>additional</b> imaging is <b>obligatory</b> to visualize the remaining colon adequatel...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{biochemistry}} is {{the usual}} name for clinical biochemistry or clinical chemistry in Serbia, and medical biochemist is the official name for the clinical chemist (or clinical biochemist). This is the largest sub-discipline of the laboratory medicine in Serbia. It includes all aspects of clinical chemistry, and also laboratory hematology with coagulation, immunology, etc. Medical biochemistry laboratories in Serbia and medical biochemists as a profession are part of Health Care System and their activities are regulated through: the Health Care Law and rules issued by the Chamber of Medical Biochemists of Serbia. The first continuous and organized education for Medical Biochemists (Clinical Chemists) in Serbia dates from 1945, when the Department of Medical Biochemistry was established at the Pharmaceutical Faculty in Belgrade. In 1987 at the same Faculty a five years undergraduate study program was established, educating Medical Biochemists under a special program. Since the academic year 2006 / 2007 the new five year undergraduate (according to Bologna Declaration) and four-year postgraduate program according to EC 4 European Syllabus for Postgraduate Training in Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine has been established. The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Public Health accredited these programs. There are four requirements for practicing medical biochemistry in the Health Care System: University Diploma of the Faculty of Pharmacy (Study of Medical Biochemistry), successful completion of the professional exam at the Ministry of Health after completion of one <b>additional</b> year of <b>obligatory</b> practical training in the medical biochemistry laboratories, membership in the Serbian Chamber of Medical Biochemists and licence for skilled work issued by the Serbian Chamber of Medical Biochemists.

Webb {{comments that}} [...] "The AD&D system has a fundamental flaw: characters eventually become so potent {{that they can}} cope with anything the world (or alternative planes, or gods) can throw at them. High-level Campaigns seeks to remedy this, aiming to provide new inspiration and sensible controls for ... high-level campaigns." [...] He comments that the [...] "Adventures" [...] section is [...] "an attempt to reinvigorate the level-challenged DM" [...] and calls the [...] "True Dweomers" [...] section [...] "the <b>obligatory</b> <b>additional</b> spell list, with more 'earth-shaking' magic", and suggests that the [...] "High-level Characters" [...] section [...] "suggests extra abilities to give powerful people a truly heroic swagger". [...] Webb concludes that [...] "The Seven Maxims is the most essential section, though it contains little more than solid, common-sense rules that focus the minds of DMs and players", and that [...] "Similar strong-but-simple ideas are crystallised in Magical Duels which is a complex but calculated system with unique spell-on-spell combat rules that make for invigorating battles." [...] Webb contends that [...] "The new powers in High-level Characters fall into two kinds: style and substance. The style side is great, helping PCs to develop nuances of character, but the abilities in the substance part are really trivial things that will be overlooked by referees, but that players will attempt to transform into life-saving skills." [...] Referring to [...] "The Seven Maxims", [...] "Magical Duels", and [...] "High-Level Characters" [...] sections, he states that [...] "These three good chapters constitute {{the majority of the}} book and are recommended reading. The other four chapters, however, fall into the trap of so many TSR supplements and guides; namely that rather than replacing or refining rules, ever more tables and lists are heaped on top of the old." [...] Webb concludes his review by saying: [...] "High-level Campaigns is of interest but by no means essential. The Seven Maxims could add clarity, and Magical Duels might add excitement. Essentially, though, High-level Campaigns is an ideal present for a referee friend. That way you can borrow it, check out the good bits, and avoid that sinking feeling of having paid £12 for another earnest AD&D debate and yet another spell list.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Chemokine receptors (CKRs), the {{primordial}} receptors for primate lentiviruses, are sufficient to mediate virus-cell fusion. Several different fusogenic CKRs and related receptors provide a broad potential host cell range, presumably advantageous for viral spread {{within a given}} infected individual, and across species. By contrast, the <b>additional</b> constraint of <b>obligatory</b> CD 4 binding, just prior to CKR engagement, radically restricts potential host cells within an individual (or lymph node microenvironment), and might also limit xenotransmission, as CD 4 sequences vary among primates. In spite of these potential drawbacks, CD 4 dependent entry for SIV and HIV is the rule rather than the exception, and is generally thought to have evolved by selection for 1) stabilization of virus–cell surface interactions, and 2) conformational shielding of readily neutralized CKR binding epitopes. CD 4 binding residues of SIV and HIV envelope are recessed, (relatively hidden from immune detection) and may exhibit a strong degree of automimicry, thus benefitting from self tolerance. Documented evolution, within individual macaques, of neutralization-resistant CD 4 -dependent SIV, derived from CD 4 -independent inocula, supports these ideas, but does not explain CD 4 ’s exclusive role as the penultimate receptor-even more striking, given the wide diversity of CKRs and other surface molecules that can serve as actual fusion receptors for SIV. We, therefore, explored the additional, non-exclusive, hypothesis that surface CD 4 on leukocytes is a marker of a more favorable host cell environment, as compared to CD 8, NK, or B cell surface markers. Results We demonstrate progressive in vitro evolution of two SIV strains to CD 4 -dependence (and CXCR 4 tropism) in normal human PBMCs (hPBMCs). The two CD 4 -independent strains of SIV tested developed nearly complete CD 4 dependence over several months of serial passage in hPBMCs, correlating with {{a limited number of}} non-synonymous env region mutations, some previously reported to be determinants of CD 4 -dependency. The initial ability of SIV stocks to grow to significant (albeit, relatively low) levels in CD 4 (−), CD 14 (−) cells was also lost with long term passage. Rapid emergence and subsequent prominence of G[*]→[*]A and A[*]→[*]G mutations within env regions associated with CD 4 dependence was seen. Conclusions Progressive acquisition of strict CD 4 tropism, independent of immunoselection, supports the idea that surface CD 4 identifies optimal host cells having intracellular environments most favorable to viral replication. The prominence of mutations involving G to A, or A to G, suggests that APOBEC 3 mediated infidelity may facilitate rapid switching of cell surface receptor usage within SIV swarms encountering fluctuating availability of optimal CD 4 + CKR + targets. These observations of non-immune selection are compatible with, and may accelerate, simultaneous selection for previously described CD 4 -dependent neutralization resistance in vivo. </p...|$|R
