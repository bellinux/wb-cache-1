40|$|Every act of {{information}} processing can in principle be decomposed into the component operations {{of information}} storage, transfer, and modification. Yet, {{while this is}} easily done for today’s digital computers, the application of these concepts to neural information processing was hampered {{by the lack of}} proper mathematical definitions of these operations on information. Recently, such definitions were given and the specific concept of local <b>active</b> information <b>storage</b> was successfully applied to the analysis and optimization of artificial neural systems. However, no attempt to measure local <b>active</b> information <b>storage</b> in neural data has been made to date. Here we measure local <b>active</b> information <b>storage</b> on a local scale in time and space in voltage sensitive dye imaging data from area 18 of the cat. We show that storage reflects neural properties such as stimulus preferences and surprise upon unexpected stimulus change, and in area 18 reflects the abstract concept of an ongoing stimulus despite the locally random nature of this stimulus. We suggest that LAIS will be a useful quantity to test theories of cortical function, such as predictive coding. <br/...|$|R

The results demonstrate the feasibility of using advanced control and communication technology to implement a PEESS that schedules and dispatches distributed electro-thermal loads as well as <b>active</b> energy <b>storage</b> devices such as batteries. The number of loads needed for a PEESS can be 5 %– 10 % of the total loads, but the influence on flexible grid operation can be significant. By deploying PEESSs in different locations, the LSEs and grid operators not only eliminate the uncertainties introduced by DR programs, but also can control load variations {{to compensate for the}} variation introduced by intermittent energy resources such as wind or solar. Our future work will focus on sizing different types of TCA loads for PEESS applications and integrating <b>active</b> energy <b>storage</b> such as battery systems to provide robust, reliable, high-quality, and low-cost energy and ancillary services.|$|R
