25|$|Mushrooms {{can be a}} good dietary {{source of}} vitamin D2 if exposed to {{ultraviolet}} light. Mushrooms contain high concentrations of ergosterol (provitamin D2). Sunlight or ultraviolet radiation (UV) triggers conversion to viosterol (previtamin D2), which then turns into vitamin D2. Low values in mushrooms occur if there is little to no exposure to sunlight or UV light. When fresh mushrooms or dried powders are purposely exposed to <b>artificial</b> <b>sunlight</b> by use of an industrial ultraviolet lamp, vitamin D2 levels can be concentrated to much higher levels.|$|E

INTRODUCTION Infrared wireless transceivers usually operate in environments containing an intense amount of ambient light, emanating from both natural and <b>artificial</b> sources. <b>Sunlight</b> and incandescent lamps represent essentially unmodulated sources of background radiation. The average power of the background radiation generates a D. C. photocurrent in the photodetector, giving rise to shot noise, which is the dominant noise source in a typical diffuse receiver...|$|R

5000|$|The {{construction}} of an underground base would probably be more complex; {{one of the first}} machines from Earth might be a remote-controlled excavating machine.
