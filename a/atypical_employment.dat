While the concept of segmented labour markets emerged in the 1970 s in the context of institutionally flexible, liberal labour markets, but also using the German case as a starting point (see Doeringer et al. 1971; Sengenberger 1987), in research and policy there is a more recent increase in the attention to the phenomenon of dualisation and dualised labour markets with a particular focus on so-called non-standard or <b>atypical</b> forms of <b>employment</b> such as fixed-term contracts, part-time work, agency work or freelance. Here, the main arguments are more institutional as continental European countries have now developed a peculiar pattern of labour market regulation that is centred around a well-protected core of permanent employees benefiting from relatively strict dismissal protection, large shares of collective bargaining coverage and full integration into social insurance. Over the last decades, this model of organizing employment has been complemented by a flexible part of the labour market after a broad movement to deregulate and to encourage the take-up of non-standard or <b>atypical</b> forms of <b>employment.</b> This pattern of labour market reforms has emerged to create a flexible margin of the labour market that is expected to facilitate job growth without questioning the institutional stability of the core of the labour market, which is supported by incumbent workers and trade unions (Boeri 2010; Palier and Thelen 2010).|$|R

In addition, according to the statistics of America Staffing Association, there were 90% American enterprises used the services provided from labor dispatching industry. That means the concept of labor dispatching has commonly existed in the American society. In Japan, since made the law of labor dispatching in 1985, labor dispatching has developed rapidly. After the law of labor dispatching putting in execution, there were 615 general dispatched work agencies, 3,266 specific dispatched work agencies, and 1.4 billion dispatched laborers. Until 1998, there were 3026 general dispatched work agencies, 6985 specific dispatched work agencies, and 9 billion dispatched labors. In a short span of 12 years, the population of dispatched labor has grown six times, and it still kept increasing.

40|$|ABSTRACT Germany {{is known}} as one of the {{countries}} where the collective representation of interests through associations (‘corporatism’) is particularly strong. However, after the tripartite Alliance for Jobs, Training and Competitiveness failed to agree on solutions for combating high unemployment, an independent commission estab-lished by the government (the ‘Hartz commission’) has currently set the agenda for labour market reform. This article addresses the question of whether these events signal the end of corporatism in labour market policy in Germany. An analysis of temporary agency work, an <b>atypical</b> form of <b>employment</b> addressed by the Hartz reforms, shows that funda-mental reform in Germany must be initiated outside the system of tripartite interest nego-tiation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{would like to}} {{investigate}} the situation of Japanese labor market especially <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> (part-timer, contract employee and dispatching worker etc.) after 1990. In the first part, I would like to investigate the process of deregulation of Japanese labor market after 1990 and increase of <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> of Japanese enterprises as {{the effect of this}} deregulation. After the boom period with high inflation from 1885 to 1990, the bubble economy crashed at 1990 and the Heisei depression began. Many enterprises including large enterprises stopped to accept new college graduates as employee. But they wished to accept rather atypical workers. The deregulation of labor market was carried out in 1990 er under the effect of the globalization in this period. The enterprises of the manufacturing industries wished to cut down the productive costs of their companies from the pressure of international competition of other countries, which can use cheaper wages. And further the neo-liberalism stream influenced on Japanese enterprises and politicians. The Japanese government under the Prime Minister Koizumi and the financial minister Takenaka tried to deregulate economic regulations such as employment laws. And from this deregulation, <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> increased not only in special sectors but also in ordinary manufacture. In the second part, I would like to investigate the effect of the world financial crisis upon the <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> after 2008, namely drastic increase of employment losses of <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> with short social safety nets. As the increase of <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> in this period was too rapid and the social safety net for this <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> was not sufficiently equipped, many atypical employee have lost their work for example in automobile industry and electric industry from September, 2008 and as consequence their situation became worse.

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> {{on the ability}} of the labour market to {{function}} depends on how it is used. In this paper we first define three motives for the use of atypical employment: adjustment to fluctuations in business activity, improvement of personnel selection by extending probationary periods, and substitution of permanent employment in order to cut costs. We discuss what efficiency effects these types of usage have. When examined theoretically, it is possible to cite not only efficiency gains but also efficiency losses for each motive. For fixed-term contracts, {{the most common form of}} <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> in Germany, we use individual data at firm and individual level to examine the extent to which the usage in Germany corresponds with these motives for using <b>atypical</b> <b>employment,</b> and what evidence there is of the efficiency effects.

40|$|There is no {{widespread}} {{consensus on}} {{what constitutes a}} precarious form of employment. The dividing line between atypical (flexible) and precarious employment is blurred and the analysis shows important differences across sectors in their use, extension, employer perceptions and trade union acceptance. The most important form of precarious employment is temporary, which is the predominant form also in the TAW and construction sectors, but is also important in private hospitals, industrial cleaning and care. The precariousness linked to instability has been reinforced by the extension of long-term unemployment and cuts in unemployment benefits. Part-time employment is strongly linked to low pay, as the industrial cleaning sector shows very clearly. Even though this <b>atypical</b> form of <b>employment</b> is also important in the public hospital sector, it doesn’t translate into precariousness. Part-time is also present in the care sector and private hospitals. Finally, self-employment is characteristic of the private hospital sector, {{but it is not}} associated with precariousness. Peak bipartite social dialogue has made a significant contribution to enhance the regulatory role of collective bargaining, and more specifically, to introduce clauses improving employment security and reducing precariousness. This can be observed in all sectors analyzed, where clauses have been introduced in national-sector collective agreements in line with recommendations laid down in peak inter-confederal agreements for collective bargaining signed since 1997. In all sectors, the crisis and in particular the 2012 labour market reform has introduced new elements that have increased tensions between social partners, and in some cases, led to a paralysis of collective bargaining, as TAW sector clearly shows. Particularly important in this regard have been the extension of temporary opting out by the employer as well as the limits imposed on the temporary extension of collective agreements (Ultractividad). The reform has certainly eroded the regulatory and protective capacity of collective bargaining, and has introduced elements dampening workers’ voice. This is a key dimension of precariousness in order to understand future developments. But there are also examples of continued cooperation, even during the crisis and after the 2012 reform. This would be the case of the construction sector, to a large extent explained by a) a shared blaming of the state as both the cause and solution for overcoming the crisis (similarly to what was also observed in the cleaning sector) and b) the institutionalization of social dialogue around a number of bi-partite bodies at sectoral level that do not restrict negotiations and dialogue to the periodical renewal of the collective agreement. The extension of <b>atypical</b> forms of <b>employment,</b> deriving in some cases in precariousness, has been reinforced by the high unemployment rate, but the analysis also shows very different logics across the sectors analyzed. In the case of the cleaning and care sectors, a) an easily replaceable workforce and b) increasing competition between private companies for being awarded public tenders, has led to a downward pressure on labour costs. At the same time, this has triggered a reduction in working time and an extension of low pay. In the case of public hospitals, <b>atypical</b> forms of <b>employment</b> have been introduced as a consequence of public spending cuts, but precariousness remains very limited in scope. In private hospitals, <b>atypical</b> forms of <b>employment</b> are more widespread than in the public sector and derive very often from the need to make compatible a job in the public and the private sectors. In the case of construction, there has not been an extension of atypical forms of employment; both unions and employers acknowledge the intrinsically temporary character of their activity. In this vein, precariousness does not derive directly from temporary employment, but from high unemployment and declining unemployment protection coverage. In some of the sectors analysed, trade unions have prioritized maintaining employment levels over wage increases or maintaining working time. Even though this has contributed in some cases to extend forms of precariousness like low pay, it is a strategy supported by workers provided the high (long-term) unemployment rate. It is also important to remark how in some sectors like construction, trade unions have paid particular attention in their relationship with employers to the unemployed, which goes against the essence of the so-called insider-outsider divide. Few joint initiatives have been developed at sectoral level in recent years in order to improve the position of precarious workers. First, because the emphasis has been placed on maintaining employment levels rather than on improving the conditions of those already employed. Secondly, because another concern, particularly for trade unions, has been to restore social dialogue with employers and manage to re-negotiate sectoral collective agreements. However, there are positive experiences like now the cleaning and care sectors where employers and trade unions have established mechanisms in order for workers to certify the skills acquired and obtain professional certificates...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} report {{considers the}} regular employment {{relationship in the}} area of conflict of labour market flexibilisation. First of all there is an overview on the debate surrounding the significance and development of the regular employment relationship. Publications dealing with the origin, extension and erosion of the regular employment relationship form the basis of this. It remains disputed whether it is possible to speak of a serious erosion of the regular employment relationship in view of {{the increase in the number}} of <b>atypical</b> forms of <b>employment.</b> The reason given for the spread of <b>atypical</b> forms of <b>employment</b> is the adjustment of the labour market to the changes in the prevailing conditions. In order to explain these processes, there follows an overview of the economic debate surrounding the flexibilisation and deregulation of the labour market. Here market-radical/neoliberal and institutional economics approaches stand opposed to each other. Deregulation proposals and their implementation in the laws on employment promotion, the hiring out of labour, working hours and such like are presented briefly. The criticism of deregulation, which is debated in literature on economics, is also dealt with. The employment effects of the deregulation measures are regarded as rather slight on the strength of empirical studies. The thesis that deregulation contributes to the erosion of the regular employment relationship have thus been rather weakened. It is more the case that a number of further influential factors must be taken into account. These include the structural change in the economy (service society), a changed employment strategy among businesses (lean employment) and the change in the structure of society (individualisation). A few selected publications are referred to in order to present these points of view. In general there is broad agreement that future forms of employment will be more flexible, but that they will have to be placed in a stable framework so that permanent exclusion processes do not arise. The report concludes by dealing with various proposals for re-regulation. Here the starting point taken is less a uniform pattern of normality and more a variety of employment forms existing side-by-side. Forms of regulation are sought which facilitate an arrangement of new employment forms which would be tolerated by society.

30|$|Going beyond {{descriptive}} evidence, a {{large body}} of recent research has analysed both wage gaps and transition probabilities between <b>atypical</b> and standard <b>employment</b> types. Regarding wage gaps experienced by fixed-term workers, a recent study shows that, controlling for personal characteristics and occupational and firm-specific effects, there is a wage gap of about 10 [*]% attributable to the type of contract (Pfeifer 2012). With respect to temporary work agency employees, controlling for individual characteristics, there is a considerable raw wage gap stemming from differences in the collective agreements of agency firms and user firms, tasks, skills and experience amounting to about 40 – 50 [*]% (Baumgarten et al. 2012). Controlling for socio-economic characteristics of workers and job characteristics, the corrected wage gap has been estimated at around 32 [*]% in the past (Jahn 2010); but taking into account tenure and work experience it was estimated at around 15 – 22 [*]% for full-time agency workers (Lehmer and Ziegler 2011). Part-time work is also characterized by a wage gap after correcting for worker and job characteristics (Wolf 2010). Furthermore, {{there is some evidence that}} marginal part-time workers receive significantly lower gross hourly wages than other part-time workers (Voss and Weinkopf 2012).|$|R
