2500|$|The {{summer before}} her {{freshman}} year of high school, Melinda Sordino meets Andy Evans at a senior party. Outside the woods, Andy rapes her. Melinda calls 9-1-1, but {{does not know what}} to say and runs home. The police come and break up the party, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> arrested. Melinda does not tell anyone what happened to her, and nobody asks. She starts high school at Merryweather High School as an outcast since all her old friends left her, and is shunned by her peers for calling the police. She remains silent and sinks into depression. Melinda is befriended by Heather, a new girl, who clings to Melinda only to ditch her for [...] "the Marthas", so she can belong to a clique instead of being an outcast like Melinda. As Melinda's depression deepens, she begins to skip school, withdrawing from her already distant parents and other authority figures, who see her silence as means of getting [...] "attention". She slowly befriends her lab partner, David Petrakis, who encourages her to speak up for herself.|$|E
2500|$|The spun fibers are {{generally}} divided into animal fibers, plant and synthetic fibers. [...] These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers, respectively. [...] Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of {{animals such as}} sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). [...] Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana fiber, soy and corn. [...] Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. [...] Common synthetic fibers include acrylics, polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. [...] Of these types, wool is generally favored for knitting, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting; however, wool is generally less convenient to clean <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> allergic to it. [...] It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. [...] Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and Egyptian cotton are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.|$|E

[...] "The convent has a chapel, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{admitted}} on Sunday to the Mass. You don't see the poor creatures that are shut up there, but I am told you can hear them sing. It's a wonder they have any heart for singing! Some Sunday I shall make bold to go. It seems to me I should know her voice in fifty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be so {{rough on}} yourself," [...] said Inglewood, in serious distress. [...] "The {{dullness}} isn't your fault or the whisky's. Fellows who don't-- fellows like me I mean--have {{just the same}} feeling that it's all rather flat and a failure. But the world's made like that; it's all survival. Some people are made to get on, like Warner; <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> made to stick quiet, like me. You can't help your temperament. I know you're much cleverer than I am; but you can't help having all the loose ways of a poor literary chap, and I can't help having all the doubts and helplessness of a small scientific chap, {{any more than a}} fish can help floating or a fern can help curling up. Humanity, as Warner said so well in that lecture, really consists of quite different tribes of animals all disguised as men." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the first}} season ended without a {{declaration}} from my lord, Lady Kew carried off her young lady to Scotland, where it also so happened that Lord Farintosh was going to shoot, and people made what surmises they chose upon this coincidence. Surmises, why not? You who know the world, {{know very well that}} if you see Mrs. So-and-so's name in the list of people at an entertainment, on looking down the list you will presently be sure to come on Mr. What-d'-you-call-'em's. If Lord and Lady of Suchandsuch Castle, received a distinguished circle (including Lady Dash), for Christmas or Easter, without reading farther the names of the guests, you may venture on any wager that Captain Asterisk is one of the company. These coincidences happen every day; <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> so anxious to meet other people, and so irresistible is the magnetic sympathy, I suppose, that they will travel hundreds of miles in the worst of weather to see their friends, and break your door open almost, provided the friend is inside it.|$|E
50|$|It {{came under}} a lot of {{criticism}} from Southampton residents, as first by people who thought that the service was unnecessary and would only add to the congestion.

40|$|A {{frequently}} asked {{question is to}} know if the SAMCEF formulation of hydro-elastic problems allows a correct representation of the rigid body modes.

50|$|In the USA, life {{insurance}} companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, {{with the exception of}} Civil Rights Act compliance requirements.

50|$|A unique {{celestial}} body, the Red Moon travels between {{worlds in}} a somewhat erratic, yet possible to predict pattern (astronomers have devised ways to establish the Red Moon's course, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> born with the innate ability of sensing its coming to the world they are on). It is the scourge of all beings, as whatever living thing is basked in its light mutates both physically and mentally, becoming a raving monster.|$|E
