The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Fiasco, {{along with}} rappers Common, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, has been {{credited}} as {{a pioneer of}} the conscious hip hop movement, which focuses on social issues. [...] Subjects touched upon on Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor include absent parents, terrorism, Islam and religion, war, and prostitution. [...] Fiasco attributes his interest in social issues to his highly cultured upbringing, as he describes his mother as [...] "very intellectual" [...] and his father as a [...] "Renaissance man". [...] He rejects the misogyny common in hip hop, which he discusses in the song [...] "Hurt Me Soul". [...] Despite this, Fiasco is strongly opposed to censorship in music: [...] "If we're going to [...] that are offensive, then we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> blind and deafen everyone. Come on, man. Let's focus on education and literacy and poverty." ...|$|E
500|$|The deal {{attracted}} mass {{attention from}} the media. Neil Harman, then of the Daily Mail, questioned the power broadcasters and Premier League chairman now had over fixture scheduling. He concluded his piece with a warning: [...] "The game has already reached saturation coverage, now {{it is likely to}} be choked. Football on six days out of seven per week will be good for no-one." [...] The Independent noted that this was a [...] "remarkable coup" [...] for BSkyB, given the company's fluctuating fortunes. The Guardian correspondent David Lacey suggested that fans were the biggest losers: [...] "A lot of people who want to watch matches regularly in future <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> buy a bond or a dish." [...] Bryan Davies, Baron Davies of Oldham described the arrangement as [...] "absolutely appalling" [...] and Football Supporters' Association chairman Craig Brewin criticised the [...] "obscene" [...] amounts of money clubs earned as part of the deal.|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, while {{commenting on}} defense {{programs}} {{likely to be}} cut following the change in government, John Young, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, stated that the VH-71 [...] "is very high on that list". The rising cost of VH-71 program contrasted poorly with President Barack Obama's stance on curbing government spending; during a White House gathering in February 2009 President Obama commented that the procurement process had [...] "gone amok and we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fix it." [...] He additionally stated that [...] "The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me." [...] In March 2009 the projected total cost for the planned 28 VH-71s was over $13billion. [...] On 6 April 2009 the proposed Defense budget announced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates had not included funding for the VH-71. [...] On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Navy announced that the contract was officially canceled, and that remaining funds were to be reinvested in upgrades to the existing fleet of VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters. [...] Nine VH-71s had been completed at time of the cancellation.|$|E
500|$|Hoxha {{delivered}} {{his speech to}} the Conference on November 16; he [...] "spoke of the tremendous Soviet pressures to which the Albanian party and government had been subjected after the Bucharest meeting... The only crime his régime had committed, the Albanian leader added, was {{that it did not}} agree that the Chinese communist party should be summarily and unjustly condemned. For this it had been treated in a manner that was shabby, anti-Marxist and uncomradely. Hoxha's speech had a shattering effect on the Moscow gathering." [...] Amongst other things Hoxha said that, according to Khrushchev, the Party of Labour and Albania itself [...] "should merely applaud and approve, but express no opinion of its own. But this is neither Marxist nor acceptable. Marxism-Leninism has granted us the right to have our say, and no one can take this from us, either by means of political and economic pressure, or by means of threats and names they might call us." [...] According to Alia, Khrushchev [...] "tried to appear calm" [...] when first replying, reading his written text [...] "almost mechanically" [...] in regards to China but as soon as he began to reply to Hoxha's speech [...] "he lost his head and began to shout, scream and splutter." [...] Khrushchev was said to have angrily remarked, [...] "Comrade Hoxha, you have poured a bucket of filth over me: you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wash it off again." [...] Jon Halliday states that, [...] "On this occasion Hoxha truly succeeded in putting himself and Albania on the world map. His denunciation of Khrushchev made headlines round the world and even his harshest critics usually concede that Hoxha turned in an able performance and showed personal courage." [...] In retirement Khrushchev later recalled the Conference and said that Hoxha [...] "bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves. After his speech, comrade Dolores Ibarruri, an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it." ...|$|E

Finally, Kennedy warned of the risks of [...] "a subsequent assimilation within the Conservative fold", adding: [...] "David Cameron has been here often before: from the early days of his leadership he was happy to describe himself as a 'liberal Conservative'.

Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If {{there is to be}} trouble, let it be in my day, so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Elizabeth's {{personality}} and views has been compiled from impressions and descriptions by those she has met. Canadian politician Michael Ignatieff remarked in 2010, after a private audience with the Queen, how he was struck by her [...] "wonderful sense of the absurd" [...] and noted her [...] "sense of humour, that sense of the absurd, that sense of comedy of life has survived 60 years of gruelling public life." [...] After a weekend at Balmoral Castle hosted by the Queen, Canadian Governor General Michaëlle Jean recounted witnessing a relaxed, informal home life: Elizabeth and her family preparing a meal together—including a salad dressing devised by the Queen—and doing the washing up afterwards. Lady Pamela Hicks, a cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, commented on Elizabeth's personality as [...] "individualistic". Hicks' mother remembers back to when George VI died. Elizabeth was in Kenya with her husband when she found out, [...] "I’m so sorry, but we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to England," [...] she recalled Elizabeth saying.|$|E
2500|$|Rousey {{appeared}} nude on {{the cover}} of ESPN The Magazines 2012 Body Issue and in a pictorial therein. Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of this goes back to advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so just think that one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever you want your son or daughter, or even your 13-year-old little sister to see, keep that in mind.' So, whatever I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine.
