500|$|An {{investigation}} by the Interstate Commerce Commission discovered a design flaw on a style of passenger car used by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in which the handle of an <b>angle</b> <b>cock,</b> a valve used to close the brake pipe when the car is the last one in the train, {{came into contact with}} a bottom crossmember of the coupler pocket. The <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> would become closed, rendering the brakes on all the trailing cars inoperable. The third car behind 4876, New Haven 8665, was of this design, but the fourth car had a slightly different style of coupler. The difference between the two cars increased the frequency and the intensity of which the <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> at the rear of 8655 would hit the crossmember. Earlier in the morning, the train was stopped outside of Kingston, Rhode Island, because the brakes on the final two cars were [...] "sticking" [...] and could not be released from the locomotive. Upon inspection, the <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> on 8655 was found to be closed and was reopened by the engineer, but, after a locomotive and shift change, the matter was forgotten.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accident}} {{was determined to}} {{have been caused by}} a closed [...] "angle cock", a valve on the front and rear of all locomotives and rail cars used in the train's airbrake system, on the rear of the third car in the train. The handle of the <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> had been improperly placed and had contacted the bottom of the car. Once it was closed the air brake pipe on all the cars behind the closed valve remained at full pressure, keeping the brakes released on those cars while the brakes on the locomotive and first three cars were applied in emergency.|$|E
50|$|A routine {{inspection}} during the train's stop in New York City, inspectors later said, found the <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> in the correct, open position. But an after-accident {{investigation by the}} ICC revealed that {{the handle of the}} <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> {{at the rear of the}} third coach was not in the correct position, as a design flaw on New Haven coach #8665 allowed the handle of the <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> valve to come into contact with the car frame, causing the valve to close. This meant that the engine could only activate the braking power of the first three coaches.|$|E
50|$|Railroads have strict government-approved {{air brake}} testing {{procedures}} for various circumstances when assembling trains or switching out cars en route. After a cut is made between cars in a train {{and the train}} is rejoined, {{in addition to other}} tests, the crew must verify that the brakes apply and release on the rear car (to ensure that all of the brake hoses are connected and the <b>angle</b> <b>cocks,</b> or valves, are opened). In most cases, the engineer is able to use information from the ETD to verify that the air pressure reduces and increases {{at the rear of the}} train accordingly, indicating that proper brake pipe continuity. This device is said to constitute a fail-safe condition.|$|R
6000|$|Talk {{of holding}} converse! Every hair on Crusoe's body, every motion of his limbs, was eloquent with silent language. He gazed into his mother's mild {{eyes as if}} he would read her inmost soul (supposing that she had one). He turned his head to every {{possible}} <b>angle,</b> and <b>cocked</b> his ears to every conceivable elevation, and rubbed his nose against Fan's, and barked softly, in every imaginable degree of modulation, and varied these proceedings by bounding away at full speed over the rocks of the beach, and in among the bushes and out again, but always circling round and round Fan, and keeping her in view! ...|$|R
2500|$|... 1 September 1957 - {{a diesel}} hauled train of 12 wooden {{carriages}} leaves Kingston for Montego Bay. The outbound journey had 900 passengers on board, correlating {{with the design}} limit of 80 passengers per carriage. However, the return journey had 1,600 passengers loaded at 130-150 persons per carriage including hundreds {{of members of the}} Holy Name Society of St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church, hundreds of pickpockets, and their targets the tourists who made up over 1,000 of the total passenger loading. At 23:30 near Kendal, Manchester three shrill whistle blasts signalled that the driver had lost control of the train, and it derailed minutes later at speed. 200 people lost their lives, and 700 sustained injuries in the worst transport disaster in Jamaica's history, and the second worst rail disaster in the world at that time. The cause of the accident was determined to be the closure of an <b>angled</b> wheel (brake) <b>cock,</b> with survivors suggesting that the pickpockets had tampered with the brakes while riding on the carriage platforms. Confidence in the rail service was shaken and much looting and robbing of the dead and injured occurred after the crash. The ensuing investigation found a number of deficiencies within the Jamaica Railway Corporation, which was resultantly given its independence in 1960.|$|R

5000|$|The Federal Express {{departed}} Boston at 11:00 P.M. After making two stops, {{the train}} halted about 70 mi south of Boston. Its brakes were sticking, and a 45-minute inspection occurred. Conductors discovered a closed [...] "angle cock" [...] (a shutoff valve) {{at the rear}} of the third car. The airbrake system aboard the rail cars had angle cocks at each end of each car. Both valves had to be open for the airbraking system to operate. The only closed valve would be that {{at the rear of}} the final car. Airbrakes on trains are powered by a compressed air tank aboard each car. The engine generates air pressure that is supposed to flow through the airbrake system along the entire length of the train. When this pressure is lessened, valves on the pressurized air tanks come open. The air from the tanks put pressure on the brake disks (or the tread of the wheel), which push against the wheels and cause braking to occur. If the cars separate, from one another or from the engine, the pressure automatically drops and the cars will brake to a stop. Closing an <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> at any point along the system keeps the air pressure in the airbrakes high, thereby preventing the engine from reducing the air pressure and activating the braking system.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of January 15, 1953, at Washington's Union Station, the Federal overran {{the end of the}} track and into the concourse. According to {{official}} ICC reports, a design flaw on New Haven coach #8665 allowed the handle of an <b>angle</b> <b>cock</b> valve in the air brake system to come into contact with the car frame, causing the valve to close. This disabled the brakes on all of the following cars, rendering them inoperable by the locomotive operator. Approaching automatic block signal #1339, the engineer attempted to apply the brakes to slow the train, with no effect. The unbraked cars pushed the GG1 locomotive and two passenger cars off the end of Track 16 at the station. They crashed through the Stationmaster's office and fell through the floor of Union Station into the baggage room below. The operator at control Tower [...] "K" [...] had contacted station personnel by phone to warn them of the runaway train and the station was evacuated before the crash. In a remarkable demonstration of the durability of the GG1 engine, engine #4876 was later cut into three pieces, hoisted from the baggage room, and reassembled at the Altoona shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It then re-entered commercial service and went on {{to be one of the}} last-serving GG1 engines. It is, as of 2011, being held for restoration at the B&O Railroad Museum in Baltimore. This crash also inspired the finale for the 1976 film, Silver Streak.|$|E
