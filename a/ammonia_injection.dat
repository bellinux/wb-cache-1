N- 13 ammonia was administered intravenously and cross-sectional images were acquired dynamically using an ECAT III positron emission tomograph with an effective in-plane resolution of 13. 46 mm full-width half-maximum. Time-activity curves were derived from the serial images by assigning regions {{of interest to the}} left ventricular myocardium and left ventricular blood pool. Tracer net extractions were estimated from the myocardial time-activity concentrations at various times after tracer injection and the integral of the arterial input function. Myocardial blood flow was altered by intravenous dipyridamote, morphine, propranolol and partial or complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and ranged from 9 to 860 ml/min per 100 g. Estimates of tracer net extractions were most accurate when determined from the myocardial N- 13 activity concentrations at 60 s divided by the integral of the arterial input function to that time. These estimates correlated with regional myocardial blood flows determined independently by the microsphere technique by y = x (1 − 0. 64 e− 114 /x; SEE = 22. 9; r = 0. 94). First pass extraction fractions of N- 13 ammonia determined noninvasively with this approach declined with higher flows *****in a nonlinear fashion and were similar to those determined invasively by direct intracoronary N- 13 <b>ammonia</b> <b>injections.</b> The findings indicate that an accurate index of regional myocardial blood flow can be obtained noninvasively by high temporal sampling of arterial and myocardial tracer activity concentrations with positron emission tomography.

Premix of petroleum gas, air and NH 3 were burned in a porous gas burner to generate the needed flue gas. Four kinds of pulverized coal were fed as reburning fuel at constant rate of 1 g/min. The coal reburning process parameters including 15 %~ 25 % reburn heat input, temperature range from 1100 °C to 1400 °C and also the carbon in fly ash, coal fineness, reburn zone stoichiometric ratio, etc. were investigated. On the condition of 25 % reburn heat input, maximum of 47 % NO reduction with Yanzhou coal was obtained by pure coal reburning. Optimal temperature for reburning is about 1300 °C and fuel-rich stoichiometric ratio is essential; coal fineness can slightly enhance the reburning ability. The temperature window for <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection</b> is about 700 °C~ 1100 °C. CO can improve the NH 3 ability at lower temperature. During advanced reburning, 72. 9 % NO reduction was measured. To achieve more than 70 % NO reduction, Selective Non-catalytic NOx Reduction (SNCR) should need NH 3 /NO stoichiometric ratio larger than 5, while advanced reburning only uses common dose of ammonia as in conventional SNCR technology.

Here, we quantified nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and N loss pathways associated with MCs, compared with inorganic fertilizer and manure. In a 26 -day greenhouse experiment with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), the effects of application technique (surface application vs. injection) and N source (control, two types of MC, three inorganic fertilizers or pig slurry) were compared. We measured yield, ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission and denitrification. With surface application, NUE for MCs (38 % for MC 1 and 22 % for MC 2) was significantly lower than for calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN; 61 %) and comparable with PS (25 %). This was most likely due to higher <b>ammonia</b> emissions. After <b>injection,</b> the NUE of MC was comparable with that of CAN. Denitrification and N 2 O emission from surface-applied MC were comparable with those from surface-applied PS. After injection, MC behaved similarly to inorganic fertilizers. We conclude that MCs should be injected to maximize NUE and to fulfil their potential as inorganic fertilizer replacement. Significant NUE differences between MCs suggest the possibility for further optimization of the MC production process...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate different injection methods for slurry on ley established on various soils. In full-scale experiments the placements of the slurry as well as ammonia emissions and yields were measured after injection in open slots with three techniques: pressurised injec-tion (PI), shallow injection with V-shaped discs (SIO 1), and shallow injection with two angled discs (SIO 2). The performance between the injectors varied and only the SIO 2 was able to place the slurry in ley below soil surface on all three soil types. The ammonia release was on average halved after injection with SIO 2 compared to band spreading, however there was an average loss of 19 kg N ha- 1. A tine for shallow injection in closed slots (tubulator) was therefore developed. In small scale with single tines, the tubulator was compared to SIO 2 with regards to slurry placement, ammonia emissions and draught requirements. <b>Ammonia</b> losses after <b>injection</b> with the tubulator tine were only 1. 6 % of the total applied ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) compared to 27 % with the SIO 2. The draught requirement for the tubulator was roughly the same, or a little higher than the SIO 2 tine.

It was found that while some of the NO{sub x} reduction in the plasma deNO{sub x} demonstration experiments could be attributed to the enhanced thermal breakdown of NH{sub 3 } into NO{sub x} reducing radicals, the effect of using the plasma accounted for 15 [...] 35 % absolute additional NO{sub x} reduction beyond any thermal benefit.

The MS data recorded for ammonium adducts ([M+NH 4]+) of TAGs, DAGs, and MAGs were consistent with stepwise fragmentation mechanisms. In the first step, ammonium ion in [M+NH 4]+ donates proton to acylglycerol and ammonia is released. In the second step, FFA is cleaved from protonated TAG, water from protonated 1, 3 -DAG and MAG, both FFA and water from protonated 1, 2 -DAG, hence leading to formation of [DAG]+ ion from TAG and 1, 3 -DAG, [DAG]+ and [MAG]+ ions from 1, 2 -DAG, and [MAG]+ ion from MAG. In the third step, [DAG]+ ion of TAG is fragmented to yield [Acyl]+, [Acyl + 74]+, [DAG− 74]+ ions, [DAG] ion of 1, 3 -DAG to [Acyl]+ ions, and [MAG]+ ion of MAG to protonated FAs, which are decomposed to water and [Acyl]+ ions in the fourth step.

40|$|The work {{undertaken}} {{in this thesis}} aim at improving the dimensional stability of particleboards caused by water absorption and stress relaxation both of which often occur simultaneously in finished composite board products. Dimensional instability was quantified by measuring the board percent thickness increase resulting from: i) springbuck on press opening; ii) reversible swelling subjected to moisture or solvent absorption and, iii) irreversible swelling due to stress release The reversible swelling was measured after a complete wetting or a humidity cycle from low to high humidity levels. The irreversible swelling was assessed after a complete drying or a humidity cycle from high to low humidity levels. Chemical modification of wood aimed at reducing the reversible swelling due to moisture absorption was attempted after the sequential replacement of water in wood by solvents. P. radiata and E. Obliqua blocks saturated with water were sequentially treated with polar followed by non-polar solvents in order to replace {{the water in the}} woods. Both species showed about 30 % retention of their original (green) volume after the final stage of treatment. The partially swollen P. radiata blocks were then chemically treated with the wood cell wall-bulking and cross-linking agents, i. e. acetic anhydride and paraformaldehyde respectively. Wood thickness swell was monitored through cyclic wetting and drying tests. The results showed that the dimensional stability of neither the acetylated nor the paraformaldehyde treated sample were improved as quantified by the anti-swelling efficiency (ASE). The presence of a catalyst (ferric chloride) was necessary to enhance the cell wall cross-linking and to improve the wood dimensional stability. This work identified that a chemical reaction between the reagents and the wood is necessary for achieving dimensional stability. Stress relaxation from springbuck and irreversible recovery are inherent in wood particles which have been stressed. Much of this work focused on reducing this stress in situ during wood composite panel consolidation. Chemical conditioning of wood materials by ammonia in situ during consolidation was studied using phenolic-based resin systems. Ammonium hydroxide (source for ammonia) was found to accelerate the curing of phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde (PRF). Accelerated curing was also found for 50 : 50 (w/w) mixtures of PRF and phenol-urea-formaldehyde (PUF) at low temperatures between 45 C and 75 C and in the presence of formaldehyde. The PRF:PUF (50 : 50) resin system showed a significantly faster cure than the PRF resin in the presence of ammonium hydroxide at all levels of temperatures investigated. The resin system also showed shorter gel times than those of the PRF at different weight portions of ammonium hydroxide additions. Preliminary chemical structural analysis of both resin systems catalysed by ammonium hydroxide using Infrared (IR) analyser showed evidence for the presence of an azomethine group which indicated that the ammonia was being incorporated into the resin structure. Single layer particleboards were manufactured at low temperatures using the PRF binder and <b>ammonia.</b> Gaseous <b>injection</b> of <b>ammonia</b> in situ during board consolidation was achieved by using a laboratory press fitted with perforated plattens. An optimum pressing schedule was established whereby the ammonia was injected after the mat had reaching its final thickness in a sealed press system. The effects of pressing temperature, PRF resin loading and gas pressure on board vertical density profile, MOR, MOE, IB and thickness swell were studied. The results showed that the ammonia gas-injected boards consolidated at both temperatures of 50 C and 100 C had more uniform density profiles than those of the hot-pressed boards at the temperature of 180 C, however, the MOR, MOE, IB and thickness swell were less satisfactory. The MOR, MOE, IB and thickness swell of the ammonia gas-injected boards were bench marked against the requirements for standard grade High Moisture Resistant (HIR) particleboards in accordance with the AS/NZS 1859. 1 : Part 1 (1997), and were found to be below the acceptable standard. Particleboards bonded with PRF:PUF 50 : 50 (w/w) resin catalysed by ammonia gas were also produced. The board MOR, MOE, lB and thickness swell were less superior than those bonded with PRF, although ammonia was found to accelerate the cure of both resin systems. This was thought to be attributable to a curing reaction that was too rapid between the ammonia and the resin system. The pressing time and temperature may need to be shortened and lowered respectively for board property improvement. The effect of wood particle size on the properties of ammonia gas-injected particleboards was investigated. Large size particles were found to increase the MOR and MIE irrespective of pressing methods. However, boards made from small size particles were found to have higher lB's than those of large size particles. This was thought to be due to better gas penetration. Recommendations are provided for further work to enhance the properties of ammonia-catalysed PRF boards. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIncubating unfertilized {{sea urchin}} eggs in weak bases {{activates}} nuclear centering, DNA synthesis, and chromosome cycles. These effects were initially attributed to raising the intracellular pH (pHi), but later experiments indicated that these weak bases {{also lead to}} increases in reduced pyridine nucleotides. These findings raised the question whether the activation of the nucleus was due to increased pHi or to increased NAD(P) H or possibly other effects. This report attempts to clarify how ammonia activates eggs by independently altering NADPH and pHi. To increase the pHi, unfertilized eggs were injected with zwitterionic buffers. This stimulated pronuclear centering, DNA synthesis, and nuclear envelope breakdown; {{there appeared to be}} a threshold corresponding to the fertilized pHi. However, like incubation in <b>ammonia,</b> <b>injection</b> of base also increased NAD(P) H. The NAD(P) H rise caused by directly raising the pHi occurred in the presence of intracellular calcium chelators, indicating that calcium is not required. Increasing NAD(P) H alone did not activate nuclear centering, DNA synthesis, or nuclear envelope breakdown. Although these experiments cannot eliminate a role for the NADPH increase in initiating events leading to nuclear centering and entry into mitosis, they provide additional and strong evidence that increasing the pHi may be a primary signal...|$|E

This project develops a family of novel NO{sub x} control technologies, Second Generation Advanced Reburning (SGAR), which have a potential to achieve 90 +% NO{sub x} control at a significantly lower cost than Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). Phase I consists of six tasks: Task 1. 1, project coordination and reporting deliverables; Task 1. 2, kinetics of Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } reactions with flue gas components; Task 1. 3, 0. 1 {times} 10 {sup 6 } Btu/hr optimization studies; Task 1. 4, 1. 0 {times} 10 {sup 6 } Btu/hr process development tests; Task 1. 5, mechanism development and modeling; and Task 1. 6, design methodology and application.

40|$|While the NH 3 – SCR {{technology}} {{has become the}} dominant method for the abatement of NOx emitted by diesel trucks and passenger vehicles, the impact of urea injection on particle emissions {{has not yet been}} thoroughly studied. In this paper we examine a typical NH 3 – SCR configuration operating under a simulated malfunctioning condition and we study its impact on both solid and total particle number and size distribution. The tests were conducted on a light-duty diesel engine operating at both low and high load points. Its aftertreatment consisted of a commercial Fe-Zeolite SCR catalyst in series with alternatively a catalytic and an uncoated diesel particle filter. Hydrocarbon post-injection was conducted in some tests to investigate the combined effect of <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection</b> during active DPF regeneration. On average the post-DPF solid > 23 nm and total < 23 nm particle number emissions were increased 129 % (range 80 - 193 %) and 67 % (range 26 - 136 %), respectively, with 100 ppm ammonia slip. This was explicitly related with the NH 3 excess concentration, while the count median diameter of the particle distribution remained unaffected. Based on NH 3 – SCR kinetics, the particles formed should consist of ammonium sulfates or nitrates. No interaction with the unburned HCs emitted during active DPF regeneration in terms of particle formation was observed. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program has}} been completed to make detailed measurements of a pulverized coal flame with reburning and advanced reburning. Maps of species (CO, CO{sub 2 }, O{sub 2 }, NO, HCN, and NH{sub 3 }), temperature and velocity have been obtained which consist of approximately 60 measurements across a cross sectional plane of the reactor. A total of six of these maps have been obtained. Three operating conditions for the baseline flame have been mapped, two operating conditions with reburning, and one operating condition of advanced reburning. In addition to the mapping data, effluent measurements of gaseous products were obtained for various operating conditions. This report focuses on the advanced reburning data. Advanced reburning was achieved in the reactor by injecting natural gas downstream of the primary combustion zone to form a reburning zone followed by a second injection of ammonia downstream of reburning to form an advanced reburning zone. Finally, downstream of the <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection,</b> air was injected to form a burnout or tertiary air zone. The amount of natural gas injected was characterized by the reburning zone stoichiometric ratio. The amount of ammonia injected was characterized by the ammonia to nitrogen stoichiometric ratio or NSR and {{by the amount of}} carrier gas used to transport and mix the ammonia. A matrix of operating conditions where injector position, reburning zone stoichiometric ratio, NSR, and carrier gas flow rate were varied and NO reduction was measured was completed in addition to a map of data at one operating condition. The data showed advanced reburning was more effective than either reburning or NH{sub 3 } injection alone. At one advanced reburning condition over 95 % NO reduction was obtained. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>injection</b> was most beneficial when following a reburning zone which was slightly lean, S. R. = 1. 05, but was not very effective when following a slightly rich reburning zone, S. R. of 0. 95. In the cases where advanced reburning was most effective (reburning S. R. = 1. 05), higher NSR values improved NO reduction but NSR was secondary to NH{sub 3 } injector location. The optimal location for injection was found to coincide with changes in the temperature field. The mapped temperature, species and velocity data for advanced reburning showed that the largest drops in NO occurred in a region where the O{sub 2 } concentration was between 0. 7 and 3. 0 %, NH{sub 3 } was between 0 and 2961 ppm, and temperatures were between 1274 and 1343 K. These are similar to optimal conditions known for SNCR. Significant NO reductions were seen when NSR values were near one, suggesting NH{sub 3 } was very effective at NO reduction when surrounding temperature and species conditions were favorable. Because this was only one detailed set of data, it is difficult to conclude that these conditions are optimal or need to exist for optimal NO reduction. More detailed mapping data at other operating conditions would be useful in identifying optimal advanced reburning conditions...|$|E
40|$|The power {{industry}} in the U. S. is faced with meeting regulations to reduce the emissions of mercury compounds from coal-fired plants. Injecting a sorbent such as powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the flue gas {{represents one of the}} simplest and most mature approaches to controlling mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. The purpose of this test program was to evaluate the long-term mercury removal capability, long-term mercury emissions variability, and operating and maintenance (O&M) costs associated with sorbent injection on a configuration being considered for many new plants. Testing was conducted by ADA Environmental Solutions (ADA) at Rocky Mountain Power’s (RMP) Hardin Station through funding provided by DOE/NETL, RMP, and other industry partners. The Hardin Station is a new plant rated at 121 MW gross that was first brought online in April of 2006. Hardin fires a Powder River Basin (PRB) coal and is configured with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOx control, a spray dryer absorber (SDA) for SO 2 control, and a fabric filter (FF) for particulate control. Based upon previous testing at PRB sites with SCRs, very little additional mercury oxidation from the SCR was expected at Hardin. In addition, based upon results from DOE/NETL Phase II Round I testing at Holcomb Station and results from similarly configured sites, low native mercury removal was expected across the SDA and FF. The main goal of this project was met—sorbent injection was used to economically and effectively achieve 90 % mercury control as measured from the air heater (AH) outlet to the stack for a period of ten months. This goal was achieved with DARCO® Hg-LH, Calgon FLUEPAC®-MC PLUS and ADA Power PAC PREMIUM brominated activated carbons at nominal loadings of 1. 5 – 2. 5 lb/MMacf. An economic analysis determined the twenty-year levelized cost to be 0. 87 mills/kW-hr, or $ 15, 000 /lb Hg removed. No detrimental effects on other equipment or plant operations were observed. The results of this project also filled a data gap for plants firing PRB coal and configured with an SCR, SDA, and FF, as many new plants are being designed today. Another goal of the project was to evaluate, on a short-term basis, the mercury removal associated with coal additives and coal blending with western bituminous coal. The additive test showed that, at this site, the coal additive known as KNX was affective at increasing mercury removal while decreasing sorbent usage. Coal blending was conducted with two different western bituminous coals, and West Elk coal increased native capture from nominally 10 % to 50 %. Two additional co-benefits were discovered at this site. First, it was found that native capture increased from nominally 10 % at full load to 50 % at low load. The effect is believed to be due to an increase in mercury oxidation across the SCR caused by a corresponding decrease in <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection</b> when the plant reduces load. Less ammonia means more active oxidation sites in the SCR for the mercury. The second co-benefit was the finding that high ammonia concentrations can {{have a negative impact on}} mercury removal by powdered activated carbon. For a period of time, the plant operated with a high excess of <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection</b> necessitated by the plugging of one-third of the SCR. Under these conditions and at high load, the mercury control system could not maintain 90 % removal even at the maximum feed rate of 3. 5 lb/MMacf (pounds of mercury per million actual cubic feet). The plant was able to demonstrate that mercury removal was directly related to the <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection</b> rate in a series of tests where the ammonia rate was decreased, causing a corresponding increase in mercury removal. Also, after the SCR was refurbished and <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection</b> levels returned to normal, the mercury removal performance also returned to normal. Another goal of the project was to install a commercial-grade activated carbon injection (ACI) system and integrate it with new-generation continuous emissions monitors for mercury (Hg-CEMs) to allow automatic feedback control on outlet mercury emissions. This was accomplished and the plant can now be operated to control carbon injection based on either the overall mercury removal or an outlet mercury emission rate. By integrating these systems, it was determined that the plant could reduce powdered activated carbon consumption, especially at low load, because, at Hardin, native mercury capture increases from less than 20 % to about 50 % at low load and the carbon injection rate can be decreased accordingly. Currently, the plant is operating to automatically control emissions to below 0. 9 lb/TBtu (pounds of mercury per million British thermal units) at carbon loadings of 0. 5 to 1. 5 lb/MMacf. During the final phase of the Long-Term test, the ACI system was operated by plant personnel. The estimated O&M cost for a single Hg-CEM system is $ 15, 500 /yr. The Hg-CEMs performed well throughout the project. This project began shortly after Thermo Fisher first offered the Mercury Freedom System™ on a commercial basis and progressed though several iterations, improvements, and upgrades to the hardware and software. Indeed, there was a ten-fold increase in the precision and accuracy of the units during the course of the project due to several successful upgrades. In their present condition, the Hg-CEMs measure mercury to a precision of about ± 0. 05 μg/wscm (micrograms of mercury per wet standard cubic meter of gas), and only require occasional fine-tuning of the calibration coefficients. The quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocol required to keep the units operating at their optimal performance was also developed and perfected during the course of the project. ADA Environmental Solutions (ADA) developed a daily calibration procedure that surpasses the requirements specified in the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), and a weekly diagnostic program that ensures that the systems are operating properly and receive the necessary maintenance. For the most part, the systems passed the daily, weekly, and quarterly QA/QC requirements as well as four performance verification tests using the Ontario Hydro (O-H) and Sorbent Trap Methods (STM) for the first test and the EPA Method 30 A (M 30 A) procedure for the remaining three. However, some improvements are still necessary before the system can meet all of the requirements. These involve tests that challenge the system with oxidized mercury (Hg+ 2). These tests could not be passed at Hardin in spite of trying several improvements suggested by ADA or Thermo Fisher...|$|E
40|$|Evaporative cooling {{of fluids}} under {{compression}} reduces the input work with relatively low equipment costs. Currently, water injection at about 1 % {{of the air}} mass-flow rate is used; additional cooling can be obtained with higher injection rates. Water is non-toxic and relatively non-corrosive, which makes it the fluid of choice for evaporatively-cooled compressors in gas turbines. Water does have a relatively low vapor-pressure, that tends to limit the amount evaporated, although its large heat of vaporization partially compensates for this deficiency. Residence times in compressors are {{of the order of}} hundredths of seconds. Hence, the time available for evaporation is brief. One expectation is that higher-vapor-pressure refrigerants could evaporate at higher rates, and hence overcome some of the limitations of water. We present here a study of such a refrigerant, but the results fall short of expectations: evaporation is projected to occur fast initially, but the reduced work expectation does not fully materialize. A heat-and-mass transfer model that predicts droplet evaporation is used for our projections. Three parameters are varied to determine their effects on the compressor calculated performance: injection ratio, initial droplet radius, and pressure ratio. Low compressor discharge temperatures appear possible, which in some applications in gas turbines could uphold definite promise for recuperative cycles. Yet, the difficulties associated with the combustion process involving a refrigerant may very well override all other considerations. For the general case of evaporatively-cooled compression, high-pressure substances would need much larger heats of vaporization than the ones considered here for their application to be sustainable as compared with water.

The SNRB technology utilizes dry sorbent injection upstream of the baghouse for removal of SOx and <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection</b> upstream of a zeolitic selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst incorporated in the baghouse to reduce NOx emissions. Because the SOx and NOx removal processes require operation at elevated gas temperatures (800 [...] 900 F) for high removal efficiency, high-temperature fabric filter bags {{are used in the}} baghouse. The SNRB technology evolved from the bench and laboratory pilot scale to be successfully demonstrated at the 5 -MWe field scale. This report represents the completion of Milestone M 14 as specified in the Work Plan. B and W tested the SNRB pollution control system at a 5 -MWe demonstration facility at Ohio Edison`s R. E. Burger Plant located near Shadyside, Ohio. The design and operation were influenced by the results from laboratory pilot testing at B and W`s Alliance Research Center. The intent was to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of the SNRB process. The SNRB facility treated a 30, 000 ACFM flue gas slipstream from Boiler No. 8. Operation of the facility began in May 1992 and was completed in May 1993. About 2, 300 hours of high-temperature operation were achieved. The main emissions control performance goals of: greater than 70 % SO{sub 2 } removal using a calcium-based sorbent; greater than 90 % NOx removal with minimal ammonia slip; and particulate emissions in compliance with the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) of 0. 03 lb/million Btu were exceeded simultaneously in the demonstration program when the facility was operated at optimal conditions.

40|$|Nitrogen oxide {{emissions}} from pulverized coal combustion {{have been and}} will continue to be a regulated pollutant for electric utility boilers burning pulverized coal. Full scale combustion models can help in the design of new boilers and boiler retrofits which meet emissions standards, but these models require validation before they can be used with confidence. The objective of this work was to obtain detailed combustion measurements of pulverized coal flames which implement two NO reduction strategies, namely reburning and advanced reburning, to provide data for model validation. The data were also compared to an existing comprehensive pulverized coal combustion model with a reduced mechanism for NO reduction under reburning and advanced reburning conditions. The data were obtained in a 0. 2 MW, cylindrical, down-fired, variable swirl, pulverized coal reactor. The reactor had a diameter of 0. 76 m and a length of 2. 4 m with access ports along the axial length. A Wyodak, sub-bituminous coal was used in all of the measurements. The burner had a centrally located primary fuel and air tube surrounded by heated and variably swirled secondary air. Species of NO, NO{sub x}, CO, CO{sub 2 } and O{sub 2 } were measured continuously. Aqueous sampling was used to measure HCN and NH{sub 3 } at specific reactor locations. Samples were drawn from the reactor using water quenched suction probes. Velocity measurements were obtained using two component laser doppler anemometry in back-scatter mode. Temperature measurements were obtained using a shielded suction pyrometer. A series of six or more radial measurements at six or more axial locations within the reactor provided a map of species, temperature, and velocity measurements. In total, seven reactor maps were obtained. Three maps were obtained at baseline conditions of 0, 0. 5 and 1. 5 swirl and 10 % excess air. Two maps were obtained under reburning conditions of 0. 78 stoichiometric ratio and 1. 5 swirl and 0. 9 stoichiometric ratio and 0. 5 swirl. And finally, two maps were obtained under advanced reburning conditions both at the same operating condition of 1. 05 stoichiometric ratio in the reburning zone followed by <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection.</b> Numerous effluent measurements were obtained to study the affect of natural gas injection location, stoichiometric ratio, and injection velocity on effluent NO.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} air enrichment in a combustion chamber designed to incinerate aqueous residues is presented. Diesel fuel and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG) were used independently as fuels. An increase of 85 % in the incineration capacity was obtained with nearly 50 % O- 2 in the oxidant gas, in comparison to incineration with air only. The incineration capacity continues increasing for enrichment levels above 50 % O- 2, although at a lower pace. For complete oxy-flame combustion (100 % O- 2), the increase of the incineration capacity was about 110 % relative to the starting conditions and about 13. 5 % relative to the condition with 50 % O- 2. The CO concentration measured near the flame front decreases drastically {{with the increase of}} O- 2 content in the oxidant gas. At the chamber exit, the CO concentration was always near zero, indicating that the chamber residence time was sufficient to complete fuel oxidation in any test setting. For diesel fuel, the NOx was entirely formed in the first region of the combustion chamber. For diesel fuel, there was some increase in the NOx concentration up to 35 % of O- 2; this increase became very sharp after that. From 60 ppm, at operation with air only, the NOx concentration raises to 200 ppm at 35 % O- 2, and then to 2900 ppm at 74 % O- 2. The latter corresponds to six times more NOx in terms of the ratio of mass of NO to mass of residue, compared to the situation of combustion with air only. For LPG, the NOx concentrations reached 4200 ppm at 80 % O- 2, corresponding to nine times more, also in terms of the ratio of mass of NO to mass of residue, in comparison with combustion with air only. Results of different techniques used to control the NOx emission during air enrichment are discussed: (a) variation of the recirculated zone intensity, (b) increase of the spray Sauter mean diameter, (c) fuel staging, (d) oxidizer staging, and (e) <b>ammonia</b> <b>injection.</b> The present paper shows that NOx emission may be controlled without damage of the increase of incineration capacity by the enrichment and with low emission of partial oxidation pollutants such as CO.
