In September 2013 the Spanish Parliament approved some legal reforms in this regard that are summarised in <b>Appendix</b> <b>A.</b> <b>6.</b> By contrast, there are specific procedures for personal debtors both in France and the UK, which may be used by consumers, self-employed individuals and owners of small firms that used personal guarantees to fund their businesses. France has two procedures, the plan de redressement and the procedure de rétablissement personnel, while bankruptcy is the main insolvency procedure for individuals in the UK. 51 It is necessary to remark that, in the UK, the term “bankruptcy” only applies to individuals, while insolvency is the term that is used for companies.

30|$|The {{idea behind}} using {{skeletal}} anchorage for RME is that greater skeletal {{expansion of the}} maxilla could theoretically be obtained. This systematic review found that bone-borne RME was associated with greater opening of the maxillary suture at the incisal foramen (1.8 [*]mm more), first premolars (2.3 [*]mm more), and the first molars (2.0 [*]mm more) compared to conventional RME (Additional file  1 : <b>Appendix</b> <b>6</b> <b>a).</b> This might be explained by a direct force application to the maxilla, which leads to separation of the median suture and displacement of the two maxillary halves [29]. Sutural opening was not assessed for hybrid RME {{in any of the}} identified trials. Interestingly, no significant increase in the external buccal maxillary width at the first molars of either bone-borne (P[*]=[*] 0.22; Additional file  1 : <b>Appendix</b> <b>6</b> <b>a)</b> or hybrid RME (P[*]=[*] 0.54; Additional file  1 : Appendix 6 b) was seen compared to conventional RME.

40|$|We aim {{to define}} a sample of intermediate-z disk galaxies {{harbouring}} central bulges, and a complementary sample of disk galaxies without measurable bulges. We intend to provide colour profiles for both samples, as well as measurements of nuclear, disk, and global colours, which {{may be used to}} constrain the relative ages of bulges and disks. We select a diameter-limited sample of galaxies in images from the HST/WFPC 2 Groth Strip survey, which is divided into two subsamples of higher and lower inclination to assess the role of dust in the measures quantities. Mergers are visually identified and excluded. We take special care to control the pollution by ellipticals. The bulge sample is defined with a criterion based on nuclear surface brightness excess over the inward extrapolation of the exponential law fitted to the outer regions of the galaxies. We extract colour profiles on the semi-minor axis least affected by dust in the disk, and measure nuclear colours at 0. 85 kpc from the centre over those profiles. Disk colours are measured on major axis profiles; global colours are obtained from 2. 6 "-diameter apertures. We obtain a parent sample containing 248 galaxies with known redshifts, spectroscopic or photometric, spanning 0. 1 < z < 1. 2. The bulge subsample comprises 54 galaxies (21. 8 % of the total), while the subsample with no measureable bulges is 55. 2 % of the total (137 galaxies). The remainder (23 %) is composed of mergers. We list nuclear, disk, and global colours (observed and restframe) and magnitudes (apparent and absolute), as well as galaxy colour gradients for the samples with and without bulges. We also provide images, colour maps, plots of spectral energy distributions, major-axis surface brightness profiles, and minor-axis colour profiles for both samples.

Consequently, a core-shell structure had the potency to be highly polarised. Therefore, LABS can be activated efficiently by core-shell RE-NPs via electrical dipole interactions at close separating distances. The high polarised efficiency of the core nucleus was confirmed experimentally via the selective orientation of NPs along two distinct directions (Fig. 2 (a 4 –d 4) and Fig. 3 (a 4, b 4)).|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, a {{tremendous}} amount of new information and data has emerged on seismic sources in the Intermountain United States and their associated processes of earthquake generation. Consequently, the seismic safety of U. S. uranium mill tailings sites, which are located almost exclusively in this region, are being reviewed by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Based on a deterministic and probabilistic re-evaluation of potential seismic hazards at a Title II site in southeastern Utah, three significant issues have been raised which will impact other sites in the Intermountain U. S. required to revisit their seismic design criteria by the NRC. These issues are: (1) whether the NRC's required use of a deterministic approach for assessing seismic hazards is appropriate for Title II uranium mill tailings sites in a region such as the Intermountain U. S.; (2) is the alternative approach of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis acceptable to the NRC for uranium mill tailings sites; and (3) what is the appropriate return period that should be used. Based on our evaluation, we conclude that deterministic ground motion approaches such as the NRC's 10 CFR 40 <b>Appendix</b> <b>A</b> can result in overly conservative seismic design criteria for Title II sites in the Intermountain U. S. and that instead, probabilistic seismic hazard analysis should provide the bases for such criteria. Additionally, as in all decisions of this nature, the selection of a return period for a specific site should be based on what is deemed an acceptable level of risk;. Such levels may vary from site to site depending on the consequences of radionuclide release into the environment. However, the values of 200 and 1000 years cited in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 40 CFR 192. 02 and NRC's <b>Appendix</b> <b>A</b> Criterion <b>6</b> (1) should form the basis for the selected return period. ...|$|R

The task at hand is to find the publicly available price data that best match the price data that the NBS claims/explains it uses in the derivation of real growth rates, and then to apply these publicly available price data to the nominal values in order to derive an alternative set of real growth rates for the years 1978 - 2011.

I was blessed {{with the opportunity to}} take what I had been reading in environmental economics textbooks and apply it to an experience far outside of my comfort zone. The site I worked on was <b>a</b> <b>6,</b> 200 -acre <b>reserve</b> called Jatun Sacha, which was set aside by the Ecuadorian government in 1985. During these six weeks, I was able to immerse myself in an entirely new culture while helping further the efforts of Jatun Sacha. My experience was highly educational and gave me a new way to look at natural resource use and environmental conservation...|$|R

As such, bone-borne RME was associated with less dental expansion at the canine (MD −[*] 0.7 [*]mm; 95 % CI −[*] 1.0 to −[*] 0.4 [*]mm), less buccal tipping at the first premolar (MD −[*] 4.3 °; 95 % CI −[*] 6.9 to −[*] 1.6 °), and less buccal tipping at the first molar (MD −[*] 5.4 °; 95 % CI −[*] 8.0 to −[*] 2.7 °) compared to tooth-borne RME. Additionally, a meta-analysis of two trials indicated that bone-borne RME was associated with less buccal tipping of the first premolar (MD −[*] 4.1 °; 95 % CI −[*] 6.0 to −[*] 2.1 °).|$|R

40|$|In {{this brief}} {{communication}} a new method is outlined for modelling magnification patterns on an observer's plane using a first order approximation to the null geodesic path equations for a point mass lens. For each ray emitted from a source, an explicit calculation {{is made for}} the change in position on the observer's plane due to each lens mass. By {{counting the number of}} points in each small area of the observer's plane, the magnification at that point can be determined. This allows for a very simple and transparent algorithm. A short Matlab code sample for creating simple magnification maps due to multiple point lenses is included in <b>an</b> <b>appendix.</b> Comment: <b>6</b> pages, 4 figures.
