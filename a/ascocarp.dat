5|$|In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the {{hymenium}} (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form {{a characteristic}} hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, {{formation of the}} hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an <b>ascocarp,</b> or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis {{and the production of}} ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.|$|E

50|$|Pecan Anthracnose is an ascomycete fungus {{and has a}} {{life cycle}} {{similar to that of}} other ascomycetes11. Anthracnose has an {{overwintering}} stage and survives as an <b>ascocarp.</b> The <b>ascocarp</b> can survive on fallen nuts, leaves and other plant debris. Ascocarps can be spread by the wind or rain. Then, during a rainy, warm spring or summer, the <b>ascocarp</b> releases it’s ascospores and they go off and infect new plants to create more ascocarps which in turn make more ascospores and the life cycle begins again15. Anthracnose is polycyclic, so it has a sexual stage as conidia when it finds its mating type11.|$|E

50|$|Geoglossum is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Geoglossaceae. They are {{commonly}} called earth tongues. The type species is Geoglossum glabrum.

Geoglossum species are characterized by dark, club-shaped, terrestrial ascocarps with a fertile hymenium continuing downward from the apex of the <b>ascocarp</b> along the stipe, eventually intergrading with a sterile stipe. The ascospores of Geoglossum range from translucent to dark brown, and are , and multiseptate.
