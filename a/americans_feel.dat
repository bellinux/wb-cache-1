2500|$|The {{numbers of}} protesters was {{significantly}} {{smaller than the}} original protests held {{the day after the}} invasion of Iraq had begun when thousands of protesters and many large demonstrations were held around the world in opposition to the war. Amongst the possible reasons are protester [...] "fatigue", the timing of events, poor weather in some cities and that many protest actions are often ignored by the media even if the number of attendees is in the thousands. General apathy towards a war that most <b>Americans</b> <b>feel</b> little connection to as well as general decline in media coverage may have also led to lower turnout. According to a study conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism, war coverage in television, newspaper and Internet stories fell from 23% during the first ten weeks of 2007 to 3% during the same period in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|However, while {{comparing}} the Israel Lobby with the Arab Lobby, Mitchell Bard notes that [...] "From the beginning, the Arab lobby has faced {{not only a}} disadvantage in electoral politics but also in organization. There are several politically oriented groups, {{but many of these}} are one man operations with little financial or popular support." [...] The Arab American Institute is involved in supporting Arab-American political candidates, but, according to award-winning journalist Ray Hanania [...] "it’s nothing compared to the funds that AIPAC raises not just for Jewish American congressmen, but for congressmen who support Israel." [...] Furthermore, Arab American lobbies face a problem of motivation; Jewish <b>Americans</b> <b>feel</b> the need to support their homeland (as well as other states in the Middle East who have signed peace treaties with Israel) in active, organized ways. Arab Americans do not appear to have a similar motivation {{when it comes to their}} own homelands.|$|E

50|$|For instance, we {{are told}} almost daily how the average European or <b>American</b> <b>feels</b> about a topic.

This leads to the idea of an idealized individual, something that is the bedrock of modern economics. Most modern economic theories look at social formations, like organizations, as products of individuals all acting in their own best interest.|$|R
