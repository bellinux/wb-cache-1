40|$|Brittle leaf {{disease of}} date palms”, known in south-ern Tunisia since the 1960 s, has assumed {{epidemic}} pro-portions from 1986 on. The symptoms {{are associated with}} manganese deficiency {{and the presence of}} a small double stranded RNA of host origin. Even though no pathogen has yet been found, some observations do not fit a purely <b>abiotic</b> <b>cause</b> of the disease. In particular, af-fected trees seem to cluster into foci, and mineral analy-ses show {{no significant differences between the}} soils of affected and unaffected trees.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) -like sequences were {{detected in the}} fragmentation layer of acid Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest soils (pH 2. 9 – 3. 4) with high nitrification rates (911. 0 mg g– 1 dry soil week– 1), but were not detected in soils with low nitrification rates (G 0. 5 mg g– 1 dry soil week– 1). In the present study, we investigated whether this low nitrification rate has a biotic cause (complete absence of AOB) or an <b>abiotic</b> <b>cause</b> (unfavorable environmental conditions). Therefore, two soils strongly differing in net nitrification were compared: one soil with a low nitrification rate (location Schoorl) and another soil with a high nitrification rate (location Wekerom) were subjected to liming and/or ammonium amendment treatments. Nitrification was assessed by analysis of dynamics in NH 4 +-N and NO 3 –-N concentrations, whereas the presence and composition of AOB communities were assessed by polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene. Liming, rather than ammonium amendment, stimulated the growth of AOB and their nitrifying activity in Schoorl soil. The retrieved amoA sequences from limed (without and with N amendment) Schoorl and Wekerom soils exclusively belong to Nitrosospira cluster 2. Our study suggests that low nitrification rates in acidic Scots pine forest soils are due to pH-related factors. Nitrosospira cluster 2 detected in these soils is presumably a urease-positive cluster type of AOB...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims Dominant {{tree species}} in {{northern}} temperate forests, for example oak and beech, produce desiccation-sensitive seeds. Despite the potentially major influence of this functional trait on the regeneration {{and distribution of}} species under climate change, little is currently known about the ecological determinants of the persistence of desiccation-sensitive seeds in transient soil seed banks. Knowing which key climatic and microsite factors favour seed survival will help define the regeneration niche for species whose seeds display extreme sensitivity to environmental stress Methods Using the Mediterranean Holm oak (Quercus ilex) forest as a model system, an in situ time-course monitoring of seed water status and viability was performed during the unfavourable winter season in two years with contrasting rainfall, at an instrumented site with detailed climate records. In parallel, {{the characteristics of the}} microhabitat and their influence on the post-winter water status and viability of seeds were investigated in a regional survey of 33 woodlands representative of the French distribution of the species. Key Results Time-course monitoring of seed water status in natural conditions confirmed that in situ desiccation is the main <b>abiotic</b> <b>cause</b> of mortality in winter. Critical water contents could be reached in a few days during drought spells. Seed dehydration rates were satisfactorily estimated using integrative climate proxies including vapour pressure deficit and potential evapotranspiration. Seed water status was therefore determined by the balance between water uptake after a rainfall event and water loss during dry periods. Structural equation modelling of microhabitat factors highlighted the major influence of canopy openness and resulting incident radiation on the ground. Conclusions This study provides part of the knowledge required to implement species distribution models which incorporate their regeneration niche. It is an important step forward in evaluating the ecological consequences of increasing winter drought and environmental filtering due to climate change on the regeneration of the most dominant Mediterranean tree species...|$|E
40|$|In {{temperate}} climates, asparagus reaches peak production five {{to eight}} years after planting and thereafter yield declines until production is no longer economically viable, normally between years 12 to 15. In many of the asparagus producing {{areas of the world}} the availability of land suitable for asparagus production is limited, therefore, replanting of old asparagus beds is undertaken. Replanted asparagus often has poor establishment and a short commercial life compared with planting on sites that have no history of asparagus production. In this research, field trials indicated that replanted stands will yield 20 % to 30 % less marketable asparagus than those on similar sites with no previous asparagus cropping history. Pre-planting treatments with the fungicides thiabendazole and/or metalaxyl did not alleviate the problem but may improve establishment in replant sites. Treatment of plants or field soils with Trichoderma viride did not improve establishment or plant performance in old asparagus soils. The replant problem was common to all asparagus cultivars evaluated with the most vigorous varieties in a replant site also performing best in virgin soils. Plants that died out in replant soil field trials exhibited symptoms typical of Fusarium spp. infections and isolations confirmed the involvement of both F. oxysporum and F. moniliforme in the early decline of replanted asparagus stands. Greenhouse studies confirmed the importance of Fusarium inoculum level in inciting disease in asparagus plants. As inoculum levels increased the disease levels on roots and crowns of developing seedlings also increased and the plant vigour decreased. A Root Necrosis Potential bioassay which measured the infectivity of Fusarium propagules in field soils proved to be useful in separating soils with a previous history of asparagus production from virgin soils. Residual herbicides commonly used in asparagus production significantly reduced asparagus seedling growth at levels likely to be found after several years of asparagus cropping demonstrating the importance of planning for the removal of an old asparagus planting some years before the crop is terminated. Evaluation of soil with and without asparagus cropping history showed that an <b>abiotic</b> <b>cause</b> to the replant problem may also be important. The presence of autotoxic material in asparagus storage roots was confirmed in laboratory experiments and the toxic material reduced growth of asparagus. Bioassays using pre-germinated asparagus seed on blotting paper demonstrated that the toxin was water soluble and heat stable. The toxins were present in roots of all ages and all asparagus cultivars tested. All asparagus cultivars tested were inhibited by the toxin. A range of other plant species were shown to be suppressed by asparagus storage root extract and some species were unaffected. The level of toxicity in replant soils at two sites was monitored over a twelve month period using a lettuce seed, paper bioassay procedure. The toxin levels found in asparagus soils after the termination of the asparagus crop by cultivation was probably only high enough to directly inhibit replanted asparagus for a short time (up to five or six months) after terminating the crop. Autotoxins are likely to be present in old asparagus soils for many years following the termination of the asparagus crop and their importance in the replant problem is most likely to be {{as a result of an}} interaction with the pathogenic Fusarium spp. present. Fusarium appeared to be the main factor involved in the replant problem and inoculum levels of pathogenic Fusarium spp. in soils are likely to be high for many years after asparagus cropping has ceased. In most cases the asparagus replant problem is therefore a replant disease that is likely to persist for many years...|$|E
40|$|Wind is {{the main}} <b>abiotic</b> <b>cause</b> of {{disturbance}} to forests in {{large parts of the}} world, particularly at temperate and boreal latitudes. In the past few decades the consequences of large wind-induced losses have been experienced at various levels, from small forest owners to large-scale, whole-society level. This is particularly relevant for areas, such as Europe, where forests are intensively managed, and the assets exposed to wind hazard are substantial. To better manage forests and commercial tree plantations {{to reduce the risk of}} wind damage, process-based, semi-mechanistic mathematical models such as ForestGALES are used. This model has been parameterised and evaluated for numerous conifer species, which constitute the major plantation types in temperate and boreal biomes. However, the geographical extent and economic importance of fast-growing broadleaved species, such as those of the Eucalyptus genus, and the lack of detailed historical data on wind damage to these species, require that tools for the estimation of the risk of wind damage to these species are developed and evaluated. This is particularly relevant in light of the projected increases of surface temperature due to climate change, and of the frequency and severity of extreme windstorms, that are expected as a consequence of climate change. Fieldwork was conducted in a semi-natural Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) forest in the Asturias region in Northern Spain to acquire data for the parameterisation of ForestGALES for E. globulus, using a tree-pulling experiment. The behaviour of the parameterisation was investigated for different stocking densities to evaluate whether the effects of tree height, stocking density, and presence of a fresh upwind gap are consistent with the literature. This parameterisation was then used to compare the vulnerability to wind damage between E. globulus and Pinus pinaster (Ait.), the predominant plantation species in the Aquitaine region of SW France where extensive damage was experienced from storms Martin (1999) and Klaus (2009). The effects of rooting depth (2 x), growth rate (2 x), presence/absence of a recently created windward gap, and of the predominant wind climate in Aquitaine were investigated in this comparison. In order to aid forest managers with optimal resource allocation for practical applications of ForestGALES, and to provide forest modellers with invaluable insights for the development of robust wind damage risk models, ForestGALES was subjected to a sensitivity analysis. A generalisation of the variance-based method of Sobol’ for the case of correlated variables was used to investigate the sensitivity of the outputs of ForestGALES (the critical wind speeds for stem breakage and uprooting, and the associated probabilities of damage) to variation in its input variables. Almost all the E. globulus trees pulled in Asturias failed by overturning rather than breakage, which allowed for good confidence in the calculations of the overturning moments required for the empirical component of ForestGALES. Resistance to overturning was not significantly influenced by the presence of a tap-root. Modelling the shape of the tree crowns with an ellipsoid provided a good approximation of the geometry of the canopy, but required additional fieldwork as crown width in the four cardinal directions had to be estimated visually prior to the tests. The scarcity of detailed published data on wind damage to E. globulus made evaluating the parameterisation particularly challenging. This impediment was obviated by investigating the behaviour of the parameterisation with regards to the well-known effects of tree height, stocking density, and presence of a fresh upwind gap. The simulations showed that the parameterisation behaved as expected, with vulnerability of E. globulus stands increasing with tree height, stocking density, and the presence of a gap. High initial planting densities, an early thinning, and a final harvesting before the trees have reached a height of 20 – 25 m are recommended to reduce the risk of wind damage to E. globulus. The comparison with P. pinaster showed that E. globulus trees are particularly susceptible to the presence of a recently created windward gap. Therefore, harvesting at neighbouring sites should be minimised, and preferentially performed when the neighbouring stands are still at a young age to take advantage of the fast growth rates of E. globulus. These practices would ensure that in case of wind damage any losses are recovered in a short time. These procedures can reduce the cumulative risk through the rotation, while maintaining competitive yields. The ForestGALES simulations have also highlighted that the silvicultural practices currently in place in Aquitaine expose P. pinaster trees to high levels of cumulative risk (> 20...|$|E

Less {{attention has been}} devoted to secondary extinctions resulting from ecological crises and the effect of community structure on such extinctions. Here we use a trophic network model that combines topological and dynamic approaches to simulate disruptions of primary productivity in palaeocommunities. We apply the model to Permian and Triassic communities of the Karoo Basin, South Africa, and show that while Permian communities bear no evidence of being especially susceptible to extinction, Early Triassic communities appear to have been inherently less stable. Much of the instability results from the faster post-extinction diversification of amphibian guilds relative to amniotes. The resulting communities differed fundamentally in structure from their Permian predecessors. Additionally, our results imply that changing community structures over time may explain long-term trends like declining rates of Phanerozoic background extinctio...|$|R
30|$|We {{employed}} Eq.  3 {{to study}} BEFR across different forest types, with an underlying assumption that biotic factors, namely species diversity and basal area, have direct causal effects on forest productivity. This assumption {{was supported by}} recent BEFR studies (e.g., Zhang et al. 2012; Liang et al. 2015) in terms of biodiversity effects, {{and a majority of}} forest dynamics studies (e.g., Shugart 1984) in terms of basal area effects. It should be noted, however, that we did not consider any abiotic factors in this study except for elevation and slope (Eq.  2) {{due to a lack of}} soil and other environmental records. Subject to the potential omitted-variable bias (Wooldridge 2000), our results should be interpreted with caution. For instance, our results may address the effects of biodiversity on productivity, but the <b>abiotic</b> <b>causes</b> of biodiversity variation across the study region and their potential confounding effect on BEFR were not directly detectable with this database. Nevertheless, as an inherent nature of abiotic factors, their potential effects especially on forest productivity are in general spatially autocorrelated (Legendre 1993; Liang 2012). To this end, we also employed a geospatial model to account for spatial autocorrelation and potential effects of abiotic factors.|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} 1998 – 2001 {{significant}} numbers of vine samples of different varieties, grafted onto different rootstocks, ready for out-planting or planted and declined a few months or years later, were collected or sent to our laboratory to investigate the presence of phytopathogenic fungi. Three hundred eighty rooted cuttings ready for outplanting, 1250 young vines planted and exhibiting decline symptoms {{in the first year}} of establishment, 82 vines two to nine years old and 27 old vines exhibiting the classical esca symptoms were examined.

The low incidence of these fungi isolated in a low percentage of samples suggested that they could not by themselves be the cause of young grapevine decline. <b>Abiotic</b> <b>causes,</b> such as lesions from improperly healed rootstock disbudding sites and graft unions made in the nursery, as well as improper storage and transportation conditions of the propagated material must also have played a role and made the decline more acute.

40|$|While well-recognized as an {{important}} kind of ecological interaction, physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is diverse with varied consequences, presenting challenges for developing and using general understanding.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of LAI {{is of great}} importance to evaluate the structural characteristics of a plant community. Vegetation types remote sensed analysis is {{a useful tool for}} the investigation of structural and functional characteristics of ecosystems. The integration of data acquired at these two different spatial scales contributes to the management of the land use and in particular of protected areas for the conservation of biodiversity. Field measuraments (LAI) and remote sensed data (Landsat 5 TM) were performed in the Circeo National Park and in the Presidential Estate of Castelporziano (located along the coast of Lazio, Italy, and characterised by Mediterranean climate). In this study the relationships between LAI and vegetation indices (NDVI, PVI, SAVI, GVI) were analysed; the NDVI showed the best correlation with the LAI. Using NDVI/LAI low power we estimated the LAI for the entire study areas on a multitemporal basis and plotted different LAI maps.

40|$|Mortality has {{received}} insufficient attention as a fish welfare topic. Here, {{we aim to}} prompt fish farming stakeholders to discuss fish mortalities in relation to welfare. Mortality in farmed fish populations {{is due to a}} variety of biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>causes,</b> although {{it is often difficult to}} differentiate between underlying and immediate causes of mortality. Most mortality appears to occur during episodes associated with disease outbreaks and critical periods (in development or production). Most causes of mortality can be assumed to be associated with suffering prior to death. As mortality rates in farmed fish populations are suspected to rank amongst the highest in commonly farmed vertebrate species, mortality should be a principal fish welfare issue. Long-term mortality rates can be used as a retrospective welfare performance indicator and short-term mortality rates as an operational welfare indicator. Scrutiny of mortality records and determining causes of death will enable action to be taken to avoid further preventable mortality. The welfare performance of fish farms should only be judged on levels of predictable and preventable mortality. Fish farmers will already be monitoring mortality due to commercial and legal requirements. As profitability in fish farming is directly linked to survival, confronting mortality should ultimately benefit both fish and farmers...|$|R

40|$|The {{predominant}} disease affecting {{oil palms}} in Colombia is bud rot, a decay {{of the growing}} leaf tissues that may eventually reach the meristem. Previous studies have suggested many biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>causes,</b> but Koch’s Postulates have recently confirmed Phytophthora palmivora as the primary pathogen of bud rot. In this paper, we describe the infection process in immature leaflets inoculated with zoospores of P. palmivora using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Initially, zoospores were attracted primarily to leaf trichomes, where some developed appressorium-like structures and subsequently penetrated the tissue. Germinated zoospores were also observed penetrating the stomata or intercellular spaces. After penetration hyphae colonized the intercellular leaf spaces, followed by intracellular invasion, penetrating to the vascular bundles and then spreading throughout the host tissue. Between 12 and 24 h after inoculation, hyphae emerged {{from the surface of}} the leaflet through the stomata, trichomes and intercellular spaces. Within 36 and 48 h, sporangia, chlamydospores, and newly released zoospores were observed, starting a new cycle of secondary infections. This sequence was consistently observed in repeated experiments. We suggest that in the field collection of moisture at the base of emerging leaflets stimulates the release of zoospores and infection. Colonization is restricted once the leaflet emerges, leaving dormant chlamydospores and hyphae in small necrotic lesions. Successive rain events stimulate the formation of new generations of sporangia, zoospores and infections, which, if frequent enough, may completely colonize the bud area. Subsequent colonization of infected tissues by opportunistic bacteria and fungi increases the severity of bud rot symptoms. The information presented here provides an overview of histopathological aspects of the early infections process of P. palmivora in detached immature leaflets...|$|R

Though much research has addressed the <b>abiotic</b> <b>causes</b> (e. g. growth condition) of A. sanguinea blooms, few studies have examined the dynamics of microbial communities associated with these blooms. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16 S rDNA genes was used to document changes in the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities associated with an A. sanguinea bloom that occurred in the Xiamen sea in May 2010. Surface sea water was sampled once a day within five consecutive days at four sites, and the microbial community composition was determined using DGGE. Sea water concentrations of chlorophyll a, nitrate and phosphate were also measured. The results indicated that the A. sanguinea bloom was probably stimulated by low salinity (26 - 30 parts per thousand) and ended probably because inorganic nutrients were consumed and resulted in a N/P ratio unfavorable for this alga. Gammaproteobacteria populations increased significantly during bloom declines and then decreased post-bloom. Divergences in the microbial community composition during different bloom periods were the result of changes in Candidatus, Pelagibacter, Alteromonas, Rhodobacteraceae, Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas populations. Sediminimonas qiaohouensis was the first bacterium shown to be significantly negatively correlated with A. sanguinea concentration. This study indicated that bacteria may {{play an important role in}} A. sanguinea-bloom regulation and provides a deeper insight into bacterial community succession during and after an A. sanguinea-bloom.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Speciose clades usually harbor {{species with}} a broad {{spectrum}} of adaptive strategies and complex distribution patterns, and thus constitute ideal systems to disentangle biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>causes</b> underlying species diversification. The delimitation of such study systems to test evolutionary hypotheses is difficult because they often rely on artificial genus concepts as starting points. One of the most prominent examples is the bellflower genus Campanula with some 420 species, but up to 600 species when including all lineages to which Campanula is paraphyletic. We generated a large alignment of petD group II intron sequences to include more than 70 % of described species as a reference. By comparison with partial data sets we could then assess the impact of selective taxon sampling strategies on phylogenetic reconstruction and subsequent evolutionary conclusions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Phylogenetic analyses based on maximum parsimony (PAUP, PRAP), Bayesian inference (MrBayes), and maximum likelihood (RAxML) were first carried out on the large reference data set (D 680). Parameters including tree topology, branch support, and age estimates, were then compared to those obtained from smaller data sets resulting from "classification-guided" (D 088) and "phylogeny-guided sampling" (D 101). Analyses of D 088 failed to fully recover the phylogenetic diversity in Campanula, whereas D 101 inferred significantly different branch support and age estimates. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A short genomic region with high phylogenetic utility allowed us to easily generate a comprehensive phylogenetic framework for the speciose Campanula clade. Our approach recovered 17 well-supported and circumscribed sub-lineages. Knowing these will be instrumental for developing more specific evolutionary hypotheses and guide future research, we highlight the predictive value of a mass taxon-sampling strategy as a first essential step towards illuminating the detailed evolutionary history of diverse clades...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{based on}} a {{literature}} review, presents a quantitative overview {{of the role of}} natural disturbances in European forests from 1850 to 2000. Such an overview provides a basis for modelling the possible impacts of climate change and enables one to assess trends in disturbance regimes in different countries and/or periods. Over the period 1950 – 2000, an annual average of 35 million m 3 wood was damaged by disturbances; there was much variation between years. Storms were responsible for 53 % of the total damage, fire for 16 %, snow for 3 % and other <b>abiotic</b> <b>causes</b> for 5 %. Biotic factors caused 16 % of the damage, and half of this was caused by bark beetles. For 7 % of the damage, no cause was given or there was a combination of causes. The 35 million m 3 of damage is about 8. 1 % of the total fellings in Europe and about 0. 15 % of the total volume of growing stock. Over the period 1961 – 2000, the average annual area of forest fires was 213 000 ha, which is 0. 15 % of the total forest area in Europe. Most types of damage seem to be increasing. This is partly an artefact of the improved availability of information. The most likely explanations for an increase in damage from disturbances are changes in forest management and resulting changes in the condition of the forest. Forest area, average volume of growing stock and average stand age have increased considerably, making the forest more vulnerable and increasing the resources that can be damaged. Since forest resources are expected to continue to increase, it is likely that damage from disturbances will also increase in future...|$|R
40|$|Understanding site {{fertility}} constraints has lifted {{productivity of}} eucalypt plantations in East and South-east Asia through targeted application of inorganic fertilisers. Whilst most {{attention has been}} given to the supply of nitrogen and phosphorus in silvicultural prescriptions, and inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi is being undertaken by some companies, more attention is required to diagnose and correct micronutrient disorders. For example, the incidence of boron deficiency remains a concern across the region affecting tree growth, tree form, fibre quality and possibly the extent of damage from some eucalypt pathogens. As even mild deficiencies of micronutrients such as copper, boron and manganese can alter the phenol pathway, limitations in the uptake of these elements have implications for tree defence against some fungal pathogens. Due to the high humidity and temperatures throughout the year, fungal leaf diseases such as Cylindrocladium quinqueseptatum have had a huge impact on the eucalypt plantation industry in South-east Asia. Often poor nutrition seems to be an underlying cause in disease susceptibility. However, in spite {{of the size of the}} eucalypt plantation sector, there is not an integrated understanding of biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>causes</b> and their interactions by the industry. Furthermore, the emergence of new eucalypt pathogens such as Kirramyces destructans and their rapid spread threatens the viability of plantations unless selection of resistant clones and breeding for resistance can keep up with the incursion of new and invasive eucalypt pathogens. In a number of countries, there is low genetic diversity in eucalypt plantations and breeding programs are yet to embrace screening for disease resistance. The challenge to a successful eucalypt plantation industry in Asia is to optimise genetics and nutrition in order to produce trees with the greatest chance of overcoming pest and disease threats.

50|$|Abiotic {{disorders}} can {{be caused}} by natural processes such as drought, frost, snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient deficiency; deposition of mineral salts such as sodium chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by storms; and wildfires. Similar disorders (usually classed as <b>abiotic)</b> can be <b>caused</b> by human intervention, resulting in soil compaction, pollution of air and soil, salinisation caused by irrigation and road salting, over-application of herbicides, clumsy handling (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees), and vandalism.|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are {{the leading}} {{aetiological}} pathogens of nosocomial infections worldwide. These bacteria form biofilms on both biotic and <b>abiotic</b> surfaces <b>causing</b> biofilm-associated infections. Within the biofilm, these bacteria might develop persistent and antimicrobial resistant characteristics resulting in chronic infections and treatment failures. Garlic exhibits broad pharmaceutical properties and inhibitory activities against S. aureus. We investigated the effects of aqueous fresh garlic extract on biofilm formation in S. aureus ATCC 25923 and MRSA strains under chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic conditions. The viable bacteria and biofilm levels were quantified through colony count and crystal violet staining, respectively. The use of fresh garlic extract under both conditions significantly inhibited biofilm formation in S. aureus strains ATCC 25923 and MRSA. Garlic could be developed as either a prophylactic or therapeutic agent to manage S. aureus biofilm-associated infections...|$|R
40|$|Salinity is {{a common}} <b>abiotic</b> stress <b>causing</b> soybean yield loss worldwide. Use of {{tolerant}} cultivars is an effective and economic approach to coping with this stress. Toward this, {{research is needed to}} identify salt-tolerant germplasm and better understand the genetic and molecular basis of salt tolerance in soybean. The objectives of this study were to identify salt-tolerant genotypes, to search for SNPs and QTLs associated with salt tolerance, and to identify candidate salt tolerance genes. A total of 192 diverse soybean lines and cultivars were screened for salt tolerance in the greenhouse based on visual leaf scorch scores after 15 - 18 days of 120 ml NaCl stress, among which 94 were tolerant while 87 were sensitive. These genotypes were further genotyped using the SoySNP 50 K iSelect BeadChip with 52, 041 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, among which 37, 281 SNPs were polymorphic with minor allele frequency (MAF) 3 ̆e 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} Amblyomma hebraeum has been {{reported}} in Zimbabwe. At the same time there was little or no spread in the distribution of Amblyomma variegatum. This paper examines the climatic cycles and their trends in the period 1974 – 1999 with a view to explaining the <b>abiotic</b> <b>causes</b> of this spread, and of forecasting the likely tendency in climate suitability for both tick species. An annual data-set of rainfall and air temperature was used as a source for climate, together with a habitat-modeling algorithm to estimate climate suitability for both ticks. Long-term suitable habitat for A. hebraeum exists mainly in the south and southeast of the country. Areas of adequate habitat for A. variegatum exist across the country, between approximately 17 °S and 18. 5 °S, and are most suitable in regions of the northwest. The climate niches of the two species differ, and account for their almost allopatric distributions, as observed in the duration and intensity of the dry period and in total annual rainfall. Cyclic changes in both temperature and rainfall drive the periodic modifications in the distributions of the ticks. More intense periods of drought in the highveld, drive the expansion of A. hebraeum in this region. Temperature does not have any effect on the tendency in this area. Areas in south and southeast show a trend towards an increase in climatic suitability because of an increase in temperature. Zones in which habitat suitability is increasing for A. variegatum are restricted to the northwestern parts of the country, because warmer temperatures and a slight decrease in the intensity of the dry season. The progressive increase in temperatures seems to be forcing the dispersion of A. variegatum towards areas outside of zones that have a prolonged dry period. On the other hand A. hebraeum is compelled to spread northwards, following areas with adequate rainfall patterns, but halted by temperature limits and perhaps competition with A. variegatum. Without adequate control measures, invasive waves of A. hebraeum may occur over a background swell of northward expansion.

40|$|AbstractSeveral <b>abiotic</b> factors <b>cause</b> {{molecular}} {{damage to}} plants {{either directly or}} through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). We investigated if application of nitric oxide (NO) donor 2, 2 ′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazono) bis-ethanimine (DETA/NO) could reduce the toxic effect resulting from short-term salt stress. Salt treatment (150 mM NaCl) alone and in combination with 10 μM DETA/NO or 10 μM DETA were given to matured soybean root nodules for 24 h. Salt stress resulted in high H 2 O 2 level and lipid peroxidation while application of DETA/NO effectively reduced H 2 O 2 level and prevented lipid peroxidation in the soybean root nodules. NO treatment increased the activities of ascorbate peroxidase and dehydroascorbate reductase under salt stress. Whereas short-term salt stress reduced AsA/DHAsA and GSH/GSSG ratios, application of the NO donor resulted in an increase of the reduced form of the antioxidant metabolites thus increasing the AsA/DHAsA and GSH/GSSG ratios. Our data suggests a protective role of NO against salt stress...|$|R

Florida torreya {{has experienced a}} significant die-off and subsequent decline during the past century. Although the decline {{has been attributed to}} numerous <b>abiotic</b> and biotic <b>causes,</b> however, our findings are that the most likely reason for the decline is fungal disease. This fungal disease is likely caused by a Fusarium species and our suggestions for a new understanding of the actual cause of the decline are addressed in this fact sheet.

In Arabidopsis seedlings germinating in vitro, we examined whether stress-related damage {{could be reduced}} by addition of protective low-molecular-weight compounds (trehalose and putrescine), addition of a specific signal molecule (acetylsalicylic acid), culture in the dark before and/or after the stress, and hardening mild-stress pretreatments. All four tested protective procedures increased survival after exposure to drought, warm air, warm water or salinity, often from ca. 15 % in the control to ca. 85 % in the treated seedlings. These protective measures may be usable to reduce {{the negative effects of}} abiotic stresses related to tissue culture...|$|R
40|$|Longer term {{exposure}} of mild steel in natural (biotic) waters progresses as a bimodal function of time, both for corrosion mass loss and for pit depth. Recent test results, however, found this also for immersion in clean fresh, almost pure and triply distilled waters. This shows chlorides or microbiological activity {{is not essential}} for the electrochemical processes producing bimodal behaviour. It is proposed that the first mode is aerobic corrosion that eventually produces a non-homogeneous corroded surface and rust coverage sufficient to allow formation of anoxic niches. Within these, aggressive autocatalytic reduction then occurs under anoxic <b>abiotic</b> conditions, <b>caused</b> by sulfide species originating from the MnS inclusions typical in steels. This is consistent with Wranglen's model for abiotic anoxic crevice and pitting corrosion without external aggressive ions. In biotic conditions, metabolites from anaerobic bacterial activity within and near the anoxic niches provides additional (sulfide) species {{to contribute to the}} severity of corrosion. Limited observational evidence that supports this hypothesis is given but further investigation is required to determine all contributor(s) to the cathodic current for the electrochemical reaction. The results are important for estimating the contribution of microbiological corrosion in infrastructure applications...|$|R
40|$|Phytoremediation {{technologies}} such as constructed wetlands have shown higher efficiencies in removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters than conventional wastewater treatment processes, and plants {{seem to have an}} important role in the removal of some of those compounds. In this context, a study was conducted to assess tolerance, uptake, and metabolism of the epilepsy drug, carbamazepine, by the macrophyte Typha spp. This evaluation was conducted in hydroponic solutions with 0. 5 – 2. 0 mg/L of this pharmaceutical for a maximum period of 21 days. The removal of carbamazepine from nutrient solutions by the plants reached values of 82 % of the initial contents. Furthermore, a metabolite (10, 11 -dihydro- 10, 11 -epoxycarbamazepine) was detected in leaf tissues indicating carbamazepine translocation and metabolism inside plants. Activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and guaiacol peroxidase generally increase (after some mild initial inhibition in the case of the latter enzyme) as result of the <b>abiotic</b> stress <b>caused</b> by the exposure to carbamazepine, but ultimately Typha seemed able to cope with its toxicity. The results obtained in this study suggest the ability of Typha spp., to actively participate in the removal of carbamazepine from water when used in phytotreatment systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Soil {{flooding}} is {{an environmental}} stressor for crops {{that can affect}} physiological performance and reduce crop yields. <b>Abiotic</b> stressors <b>cause</b> changes in protein synthesis, modifying the levels {{of a series of}} proteins, especially the heat shock proteins (HSP), and these proteins can help protect the plants against abiotic stress. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify if tomato plants cv. Micro-Tom from different genotypes with varying expression levels of MT-sHSP 23. 6 (mitochondrial small heat shock proteins) have different responses physiological to flooding. Plants from three genotypes (untransformed, MT-sHSP 23. 6 sense expression levels and MT-sHSP 23. 6 antisense expression levels) were cultivated under controlled conditions. After 50 days, the plants were flooded for 14 days. After this period half of the plants from each genotype were allowed to recover. Chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange, chlorophyll index, leaf area and dry matter were evaluated. Flood stress affected the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which is related to inactivation of the oxygen-evolving complex, loss of connectivity among units in photosystem II, oxidation-reduction of the plastoquinone pool and activity of photosystem I. The genotype with MT-sHSP 23. 6 sense expression levels was less sensitive to stress from flooding...|$|R
