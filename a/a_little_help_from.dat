In 1993 he published Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt Pepper (published in the U.S. as With <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> <b>from</b> My Friends: The Making of Sgt Pepper, co-authored with William Pearson), which also included interview quotations from a 1992 South Bank Show episode discussing the album. Martin also edited a 1983 book called Making Music: The Guide to Writing, Performing and Recording.|$|E

The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town.

Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E

Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.|$|E

25|$|Falkinburg {{continued}} wrestling {{and brought}} other wrestlers into his stable, The Diamond Mine, such as Scotty Flamingo (Raven) and Vinnie Vegas (Kevin Nash). The relationships between DDP, Flamingo, and Vegas {{were used in}} many angles over the following months. Falkinburg went {{in the corner of}} Scotty Flamingo, at Clash of the Champions XXI on November 18, 1992, when Flamingo fought Johnny B. Badd in a worked boxing match. Flamingo won this bout with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Falkinburg who filled Flamingo's glove with water. The following year, after Studd and Flamingo left the stable, Falkinburg teamed with Vinnie Vegas as the Vegas Connection.

25|$|In April 1920, {{while the}} Azerbaijani army {{was locked in}} Karabakh {{fighting}} local Armenian forces, Azerbaijan {{was taken over by}} Bolsheviks. On 10 August 1920, Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks, agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached. In 1921, Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the Bolsheviks who, in order to attract public support, promised they would allot Karabakh to Armenia, along with Nakhchivan and Zangezur (the strip of land separating Nakhchivan from Karabakh). However, the Soviet Union also had far-reaching plans concerning Turkey, hoping that it would, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> them, develop along Communist lines. Needing to placate Turkey, the Soviet Union agreed to a division under which Zangezur would fall under the control of Armenia, while Karabakh and Nakhchivan would be under the control of Azerbaijan. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would likely have left Karabakh under Armenian control. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established within the Azerbaijan SSR on 7 July 1923.|$|E

5000|$|A 32-page {{official}} {{training manual}} titled The Care and Training of Your Pet Rock was included, with {{instructions on how}} to properly raise and care for one's new Pet Rock (notably lacking instructions for feeding, bathing, and so on). The instruction manual was the real product, full of gags, puns and jokes, and contained several commands that could be taught to the new pet. While [...] "sit" [...] and [...] "stay" [...] were effortless to accomplish, [...] "roll over" [...] usually required <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the trainer.

25|$|At NYU Schoonmaker {{also met}} filmmaker Michael Wadleigh and later edited his {{influential}} music festival documentary, Woodstock on which Scorsese also worked. Her first major film editing work on Woodstock gained Schoonmaker an Academy Award nomination for Best Editing. Her use of superimpositions and freeze frames brought the {{performances in the}} film to life, and added to the movie's wide appeal, thus helping to raise the artistry and visibility of documentary filmmaking to a new level. Among the most haunting of Woodstock’s brilliantly edited sequences are the relatively sedate, nearly painterly, composition of Joan Baez’s mesmerising rendition of “Joe Hill” and her a cappella “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”, sung before a raptly silent audience of half-a-million and Joe Cocker’s “With <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> <b>from</b> My Friends”, featuring the singer’s falsetto response to his own vocal on {{the other half of}} the split screen….Only infrequently does editing inspiration flag, notably on Jimi Hendrix’s very long guitar solo that concludes the “Director’s Cut”….the Hendrix number evidences the flaccidity of material unmediated by the editing magic of Scorsese and Schoonmaker.|$|E

50|$|In {{the pragmatic}} philosophies of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and others, inquiry is closely {{associated}} with the normative science of logic. In its inception, the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry was extracted by Peirce from its raw materials in classical logic, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Kant, and refined in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic by Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce himself to address problems about the nature and conduct of scientific reasoning. Borrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three fundamental modes of reasoning that play a role in inquiry, commonly known as abductive, deductive, and inductive inference.|$|R

40|$|Dreams are {{a nightly}} {{phenomenon}} that everyone experiences. They {{are full of}} vivid imagery, imagination, and emotion. Using dreams as {{a rich source of}} inspiration I created wooden objects and furniture for the bedroom, the place where dreams occur. Even though dreams vary from person to person, there are common themes that can be found regardless of culture or gender. I tried to combine those themes with unique and specific imagery from my own dreams. Capturing the intangible quality of dreams proved to be difficult. A dream is like a memory, at times clear and intense, or contrastingly brief and forgettable. The subject matter can be on the tip of your tongue and yet you cannot recall any of it. Trying to grasp that concept and realizing the implications involved took awhile. I discovered that I could not recreate dreams, but what I could do was create a kind of visual journal. I kept a dream journal throughout this experience and soon noticed that I was not really recording my dreams. I was writing down enough information to jog my mind into remembering the dream, which I could then reconstruct in my head. I attempted {{to do the same thing}} with physical objects to create a physically tangible, yet still fleeting world. One focus of mine was to create artwork that many people could relate to and experience. A more personal goal was to delve into a new world of inspiration and form unlike any I had previously experienced and travel through a journey of self-discovery in my subconscious. As for the audience, I hope they are taken on an equally insightful journey through their own imaginations with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> visual <b>help</b> <b>from</b> my work...|$|R
40|$|The liberal {{political}} theory {{that was used}} to rationalize the apportionment jurisprudence of the 1960 s suggests [...] with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> republican <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the notion of 2 ̆ 2 virtual representation 2 ̆ 2 [...] the possibility of extra votes for parents on account of their children. It suggests the notion so clearly that the almost complete absence of the idea from American political discourse is something of a mystery. The mystery is deepened by the fact that apportionment is usually done according to total population. Extra voting power is thus already being cast on account of children, but by the district population as a whole, rather than parents. The extra votes idea has surfaced recently, but barely. This Article explores the implications of its mysterious obscurity. The Article proposes a conversational theory of American democracy, in which public involvement in democratic conversation is the glue that holds the system together. Competitive elections are an essential stimulus for this conversation. The conversational theory is descriptive rather than normative. This accounts for a good deal of its superior descriptive force when compared with liberal and republican theories, which are normative in inspiration and are then turned to descriptive tasks, often without an appreciation of the shift. The conversational theory comfortably accommodates the continued obscurity of the extra votes possibilities, as well as many other aspects of American political life that cry out for explanation in liberal (or republican) terms. It explains, for instance, the apparent success of the United States Senate, an institution well-suited to democratic conversation, but quite awkward in liberal terms. The extra votes idea may yet catch on, because American democracy is influenced by normative visions. Whether that happens or not, however, there is much to be learned {{from the fact that the}} idea remains largely unattended...|$|R
