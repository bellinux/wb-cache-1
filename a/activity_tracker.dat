40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} test-retest {{reliability}} and validity of ten <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> for step counting at three different walking speeds. Methods: Thirty-one healthy participants walked twice on a treadmill for 30 min while wearing 10 <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> (Polar Loop, Garmin Vivosmart, Fitbit Charge HR, Apple Watch Sport, Pebble Smartwatch, Samsung Gear S, Misfit Flash, Jawbone Up Move, Flyfit, and Moves). Participants walked three walking speeds for 10 min each; slow (3. 2 km. h(- 1)), average (4. 8 km. h(- 1)), and vigorous (6. 4 km. h(- 1)). To measure test-retest reliability, intraclass correlations (ICC) were determined {{between the first and second}} treadmill test. Validity was determined by comparing the trackers with the gold standard (hand counting), using mean differences, mean absolute percentage errors, and ICC. Statistical differences were calculated by paired-sample t tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and by constructing Bland-Altman plots. Results: Test-retest reliability varied with ICC ranging from - 0. 02 to 0. 97. Validity varied between trackers and different walking speeds with mean differences between the gold standard and <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> ranging from 0. 0 to 26. 4 %. Most trackers showed relatively low ICC and broad limits of agreement of the Bland-Altman plots at the different speeds. For the slow walking speed, the Garmin Vivosmart and Fitbit Charge HR showed the most accurate results. The Garmin Vivosmart and Apple Watch Sport demonstrated the best accuracy at an average walking speed. For vigorous walking, the Apple Watch Sport, Pebble Smartwatch, and Samsung Gear S exhibited the most accurate results. Conclusion: Test-retest {{reliability and validity}} of <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> depends on walking speed. In general, consumer <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> perform better at an average and vigorous walking speed than at a slower walking speed...|$|R

30|$|Wearable <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> {{have become}} a viable {{business}} opportunity. Nevertheless, research has raised concerns over their potentially detrimental effects on wellbeing. For example, a {{recent study found that}} while counting steps with a pedometer increased steps taken throughout the day, {{at the same time it}} decreased the enjoyment people derived from walking. This poses a serious threat to the incorporation of healthy routines into everyday life. Most studies aim at proving the effectiveness of <b>activity</b> <b>trackers.</b> In contrast, a wellbeing-oriented perspective calls for a deeper understanding of how trackers create and mediate meaningful experiences in everyday life.|$|R

40|$|Wearable {{technologies}} are gaining momentum and widespread diffusion. Thanks to {{devices such as}} <b>activity</b> <b>trackers,</b> in form of bracelets, watches, or anklets, the end-users {{are becoming more and}} more aware of their daily activity routine, posture, and training and can modify their motor-behavior. <b>Activity</b> <b>trackers</b> are prevalently based on inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. Loads we bear with us and the interface pressure they put on our body also affect posture. A contact interface pressure sensing wearable would be beneficial to complement inertial <b>activity</b> <b>trackers.</b> What is precluding force sensing resistors (FSR) to be the next best seller wearable? In this paper, we provide elements to answer this question. We build an FSR based on resistive material (Velostat) and printed conductive ink electrodes on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate; we test its response to pressure in the range 0 – 2. 7 [*]kPa. We present a state-of-the-art review, filtered by the need to identify technologies adequate for wearables. We conclude that the repeatability is the major issue yet unsolved...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> {{has shown a}} remarkable shift in human computer interaction; individuals seem willing to wear a device that constantly tracks health related metrics such as movement, exercise, sleep, and calorie burn. Using the insights derived from their <b>activity</b> <b>trackers,</b> individuals {{are expected to be}} more empowered to set and stick to personal health goals. Whereas the outcome of using <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> is of great importance to both individuals and society at large, there are no empirical studies substantiating this presumption. This study aims to contribute to filling this research gap. Making use of self-regulation theory as theoretical framework, we developed a model that proposes six system specific elements (attractiveness, monitoring, feedback, privacy protection, readability, and gamification) as determinants of health empowerment, and thereof health commitment. Using survey data collected from individuals wearing smart wristbands (N = 210), the model was validated. Overall, the results provide strong support for the health empowering capabilities of smart wristbands. The paper concludes with implications for theory and practice, and some suggestions for future research...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{proliferation}} and popularity of wearable <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> (eg, Fitbit, Jawbone, Misfit) may present {{an opportunity to}} integrate such technology into physical activity interventions. While several systematic reviews have reported intervention effects of using wearable <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> on adults 2 ̆ 7 physical activity levels, none to date have focused specifically on children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review {{was to examine the}} effectiveness of wearable <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> as a tool for increasing children 2 ̆ 7 s and adolescents 2 ̆ 7 physical activity levels. We also examined the feasibility of using such technology in younger populations (age range 5 - 19 years). METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of 5 electronic databases, reference lists, and personal archives to identify articles published up until August 2016 that met the inclusion criteria. Articles were included if they (1) specifically examined the use of a wearable device within an intervention or a feasibility study; (2) included participants aged 5 - 19 years old; (3) had a measure of physical activity as an outcome variable for intervention studies; (4) reported process data concerning the feasibility of the device in feasibility studies; and (5) were published in English. Data were analyzed in August 2016. RESULTS: In total, we identified and analyzed 5 studies (3 intervention, 2 feasibility). Intervention delivery ranged from 19 days to 3 months, with only 1 study using a randomized controlled trial design. Wearable <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> were typically combined with other intervention approaches such as goal setting and researcher feedback. While intervention effects were generally positive, the reported differences were largely nonsignificant. The feasibility studies indicated that monitor comfort and design and feedback features were important factors to children and adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of research concerning the effectiveness and feasibility of wearable <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> as a tool for increasing children 2 ̆ 7 s and adolescents 2 ̆ 7 physical activity levels. While there are some preliminary data to suggest these devices may have the potential to increase activity levels through self-monitoring and goal setting in the short term, {{more research is needed to}} establish longer-term effects on behavior...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the accuracy of various <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> in estimating steps taken and energy expenditure. The <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> included the Nike Fuelband, Jawbone UP, BodyMedia FIT Core, Adidas MiCoach, Fitbit Ultra, and the NL- 2000 i. Only the Nike Fuelband, Jawbone UP, FitBit Ultra, and the NL- 2000 i recorded steps. Twenty subjects (10 males, 10 females) participated in two, 50 -minute activity sessions. The first session consisted of treadmill walking and treadmill running. Each exercise was 20 minutes, with a 10 minute break between. The second session consisted of 20 minutes on an elliptical cross-trainer, a 10 -minute break, and the time needed to complete the agility drills. The <b>activity</b> <b>trackers</b> were worn concurrently with a portable metabolic gas analyzer. Steps were recorded using a hand counter. At the end of each mini-session, steps and kcals were recorded by each activity device. The results of the study showed steps to be fairly accurate for all devices, but calories to be less accurate. The accuracy of the devices varied depending on the exercise modality. Based on the results, choosing an activity device should be based on the information looking to be recorded and the type of activity to be performed...|$|R
