25|$|Virginia Woolf {{is taking}} her walk while {{thinking}} of ideas for her novel. She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway {{to have had}} one true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was not afraid to go against the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over something quite trivial, a representation of what her life has become and what has been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs.Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia feels about being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond.|$|E
500|$|Seacole {{was joined}} by a 14-year-old girl, Sarah, also known as Sally. Soyer {{described}} her as [...] "the Egyptian beauty, Mrs Seacole's daughter Sarah", with blue eyes and dark hair.

However, {{there is no evidence}} that Bunbury met Seacole, or even visited Jamaica, at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> would have been nursing her ailing husband. Ramdin speculates that Thomas Day could have been Sarah's father, pointing to the unlikely coincidences of their meeting in Panama and then in England, and their unusual business partnership in Crimea.|$|E

The video was released at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was going through a failed marriage with then husband actor Sean Penn.

500|$|In her memoir, Stanton {{credits the}} Cadys' neighbor, Rev. Simon Hosack, with {{strongly}} encouraging her intellectual development and academic abilities at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> felt these were undervalued by her father. Writing {{of her brother}} Eleazar's death in 1826, Stanton remembers trying to comfort her father, saying that she would try to be all her brother had been. At the time, her father's response devastated Stanton: [...] "Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!" [...] Understanding from this that her father valued boys above girls, Stanton tearfully took her disappointment to Hosack, whose firm belief in her abilities counteracted her father's perceived disparagement. Hosack went on to teach Stanton Greek, encouraged her to read widely, and ultimately bequeathed to her his own Greek lexicon along with other books. His confirmation of her intellectual abilities strengthened Stanton's confidence and self-esteem.|$|E

[...] According to Raheja, Kapadia's casting in Dil Chahta Hai and Leela, in which she played [...] "an older woman who {{is the object of}} a younger man's affection" [...] served as [...] "a kind of tribute to her eternal beauty."
