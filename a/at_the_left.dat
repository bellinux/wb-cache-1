5|$|The badge {{was pinned}} to the riband <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hip. Made of gold, it {{depicted}} a shamrock bearing three crowns, {{on top of a}} cross of St Patrick and surrounded by a blue circle bearing the motto in majuscules, as well as the date of the Order's foundation in Roman numerals ("MDCCLXXXIII").|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> {{five men}} eye the six dancing women. Three {{of the men}} discuss their choice of women, while the other two watch the dancing group alone. The male figure closest to the viewer, a seated black man, had {{previously}} appeared as a soldier in The Triumph of Cleopatra. A sixth man has made his choice, and lunges forward to grab {{the arms of a}} bare-breasted dancing woman.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{rather than}} {{inducting}} a player into the Wall of Fame, the Phillies selected their Centennial Team, commemorating {{the best players}} of the first 100 years in franchise history. The Centennial Team includes players from several periods in Phillies history. The team is honored with a plaque listing {{the names of all}} players selected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> end of the Wall of Fame. 11 members of the Centennial Team also have their own individual plaques on the Wall; those not otherwise included on the Wall are Manny Trillo, Jim Konstanty, and Pete Rose.|$|E

5|$|Longstreet's attack {{commenced}} with a 30-minute artillery barrage by 36 {{guns that}} was particularly punishing to the Union infantry in the Peach Orchard and {{the troops and}} batteries on Houck's Ridge. Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division deployed in Biesecker's Woods on Warfield Ridge (the southern extension of Seminary Ridge) in two lines of two brigades each: <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> front, Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson's Texas Brigade (Hood's old unit); right front, Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law; left rear, Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson; right rear, Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning.|$|E
5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the panel, facing right.|$|E

50|$|These minor {{victories}} {{were never}} proportionate {{to the effort}} invested by the Faisceau, and the group failed to expand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left's</b> expense, while becoming the enemy of the right - unlike in Italy, the latter was strong and confident enough not to rely on Fascists against <b>the</b> <b>left.</b>|$|R
5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2: Knowing {{that the}} Byzantine army was {{focusing}} on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al-Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al-Walid struck at the right flank of the Byzantines left center, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right center struck at the Byzantines left center at its left flank. Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims' right wing cavalry to strike <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> flank of the Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had {{at the start of}} the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E

It passes downward through <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hypochondrium and lumbar regions, along the outer border of <b>the</b> <b>left</b> kidney and ends <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>left</b> part of <b>the</b> abdomen where it continues as the sigmoid colon. It is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. In the other third, {{it has a}} (usually short) mesentery. The arterial supply comes via <b>the</b> <b>left</b> colic artery.|$|R
