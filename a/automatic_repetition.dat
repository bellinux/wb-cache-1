40|$|We {{examined}} whether {{behavioral and}} neural effects of repeating faces are modulated by independent factors of selective attention, emotion, and cholinergic enhancement, during functional MRI. Face repetition occurred either between task-relevant (spatially attended) or task-irrelevant (unattended) stimuli; faces could be fearful or neutral; subjects received either placebo or physostigmine. Under placebo, a reaction time advantage occurred with repetition (i. e., priming) {{that did not}} differ between levels of attention, but was attenuated with emotion. Inferior temporo-occipital cortex demonstrated repetition decreases to both attended and unattended faces, and showed either equivalent or greater repetition decreases with emotional compared with neutral faces. By contrast, repetition decreases were attenuated for emotional relative to neutral faces in lateral orbitofrontal cortex. These results distinguish <b>automatic</b> <b>repetition</b> effects in sensory cortical regions from repetition effects modulated by emotion in orbitofrontal cortex, which parallel behavioral effects. Under physostigmine, unlike placebo, behavioral repetition effects were seen selectively for attended faces only, whereas emotional faces no longer impaired priming. Physostigmine enhanced repetition decreases in inferior occipital cortex selectively for attended faces, and reversed the emotional interaction with repetition in lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Thus we show that cholinergic enhancement both augments a neural signature of priming and modulates the effects of attention and emotion on behavioral and neural consequences of repetition...|$|E

Advancing health-behavior theory to include behavioral initiation and maintenance factors, including reflective (e. g., belief- and feedback-based) and automatic (e. g., habit-based) mechanisms of adherence to different treatment-related behaviors could improve non-adherence prediction and intervention efforts. To test behavioral initiation and maintenance factors from an extended common sense self-regulation theoretical framework for predicting medication adherence {{and physical activity}} among patients with Type 2 diabetes. Patients (n = 133) in an in-person (n = 80) or online (n = 53) version of the study reported treatment-related (1) barriers, (2) beliefs and experiential feedback (reflective mechanisms of treatment-initiation and short-term repetition), and (3) habit strength (automatic mechanism of treatment-maintenance) for taking medication and engaging in regular physical activity at baseline. Behaviors were assessed via self-reports (n = 133) and objectively (electronic monitoring pill bottles, accelerometers; n = 80) in the subsequent month. Treatment-specific barriers and habit strength predicted self-reported and objective adherence for both behaviors. Beliefs were inconsistently related to behavior, even when habits were “weak”. Experiential feedback from behavior {{was not related to}} adherence. Among patients with Type 2 diabetes diagnosis, medication and physical activity adherence were better predicted by their degree of <b>automatic</b> behavioral <b>repetition</b> than their beliefs/experiences with the treatment-actions.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for recognizing repetitions in stuttered speech. First, the recorded speech is parameterized by extracting six acoustic features, including volume, zero crossing rate, spectral entropy, high-order derivatives, VH curve, and VE curve. Second, the speech is segmented using {{the technique of}} end-point detection according (EPD) to the threshold of VH curve. Third, {{the features of the}} segmented speech are processed by dynamic time warping (DTW) to identify similar patterns in neighbouring segments. The proposed method was verified using the artificial stuttering samples of Mandarin Chinese. Ten male subjects were asked to imitate stuttering by speak out 39 predefined repetition settings. These settings are planned by considering three Mandarin Phonetic Symbols ([t], [k], [t‘]) and three kinds of repetitions (part-word repetition, whole-word repetition, multi-syllable word repetition). The experimental results indicate that EPD using VH curve is capable to slice the repetition in artificial stuttered speech. Comparing the results for recognizing the phoneme and single syllable words, there is no significant difference for the threshold of DTW. The performance of DTW in recognizing repetitions had high accuracy of 83 %. Therefore, the proposed method combining EPD and DTW is feasible for <b>automatic</b> recognition of <b>repetitions</b> in stuttered speech. However, more real stuttered speech samples are still needed to verify and improve the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Screening of aphasia {{in acute}} stroke {{is crucial for}} {{directing}} patients to early language therapy. The Language Screening Test (LAST), originally developed in French, is a validated language screening test that allows detection of a language deficit within a few minutes. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop and validate two parallel German versions of the LAST. METHODS The LAST includes subtests for naming, <b>repetition,</b> <b>automatic</b> speech, and comprehension. For the translation into German, task constructs and psycholinguistic criteria for item selection were identical to the French LAST. A cohort of 101 stroke patients were tested, all of whom were native German speakers. Validation of the LAST was based on (1) analysis of equivalence of the German versions, which was established by administering both versions successively in a subset of patients, (2) internal validity by means of internal consistency analysis, and (3) external validity by comparison with the short version of the Token Test in another subset of patients. RESULTS The two German versions were equivalent as demonstrated by a high intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 91. Furthermore, an acceptable internal structure of the LAST was found (Cronbach's α = 0. 74). A highly significant correlation (r = 0. 74, p < 0. 0001) between the LAST and the short version of the Token Test indicated good external validity of the scale. CONCLUSION The German version of the LAST, available in two parallel versions, is a new and valid language screening test in stroke...|$|R
40|$|Introduction {{and aims}} of the study: Stutter-like disfluencies occur {{predominantly}} on first syllables of words. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that stuttering comprises the initiation of syllables. Nonetheless, the occurrence of word-final disfluencies (WFD) {{has been reported in}} literature. WFD have been mentioned in association with neurogenic stuttering, but have also been observed in individuals without apparent acquired neurological damage. In most cases reported this far, WFD consisted of repetitions. Only two studies reported on the occurrence of final prolongations. As word-final prolongations (WFP) seem to be an unusual phenomenon, {{the purpose of the present}} study is to add to the database by documenting another case of WFP. Methods: The participant of this study (K.) was a 49 -year-old male with neurofibromatosis type 1. Speech samples were collected in five different speech modalities (i. e., spontaneous speech, monologue, <b>repetition,</b> <b>automatic</b> series and reading). A detailed fluency analysis was executed in a semi-automatic manner using Praat software. Results: K’s overall disfluency index amounted to 11. 05 with prolongations being the predominant disfluency type. Actually, somewhat less than two thirds of all disfluencies displayed consisted of prolongations. These almost invariably occurred in a word-final position. WFP accounted for 10. 84 % of the speaking time and lasted on average 0. 40 seconds. It appeared that some linguistic loci were more likely to be affected by WFP than others. WFP occurred more frequently in content words, multisyllabic words and words at the end of a sentence than in function words, monosyllabic words and words located sentence initially and medially. The sounds most frequently involved were /t/, /s/, /p/ and /r/. Conclusions: Although the disfluencies displayed by K. do not fully correspond to the pattern of behaviors called stuttering, they at least appear to be stuttering-related. WFP might reflect cognitive processing difficulties or relate to speech motor aspects. One could say that K. showed difficulties terminating words...|$|R
40|$|Most {{researchers}} and clinicians agree that {{early detection of}} aphasia after stroke will help to predict future outcome (see Laska et al., 2007) and {{to allow for a}} better recovery by combining early and intensive speech therapy with early neural reorganization (see Salter et al., 2006). However, most standard aphasia tests are inadequate for assessment in acute stroke. The recently developed Language Screening Test (LAST; Flamand-Roze et al., 2011) can be used for early detection of signs of aphasia in acute post-stroke patients. The goal {{of the present study was}} to adapt and to establish normative data for the LAST in the French-Canadian population of Quebec according to age and education. Methods: The first step was to adapt the LAST to the French-Canadian linguistic context by (1) assessing its surface validity, and (2) verifying with a local language expert the relevance of the selected items. After this first step, the final version of the test (LAST-Q) was developed. The final LAST-Q comprises 5 subtests: picture naming, <b>repetition,</b> <b>automatic</b> speech, word picture matching and verbal instructions. Patients have 5 seconds to answer each question, and the answers are scored as either 1 or 0. As in the original LAST, two parallel versions of the LAST-Q (versions a and b), for patient test-retest, were developed. The second step was to norm the LAST-Q (a and b) with a sample of 50 French-Canadian normals. Participants were divided into four groups according to their (a) age (40 to 60 years old and 60 to 80), and (b) educational level (≤ 11 and ≥ 12 years of education). Results. As expected, a perfect score was obtained for all people from both groups of ages and both educational levels but only for one of the two versions of the LAST-Q. The scores of the second version seemed influenced by the educational level (i. e. only individuals with high level of education obtained a 15 / 15 final score while low level education individuals obtained heterogeneous scores between 11 to 15). Thus, only one version of the LAST-Q attained the goal of perfect score required for a clinical routine screening test in acute emergency clinics. Conclusions: The LAST-Q has proven to be a user-friendly test for bedside assessment and its administration takes less than 3 minutes. As the original LAST, the LAST-Q with a cutoff score of < 15 from a maximal score of 15, showed optimal sensitivity and specificity for language disorders...|$|R
