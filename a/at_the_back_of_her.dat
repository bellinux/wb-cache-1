5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, {{a symbol of}} her indifference and wild power. It {{is not clear whether}} Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eug√®ne Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
25|$|During the 1916 Easter Rising, several {{jewish women}} from the {{community}} smuggled ammunition from Portobello, Dublin's Jewish quarter, to the then named Sackville Street, where the rebels occupied the General Post Office and other strategic buildings. Most notable of these women was the famous Artist Estella Solomons, she used to hide ammunition under a vegetable patch <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family home. The Cumann na mBan women worked as agents transferring ammunition, able to avoid detection at that time precisely because they were women.|$|E
25|$|Also spelled langsuir or lang suyar, {{it is said}} to be {{the ghost}} of a woman who died while giving birth to a {{stillborn}} child which turns into a pontianak, or during pregnancy before the forty days of uncleanness have expired. The mother's grief changes her into a type of flying banshee. To prevent a pregnant woman's corpse from becoming a lang suir, glass beads are placed into the mouth, an egg is placed in each armpit, and needles are placed in the hands. The lang suir can appear as a beautiful woman with long nails (a traditional mark of beauty), ankle-length hair and dressed in green. They also have the ability to take the form of an owl with long talons. Being fond of eating fish, they usually haunt coastal areas and attack pregnant women out of jealousy. It is possible to tame a lang suir by cutting off her long nails and stuffing the hair into the hole <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck.|$|E

Delta wing aircraft may have [...] "elevons" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing, which combine the functions of elevators and ailerons.|$|R

500|$|Ferrier {{gave her}} first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert {{organised}} by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote [...] "went off very well" [...] in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, {{and concluded that}} she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach {{for the remainder of}} her life. He later explained that her [...] "warm and spacious tone" [...] was in part due {{to the size of the}} cavity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> throat: [...] "one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to [...] "her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character".|$|E
500|$|Wrapped {{and sealed}} in a {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) Mylar bag, Sex contains 128pages and is spiral bound with an aluminium cover {{that has the}} word [...] "Sex" [...] stamped {{in the middle and}} a warning label. The front page also shows Madonna against a sky blue backdrop. Three different types of paper were used for the printing of Sex and the design was overseen by Madonna and Baron & Baron Inc. (consisting of Fabien Baron and the photographer Siung Fat Tjia) who had previously collaborated with the singer designing the cover art of her fifth studio album, Erotica. As this was the first project for Maverick, the packaging was crucial; however Madonna did not have faith in Warner Book's [...] "mass-market" [...] publication process. Hence Baron suggested to transfer the packaging job to Nicholas Callaway's bespoke Callaway Editions. Charles Melcher, co-publisher with Callaway for the book, said that they usually did [...] "exquisite art books, $100 high end, beautiful things". But it was a challenge for them to process Madonna's ideas into reality. The artist wanted the packaging to be sealed, so that the reader had to tear it up and read. They considered various kinds of clasps before zeroing on the idea of the sealed bag as a reference to a condom package. The metal cover was Madonna's idea, who took the inspiration from the 1979 album, Metal Box by the band Public Image Ltd. Melcher recollects, [...] "We were talking about materials for the cover, and we went into her kitchen. [...] pointed at the metal plate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stove and said, 'I want something like this'. I was very impressed with the way she interacted with her world to source things." [...] The company bought about [...] of aluminium, a pound for each book. The designers had to do the front and the back covers, while rolling, stamping and ionizing the metal.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{full-length}} bronze female figures, {{one on each}} side, flank the pedestal's base. Each {{figure is}} seated and wears classical robes. [...] "Justice", the figure on the proper left, has long, braided hair. Her proper left arm is raised to shoulder height; she holds a sword in her proper right hand. The figure of [...] "History", on the proper right, holds a tablet on her lap with her proper left hand and a writing tool in her proper right hand. Her hair is knotted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. A book rests beneath her proper right foot. The allegorical figures would be approximately [...] tall, if standing. The pedestal rests on a three-stepped platform. It is executed in Baveno granite from quarries at Lake Maggiore, Italy, and was chosen for its structural excellence and color. The granite used in the monument {{was the first of}} its kind to be imported into the United States.|$|E
