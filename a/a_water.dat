5|$|As in {{the case}} of kelpies and water horses, most myths about water bulls are about males of the species. Occasionally <b>a</b> <b>water</b> cow is mentioned, as in the Highland tale set at Borrodale on Skye, where <b>a</b> <b>water</b> cow was reputed to reside in a small loch. Canine {{carcases}} left out to trap the beast were ignored. Sir Walter Scott also refers to <b>a</b> <b>water</b> cow in a story about an attempt to drain Loch na Beiste to kill one believed to be living there.|$|E

5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture <b>a</b> <b>water</b> bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting <b>a</b> <b>water</b> bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E

5|$|Anhingas, {{also known}} as darters or snakebirds, are cormorant-like water birds with long necks and long, {{straight}} beaks. They are fish eaters, diving for long periods, and often swim with only their neck above the water, looking rather like <b>a</b> <b>water</b> snake.|$|E
5|$|Another example, is the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (Water Board La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years <b>a</b> <b>water</b> capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and <b>a</b> <b>water</b> tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E

5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having <b>a</b> <b>water</b> bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was <b>a</b> <b>water</b> bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was <b>a</b> <b>water</b> horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E
