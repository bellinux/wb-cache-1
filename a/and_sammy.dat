5|$|Fothergill {{began his}} career as a club {{professional}} in the north east of England. He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified for the county. He was the most productive bowler for the county in their first two years of first-class cricket, but the emergence of E. W. Bastard, and later Ted Tyler <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Woods, limited his opportunities with the club. He joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1882, and played for the MCC until 1892, also appearing at Lord's for representative sides.|$|E

5|$|At Everton, Johnson {{was part}} of a forward line spearheaded by record-breaking goalscorer Dixie Dean. In Johnson's first full season Everton won the Second Division Championship, and in his second the club won the First Division, {{becoming}} the English champions. The following season Everton reached the 1933 FA Cup Final, where Johnson faced his former club Manchester City. Everton were comfortable victors, winning 3–0, and seven years after suffering defeat in an FA Cup final Johnson gained a winners medal. Accounts of the match suggest Johnson had a quiet game, with reports focusing on the play of Dixie Dean and Cliff Britton. The final was the first to use shirt numbers to identify the players, Johnson becoming the competition's first number 10. During his Everton career Johnson won a further three England caps. Johnson scored twice in a 7–1 victory over Spain in 1931. John William Smith <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Crooks also scored braces while Dixie Dean scored the other goal.|$|E
5|$|He {{was said}} to have been {{discovered}} by Ipswich Town scout Jim Rodgers (his goals at schoolboy level meant that he was already well known to all the football scouts in Northern Ireland), who was told by manager Bobby Robson to wait until Whiteside grew older. Instead, it was Manchester United's 80-year-old Ulster scout Bob Bishop, who previously unearthed Belfast-born George Best <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> McIlroy for the club, who first offered him a trial at an English club. Whiteside's family were Manchester United supporters, though the youngster himself held no particular allegiance. He found that he had been offered schoolboy terms at the club during a school trip to the United States; on the trip, he and his classmates met President Jimmy Carter at the Oval Office, a rare and extraordinary occasion for children from a disadvantaged background.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City's quarter-final {{was against}} Burnley of the Second Division. City {{took the lead}} early in the match {{following}} a solo goal by Tilson. In the second-half Burnley discarded their passing game in favour of a direct approach, and pressured the Manchester City goal. The City defence stood firm, and the match finished 1–0. City's opponents for the semi-final, held at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, were Derby County. Derby had two chances to score in the first half, but both were missed. A Manchester City counter-attack produced the opening goal, when Brook crossed and Toseland headed in. By midway through the second half Manchester City led by three goals. The second was scored by Tilson, a follow-up after an initial saved shot. McMullan scored the third after dribbling through the Derby defence. Derby mounted a late comeback. A goal by Howard Fabian reduced the deficit to two, <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Crooks added a late second for Derby, {{but it was too}} late to affect the result of the match, which ended 3–2.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another {{restructuring of the}} major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, {{and again in the}} abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. The next year, Mark McGwire <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Sosa both surpassed Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of Major League Baseball (MLB).|$|E
5|$|The game {{remained}} scoreless in {{the early}} innings, with only two baserunners apiece for each team through the first three innings. The Giants loaded the bases with two outs {{in the top of}} the 4th inning, but Brian Johnson struck out to end the inning. The first runs of the game came in the bottom of the 5th as Henry Rodriguez singled to lead off the inning and scored on a home run by Gary Gaetti to give the Cubs a 2–0 lead. The Cubs threatened again in the next inning with singles by Lance Johnson <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Sosa. Rich Rodriguez relieved Gardner, but loaded the bases with a walk to Mark Grace and allowed a single to Matt Mieske which scored two more runs and extended the Cubs' lead to 4–0. John Johnstone relieved Rodriguez and closed the inning without further scoring.|$|E

5|$|The hot {{and humid}} {{conditions}} in Nanning slowed the runners' pace and twelve of them remained within the main pack by the 10km point. The following five kilometres was decisive for the race, as Samuel Tsegay, Titus Masai and Mosop were all left trailing. The leading four runners were soon reduced to three, as Kipruto fell away to leave Zersenay Tadese, Wilson Kiprop <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Kitwara to battle for the medal positions. Zersenay and Kiprop were neck and neck in the lead from the last kilometre and it was Kiprop who pulled away in the final 100metres to break the Eritrean's four-year undefeated streak. Zersenay faded badly {{at the end and}} appeared injured after taking second place. Kitwara and Kipruto were third and fourth, sealing the Kenyan team victory, while Samuel Tsegay's fifth place helped Eritrea to the team silver.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content {{to sit back and}} frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool took the lead in the 15th minute. Souness <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E
5|$|The playoff {{campaign}} was a high-scoring one, with there being {{an average of}} 4⅔ goals per game in the three matches played. The semi-final was against Lincoln City, and was played over two legs. The first leg at the Memorial Stadium was won 2–1 by Rovers, thanks to goals by Craig Disley and Richard Walker. The second leg was played at Sincil Bank and ended 5–3, with Stuart Campbell, Rickie Lambert, Richard Walker, Sammy Igoe and Sean Rigg scoring the goals. This gave Rovers a 7–4 aggregate win and {{a place in the}} final at Wembley Stadium. A record attendance for a League Two playoff final of 61,589 watched the game, and saw Rovers win the match 3–1 and gain promotion for only the fourth time in the club's history.

5|$|The {{problems}} {{spilled over}} into the next Australian season when an English team formed by Alfred Shaw, James Lillywhite and Arthur Shrewsbury toured. A disagreement between Alexander and Lillywhite led {{to members of the}} Fourth Australians refusing to play against the tourists in certain matches and then being banned by the colonial authorities from playing in others. Having agreed contracts for matches with the colonial authorities, Lillywhite offered Alexander 30% of the gate receipts from the first two Tests, but Murdoch {{and the rest of the}} team insisted on 50%. One outcome was that Australia had to make eleven changes to their team for the second Test after terms could not be agreed with the Fourth Australians. The Fourth Australians had made up the team in the first Test but refused to play in the second Test in which nine debutants were necessary alongside Tom Horan <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Jones.|$|E
5|$|As {{proof of}} the {{successful}} revival of the British hard rock and metal scene, tours and gigs {{of old and new}} acts were sold out, both at home and in other European countries, where the movement had spread. Groups arising from the NWOBHM were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums. Iron Maiden supported Kiss in Europe in 1980, embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981, as well as opening for Judas Priest and UFO in the US. Def Leppard visited the US {{for the first time in}} 1980 for a three-month trek supporting Pat Travers, Judas Priest, Ted Nugent, AC/DC <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Hagar. Saxon opened for Judas Priest in Europe and for Rush and AC/DC in the US in 1981. NWOBHM bands were already present on the roster of the famous Reading Festival in 1980, and were quickly promoted to headliners for the 1981 and 1982 events. The 1980 edition was also remarkable for the violent protests against Def Leppard, whose declared interest in the American market was received badly by British fans. In addition to Reading, a new festival called Monsters of Rock was created in 1980 at Castle Donington, England, to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} season, Fothergill only appeared once for Somerset, in a match against Kent {{early in the}} season. He took four for 87 in the match, which was his final first-class appearance for the county. Fothergill was again selected {{to play for the}} South against the North, but bowled just three overs in the match, without taking a wicket. The remainder of his notable appearances that season were made for the MCC, though few were considered first-class. He performed well in matches against Wiltshire and Leicestershire, taking eleven wickets in each match, including seven for 62 in the second innings against Leicestershire, but neither match had first-class status. In 1885, he enjoyed his best match for the South, taking four wickets in each innings as the North were defeated by nine wickets. The majority of his cricket from 1884 until 1886 was made for the MCC, although he did appear four times in 1886 for Somerset, which had been stripped of its first-class status. In contrast, in 1887 and 1888, he played almost exclusively for the county, appearing just three times for the MCC. Somerset, who had relied on the bowling of Fothergill in the early 1880s, were spearheaded by E. W. Bastard, Ted Tyler <b>and</b> <b>Sammy</b> Woods in the late 1880s, and Fothergill was rarely needed to bowl many overs. Despite this, he was presented with a bat during 1888, a reward usually given to batsmen who had scored a century.|$|E
