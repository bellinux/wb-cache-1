40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} is to design flash {{geometry}} of bearing hub to apply the <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> system in hot forging process. The flash geometry is very important in hot forging process because the flash geometry effects on the metal flow, material losses, forging load, die pressure and so on. In this study, the problem of designing the flash geometry is studied with flash thickness and width considering the maximum die pressure to apply an <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> system in hot forging process for bearing hub. The numerical analysis was conducted by means of the commercial S/W DEFORM. On the basis of numerical analysis the flash geometry of hot forging die was redesigned, and experiment was conducted. From the experimental results, it was possible to produce bearing hub with an <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> system without any deterioration of die lifetime...|$|R
50|$|A standby {{generator}} is a back-up {{electrical system}} that operates automatically. Within seconds of a utility outage an <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> switch senses the power loss, commands the generator {{to start and}} then transfers the electrical load to the generator. The standby generator begins supplying power to the circuits. After utility power returns, the <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> switch transfers the electrical load back to the utility and signals the standby generator to shut off. It then returns to standby mode where it awaits the next outage. To ensure a proper response to an outage, a standby generator runs weekly self-tests. Most units run on diesel, natural gas or liquid propane gas.|$|R

40|$|The {{inconsistency}} {{of power}} supply in Nigeria {{has been a}} major stumbling block to the advancement of her economy and as such it is an issue that requires immediate attention. Uninterrupted power supply is critical in so many applications especially in cases like hospital operations or financial transactions. This work was born out of the need to provide a cost effective and locally available way to automate the switching between various power sources. This issue can be addressed by implementing an <b>Automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> switch which automatically switches on a backup generator {{in the absence of the}} utility supply and transfers the load to the generator. The <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> switch also switches off the backup generator and connects back to the utility supply when the power comes back. The circuitry consists of time delay integrated circuits and switching relays. The present effort is a prototype design to create an <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> switch that can be used in an average Nigerian household because of its affordability and simplicity of operatio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> {{lines are}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role in production. As production rates and capital investment increase, the cost of line stoppages also increases. A line stoppage of an <b>automatic</b> <b>transfer</b> line occurs everytime any of the machines stops, {{unless there is a}} sufficient buffer stock between each machine in the line. Thus there arises the question of how much buffer stock between each machine is required to optimise line operation in accordance with some criterion such as maximum output or minimum cost. Though it is fairly easy to formulate this problem in mathematical terms, it has been shown (Ref. 1) that an analytical solution is not possible. The problem can, however, be solved for each particular case by simulation. This report describes one such solution for the case of an automatic bottling plant in a brewery. The work was carried out as a thesis project for the college's diploma, by Mr. A. C. Roberts, a student in the Statistics and Operational Research section, School of Management, during the Academic year 1967 / 68. Mr. E.
