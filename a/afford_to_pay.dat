5|$|Maeser {{accepted}} his first teaching {{position in the}} First District School in Dresden from 1852 to 1853, and he taught at the Budich Institute beginning in 1854. Maeser continued his teaching career {{when he arrived in}} Utah. He taught at the Deseret Lyceum, an academy established in Salt Lake City in November 1860. The teachers at the Lyceum constructed school slates and performed janitor duties because conditions were so poor. When students' families could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tuition, Maeser often collected payments of produce via wheelbarrow.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state could no longer <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> interest on government bonds. Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E
50|$|It was unsuccessfully sued by Harpers and Queen who {{objected to}} the name and didn't get the joke. Harpers and Queen managed to give the small {{independent}} magazine the kind of front-page UK-wide publicity {{it could not have}} <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for. Several sets of circumstances led to the directors of Harpies and Quines declaring voluntary insolvency in 1994 after publishing 16 (18?) issues.|$|R

5|$|Wu {{received}} her elementary school education at Ming De School, {{a school for}} girls founded by her father. She left her hometown in 1923 {{at the age of}} 11 to go to the Suzhou Women's Normal School No.2. This was a boarding school with classes for teacher training as well as for regular high school. Admission to teacher training was more competitive, as it did not charge for tuition or board, and guaranteed a job on graduation. Although her family could have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> Wu chose the more competitive option, and was ranked ninth among around 10,000 applicants.|$|R
5|$|Solti {{enrolled}} at the Ernö Fodor School of Music in Budapest {{at the age of}} ten, transferring to the more prestigious Franz Liszt Academy two years later. When he was 12 he heard a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony conducted by Erich Kleiber, which gave him the ambition to become a conductor. His parents could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{diverted}} several regiments of militia {{and volunteer}} troops after the Battle of Gettysburg {{to control the}} city. The rioters were overwhelmingly working-class men, mostly Irish or of Irish descent, who feared free black people competing for work and resented that wealthier men, who could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a $300 (equivalent to $9,157 in 2017) commutation fee to hire a substitute, were spared from the draft.|$|E
5|$|Adam Mort {{established}} a grammar school by the chapel in 1631 {{which was in}} use until 1833. Children from poor families were admitted free and those who could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> covered the costs. Mort's School closed in 1894. In 1832 children were taught in a barn at the vicarage, the curate, Alfred Hewlett, improved it and the chapel {{was used as a}} classroom. A national school built by subscription on land donated by Captain Durie of Damhouse opened in November 1841. Meanleys Infant School was opened at Gin Pit in 1904 to serve the mining community that had grown up by there. Other schools were built at Ellesmere Street and Marsland Green.|$|E

Lucy was left in some {{financial}} difficulty following her husband's death when McGill decided it could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>paying</b> her a portion of his salary. In 1935 the Canadian government finally recognized his service to Canada by granting $50,000 to his estate.|$|R

5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for polling.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season, he signed a 12-month {{extension}} to his contract. He spent more than two years with League Two side Rochdale, before joining Boston United in the January transfer window of 2007. Boston United were reduced to just 12 professionals on their books in the closing stages of the 2006–07 season, as the club could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> players wages. Cooksey had not been paid since February, and was spending £30 a day in fuel travelling from his Manchester home. He spent six months at Boston United and played 16 League Two games, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated from The Football League {{on the final day of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Concorde was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Sud Aviation (later Aérospatiale) and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. Twenty aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development aircraft. Air France (AF) and British Airways (BA) {{were the only}} airlines to purchase and fly Concorde. The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a high price in exchange for Concorde's speed and luxury service. For example, in 1997, the round-trip ticket price from New York to London was $7995, more than 30 times {{the cost of the}} cheapest option to fly this route.|$|E
5000|$|Ruffo {{was never}} a [...] "house baritone" [...] or a {{resident}} singer with any opera company; he was a nomadic star {{in his own right}} and received top billing—and top fees—wherever he sang. Ruffo was the only male opera singer of his time who could compete, in terms of celebrity and fees, with Caruso. Surprisingly, they sang together infrequently and made only one commercially issued recording: an electrifying performance of the Oath Duet from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. Two explanations have been adduced by historians for this happenstance. First, professional jealousy: neither Ruffo nor Caruso liked sharing the glory with another extravagantly gifted star (though intimates of Caruso have denied this). Secondly, few opera houses could have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> both singers' enormous fees in conjunction, especially if there was an expensive diva appearing in the same production.|$|R
25|$|Lawlessness during {{wars and}} civil {{conflicts}} {{can create a}} culture of impunity towards human rights abuses of civilians. Among some armies, looting of civilian areas is considered a way for soldiers to supplement their often meager income, which can be unstable if soldiers are not paid on time. Some militias that cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> adequately <b>pay</b> their troops promote pillaging as a compensation for victory, and rape of civilians {{can be seen as}} a reward for winning battles.|$|R
5000|$|The American Red Cross {{located the}} {{children}} for him, but such was the cost of getting people out of Russia {{at that time that}} he could <b>afford</b> only <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the costs for one child. After much heart-searching, he selected Olga; she was escorted to Estonia and put on a ship for England. Boris Uvarov was horrified by the state of his waif-like niece when she arrived in England; she was without hair or fingernails, and suffering from malaria.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Hamburg scene {{revolved}} around the Kaiserkeller, Top Ten, Star-Club, Beer-Shop, Mambo, Holle, Wagabond (pronounced vagabond in German) and the Pacific Hotel, {{as well as the}} less popular clubs like Grannies, the Ice Cream Shop, Chugs, and Sacha's. The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights, with posters advertising the performers in the clubs. Each club had a doorman whose job was to entice customers inside, as the drinks were expensive (for Babycham and watered-down beer). Customers who would not, or could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out.|$|E
5|$|Ishikawa {{attended}} Federal Way High School in Federal Way, Washington, {{where he}} lettered in baseball, leading {{his team to}} the Washington State Class 4A Title as a junior in 2001 and to the title game as a senior in 2002. He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. The Giants gave him a $955,000 bonus {{to prevent him from}} attending Oregon State University. The bonus was the highest back then for a non-first-round player, cued on by the organization's approaching signing deadline. The Giants could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a 21st-round pick that much because their higher picks had signed quickly for routine bonuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to the United States and settled in Key West, Florida, in 1820. Young Stephen was sent to school near Mobile, Alabama, but his {{education}} was interrupted by his father's death. His elder brother John also died about this time. To support herself and her surviving son, Ellen opened a boarding house for seamen. Then she sent her son away for further schooling at a Moravian academy in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Although he was {{for all of his}} life a practicing Catholic, he had only praise for the education he received at the academy. After about three years, his mother could no longer <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his tuition, so in 1829 his schooling ended and he returned home.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the central arguments {{made in a}} speech to the 39 th UKSG Conference in April  2016, exploring how academic libraries and publishers can work together more effectively to deliver on our shared core mission – to foster access to the world’s knowledge across disciplinary, institutional and national boundaries for researchers, students and academics alike. It examines how some straightforward changes to publisher practices might enable simpler workflows within libraries, thereby generating significant efficiency gains. It also presents evidence for the impact of long-term trends in library spending, budgets and staffing to demonstrate why it is that university libraries, and their institutions, cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> above-inflation increases for ’big deal’ subscriptions, nor <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> twice for the same content in the form of hybrid journals. It argues that the publishers that embrace open access (OA), explore new business models and work with the higher education community to explore the transformative power of OA will reap long-term rewards...|$|R
50|$|Kelpe {{resumed his}} {{academic}} education, studying {{art history at}} the University of Chicago. He earned a master's degree in 1948 and a doctorate in 1957. He later became a professor, teaching art and art history for many years at various colleges and universities. Starting in the 1950s, his creations featured crystal-like shapes and more elaborate changes in perspective. He experienced financial hardship in the 1950s, writing that his circumstances were hopeless, and that he couldn't <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> both <b>pay</b> the rent and purchase food.|$|R
5|$|Under Louis, {{only between}} 20 and 50 prisoners were usually {{held at the}} Bastille at any one time, {{although}} as many as 111 were held {{for a short period}} in 1703. These prisoners were mainly from the upper classes, and those who could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, wearing their own clothes, living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls. By the late 17th century, there was a rather disorganised library for the use of inmates in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the boys}} must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two subjects, and are given the option to retake the exams. Anmar passes the retakes and aspires to study English {{literature}} in college, and his family decide to move to the safer region of Arbul now that he has graduated. Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family can no longer <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the university fees. Ali chooses not to retake the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop. As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, when Macdonald was 15, {{the family}} moved to the town of Port Hood, Cape Breton. Macdonald {{attended}} the Port Hood Academy. He hoped to enroll next in the Bachelor of Arts program at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, but his family couldn't <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for a university education so Macdonald obtained a teaching licence and taught for two years to finance his education. Midway through his university studies, he took another year off to earn money teaching. He completed his final term on credit and was required to teach in the university's high school during 1914–15 to pay off his debt. Macdonald did well at St. FX. He played rugby, joined the debating team, edited the student newspaper and, in his graduating year, won the gold medal in seven of his eight courses. He was also class valedictorian.|$|E
50|$|In a lease-buyback scheme, {{the owner}} turns the lease over with {{an option to}} buy it back later. The owner is promised {{to be able to}} rent the {{property}} back, which will be counted toward an eventual buyback. These can be legitimate; however, in a scam they may end in loss of the property or considerable additional cost: the renting prices may be made so high that the original owner cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>paying</b> and/or the buyback price may be set far above the fair market value of the property.|$|R
50|$|Due to redevelopment, {{the eastern}} {{portion of the}} Fourth Ward {{consists}} of postmodern townhouses built by developers. Many of the townhouses have corrugated metal, and Downtown Houston is visible from the properties. Many young urban professionals and empty nesters live in the townhouses. The area west of Buckner street has many two story suburban style houses on small lots, intended for lower income individuals. As of 2006 few shotgun houses remain in the Fourth Ward. As of 2007 the newer, subsidized market value houses each had a cost of $92,000; most of the shotgun houses were replaced by the market value houses. The townhouses each have a cost twice that of the subsidized houses. Many longtime African-American residents {{who had lived in}} the neighborhood {{for long periods of time}} were unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> qualify <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for loans <b>to</b> buy the newer subsidized houses or the townhouses.|$|R
5000|$|Prostitution was {{commonplace in}} ancient Israel. There {{are a number}} of {{references}} to prostitution in the Hebrew Bible. The Biblical story of Judah and Tamar (...) provides a depiction of prostitution being practiced in that time period. In this story the prostitute waits at the side of a highway where she waits for travelers. She covers her face in order to identify herself as a prostitute. Instead of being paid in money she asks for a kid goat. This would have been the equivalent of a high price, showing that only the wealthy owner of numerous herds could have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for a single sexual encounter. Under this system if the traveller does not have his cattle with him he must give valuables to the woman as a deposit until a kid goat is delivered to her. The woman in the story was not a legitimate prostitute but actually was Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, who sought to trick Judah into impregnating her. However, since she succeeded in impersonating a prostitute her conduct can be assumed to accurately represent the behaviour of a prostitute in society during that time period.|$|R
5|$|In 1927, Nordale hired {{a recent}} University of Alaska Fairbanks {{graduate}} named Bob Bartlett. Bartlett {{had worked for}} the paper during school vacations, but he made journalism a full-time job following graduation. For four years, Bartlett was the only reporter (other than the editor) who regularly wrote local stories. In late 1930, Bartlett was made the paper's assistant editor in lieu of a raise that the paper couldn't <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Bartlett remained the paper's assistant editor until 1933, when he became the secretary to Anthony Dimond, Alaska's delegate to the U.S. Congress. Bartlett became the delegate to Congress in 1945, and in 1958, when Alaska hosted its first election for state office, Bartlett was elected one of its first two U.S. Senators.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 {{the band}} {{returned}} to BOSS Studios to record enough material for two full-length albums. Both were originally offered to Alternative Tentacles, {{with the first}} being Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac. Before either album could be released, though, Alternative Tentacles had to acquire the master tapes from Bob O'Neill, BOSS Studios' namesake and owner. He refused to release them until he'd been reimbursed for the sessions, and Alternative Tentacles couldn't immediately <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> After months of waiting, the band issued the concert recording Live PCPPEP on Alternative Tentacles out of financial desperation in September 1984. Mostly made up of live performances of songs from their debut, it prompted some critics and fans to joke that they had released the same album twice. Meanwhile, Bob O'Neill was preparing to release Psychic... on his own Ward 9 label to recoup his expenses.|$|E
5|$|In May 1952 he {{resigned}} from the RAF for the second time. Braham decided he could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for his three sons' private education on a wing commander's salary in Britain. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) with the rank of wing commander and on much better pay. On 6 June 1952 the Brahams sailed to Canada. Braham was immediately appointed staff officer for operations and training at Air Defence near Montreal. He taught aircrew how to fly, carry out interceptions and fight in all types of weather. He flew the fast Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck on 39 occasions and North American F-86 Sabre {{as well as the}} Lockheed T-33. Altogether he flew 193 times with the RCAF. His next appointment was 200 miles north of Toronto at the All-Weather Fighter Operational Training Unit.|$|E
