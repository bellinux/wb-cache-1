5|$|The {{university}} historically pioneered {{research and}} training collaborations between academia, industry and government. In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm. In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling <b>American</b> <b>businesses.</b> On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration {{with the federal government}} on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.|$|E

50|$|Barbero (2008) {{examines}} {{the development of}} the field of Latin <b>American</b> <b>business</b> history, from the 1960s to 2007. Latin <b>American</b> <b>business</b> history developed in the 1960s, but until the 1980s it was dominated by either highly politicized debates over Latin American underdevelopment or biographies of Latin American entrepreneurs. Since the 1980s, Latin <b>American</b> <b>business</b> history has become a much more professionalized and an integrated part of Latin American academia. It is much less politicized and has moved beyond entrepreneurial biography to histories of companies and industries. However, Latin <b>American</b> <b>business</b> historians have still not devoted enough attention to agricultural enterprises or comparative histories between the many countries. Probably most importantly, Latin <b>American</b> <b>business</b> historians have to become much more versed in business history theory and methodology so as to get beyond mere summation of the region's economic past.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asks the}} {{question}} {{how and why}} did <b>American</b> <b>business</b> become important in public policy-making in the European Union (EU). Scholars studying the political role of business in Europe agree that organized <b>American</b> <b>business</b> is now very important in policy-making. This wasn't always so. What happened and why? The working hypothesis {{of this paper is}} that the form of EU institutions and the EU policy process are compatible with the political experience and political organization of <b>American</b> <b>business.</b> The first test of the hypothesis involves an agreement on the most important policy characteristics of the EU. The paper identifies three factors; increasing complexity, a constantly changing policy process and an increasing number of policy actors. The major test of the hypothesis involves adopting an actor-centered approach to <b>American</b> <b>business</b> in Europe. This leads us to ask five major questions, first, over the period 1970 - 1975, what has <b>American</b> <b>business</b> considered as its strategic organizational and policy options? Second, what has <b>American</b> <b>business</b> seen as its significant limitations and opportunities in pursuing its strategy as an active influencer of European public policy. (9) Third, how did <b>American</b> <b>business</b> assess the benefits and costs of the various possible behavior open to it as it pursued its pan-European image while downplaying its Americaness by projecting itself as a good European citizen? Fourth, what inducements did its collective organizations have to offer their members in order to bring about such effective coordination. Finally, how did <b>American</b> <b>business</b> respond to the consequences that flowed from policy choices it made at various times? The answers to these questions confirm the research hypothesis, although more research and data is definitely needed. The major American success is on standards and harmonization affecting <b>business.</b> <b>American</b> <b>business</b> knows how to manage the EU. regulating process and 60 per cent of all European regulatory decisions on business are made in Brussels. But there are major failures as well. First, <b>American</b> <b>business</b> {{has not been able to}} change the pattern of European industrial relations. Second, it has not been able to change the EU rules on corporate governance so these rules are more compatible with American patterns...|$|R

25|$|During September 1944, Sergey Kavtaradze was in Iran, where, {{three years}} after the Anglo-Soviet invasion, he was to push for a Soviet share in the local oil industry.

Sa'ed, who was by then involved in a conflict with the far left Tudeh and nationalist forces over having allowed British and <b>American</b> <b>businesses</b> the possibility of opening oil field in the country, did not reply favorably to the envoy's request. Kavtaradze then resorted to threats, which he notably voiced during a meeting with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In parallel, the Soviet Red Army troops in Iran made the transit of Iranian forces difficult, and were present during a large-scale Tudeh demonstration in front of the Majlis building.|$|E
25|$|For several decades, the Haitian {{government}} had been receiving large loans from both American and French banks, {{and with the}} political chaos was growing increasingly incapable of repaying their debts. If the anti-American government of Rosalvo Bobo prevailed, there was no guarantee of debt repayment, and <b>American</b> <b>businesses</b> refused to continue investing there. Within six weeks of the occupation, U.S. government representatives seized control of Haiti's customs houses and administrative institutions, including the banks and the national treasury. Under U.S. government control, a total of 40% of Haiti's national income was designated to repay debts to American and French banks. While this helped improve the economic stability and credibility of the Haitian government, it led to allegations that the American actions froze Haiti's economic development. For the next nineteen years, U.S., government advisers ruled the country, their authority provided by the United States Marine Corps.|$|E
