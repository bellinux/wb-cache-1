5|$|At last, on Monday, 28 June 1841 {{the curtain}} rose on Giselle at the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi danced Giselle with Lucien Petipa as her lover Albrecht, Jean Coralli as the {{gamekeeper}} Hilarion, and Adèle Dumilâtre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis. Typical of the theatrical {{practices of the}} time, Giselle was preceded by <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> another production—in this case, the third act of Rossini's opera, Mosè in Egitto.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Weird Tales became {{involved}} in a media altercation after the editor announced the magazine was going to publish <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> Victoria Foyt's controversial novel Save the Pearls, which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. The publisher subsequently overruled the editor, and announced that Weird Tales no longer had plans to run the excerpt.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} So Beautiful or So What {{features}} West African blues-inspired guitar playing, Indian-style percussion, and experimentation with samples, which ranged from <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> a 1941 sermon to nighttime ambience in Kenya. The songs were recorded with little bass {{but with a}} very large presence of bells. Much of Simon's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality and mortality, which Simon said was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, about three months after taking office at the end of May 1723.

5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the nose or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E
5|$|Back in New York, {{executives}} of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. The executives first introduce him to Alan's work by showing <b>an</b> <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> his previous documentary, The Last Road to Hell, depicting executions in several war-torn countries. One of the executives tells Monroe that Alan staged such dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the jungle. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he quickly dies and is left behind. The remaining four locate the Yacumo. Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew forces the tribe into a hut and burn it down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe criticizes the staged scenes and poor treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.|$|E
