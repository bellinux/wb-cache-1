25|$|Mock bombardments of {{imaginary}} shore {{positions were}} carried out by Prince David in Saanich Inlet, and equally imaginary shore batteries fired back, while movie raiders rowed the ship's boats ashore <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could. A ship-handling problem peculiar to this operation was that in every scene where Prince David was to appear herself, she could present only her starboard side to the camera. It was calculated that cinema-goers would not likely accept the huge sound truck that had been hoisted aboard, and reposed on the weather deck port side, as a regular item in Combined Operations weaponry. The ship's company co-operated heartily, and kept up a high standard of discipline and war-readiness despite the distractions of this fling with film fame, and the glitter of hob-nobbing with the film famous.|$|E
500|$|Georgia Tech coach John Heisman later {{described}} Strupper as follows:"Everett Strupper {{was a small}} {{package of}} condensed lightning when you turned him loose in an open field with a ball you wanted delivered somewhere {{in the neighborhood of}} the enemy's goal line. He was small, but he was put together like a high-powered motor. His arms and legs did just what his mind told them to do, and, believe me, his mind worked faster than Ty Cobb's when he's running the bases. Dodging and twisting, stiff-arming and hipping, he'd run the gauntlet of men big enough, you'd think, to pick him up and spank him, and most of the time, too, he'd get away from them, try <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> would." ...|$|E
500|$|Mullins {{found that}} [...] "To choreograph a fight is {{constantly}} {{trying to be}} open to doing things differently, and making things creative as possible. Any sequence that you ever do, it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger is always there. In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , so we knew the level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting." [...] Jo also noted that [...] "trying to come up with things people haven’t seen before. There have been so many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. And it feels like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E

500|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} victory since early September 2014 after winning 1–0 away against Cheltenham Town, De Girolamo scoring from a Coulson {{pass in the}} 43rd minute. De Girolamo was recalled early from his loan spell by Sheffield United as they wanted him for their two upcoming cup fixtures, after he had scored three times in four York matches. Bournemouth's Guadeloupe international defender Stéphane Zubar joined on loan until 4 January 2015, with Parslow being loaned back to Grimsby until the same date. York drew 1–1 {{at home with their}} divisional rivals AFC Wimbledon {{in the first round of}} the FA Cup; Hyde gave York the lead in the eighth minute after scoring from Coulson's low cross, before Andy Frampton equalised for the away team on 22 minutes. Burton was ruled out for two to three months with a medial ligament injury suffered in this match, resulting in his loan at the club being curtailed. York signed 19-year-old Middlesbrough defender Brad Halliday on a one-month loan as cover and competition for McCoy. Fellow strugglers Oxford United won 1–0 at York, James Roberts scoring from threeyards after Danny Hylton flicked on a Brian Howard corner in the 35th minute, and Wilcox surmised the result saying [...] "The lads are working <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> possibly can but I'm just looking for a little bit more now".|$|E

40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} {{sales force}} {{may not be}} as desirable as a homogeneous sales force for two reasons: premiums are required for all except from one agent type, and only the highest type would work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> though <b>they</b> were from a homogeneous sales force. This study revisits the heterogeneous sales force compensation and price delegation problem with type-dependent reservation. We find that an equilibrium separating or pooling compensation contract always exists. Different types of agents may receive premiums, and there are scenarios when no premiums are paid. Retaining centralized pricing provides a tool for regulating agent behavior. More than one or even all agent types may work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> though <b>they</b> were members of a homogeneous sales force. These findings differ from existing results and their driving force is the dynamics between the differences in reservations and agents’ effort costs arising from concealing their true types...|$|R

Clinton said she would also evaluate the relief effort and help evacuate some Americans. She stressed that her visit was designed not to interfere with ongoing efforts: [...] "It's a race against time. Everybody is pushing <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can."

2500|$|Early on at Midvale, {{working as}} a laborer and machinist, Taylor {{recognized}} that workmen were not working their machines, or themselves, nearly <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could (which {{at the time was}} called [...] "") and that this resulted in high labor costs for the company. When he became a foreman he expected more output from the workmen. In order to determine how much work should properly be expected, he began to study and analyze the productivity of both the men and the machines (although the word [...] "productivity" [...] was not used at the time, and the applied science of productivity had not yet been developed). His focus on the human component of production Taylor labeled scientific management.|$|E

[...] The boat pitches and yaws less in the middle, and the rowers there have less effect on these movements, being closer to the centre of mass and centre of buoyancy. [...] Therefore, the rowers {{in the middle of the}} boat do not have to be as technically sound or reactive to the movements of the boat, and can focus more on pulling <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can.

2500|$|Animal welfare {{groups have}} {{documented}} {{many cases of}} animal cruelty in the training of performing circus animals. The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) contends that animals in circuses are frequently beaten into submission and that physical abuse {{has always been the}} method for training circus animals. According to PETA, although the US Animal Welfare Act does not permit the use of electric shock prods, whips, hooks, or similar instruments by trainers, these are still used today. According to PETA, during an undercover investigation of Carson & Barnes Circus, video footage was captured showing animal care director Tim Frisco training endangered Asian elephants with electrical shock prods and instructing other trainers to [...] "beat the elephants with a bullhook <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could and to sink the sharp metal bullhook into the animals' flesh and twist it until they screamed in pain." ...|$|E

The thorns answered their purpose as nails admirably, and the planks soon were securely fastened into their places against the stem; but without nails to clench the planks together, it was evident to them all that the boat would not float five minutes.

This research did not distinguish whether this {{was the result of the}} individuals in a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group. In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann's experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann's setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers' assistants only pretended to pull on the rope.|$|R

In April 1945, the 7th Battalion took part in operation [...] "Forward On", sweeping through Germany against minimal resistance.

Luckily, they were supported by tanks, sappers of the Royal Engineers and a single Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers, which demolished several buildings with its petard. Cloppenburg was captured the next day. Then, in April, the Battalion embarked on its final advance, moving through Bahlum, Bremen, then Bremerhavan, capturing hundreds then thousands of prisoners.
