5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an <b>arthropod</b> that walked on the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine <b>arthropod</b> groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>arthropod</b> parasites have been {{recorded}} on this duck, including chewing mites of the families Philopteridae and Menoponidae, feather mites and skin mites. Internal helminth parasites include roundworms, tapeworms and flukes. In a survey in Florida, all 30 ducks tested carried at least two helminth species, although none had blood parasites. Only one duck had no mites or lice.|$|E
40|$|Brassica seed {{crops are}} grown {{throughout}} New Zealand and worldwide, and inter-crop and crop-weed contamination through gene flow {{is a major}} concern. For Brassica, large <b>arthropods</b> (body length> 3 mm), particularly honey bees, {{are the most important}} pollinators and are considered key vectors of pollen. Small <b>arthropods</b> (body length < 3 mm) are also abundant in Brassica crops but their role as pollinators is rarely assessed. Numerous small <b>arthropods</b> (particularly Diptera and Thysanoptera) were recorded within cages surrounding pak choi inflorescences that excluded large <b>arthropods.</b> Inflorescences inside these cages set seed, but seed set was significantly reduced compared with inflorescences in cages that were hand pollinated and uncaged inflorescences. Although the presence of large <b>arthropods</b> significantly increased seed set, the role of small <b>arthropods</b> and wind cannot be excluded in pak choi pollination. Further studies are required to fully determine the role of small <b>arthropods</b> in long distance pollen flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) to North America, agent of white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats, has {{increased interest in}} fungi from underground habitats. While bats {{are assumed to be}} the main vector transmitting Pd cave-to-cave, the role of other fauna is unexplored. We documented the fungi associated with over-wintering <b>arthropods</b> in Pd-positive hibernacula, including sites where bats had been recently extirpated or near-extirpated, to determine if <b>arthropods</b> carried Pd, and to compare fungal assemblages on <b>arthropods</b> to bats. We isolated 87 fungal taxa in 64 genera from <b>arthropods.</b> Viable Pd was cultured from 15. 3 % of <b>arthropods,</b> most frequently from harvestmen (Nelima elegans). Fungal assemblages on <b>arthropods</b> were similar to those on bats. The different fungal assemblages documented among <b>arthropods</b> may be due to divergent patterns of movement, aggregation, feeding, or other factors. While it is unlikely that <b>arthropods</b> {{play a major role in}} the transmission dynamics of Pd, we demonstrate that <b>arthropods</b> may carry viable Pd spores and therefore have the potential to transport Pd, either naturally or anthropogenically, within or among hibernacula. This underlines the need for those entering hibernacula to observe decontamination procedures and for such procedures to evolve as our understanding of potential mechanisms of Pd dispersal improve...|$|R
50|$|<b>Arthropods</b> are {{intermediate}} {{hosts of}} Hymenoleptis nana, {{otherwise known as}} the “dwarf tapeworm,” while humans are used as final hosts. Humans become infected through eating infected <b>arthropods,</b> ingesting eggs in water inhabited by <b>arthropods,</b> or from dirty hands. This is a common and widespread intestinal worm.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{the number}} of individuals, Waptia fieldensis is the third most {{abundant}} <b>arthropod</b> from the Burgess Shale Formation, with thousands of specimens collected. It was among the first fossils found by the American paleontologist Charles D. Walcott in 1909. He described it in 1912 and named it after two mountains near the discovery site – Mount Wapta and Mount Field.|$|E
5|$|Experimental robots {{have had}} the same inspiration, in {{particular}} when heavy loads are needed to be carried in tight areas involving turns and curves.

5|$|Most spiders convert {{nitrogenous}} {{waste products}} into uric acid, {{which can be}} excreted as a dry material. Malphigian tubules ("little tubes") extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber, from which they are expelled through the anus. Production of uric acid and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water-conserving feature that has evolved independently in several <b>arthropod</b> lineages that can live far away from water, for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely {{different parts of the}} embryo. However, a few primitive spiders, the sub-order Mesothelae and infra-order Mygalomorphae, retain the ancestral <b>arthropod</b> nephridia ("little kidneys"), which use large amounts of water to excrete nitrogenous waste products as ammonia.|$|E
50|$|Stem <b>arthropods</b> {{constitute}} {{a group that}} has seen attention in connection with the Burgess Shale fauna. Several of the finds, including the enigmatic Opabinia and Anomalocaris have some, though not all, features associated with <b>arthropods,</b> and are thus considered stem <b>arthropods.</b> The sorting of the Burgess Shale fauna into various stem groups finally enabled phylogenetic sorting of this enigmatic assemblage and also allowed for identifying velvet worms as the closest living relatives of <b>arthropods.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Arthropods</b> are {{important}} in human health, which can transmit pathogens to humans, parasitize, or produce important allergens.

5|$|Although the {{relationships}} of millipede orders are still the subject of debate, the class Diplopoda {{as a whole is}} considered a monophyletic group of arthropods: all millipedes are more closely related to each other than to any other arthropods. Diplopoda is a class within of the <b>arthropod</b> subphylum Myriapoda, the myriapods, which includes centipedes (class Chilopoda) as well as the lesser-known pauropods (class Pauropoda) and symphylans (class Symphyla). Within myriapods, the closest relatives or sister group of millipedes has long been considered the pauropods, which also have a collum and diplosegments.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features {{are part of the}} ancestral <b>arthropod</b> feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} <b>arthropod</b> model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E

5000|$|A {{contrary}} {{view was}} presented in 2003, when Jan Bergström and Xian-Guang Hou argued that, if <b>arthropods</b> were a [...] "sister-group" [...] {{to any of the}} anomalocarids, they must have lost and then re-evolved features that were well-developed in the anomalocarids. The earliest known <b>arthropods</b> ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, {{by the standards of the}} time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of <b>arthropods.</b> This reasoning implies that Parapeytoia, which has legs and a backward-pointing mouth like that of the earliest <b>arthropods,</b> is a more credible closest relative of <b>arthropods</b> than is Anomalocaris. In 2006, they suggested that <b>arthropods</b> were more closely related to lobopods and tardigrades than to anomalocarids. In 2014, research indicated that tardigrades were more closely related to <b>arthropods</b> than velvet worms.|$|R
5|$|Most young {{octopuses}} hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending on the}} species and water temperature. They feed on copepods, <b>arthropod</b> larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling {{on the ocean floor}} and developing directly into adults with no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae. Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea octopuses – do not have a paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{differences}} {{should be regarded as}} pseudo-changes in the genetic code due to the phenomenon of RNA editing, which is common in mitochondria. In higher plants, it was thought that CGG encoded for tryptophan and not arginine; however, the codon in the processed RNA was discovered to be the UGG codon, consistent with the standard genetic code for tryptophan. Of note, the <b>arthropod</b> mitochondrial genetic code has undergone parallel evolution within a phylum, with some organisms uniquely translating AGG to lysine.|$|E

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{synthetic}} fertilizers/insecticides in conventional farming has dramatically {{increased over the}} past decades. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the effects of bio-pesticides and insecticides/pesticides on selected beneficial non targeted <b>arthropods.</b> Orders Collembola, Arachinida/Opiliones, Oribatida and Coleoptera were the main groups of <b>arthropods</b> found in the organic fields and Coleoptera, Oribatida, Gamasida and Collembola in conventional fields. Pesticides/insecticides had a significant effect on non-targeted <b>arthropods</b> order- Collembola, Arachinida/Opiliones, Hymenoptera and Thysonoptera were suppressed after pesticides/insecticides spraying. Bio-insecticides in organic fields had a non-significant effect on non targeted species and they started to increase in abundance after 7 days of spraying, whereas insecticide treatment in conventional fields had a significant long-term effect on non targeted <b>arthropods</b> and short term effect on pests/insects, it started to increase after 21 days of the spraying. These results indicate that insecticide treatment kept non targeted <b>arthropods</b> at low abundance. In conclusion, organic farming does not significantly affected the beneficial-non targeted <b>arthropods</b> biodiversity, whereas preventive insecticide application in conventional fields had significant negative effects on beneficial non targeted <b>arthropods.</b> Therefore, conventional farmers should restrict insecticide applications, unless pest densities reach the thresholds and more desirably can switch to organic farming practices...|$|R
5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This {{is the result of}} a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as <b>arthropod,</b> squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some <b>arthropod</b> species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture <b>arthropod</b> prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Arthropods</b> are {{effective}} tools to instill horror, because fear of <b>arthropods</b> may be conditioned into people's minds.

It is dug into every square foot of our earth; it has invaded homes, schoolhouses, public buildings; it has poisoned food and water; it brings sickness and death by germ warfare to countless millions of people every year.... The enemy within-these walking, crawling, jumping, flying pests-destroy more crops than drought and floods. They destroy more buildings than fire. They are responsible {{for many of the}} most dreaded diseases of man and his domestic animals.... Some of them eat or attack everything man owns or produces-including man himself [...]" [...] Thus, insects and other <b>arthropods</b> are dangerous to humans in both obvious and less obvious ways. Undoubtedly, <b>arthropods</b> are dangerous for their potential to carry disease. Somewhat less apparently, <b>arthropods</b> cause damage to buildings, crops, and animals.
