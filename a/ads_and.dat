40|$|The {{extent to}} which the genetic risk for alcohol {{dependence}} (<b>AD)</b> <b>and</b> conduct disorder (CD) and their common genetic risk overlap with genetic factors contributing to variation in dimensions of personality was examined in a study of 6, 453 individuals from 3, 383 adult male and female same-sex and unlike-sex twin pairs from the Australian Twin Registry. The associations between the personality dimensions of positive emotionality, negative emotionality, <b>and</b> <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> CD risk were modest, whereas the associations between behavioral undercontrol <b>and</b> <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> CD risk were substantially higher. Genetic influences contributing to variation in behavioral undercontrol accounted for about 40 % of the genetic variation in <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> CD risk and about 90 % of the common genetic risk for <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> CD.

5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the <b>ads</b> <b>and</b> began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on {{the working}} {{conditions}} of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere {{and the health}} hazards {{to which they are}} exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published <b>ads</b> <b>and</b> stating that his response was industry advocacy.

5|$|Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local {{stockbroker}} {{helped him}} raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation {{at the behest}} of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the <b>ads,</b> <b>and</b> agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this article}} is to study the texture {{features}} of cingulum in patients with Alzheimer's disease (<b>AD)</b> <b>and</b> mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on magnetic resonance images, and explore the texture differences derived from different gender among each group. Texture analysis was performed on 7 AD patients, 14 MCI patients and 11 normal controls (NC). Texture features extracted from gray level co-occurrence matrix and run-length matrix were analyzed between each two groups. The results showed that texture features of the anterior cingulum had significant differences in the multiple comparisons and features of the posterior cingulum had significant differences between <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> MCI group as well as <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> NC group. There were significant differences between <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> MCI group as well as <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> NC group in male’s cingulum. While in female’s cingulaum, the differences were founded between <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> NC group.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} serum levels of vitamin B 12 <b>and</b> folate in <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> other types of dementia in Thai patients. Methods: One hundred and eleven Thai subjects were classified into 3 groups: 32 AD patients, 43 non-AD dementia patients and 36 age-matched controls. Serum concentrations of vitamin B 12 and folate were measured using a solid phase radioimmunoassay. Results: Serum vitamin B 12 levels {{were found to be}} significantly lower in <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> non-AD dementia patients than in age-matched controls. There is a significant relationship between Mini-Mental State Examination score and vitamin B 12 level in <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> non-AD dementia groups. However, there is no significant difference in serum folate in <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> non-AD dementia groups when compared to age-matched controls.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{is predicted to}} increase rapidly in the coming decade, highlighting the importance of early detection and intervention in patients with <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, remarkable advances {{have been made in}} the application of neuroimaging techniques in investigations of <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> MCI. Among the various neuroimaging techniques, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has many potential advantages, noninvasively detecting alterations in brain function that may be present very early in the course of <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> MCI. In this paper, we first review task-related and resting-state fMRI studies on <b>AD</b> <b>and</b> MCI.
