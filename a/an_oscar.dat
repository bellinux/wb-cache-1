Mildred insisted {{that she did not}} want to be <b>an</b> actress, but <b>Oscar</b> convinced her to take the part, renaming her Lily Garland.|$|R

5|$|Ran won several {{awards in}} Japan, {{but was not}} quite as honored there {{as many of the}} director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the {{selection}} of Ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for <b>an</b> <b>Oscar</b> nomination in the Best Foreign Film category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the 57th Academy Awards. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit Ran for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film, a French film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive <b>an</b> <b>Oscar</b> nomination for Best Directing that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa). Rans costume designer, Emi Wada, won the movie's only Oscar.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{theatrical}} {{release was}} deliberately small-scale, most likely undertaken {{to ensure that}} Going Clear met the eligibility criteria for <b>an</b> <b>Oscar</b> nomination.

5|$|The three films Wilder {{appeared}} in following The Producers were box office failures: Start the Revolution and Quackser seemed to audiences poor copies of Mel Brooks films, while Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory {{was not a}} commercial success, although it later gained a cult following and <b>an</b> <b>Oscar</b> nomination for Best Score, {{as well as a}} Golden Globe award nomination for Wilder.|$|E

5|$|Although largely {{indifferent}} to awards, Gielgud had the rare distinction of winning <b>an</b> <b>Oscar,</b> an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony.

He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas between 1929 and 1994, and made commercial recordings of many plays, including ten of Shakespeare's. Among his honours, he was knighted in 1953 and the Gielgud Theatre was named after him. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.|$|E
5|$|B: Bette Davis's {{performance}} in Of Human Bondage was not nominated for <b>an</b> <b>Oscar.</b> Several influential {{people at the}} time campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year (and the following year also) the Academy relaxed its rules and allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible to win the award, {{regardless of whether they}} were an official nominee or not. While the Academy does not officially recognize this as a nomination for Davis, they have included her in the list of nominees for the 1935 ceremony on their official website.|$|E
