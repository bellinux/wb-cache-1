40|$|Existing {{international}} {{emissions reduction}} policies {{are not sufficient}} to meet the internationally agreed objective of limiting average global temperature rise to ‘well below’ two degrees, resulting in an emissions gap. Materials – such as <b>aluminium,</b> <b>cement,</b> paper, plastics and steel – act as a carrier of industrial energy that allows, through trade, the transfer of embodied emissions between sectors and countries. However, the use of materials has been overshadowed by policies focusing on energy efficiency improvements and deployment of a low carbon energy supply. This article argues that policies based on material and product demand can support domestic climate change mitigation and reduce the emissions gap, yet there is little obvious integration between climate and material efficiency policies. The article investigates current ‘emissions flows’ through the EU economy {{and how much of}} these are captured and excluded from existing EU climate policies. We analyse the potential increase in emissions coverage that would be achieved by extending EU directives that currently target the energy use of products (cars, buildings and appliances) in operation, to include the emissions required to produce the goods (i. e. embodied emissions). The analysis shows that a greater integration of material efficiency strategies within climate change mitigation policy could significantly increase the emissions coverage of existing product policies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis article compares several {{configurations}} of a border adjustment (BA) to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{that are designed}} to maximize their World Trade Organisation (WTO) compatibility, either with the GATT general regime or with Article XX (its environmental exception rule). The different BAs are assessed quantitatively using the partial equilibrium model CASE II, which represents four sectors included in the EU ET'S (<b>cement,</b> <b>aluminium,</b> steel and electricity). The main findings indicate that the inclusion of imports and exports would reduce world emissions more than the inclusion of imports alone, that an obligation to buy EU allowances is more compatible with WTO rules than one based on a tax, and would be better at reducing world emissions. Moreover, if the BA is based on best available technologies, more precisely on the recently defined EU product-specific benchmarks, then the adjustment would only be partial and carbon leakage would nevertheless be significantly reduced. The popular view that a BA contributes to both carbon leakage limitation and to domestic production preservation is discussed, and it is argued on the contrary that although a BA would efficiently limit leakage, a decrease in European production of GHG-intensive products is to be expected. Industries that consume <b>cement,</b> <b>aluminium</b> and steel would pay more for these goods with a BA. Consequently, the price signal should be preserved and diffused in downstream sectors, an expected key result of climate policy. On the contrary, free allocation efficiently preserves domestic production, but does not preserve and diffuse the price signal and is less efficient in limiting leakage...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{intensive}} {{industries are}} one of the fields in which strong increases of energy efficiency and deep decarbonisation strategies are particularly challenging. Although European energy intensive industries have already achieved significant energy and greenhouse gas reductions in the past, much remains to be done to make a significant contribution to achieving European as well as national climate mitigation targets of greenhouse gas emission reductions by - 80 % or more (compared to the baseline of 1990). North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) is a European hotspot for coping with this challenge, accommodating more than 10 % of the energy intensive industries of the EU 28. It is also the first German state to have adopted its own Climate Law, enacting state-wide CO 2 emission reductions by 80 % until 2050 compared to 1990. The state government initiated the project "Platform Climate Protection and Industry North-Rhine Westphalia" to identify and develop the necessary far-reaching low carbon innovation strategies for energy intensive industries. Heart of the project was a dialogue process, which involved a broad spectrum of stakeholders from steel, chemical, <b>aluminium,</b> <b>cement,</b> glass and paper producing industries. Besides enhancing and broadening the knowledge on high efficiency and low-carbon technologies within industries, the aim was to explore possible pathways and preconditions for the application of these technologies in energy intensive industries as well as to strengthen the motivation of companies for initiatives and investments in technologies with lower CO 2 emissions. The results of the dialogue shall provide a basis for a possible low-carbon industry roadmap NRW and may also serve as an example for other industrialized regions in the EU and globally. The paper sketches the structured dialogue process with the stakeholders from companies as well as industrial associations and presents the learnings regarding the engagement of energy intensive industries into ambitious climate policies on a regional level. These include existing limitations as well as chances in the respective sectors on the state level, regarding their economic and technical structures as well as their innovation systems. The findings are based on more than a dozen stakeholder workshops with industry companies and more than 150 individual representatives of NRW's energy intensive industries as well as on background research in the initial phase of the project...|$|E
40|$|Objective was {{to develop}} a lightweight, high alumina {{refractory}} aggregate for use in various high performance insulating (low thermal conductivity) refractory applications (e. g., in the <b>aluminium,</b> glass, <b>cement,</b> and iron and steel industries). A new aggregate process was developed through bench and pilot-scale experiments involving extrusion of a blend of calcined and activated alumina powders and organic extrusion aids and binders. The aggregate, with a bulk density approaching 2. 5 g/cc, exhibited reduced thermal conductivity and adequate fired strength compared to dense tabular aggregate. Refractory manufacturers were moderately enthusiastic over the results. Alcoa prepared an economic analysis for producing lightweight aggregate, based on a retrofit of this process into existing Alcoa production facilities. However, a new, competing lightweight aggregate material was developed by another company; this material (Plasmal{trademark}) had a significantly more favorable cost base than the Alcoa/DOE material, due to cheap raw materials and fewer processing steps. In late 1995, Alcoa became a distributor of Plasmal. Alcoa estimated that {ge} 75 % of the market originally envisioned for the Alcoa/DOE aggregate would be taken by Plasmal.

Steel, <b>aluminium</b> and <b>cement</b> {{are the key}} manufacturing industries in India which provide inputs to various other sectors such as construction, transportation, power transmission, etc. As a result, their demand is consistently rising. These industries are heavily energy-intensive and use raw materials such as iron ore, coal, electricity, steam, and fuel oil, whose supply can act as severe production constraints {{over a period of}} time and can hinder sustainable development.

In view of rapid infrastructure growth, there is an emerging need for development of cementitious materials or fillers either to replace cement or fine aggregate for stable growth. One of the industrial wastes is secondary aluminium dross. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the mechanical and durability aspects of concrete incorporated with secondary <b>aluminium</b> dross. <b>Cement</b> has been partially replaced by secondary aluminium dross in different proportions to study the mechanical and durability aspects.

40|$|Several {{causes of}} tool wear have been {{investigated}} in dry machining of <b>aluminium</b> alloy with <b>cemented</b> carbide insert; {{some of the most}} important are: adhesion and diffusion. The formation of built-up edge (BUE) and adhesive layer on the tool rake face degrades on the one hand, the shape and efficiency of cutting tool and on the other hand, the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the finished product. This paper describes tool wear mechanisms in dry machining of a usual aluminium–copper alloy (2024) with an uncoated cemented carbide tool (WC–Co). Orthogonal cutting tests were performed using an instrumented planer machine. The morphology of chips, cutting forces and contact lengths were analyzed for several cutting conditions. The tool–chip interface temperature and the average pressure were calculated by conducting calibration–cutting experiments in conjunction with FEM simulations. This allowed to define the contact parameters associated with different cutting conditions on the tool rake face. High-speed camera movies (CCD), white light interferometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were investigated to show the development of the built-up edge and the adhesive layer on the tool rake face during machining process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Upper Jurassic {{sandstones}} of the South Brae Field were deposited as {{a submarine}} fan complex. The earliest formed concretionary ferroan calcite cement passively encloses detrital feldspars which originally formed more than 10 % of the rock. Later non-ferroan calcite at the concretion margins was precipitated {{from a more}} aggressive fluid. This fluid dissolved {{up to half of}} the feldspars and micas originally present, but little or no clay was precipitated. Aluminium must have been lost from the system. A late dissolution event has enhanced porosity by up to 8 %. Feldspar was again reduced in volume by about half, leaving only- 2 % in the rock today. Very minor amounts of fibrous illite and kaolinite (< 1 %) form the last diagenetic <b>cement.</b> <b>Aluminium</b> must have again been lost from the system. As the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF) encloses and interdigitates with the South Brae sandstones, a local source of organic acids is quite possible. These acid solutions may have increased the mobility of A 1. The A 1 from the feldspars must have therefore been transported vertically into the KCF, or more probably transported laterally by compactional flows out of the basin (up to 10 kin) during release of overpressured basinal water.

40|$|The final {{properties}} of an alloy are highly interlaced with its microstructure. It is therefore essential {{to control the}} evolution of the microstructure of the material during the fabrication process. Nowadays, materials design involves an increasing part of computational design to complement the traditional experimental trial and error approach. Such simulations of the process can decrease the number of material prototypes and shorten the development time for new alloys. In this thesis several microstructure models, aimed for process design, have been suggested. The ambition has been to develop physically based models that are capable to represent the evolution of hundreds of grain or particle sizes, where the models should be possible to run on a standard computer with simulation times less than one day. To achieve this goal, simplified approaches have been suggested, which are accurate enough for the growth rate of grains and particles. The microstructure models have all in common that size distributions of grains or particles are simulated with mean-field approaches. Several of the models also utilize composition and temperature dependent thermodynamic and kinetic properties continually throughout the simulations. These properties have been calculated with programming interfaces to Thermo-Calc and DICTRA together with appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic databases. The materials that have been considered in the present thesis are low alloyed steels, <b>aluminium</b> alloys and <b>cemented</b> carbides. The models are however generic in the sense that all materials can be handled if appropriate thermodynamic, kinetic and property databases exist for the alloy. QC 2011031...|$|R
40|$|Coal is a {{strategic}} commodity in South Africa {{as it is}} the Primary source of energy in form of electricity and synthetic liquid-fuels. It is also a feedstock in the heavy industries that include steel, <b>cement,</b> <b>aluminium</b> smelters and paper. Its role in socio-economic development spans over 100 years. Therefore, the importance of coal supply chain cannot be overemphasised. The mining industry and the role players comprises the South African government, public and private enterprises. Hence, there is need for collaboration of the three parties in a public-private partnership (PPP) model to enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency. The government role in the legislative environment, issuing of exploration, mining and water licenses among others is crucial for the industry. The state-owned corporations such as Transnet, the only national rail transport logistics company and electricity supply company (Eskom), the main electricity generating company and the leading customer/consumer of the South African coal underpins the extent of the state involvement in the industry. The private sector role of ownership of the coal-mines is dominated by the big five international organisations namely BHP Billiton, Anglo Coal, Xstrata/Glencore, Sasol and Exxaro and the black economic empowerment (BEE) companies or junior miners. The electricity and the liquid-fuels types of energy impact on all sectors of the economy. It is this complex relationship by all the role players in the coal-mining industry supply chain that requires enhanced collaboration in a PPP model to harmonise the entire operations in the value-chain.

40|$|The use of market-based {{instruments}} in environmental {{policy has been}} growing rapidly in the last 20 years. The benefits of their flexibility and cost-effectiveness over traditional 'command and control' regulation have been widely reported in the academic literature. Market-based instruments have subsequently been incorporated into UK and European climate policy to drive the long-term technological changes that are considered critical in mitigating the effects of climate change. Although there has been top-down assessment of the environmental performance of this policy package, very little analysis {{has been carried out}} from an industry perspective. This is considered essential to fully evaluate environmental policy style and implementation. This thesis aims to help fill this void by examining the response of three energy intensive industry sectors: <b>cement,</b> <b>aluminium</b> and chemicals, to the complex policy-mix that regulates industrial greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. This is achieved using a postal survey and semi-structured interviews to assess company and trade association views on the effectiveness of the taxes, tradable permit schemes and negotiated agreements that together aim to encourage energy-efficiency and emission reductions. Although the literature supports the use of economic {{instruments in}} climate policy, and the use of negotiated agreements to offset, their economic impact on energy-intensive industry, the results from this study indicate that the interaction of the individual instruments, and the influence of a high energy price, have masked the price incentives. Consequently, the UK policy package has not necessarily provided the incentives for abatement action that are theoretically anticipated or may have been attributed to the scheme. The importance of actor research is thus highlighted, and should be extended to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as it expands in its purpose to regulate industrial greenhouse gas emissions across Europe.
