25|$|The fuel prevalves were deleted {{from the}} Mercury-Redstone in the {{interest}} of improved reliability, since if they closed during a launch, an abort condition could be triggered. On the three unmanned flights, it was discovered that the Mercury-Redstone exhibited a roll transient of 8° per second versus 4° for the Redstone missile. Although this was below the 12° per second roll transient required to trigger an abort, the roll rate sensor was removed from the two manned flights to reduce the chances of an accidental abort (the booster still retained the roll attitude <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> which would be triggered at 10°).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A large {{class of}} <b>angle</b> <b>sensors</b> uses a small {{permanent}} magnet {{attached to the}} rotor. The magnet is polarized perpendicularly to the axis of rotation, and a magnetic field sensor is placed ahead on the axis. The sensor circuit consists of two full bridges at 45 ◦, each having four anisotropic magneto-resistive (AMR) elements. Even though the electronic system may be calibrated to have nearly no errors like offset, nonlinearity, and mismatch, still significant angle errors may result from assembly tolerances of the magnet and the sensor. This work gives an analytical description of the angle error caused by tilts and eccentricities of magnet and sensor elements against the axis of rotation. Particular emphasis is given to worst case combinations of all tolerances. One part of the angle error can be cancelled by an optimized layout of the AMR-resistors. The remaining part {{is identical to the}} case of giant magneto-resistive (GMR) <b>angle</b> <b>sensors.</b> Errors of both AMR and GMR <b>angle</b> <b>sensors</b> are effectively reduced by identical optimization of the shape of magnets. One such optimized shape is disclosed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The current {{calibration}} {{methods of}} combat aircraft’s attarck <b>angle</b> <b>sensors</b> are too complex {{and have some}} insufficiencies. According to the detailed design requirements of flight control system，a method combined with linear fitting and neural network identification is proposed, which can calibrate the measure data of the attarck <b>angle</b> <b>sensors</b> qucikly and accurately. The method proposed avoids the disadvantages of traditional interplation method ， improves the computating efficiency, and ensures the the flight control system’s fault-tolerant ability. A simulation on flight control system with this calibration method was carrid out, which validated the precision and dependability of the method. The method can also deal strong nonlinear data quickly...|$|R

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel <b>angle</b> <b>sensor,</b> and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|E

30|$|Looking at the results, <b>angle</b> <b>sensors</b> and angular {{velocity}} sensors were effective in determining road surface shapes and properties, respectively. However, the relevance factor of the flatness for the composite gradient: 83.4  %, and the recall {{ratio of the}} composite gradient: 88  %, are lower values as compared {{to others in the}} estimated results for the road surface shapes. The estimation of composite gradients is likely to be less sufficient with only <b>angle</b> <b>sensors.</b> In addition, composite gradient points involve the difficulty or reluctance to press for the travelling of strollers as uneven points. In order to improve estimation accuracy, we plan to proceed with the efficient collection of sensor data and user-subjective training data based on the proposed system, considering that if such subjective experiences in the difficulties in passage affect the acceleration and the {{angular velocity}}, there is a possibility to improve the estimation accuracy of the composite gradients using their feature amounts.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{innovations}} {{are currently}} available on various cars. In some models, {{rather than one}} central coil, there are individual coils on each spark plug, sometimes known as direct ignition or coil on plug (COP). This allows the coil a longer time to accumulate a charge between sparks, and therefore a higher energy spark. A variation on this has each coil handle two plugs, on cylinders which are 360 degrees out of phase (and therefore reach TDC at the same time); in the four-cycle engine this means that one plug will be sparking during {{the end of the}} exhaust stroke while the other fires at the usual time, a so-called [...] "wasted spark" [...] arrangement which has no drawbacks apart from faster spark plug erosion; the paired cylinders are 1/4 and 2/3. Other systems do away with the distributor as a timing apparatus and use a magnetic crank <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> mounted on the crankshaft to trigger the ignition at the proper time.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} document {{sets out}} to determine the key limitations to existing methods of acquiring body slip angle data and how could accurate live body slip angle provide better information about a vehicle’s current behavior to aid vehicle safety systems. Initially, body slip angle estimation techniques are evaluated as these methods are currently used in electronic stability control systems, as current vehicles do not have body slip <b>angle</b> <b>sensors.</b> It is clear to see that all the different estimations methods have clear limitations. With this in mind existing methods of measuring body slip angle were investigated, such as optical sensors, GPS and Doppler velocity sensors. It is clear that laser Doppler velocity sensors could be an accurate method of measuring body slip angle on consumer vehicles, therefore a body slip angle based electronic stability control system using laser doppler velocity sensors is proposed. In order to further validate body slip angle based electronic stability control systems, several multi body simulations are carried out. The multi body simulations show that an electronic stability control system based on body slip angle is feasible. The simulations also show that in low coefficient of friction conditions the body slip angle is a better indicator of vehicle behavior than yaw rate. In conclusion, {{it is clear to}} see {{that there is a need}} in the automotive industry for direct real time slip <b>angle</b> <b>sensors,</b> but further research is required to determine the robustness and viability of body slip angle targeted ESC systems...|$|R
