500|$|Sunderland lost 1–0 away to Manchester City on 5 November after a goal from Stephen Ireland. Manager, Roy Keane, {{expressed}} his frustration in a post match interview saying [...] "We didn't deserve anything. I don't feel we did {{enough to get}} {{anything out of the}} game. I don't think their keeper had too many saves to make, did he?". 10 November was the first Tyne–Wear derby of the season. Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland into the lead shortly after half time, but James Milner drew Newcastle level on the 68th minute after his cross beat goalkeeper Craig Gordon into the far post. Sunderland had a chance to win the game when ex-Newcastle forward Michael Chopra headed against the bar minutes from full-time. Sunderland ended the month on a low as they were beaten 7–1 away to Everton on 24 November. Dwight Yorke scored Sunderland's only goal just before half time. Roy Keane said [...] "It's hard to take, but we lose as a team <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> the team and sorted the tactics so I have no problem taking responsibility for what happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Ibuki was {{met with}} a {{positive}} critical and fan reception regarding her character design, attractiveness and personality, and with a mixed reception regarding her gameplay issues. Despite her debut in a relatively obscure entry in the series, Ibuki {{has become one of}} the most popular Street Fighter female characters. [...] Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono said Ibuki is so [...] "popular because she is insanely fun to play." [...] Professional Street Fighter commentator and player Femi Adeboye (F-Word) recalled Ibuki in Third Strike has changed his life when he was a young teenager: [...] "I saw this ninja girl <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> her up, that became my destiny." [...] In 2002, she was voted the 12th most popular Street Fighter character in Capcom's own poll for the 15th anniversary of Street Fighter. Street Fighter IV director Takashi Tsukamoto described her as [...] "a character that many people were waiting for;" [...] a teaser trailer suggesting her inclusion in the game, revealed by Yoshinori Ono at the Evolution Championship Series 2011 tournament event, excited the crowd. Ibuki was voted the 16th most requested Street Fighter side character to be added to the roster of Tekken X Street Fighter in an official poll by Namco in 2013.|$|E
500|$|During the follow pre-season, Holdsworth allowed Nix {{to attend}} a trial with Dutch Eerste Divisie side Sparta Rotterdam. Nix {{described}} it as a [...] "chance of a lifetime" [...] to pursue his dream of playing for the Australian national side with Sparta having an Australian coach. However, his trial was unsuccessful and he returned to Mansfield and he immediately scored in a friendly ahead of the new Conference season. Nix was not included in Mansfield's squad for the first three games of the season, and during the third match with the side losing, the club's fans were singing Nix's name. After eventually winning 3–1, Holdsworth said: [...] "I know Kyle is a very good player and I respect the fans have individuals they like. But we have a healthy squad here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> what I felt was a winning side today which proved to be right." [...] His first game of the season was as a late substitute for Adam Smith moments after Mansfield conceded an equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Kettering Town. His first start of the season came as Holdsworth made changes to personnel and formation for a game at Southport on 11 September. A 2–1 victory was Mansfield's third consecutive win. Before the end of the month, he had scored his first goal of the month, during a 5–0 victory against York City which put Mansfield second in the table.|$|E

60|$|In {{coming down}} from this tower, we somehow or other got upon the ramparts, which connect it with the great gate.

I heard Sam yell to me to run, or we'd be killed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> up my gun and ran for the trees. I hadn't gone very far when I tripped and fell, and the gun got lost in a dark hollow.

Then I started to look for the trail, but I got dizzy and had to sit down where you found me." ...|$|E

(Bow said, after a while, that he did not feel himself a sufficiently accomplished oarsman to pull with me, but that he would sit still, if I would allow him, and study my stroke.
