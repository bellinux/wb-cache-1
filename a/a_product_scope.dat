Our analysis shows that equilibrium outcomes involve substantial overinvestment in <b>product</b> <b>scope,</b> which benefit consumers and hurt firms, relative to the social optimum. Technological progress generally increases consumer surplus and lowers firm profits. If entry is threatened bilaterally across two converging markets, both either accommodate entrants from the rival market, or both deter entry; continuous progress in technology can cause equilibria shifts, leading to discontinuous and radical redistribution of surplus across markets. ...|$|R

40|$|International {{business}} {{literature has}} largely explained the international dispersion of firms’ activities as a choice based on trade-offs between cost minimisation, knowledge seeking, managing transaction costs and maintaining control.

Linking the characteristics of <b>a</b> <b>product</b> to the <b>scope</b> for horizontal and vertical decoupling in a value network allows us to re-frame recent discussions in the literature about fragmentation of activities vs tasks and to develop an overall picture of the way industry-specific peculiarities characterise (and also constrain) viable international configurations. We show how our framework {{can be used to}} interpret data on the scope for decoupling and dispersion collected from industry experts and elucidate the relationships between configuration options and measures of product characteristics. We then utilise this framework to predict how emerging technologies will reshape the international configuration options available to firms. This is the author accepted manuscript.

The solver performs recursive two-sided metric queries on a modified Cauchy-Schwarz criterion, culling negligible sub-volumes of the product-tensor for problems with structured decay in the sub-space metric. These sub-structures are shown to bound the relative error in the matrix-matrix product, and in favorable cases, to enjoy a reduced computational complexity governed by dimensionality reduction of the <b>product</b> volume. <b>A</b> main contribution is demonstration of a new, algebraic locality that develops under contractive identity iteration, with collapse of the metric-subspace onto the identity's plane diagonal, resulting in a stronger SpAMM bound. Also, we carry out a first order Fréchet analyses for single and dual channel instances of the square root iteration, and look at bifurcations due to ill-conditioning and a too aggressive SpAMM approximation.

Automatic tests are a great complement to manual testing and one strong advantage is that tests can be run on every product release without much effort. The goal of this thesis was to develop a framework for automatic test generation for AUTOSAR systems, called Strobilus. Strobilus features support for reading and modifying AUTOSAR configuration files and generation of script and SWC code through an intermediate language. Strobilus was built using Java with XML-libraries. It is primarily intended to be a complement to the tool Picea Workbench, testing Picea Workbench’s output of configuration files, {{but it can also be}} used as <b>a</b> stand-alone <b>product.</b> The <b>scope</b> of Strobilus covers support for AUTOSAR version 3. 1, code generation for C and script generation for CANoe. The design is very modular making it easy to add additional AUTOSAR versions, test modules or output formats. In its current state, Strobilus is capable of testing signals connecting to CAN. The generated test evaluates the correctness of signal paths, signal timing and verifies that packets are transmitted properly with the correct contents. More tests do however need to be implemented for the Strobilus framework to reach its full potential...|$|R

40|$|Project {{performance}} {{researchers are}} unanimous that the conventional EVM (Earned Value Management) {{is a very}} good tool to calculate project cost performance. On the other hand, they have much more divergent opinions about the EVM capacity to provide reliable schedule performance indicators. Nevertheless, even though they recognise that the schedule performance indicator – SPI is useless after the planned end of the project, most of them don’t question its use and reliability over the first two thirds of the project. My researches show that the schedule performance indicators are not reliable and are essentially erroneous over entire project life cycle for most commercial projects with a non-linear cumulative cost curve. But, getting the good performance indicators is not enough. In analyzing what to do with EVM results, I propose a new performance indicator which, in my opinion, is very significant for project managers. The main objective of project performance analysis is to tell as how the project is performing related to three principal project factors: scope (size), cost and time. It has to indicate how our process of product development is performing, are we delivering our <b>product</b> (<b>scope)</b> on time and within planned costs. We are practically measuring the effectiveness of our process by measuring its attributes, efforts (cost) and time [1]. We are measuring how are we delivering the product (instead in <b>product</b> <b>scope,</b> which is often very difficult to measure when the process is in progress, <b>a</b> <b>product</b> is expressed in its other attribute, its value, either planned or earned) comparing to the attributes of process – costs (cost performance analysis) and time (schedule performance analysis) [1]. The fundamentals of EVM are based on this concept. EVM is supposed to indicate how our process (project) is performing by measuring and comparing the costs (actual costs-AC) and the time spent in order to produce a certain amount of <b>a</b> <b>product</b> (earned value-EV). While the EVM works well when calculating cost performance, it is much more different when we talk about schedule performance. Because of that, the cost performance is not a subject of this analysis and the following article is focusing principally on time or schedule performance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Product</b> line <b>scoping</b> is <b>a</b> {{critical}} activity {{because it}} elicits the common realms {{upon which the}} different <b>products</b> of <b>a</b> <b>product</b> line can be optimally engineered with respect to economies of scope. This, in turn, upper bounds the overall economic benefits that can be accrued from product line based development. Inherently, <b>product</b> line <b>scoping</b> is difficult because {{of the complexity of}} the factors that must be taken into account. Many are not known a priori. Traditional scoping approaches (from domain engineering) have focused on the notion of application domains. However, domains proved difficult to optimally scope and engineer from an enterprise standpoint because a domain captures extraneous elements that are of no interest to an enterprise which focuses on particular products, whether existing, under development, or anticipated. Hence, the domain view provides a flawed economic basis for making a scoping decision. We introduce in this paper PuLSE-Eco, a technique especially developed to address the aforementioned issues. Its main characteristics are: a complete product-centric orientation done via product maps, the separation of concerns achieved through the definition and operationalization of strategical business objectives, and last, diverse types of analyses performed upon <b>product</b> maps allowing <b>scoping</b> decisions based on these objectives.
