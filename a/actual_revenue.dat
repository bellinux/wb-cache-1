50|$|However, this {{analysis}} {{does not take}} uncertainty into account. Since the revenue functions are only a (possibly rough) estimate, the <b>actual</b> <b>revenue</b> functions may be quite different. For any level of uncertainty (or horizon of uncertainty) we can define an envelope within which we assume the <b>actual</b> <b>revenue</b> functions are. Higher uncertainty would correspond to a more inclusive envelope. Two of these uncertainty envelopes, surrounding the revenue function of the red team, are represented in Figure 3. As illustrated in Figure 4, the <b>actual</b> <b>revenue</b> function may be any function within a given uncertainty envelope. Of course, some instances of the revenue functions are only possible when the uncertainty is high, while small deviations from the estimate are possible even when the uncertainty is small.|$|E

Evasion occurs when passengers gain access from unpaid to paid side by interacting with fare controls in manners inconsistent with tariff.
