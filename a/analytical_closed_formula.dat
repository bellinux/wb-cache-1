This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to the reliability mod-eling and analysis of a component-based system that allows dealing with multiple failure modes and studying the error propagation among com-ponents. The proposed model permits to specify the components atti-tude to produce, propagate, transform or mask different failure modes. These component-level reliability specifications together with informa-tion about systems global structure allow precise estimation of reliability properties by means of <b>analytical</b> <b>closed</b> <b>formulas,</b> probabilistic model-checking or simulation methods. To support the rapid identification of components that could heavily affect systems reliability, we also show how our modeling approach easily support the automated estimation of the system sensitivity to variations in the reliability properties of its com-ponents. The results of this analysis allow system designers and develop-ers to identify critical components where it is worth spending additional improvement efforts. ...|$|R
40|$|A topological {{index of}} graph G is a {{numerical}} parameter related to G which characterizes its molecular topology {{and is usually}} graph invariant. In the field of quantitative structure-activity (QSAR) /quantitative structure-activity structure-property (QSPR) research, theoretical properties of the chemical compounds and their molecular topological indices such as the Randić connectivity index, atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index and geometric-arithmetic (GA) index are used to predict the bioactivity of different chemical compounds.

40|$|Wireless {{technologies}} in the LAN environment {{are becoming increasingly}} important. The IEEE 802. 11 is the most mature technology for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The limited bandwidth and the finite battery power of mobile computers represent {{one of the greatest}} limitations of current WLANs. In this paper we deeply investigate the efficiency and the energy consumption of MAC protocols that can be described with a p-persistent CSMA model. As already shown in the literature, the IEEE 802. 11 protocol performance can be studied using a p-persistent CSMA model [Cal 00]. For this class of protocols, in the paper we define an analytical framework to study the theoretical performance bounds from the throughput and the energy consumption standpoint. Specifically, we derive the p values (i. e., the average size of the contention window in the IEEE 802. 11 protocol) that maximizes the throughput, $p^C_{opt}$, and minimizes the energy consumption, $p^E_{opt}$. By providing <b>analytical</b> <b>closed</b> <b>formulas</b> for the optimal values, we discuss the trade-off between efficiency and energy consumption. Specifically, we show that power saving and throughput maximization can be jointly achieved.

In “laser wire” monitors the laser beam crosses the electron bunch at the right angle. A model comprising the ellipsoidal laser and electron bunches with tri-Gaussian density distribution is considered. For this model, the total yield of x-ray quanta and temporal duration is derived as functions of the (arbitrary) crossing angle and geometric dimensions of both the bunch and the pulse.
