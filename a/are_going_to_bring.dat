2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{differences}} amongst theaters in Chicago and Under the Gun's ensemble, the theater's artistic director explained: [...] "I think what makes us different is our ensemble. Our idea of the ensemble is we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> in {{a large group of}} people that we like, and we try to empower them to do the best work they can do. And we give them plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. I have to have the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is there anyway I can help them perform better? Because I am stuck with them. Unless I can trick them into punching me in the face, I can’t cut them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Just {{wait till}} we {{get down to}} business. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> down {{everything}} in sight," [...] went on Ham Spink. He could hardly talk without [...] "blowing his own horn," [...] {{as some of the}} boys put it.|$|E
60|$|They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him home. They {{have taken}} a cane, and are holding it across between them, and he is sitting on it and putting his arms about their necks. Each student holds {{one end of the}} cane, and so they are {{bringing}} him along.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Wyandots and the Ottawas {{are very}} {{angry at the}} Wanderers," [...] said the hunter who {{furnished}} the news. [...] "They say the Wanderers must hereafter keep to the hunting grounds in the far west. The Wyandots say there was some mistake made about Dave, and they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> in, next spring, the goods they got away from Bevoir, and which were stolen from the pack-train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "P.S.--Have {{you heard}} that your friend the Bishop <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a Bill before the House of Lords which is to exterminate me altogether?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thomasin has {{not been}} able to come, as she promised to do," [...] he replied to her inquiry, which had been anxious, for she knew that her niece was badly in want of money. [...] "The captain came down last night and {{personally}} pressed her to join them today. So, not to be unpleasant, she determined to go. They fetched her in the pony-chaise, and <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her back." ...|$|E
6000|$|Warrington {{burst out}} {{laughing}} as he read the poem: and Mr. Hack laughed too but with rather a rueful face.--"It won't do," [...] he said, [...] "the public won't stand it. Bungay's people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> out a very good book, and have set up Miss Bunyan against Lady Violet. We have most titles to be sure--but the verses are too bad. Lady Violet herself owns it; she's busy with her own poem; what's to be done? We can't lose the plate. The governor gave sixty pounds for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Walter nodded. [...] "Did it {{the last}} thing before I left the house," [...] he replied. [...] "The young lady is {{practically}} all right now, and has gone home. Her father is getting along nicely {{and it is only}} a matter of time when he will be right as ever. By the way, their story is exactly as Sparrer had it. Looks like a sure case against the owner of that other car. I understand that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> suit for damages. I suppose that means that we'll have to go on the witness stand when the thing comes off." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thank you, Felix,' {{said the}} Curate; 'it {{is a great}} relief to me. I was afraid you thought you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a meddling fellow in upon you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well. I suppose I {{ought to say}} that I like it. There has been a {{policeman}} here who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> an action against me." ...|$|R
5000|$|On October 25, 2016, Thorns {{signed with}} the Cape Breton Highlanders in the NBL Canada. Team manager Tyrone Levingston praised the signee, saying, [...] "The point guard role {{is key to the}} success of any team, and I look forward to seeing what Hank <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> that role." ...|$|R
6000|$|I'm {{right with}} you on the {{question}} of the [...] "home-like" [...] system of having fun. I think we'll all agree beautifully on that. I've had all the cheap bohemia that I want. I can tell you, none of the [...] "climbers" [...] and the cocktail crowd <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> their vaporings into my house. It's for the clean, merry life, with your best friends in the game and a general concentration of energies and aims. I am having a cedarwood club cut from the mountains with knots on it, and I am going to stand in my hallway (when I have one) and edit with it the cards of all callers. You and Mrs. will have latchkeys, of course.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think I {{dare not}} breathe {{a word for}} my own sake," [...] he continued. [...] "There is reason in that, but I have other monies. I am rich enough without my sixth share of that Bekwando Land and Mining Company which you and the Syndicate <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> out! But then, I am not a fool! I have no wish to throw away money. Now I propose to you {{therefore}} a friendly settlement. My daughter Julie is very charming. You admire her, I am sure. You shall marry her, {{and then we will}} all be one family. Our interests will be the same, and you may be sure that I shall look after them. Come! Is that not a friendly offer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see the Hunters <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> {{over their}} carriage," [...] the Major said, two days later, as he looked through a letter. [...] "I am very glad of that, for I put it off till too late. I have been trying {{everywhere}} for the last two days to hire one, but they are all engaged, and have been so for weeks, I hear. I was wondering what I should do, for my buggy will only hold two. I was thinking of asking Mrs. Doolan if she could take one of the Miss Hunters, and should have tried to find a place for the other. But this settles it all comfortably. They are going to send on their own horses halfway the day before, and hire native ponies for the first half. They have a good large family vehicle; I hoped that they would bring it, but, of course, I could not trust to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I settled Johnny Gibson {{should keep}} them. He <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> his dog, you know; besides, {{what could we}} do with them? We can't cook them, can we?" ...|$|R
3000|$|Like {{actually}} {{carrying a}} rabbit’s foot {{around with me}} saying oh this is my lucky charm, this <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> me luck! (Laughs) (Theo, Sales Assistant, 24  years old) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|By the {{conversation}} Hal knew {{it must be}} later than he had supposed. Under cover of the darkness Macklin <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a coach <b>to</b> the place. For what purpose? ...|$|R
6000|$|MAN. It's {{good enough}} {{for a man with}} only you to stand between him and death. (As they look at one another for a moment, Raina hardly able to believe that even a Servian officer can be so cynically and selfishly unchivalrous, they are startled by a sharp fusillade in the street. The chill of {{imminent}} death hushes the man's voice as he adds) Do you hear? If you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> those scoundrels in on me you shall receive them as you are. (Raina meets his eye with unflinching scorn. Suddenly he starts, listening. There is a step outside. Someone tries the door, and then knocks hurriedly and urgently at it. Raina looks at the man, breathless. He throws up his head with the gesture of a man who sees that it is all over with him, and, dropping the manner which he has been assuming to intimidate her, flings the cloak to her, exclaiming, sincerely and kindly) No use: I'm done for. Quick! wrap yourself up: they're coming! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will strike}} due south as if {{intending}} to enter Mexico; one never knows who is watching one," [...] Dave said the evening before. [...] "There are always some pretty hard men about these border towns--miners who are {{down on their}} luck; men who have had to run from the northern diggings, and such like. We may say what we like, but they will make a guess that we have located something rich, and {{are going back to}} work it quietly and keep it to ourselves, and like enough some of them will take it in their heads to follow us. Anyhow, we will travel south for a day or two, and then turn off sharp to the west. It aint as I should grudge anyone else a share in the mine, but the more there are the more chance of the Injuns finding us. Besides, some of these chaps are so reckless that like as not they would light a big fire if they wanted to cook a loaf of bread. We three have been up that way before, although not so far as we are going now, and we know what we have got to expect, and that, if we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> our scalps out again, we have got to sleep with our eyes open." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stephen!--do {{you really}} think that we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> {{anything}} to bear upon public affairs worth having? I know something of the contemporary feminine intelligence. Justin makes no serious objection to a large and various circle of women friends, and over my little sitting-room fire in the winter and in my corners of our various gardens in the summer and in walks over the heather at Martens and in Scotland there are great talks and confessions of love, of mental freedom, of ambitions, and belief and unbelief--more particularly of unbelief. I have sometimes thought of compiling a dictionary of unbelief, a great list of the things that a number of sweet, submissive, value-above-rubies wives have told me they did not believe in. It would amaze their husbands beyond measure. The state of mind of women about these things, Stephen, is dreadful--I mean about all these questions--you know what I mean. The bold striving spirits do air their views a little, and always {{in a way that makes}} one realize how badly they need airing--but most of the nicer women are very chary of talk, they have to be drawn out, a hint of opposition makes them start back or prevaricate, and I see them afterwards with their husbands, pretty silken furry feathery jewelled silences. All their suppression doesn't keep them orthodox, it only makes them furtive and crumpled and creased in their minds--in just the way that things get crumpled and creased if they are always being shoved back into a drawer. You have only to rout about in their minds for a bit. They pretend at first to be quite correct, and then out comes the nasty little courage of the darkness. Sometimes there is even an apologetic titter. They are quite emancipated, they say; I have misunderstood them. Their emancipation is like those horrid white lizards that grow in the Kentucky caves out of the sunlight. They tell you they don't see why they shouldn't do this or that--mean things, underhand things, cheap, vicious, sensual things.... Are there, I wonder, the same dreadful little caverns in men? I doubt it. And then comes a situation that really tries their quality.... Think of the quandary I got into with you, Stephen. And for my sex I'm rather a daring person. The way in which I went so far--and then ran away. I had a kind of excuse--in my illness. That illness! Such a queer untimely feminine illness....|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} jesting with us, Pollio. You {{told me that}} you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Beric the fierce British chief here, and this young giant is but a beardless lad." ...|$|R

5000|$|On November 12, 1999 Fulani {{formally}} endorsed Buchanan, saying: [...] "We {{are going}} to integrate that peasant army of his. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> black folks, Latino folks, gay folks and liberal folks into that army...I'm going to take Pat Buchanan to 125th Street in Harlem. We {{are going to}} have lunch at Sylvia's. I am going to take him to speak at Reverend Sharpton's National Action Network." [...] Fulani became Buchanan's campaign co-chair.|$|E
5000|$|Director Branagh found {{shooting}} in the house difficult yet interesting. “The minimalism I found was a great challenge. The elevator was Harold's idea, so that was there and was a central feature of what we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> to it. And then everything else was drawn from contemporary British architecture, contemporary British artists. The wire figure is by Anthony Gormley, {{one of our most}} famous sculptors. Gary Hume did all the artwork on the walls." [...] Custom designed furniture from Ron Arad completes the look.|$|E
5000|$|Americans for Prosperity {{president}} Tim Phillips went to Madison to [...] "voice {{praise for}} cutting state spending by slashing union benefits and bargaining rights {{to address a}} large group of counterprotesters." [...] Phillips also said: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> fiscal sanity back to this great nation. ... This is a watershed moment in Wisconsin.... For the last two decades, government unions have used their power to drive pensions and benefits and salaries well beyond anything that can be sustained. We are just trying to change that." [...] The group planned an ad campaign in support of Gov. Walker's initiatives.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> his toy village; it is {{all made}} of wood, you know, and will burn nicely. We'll have a grand bonfire, and see them blaze up, won't we?" ...|$|R
