5000|$|Aero {{elasticity}} [...] is {{the branch}} of physics and engineering that studies the interactions between the inertial, elastic, and aerodynamic forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a fluid flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as energy harvesting [...] and understanding snoring. The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or steady response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body’s dynamic (typically vibrational) response. Aeroelasticity draws {{on the study of}} fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, structural dynamics and dynamical systems.The synthesis of aeroelasticity with thermodynamics is known as <b>aerothermoelasticity,</b> and its synthesis with control theory is known as aeroservoelasticity.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aerothermoelasticity</b> {{comprises}} {{those aspects}} {{of the dynamics of}} an aircraft that are caused by flexibility and heating during flight. The concept of <b>aerothermoelasticity</b> is particularly important for hypersonic vehicles that operate at extremely high dynamic pressures. The design requirements for such vehicles often introduce long and thin fuselages subject to elastic bending in low-frequency vibrational modes. Furthermore, surface heating can significantly change the stiffness characteristics of these modes. These aerothermoelastic effects must be considered in the synthesis and analysis of control systems. The present method makes it possible to incorporate the results of computational analysis into the small linear models that are typically used in designing controls...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{state-of-the-art}} in hypersonic aeroelasticity and <b>aerothermoelasticity</b> is provided. Recently, the main focus in this area {{has been on the}} development of computa-tional aeroelastic and aerothermoelastic methods capable of studying complete hypersonic vehicles. Thus, in addition to a survey of studies conducted in this area over the past six decades, two important issues are a focus of this review, namely: 1) modeling unsteady hypersonic aerodynamics; and 2) incorporation of the heat transfer between the fluid and the structure into the aeroelastic solution process. Finally, future directions of hyper-sonic aeroelasticity and <b>aerothermoelasticity</b> are outlined. Since air-breathing hypersonic vehicles exhibit strong coupling between the airframe, propulsion, and control systems, future directions point to the incorporation of advanced computational aerothermoelastic methods into a comprehensive vehicle analysis.

40|$|The {{field of}} <b>aerothermoelasticity</b> plays an {{important}} role in the analysis and optimization of air-breathing hypersonic vehicles, impacting the design of the aerodynamic, structural, control, and propul-sion systems at both the component and multi-disciplinary levels. This study aims to expand the fun-damental understanding of hypersonic <b>aerothermoelasticity</b> by performing systematic investigations into fluid-thermal-structural coupling, and also to develop frameworks, using innovative modeling strategies, for reducing the computational effort associated with aerothermoelastic analysis. Due to the fundamental nature of this work, the analysis is limited to cylindrical bending of a simply-supported, von Kármán panel. Multiple important effects are included in the analysis, namely: 1) arbitrary, non-uniform, in-plane and through-thickness temperature distributions, 2) material property degradation at elevated temperature, and 3) the effect of elastic deformation on aerodynamic heating. It is found that including elastic deformations in the aerodynamic heating computations results in non-uniform heat flux, which produces non-uniform temperature distributions and non-uniform material property degra-dations. This results in reduced flight time to the onset of flutter and localized regions in which the ma-terial temperature limits may be exceeded. Additionally, the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy is evaluated for aerothermoelastic analysis based on either quasi-static or time-averaged dy...|$|E

Current proposals favor LH 2 as a fuel for both conventional dual-stage rockets, vertical-launch SSTO rockets, and horizontal-launch airbreathing SSTOs; hence large cryogenic tanks and thermal protection (for descent in rockets and ascent in airbreathers) are required. Consideration is given to structural alloys and composites; thermal-protection materials; propellant-tank insulation materials; the design of light but strong tanks, wings, nose caps, and airbreathing-engine structures; and the problem of hot boundary-layer gases.

40|$|<b>Aerothermoelasticity</b> {{is one of}} the key {{technologies}} for hypersonic vehicles. Accurate and efficient computation of the aerothermodynamics {{is one of the}} primary challenges for hypersonic aerothermoelastic analysis. Aimed at solving the shortcomings of engineering calculation, computation fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimental investigation, a reduced order modeling (ROM) framework for aerothermodynamics based on CFD predictions using an enhanced algorithm of fast maximin Latin hypercube design is developed. Both proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and surrogate are considered and compared to construct ROMs. Two surrogate approaches named Kriging and optimized radial basis function (ORBF) are utilized to construct ROMs. Furthermore, an enhanced algorithm of fast maximin Latin hypercube design is proposed, which proves to be helpful to improve the precisions of ROMs. Test results for the three-dimensional aerothermodynamic over a hypersonic surface indicate that: the ROMs precision based on Kriging is better than that by ORBF, ROMs based on Kriging are marginally more accurate than ROMs based on POD-Kriging. In a word, the ROM framework for hypersonic aerothermodynamics has good precision and efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Following {{an initial}} {{discussion}} of the NASP flight environment, the results of recent aeroelastic testing of NASP-type highly swept delta-wing models in Langley's Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) are summarized. Subsonic and transonic flutter characteristics {{of a variety of}} these models are described, and several analytical codes used to predict flutter of these models are evaluated. These codes generally provide good, but conservative predictions of subsonic and transonic flutter. Also, test results are presented on a nonlinear transonic phenomena known as aileron buzz which occurred in the wind tunnel on highly swept delta wings with full-span ailerons. An analytical procedure which assesses the effects of hypersonic heating on aeroelastic instabilities (<b>aerothermoelasticity)</b> is also described. This procedure accurately predicted flutter of a heated aluminum wing on which experimental data exists. Results are presented on the application of this method to calculate the flutter characteristics of a fine-element model of a generic NASP configuration. Finally, it is demonstrated analytically that active controls can be employed to improve the aeroelastic stability and ride quality of a generic NASP vehicle flying at hypersonic speeds...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{new insights into}} the aerothermoelastic stability of thin plates. Particularly, the issue of loss of stability of an isotropic plate-strip of constant thickness immersed in a supersonic flow field and subjected to a variable temperature field through the thickness is examined. Using the basic principles of the theory of <b>aerothermoelasticity</b> of isotropic bodies, the theories of flexible panels, and the linear law of temperature field through the thickness of the panel, the stability equations and associated boundary conditions are obtained. As expected, the coefficients of the aerothermoelastic governing equations depend on the thermal load, and consequently the panel-flutter critical speed depends on temperature. The model takes into account quadratic and cubic aerodynamic non-linearities as well as cubic geometric non-linearities. Due to the inhomogeneity of the temperature field distribution across the thickness plate buckling instability occurs. This instability accounts for the deformed shape of the plate and the stability boundary depends on the variables characterizing the flow speed, the temperature of the middle plane and the temperature gradient in the direction normal to the plane. It is shown that the combined effect of the temperature field and free-stream regulates the process of stability and the temperature field can significantly change the flutter critical speed and flutter behavior. The problem of stability is also considered in the non-linear framework. The existence and behavior of flutter-type vibrations is investigated at pre-and post-critical speeds. The influence of the temperature field on the dependency of the limit cycle amplitude as a function of speed is studied. Results and discussions are presented along with pertinent concluding remark...|$|E
