Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World <b>are</b> <b>complete,</b> and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E
