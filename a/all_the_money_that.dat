25|$|Brigham Young University (BYU), the LDS Church's {{flagship}} educational institution, {{has made}} several {{changes in its}} policy towards women. In 1975, the four-year, full tuition and boarding expenses presidential scholarship was changed from only being available to men to being available to {{an equal number of}} men and women. BYU established a Women's Research Institute in 1978. Among its directors over its 21 years of existence was Marie Cornwall. At the end of 2009, BYU restructured its Women's Studies Programs, freeing more money for research on women's issues by ending an institute staff, placing the Women's Studies Minor in the Sociology Department and thus putting <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> had been split between research and staff directly into research expenditures.|$|E
25|$|Of {{economic}} {{importance is}} BrabantStad, {{a partnership between}} the municipalities of Breda, Eindhoven, Helmond, 's-Hertogenbosch and Tilburg and the province of North Brabant. BrabantStad is the fastest growing economic region in the Netherlands, with the Brabantse Stedenrij (polycentric city region) {{as one of the}} national top regions, behind the Randstad megalopolis (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht). The partnership in North Brabant aims to form an urban network and to make the province explicitly known as a leading knowledge region within Europe. With a total of 1.5million people and 20% of the industrial production in the Netherlands is BrabantStad one of the major economical important, metropolitan regions of the Netherlands. Of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> goes to research and development in the Netherlands, one third is spent in Eindhoven. A quarter of the jobs in the region are in technology and ICT.|$|E
25|$|Returning to {{his home}} town of Caerleon (now a village in south Wales just outside Newport, where {{the ruins of the}} Roman {{fortress}} of Isca can still be seen, whose walls surrounding its Roman baths and elsewhere were still standing high during the medieval period). Sir Launfal takes humble lodgings, spends <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> King Arthur gave him before setting out, and soon descends into poverty and debt. One Trinity Sunday, the king holds a banquet in Caerleon to which Sir Launfal, because of his poverty, is not invited. The mayor's daughter offers to let him spend the day with her, but he declines her offer since he has nothing to wear. Instead, he borrows a horse from her and goes for a ride, stopping to rest under a tree in a nearby forest. Two maidens appear and bring him to a lady they call Tryamour, daughter of the King of Olyroun and of Fayrye, whom Sir Launfal finds lying on a bed in a glorious pavilion.|$|E

500|$|In July 1966, The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines, and unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos. After the {{supposed}} snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage {{had to make}} their way to Manila airport on their own. At the airport, road manager Evans was beaten and kicked, and the group members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. Once the group boarded the plane, Tony Barrow and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, [...] "Tell Lil I love her," [...] thinking he was about to be jailed or killed. Epstein was forced to give back <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> the group had earned while they were there before being allowed on the plane.|$|E
500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E
500|$|Owing to the {{combination}} of Pink Floyd's partial breakup and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. [...] The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also {{the loss of his}} father during the Second World War. [...] Gilmour's guitar solos on [...] "Your Possible Pasts" [...] and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. [...] More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band's breakup. [...] Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said [...] "with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. [...] And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction...", [...] Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "It's about pursuing something greater even when you have <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> you could ever want. [...] And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. [...] It's up to you to decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time." [...] Rachel Mann of The Quietus said [...] "flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album" [...] and [...] "still has something fresh to say". [...] Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: [...] "Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen. [...] Q Magazine once compiled a top ten list of depressing records, and this was on it. [...] Enough said, I think." ...|$|E

[...] The Gemara deduced from the words [...] "and they despoiled the Egyptians" [...] in [...] that when the Israelites left Egypt, they carried that wealth away with them.

2500|$|In 1966, Anger {{moved into}} {{the ground floor of}} a large nineteenth-century Victorian house in San Francisco known as the Russian Embassy. Around this time he began {{planning}} a new film titled Lucifer Rising echoing his Thelemite beliefs about the emerging Aeon of Horus. He tattooed the name of Lucifer upon his chest and began searching for a young man who could symbolically become Lucifer, [...] "the Crowned and Conquering Child" [...] of the new Aeon, for Lucifer Rising. While living at the Russian Embassy, he met and lived with various young men who could fit the position. Finally, he settled upon Bobby Beausoleil for the role of Lucifer. Beausoleil founded a band, the Magic Powerhouse of Oz, in order to record the music for the film. In 1967, Anger claimed that the footage which he had been filming for Lucifer Rising had been stolen, placing the blame on Beausoleil, who would deny the claims. Anger's unofficial biographer Bill Landis quotes Beausoleil who states, [...] "what had happened was that Kenneth had spent <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was invested in Lucifer Rising" [...] and that he therefore invented the story to satisfy the film's creditors. Beausoleil and Anger fell out, with the former getting involved with Charles Manson and his cult, the Family, eventually carrying out Manson's bidding by torturing and murdering Gary Hinman.|$|E
