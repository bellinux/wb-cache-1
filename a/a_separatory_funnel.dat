25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} {{have a lower}} density than water, {{which means}} they are lighter and will form a separate layer on top of water. An important exception: most of the halogenated solvents like dichloromethane or chloroform will sink {{to the bottom of}} a container, leaving water as the top layer. This is important to remember when partitioning compounds between solvents and water in <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> during chemical syntheses.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel,</b> will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquid–liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E

40|$|The {{ion-selective}} electrode {{method for}} the microdetermination of iodine in environmental sample was investigated. To isolate iodine from substances influencing on electrode method such as sulfide and {{large amount of}} alkali used for alkali fusion of the sample, solvent extraction method was utilized. The recommended procedures are as follows : Add 2 ml of sulfuric acid (1 : l) and sodium nitrite solution (1 %) to 150 ml of sample solution in <b>a</b> 250 ml <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> and mix throughly. After standing for (2 〜 3) min, add 15 ml of carbon tetrachloride and shake for 1 min. Transfer the organic phase to <b>a</b> 200 ml <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel.</b> Repeat the extraction of iodine once more with 10 ml of carbon tetrachloride and combine with the first extract. After washing with diluted sulfuric acid, transfer the organic phase to <b>a</b> 50 ml <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> containing 10 ml of (10 ^ 〜 10 ^) M sodium bisulfite solution. Shake for 1 min, discard the organic phase, transfer 5 ml of the aqueous phase to a 100 ml polyethylene beaker, add 10 ml of 10 % Phosphate solution, and then determine the iodide concentration by ion-selective electrode method. The recovery of iodine from the 150 ml of supplying water containing (2 〜 150) μg of iodine was examined for above procedure. The sufficient recoveries were obtained in addition of more than 5 μg. This method {{was applied to the}} determination of iodine in lowland rice near an iodine manufacturing plant. Results were well agreed with those obtained by the neutron activation analysis...|$|R

50|$|By mixing {{partially}} organic soluble {{samples in}} organic solvent (toluene, benzene, xylene), the organic soluble compounds will dissolve into the solvent {{and can be}} separated using <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel.</b> This process is valuable in the extraction of proteins and specifically phosphoprotein and phosphopeptide phosphatases.|$|E
50|$|As heavy {{minerals}} are a minor constituent of most sedimentary rock, {{they must be}} separated out to be studied. Heavy mineral separation generally uses a dense liquid in either <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> or centrifuge.

40|$|It is {{interesting}} to study {{whether or not the}} MB-AS associate can be adsorbed onto a glass container surface. In this paper, we report that an addition of a small amount of heptane is effective to promote adsorption of the AS-MB associate onto the wall of <b>a</b> glass <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel.</b> It is also found that the adsorption of free MB onto the glass surface can be suppressed to a considerable extent by adding sulfuric acid. The present method can be used to determine AS (DBS or DS) of the 10 μg/l level in tap and river water samples...|$|R
30|$|A weighed {{amount of}} Fe(III) {{chloride}} (0.0226  g) was dissolved in 1 Litre of distilled water (pH 2.5) in a graduated flask. 50.0  mL {{of the solution}} was placed in <b>a</b> 100  mL <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel,</b> followed by addition of 10  mL of a 1 % oxime solution in chloroform. It was shaken for 1  min. The dark red colored chloroform has the Fe(III) 8 -hydroxyquinolone complex. Fe(III) (50 – 200  µg) can be extracted from aqueous solution with 1 % solution of 8 -hydroxyquinoline in chloroform by double extraction when the pH of the aqueous solution is between 2 and 10. At a pH of 2 – 2.5 nickel, cobalt, cerium(III), and aluminium do not interfere.|$|R
5000|$|While one <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> {{is useful}} in {{separating}} certain compound mixtures with a carefully formulated biphasic solvent system, <b>a</b> series of <b>separatory</b> <b>funnels</b> may be employed to separate compounds that have different partition coefficients. Countercurrent distribution, therefore, is a method of using a series of vessels (<b>separatory</b> <b>funnels)</b> to separation compounds by a sequence of liquid-liquid extraction operations. Contrary to liquid-liquid extraction, in the CCD instruments the upper phase is decanted from the lower phase once the phases have settled. First, a mixture is introduced to vessel 1 (V1) charged with both phases and the liquid-liquid extraction process is performed. The upper phase is added to a second vessel (V2) which already holds fresh lower phase. Fresh upper phase is added to V1. Both vessels are shaken and allowed to settle. upper phase from V1 is transferred to V2 {{at the same time}} the upper phase from V2 is transferred to V3 which already holds fresh lower phase. Fresh upper phase is added to V1, all three vessels are shaken and settled and the process continues. Compounds that are more soluble in the upper phase than lower phase faster and farther down the series of vessels (the [...] "train") while those compounds which are more soluble in the lower phase than the upper phase tend to lag behind. A compound insoluble in the upper phase will remain in V1 while a compound insoluble in the lower phase will stay in the lead vessel.|$|R

5000|$|The {{separatory}} funnel {{runs on the}} concept of [...] "like dissolves like", with different solutes being preferentially soluble in certain solvents. While <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> is being shaken, the two solvents mix and share a large surface area, which allows each solute to migrate to the solvent in which it is more soluble.|$|E
50|$|While solvent {{extraction}} is often {{done on a}} small scale by synthetic lab chemists using <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel,</b> Craig apparatus or membrane-based techniques, it is normally done on the industrial scale using machines that bring the two liquid phases into contact with each other. Such machines include centrifugal contactors, Thin Layer Extraction, spray columns, pulsed columns, and mixer-settlers.|$|E
50|$|The {{bottom layer}} is drained out, then {{the top layer}} can be {{retained}} in the <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> for further extractions with additional batches of solvent or drained out into a separate vessel for other uses. If it is desired to retain the bottom layer in the <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> for further extractions, both layers are taken out separately, and then the former bottom layer is returned to the <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel.</b>|$|R

50|$|The largest risk {{when using}} <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> {{is that of}} {{pressure}} build-up. Pressure accumulates during mixing if a gas evolving reaction or physical change occurs. This problem can be easily handled by simply opening the stopper {{at the top of}} the funnel routinely while mixing. This should be done with the top of the funnel pointed away from the body.|$|E

50|$|Purification of amines: Amines (analogously to ammonia) have a lone pair of {{electrons}} on the nitrogen atom that can form a relatively weak bond to a hydrogen atom. It is therefore the case that under acidic conditions amines are typically protonated, carrying a positive charge and under basic conditions they are typically deprotonated and neutral. Amines of sufficiently low molecular weight are rather polar and can form hydrogen bonds with water and therefore will readily dissolve in aqueous solutions. Deprotonated amines on the other hand, are neutral and have greasy, nonpolar organic substituents, and therefore have a higher affinity for nonpolar inorganic solvents. As such purification steps can be carried out where an aqueous solution of an amine is neutralized with a base such as sodium hydroxide, then shaken in <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> with a nonpolar solvent that is immiscible with water. The organic phase is then drained off. Subsequent processing can recover the amine by techniques such as recrystallization, evaporation or distillation; subsequent extraction back to a polar phase can be performed by adding HCl and shaking again in <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> (at which point the ammonium ion could be recovered by adding an insoluble counterion), or in either phase, reactions could be performed as part of a chemical synthesis.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of using <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel</b> is emulsions can form easily, {{and can take}} a long time to separate once formed. They are often formed while liquids are being mixed in the separatory funnel. This can occur when small droplets are suspended in an aqueous solution. If an emulsion is formed, one technique used to separate the liquids is to slowly swirl the solution in the separatory funnel. If the emulsion is not separated by this process, a small amount of saturated saline solution is added.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel,</b> {{also known}} as {{separation}} funnel, separating funnel, or colloquially sep funnel, {{is a piece of}} laboratory glassware used in liquid-liquid extractions to separate (partition) the components of a mixture into two immiscible solvent phases of different densities. Typically, one of the phases will be aqueous, and the other a lipophilic organic solvent such as ether, MTBE, dichloromethane, chloroform, or ethyl acetate. All of these solvents form a clear delineation between the two liquids. The more dense liquid, typically the aqueous phase unless the organic phase is halogenated, sinks and can be drained out through a valve away from the less dense liquid, which remains in the separatory funnel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Separatory</b> <b>funnels</b> are pear-shaped, have a cap {{and a short}} neck, with a {{stopcock}} for {{the even}} pouring of fluids. These are used to decant two immiscible fluids. It can be graduated, though this is not very common.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Separatory</b> <b>funnels</b> {{are similar}} in shape and design, and {{may be used as}} {{dropping}} funnels. They do not always have the ground glass joint at the stem, instead having a narrow tube suitable for insertion into a rubber stopper.|$|R
50|$|Stopcocks are {{a smooth}} tapered plug or rotor with a handle, which fits into a {{corresponding}} ground glass female joint. Stopcocks are often parts of laboratory glassware such as burettes, <b>separatory</b> <b>funnels,</b> Schlenk flasks, and columns used for column chromatography.|$|R
50|$|To use <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel,</b> the {{two phases}} and {{the mixture to}} be {{separated}} in solution are added through the top with the stopcock at the bottom closed. The funnel is then closed and shaken gently by inverting the funnel multiple times; if the two solutions are mixed together too vigorously emulsions will form. The funnel is then inverted and the tap carefully opened to release excess vapor pressure. The separating funnel is set aside {{to allow for the}} complete separation of the phases. The top and the bottom tap are then opened and the lower phase is released by gravitation. The top must be opened while releasing the lower phase to allow pressure equalization between the inside of the funnel and the atmosphere. When the bottom layer has been removed, the stopcock is closed and the upper layer is poured out through the top into another container.|$|E
50|$|A heating mantle, or isomantle, is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} equipment used to apply heat to containers, as an alternative to other forms of heated bath. In contrast to other heating devices, such as hotplates or Bunsen burners, glassware containers may be placed in direct contact with the heating mantle without substantially increasing the risk of the glassware shattering, because the heating element of a heating mantle is insulated from the container so as to prevent excessive temperature gradients. Heating mantles may have various forms. In a common arrangement, electric wires are embedded within a strip of fabric that can be wrapped around a flask. The current supplied to the device, and hence the temperature achieved, is regulated by a rheostat. This type of heating mantle is quite useful for maintaining an intended temperature within <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel,</b> for example, after the contents of a reaction have been removed from a primary heat source.|$|E
50|$|After the biphasic {{solvent system}} has been chosen a batch of is {{formulated}} and equilibrated in <b>a</b> <b>separatory</b> <b>funnel.</b> This step is called pre-equilibration of the solvent system. The two phases are separated. Then the column is filled with stationary with a pump. Next, the column is set an equilibration conditions, such as the desired rotation speed, and the mobile phase is pumped through the column. The mobile phase displaces the {{a portion of the}} stationary phase until column equilibration is achieved and the mobile phase elutes from the column. The sample may be introduced into the column {{at any time during the}} column equilibration step or after equilibration has been accomplished. After the volume of eluant surpasses the volume of the mobile phase in the column, the sample components will begin to elute. Compounds with a partition coefficient of unity will elute when one column volume of mobile phase has passed through the column since the time of injection. The compound can then be introduced to another stationary phase to help increase the resolution of results. The flow is stopped after the target compound(s) are eluted or the column is extruded by pumping the stationary phase through the column. An example of a major application of countercurrent chromatography is to take an extremely complex matrix such as a plant extract, perform the countercurrent chromatography separation with a carefully selected solvent system, and extrude the column to recover all of the sample. The original complex matrix will have been fractionated into discrete narrow polarity bands, which may then be assayed for chemical composition or bioactivity. Performing one or more countercurrent chromatography separations in conjunction with other chromatographic and non chromatographic techniques has the potential for rapid advances in compositional recognition of extremely complex matrices.|$|E
