5|$|<b>After</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, {{the forward}} speed of Dean {{continued}} to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter, Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph (105km/h). Later that day, Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, Nadine began {{weakening}} {{once again}} and deteriorated to a tropical storm at 1200UTC, on October1. Northwesterly winds began to increase on October3, after an upper-level trough that was causing low wind shear moved eastward. A few hours later, the low-level center became partially exposed, before becoming fully separated from the convection by 1500UTC. Due to strong wind shear and cold sea surface temperatures, showers and thunderstorms rapidly diminished, and by late on October3, Nadine became devoid of any deep convection. At 0000UTC on October4, Nadine transitioned into an extratropical low-pressure area, while located about 195miles (315km) southwest of the central Azores. The low rapidly moved northeastward, degenerated into a trough of low pressure, and was absorbed by a cold front later that day.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Joyce caused minor {{impact in}} the ABC and Windward islands during late September and early October 2000. The fourteenth {{tropical}} cyclone, tenth named storm, and sixth hurricane of the season, Joyce developed from a tropical wave located southwest of Cape Verde on September25. Only twelve hours after becoming a cyclone, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Joyce early on September 26. Joyce continued to strengthen and became a hurricane by September 27. On the following day, Joyce peaked with winds of 90mph (150km/h) on September28. <b>After</b> <b>peak</b> intensity on September 28, unfavorable conditions caused Joyce to become disorganized and weaken.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston would become an increasingly strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began to wrap in the storm <b>after</b> <b>peak.</b> It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped into the center, but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained a remnant low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September11 {{and almost immediately}} {{led to the formation}} of a tropical depression by 06:00UTC the next day. Steered in a traditional west-northwest fashion, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Julia twelve hours later and continued steady strengthening to become a hurricane by 12:00UTC September14. As a reminder of limited hurricane intensity forecasting skill, the system began a period of rapid intensification thereafter, attaining peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) by 12:00UTC on September15. Julia became the easternmost Category4 hurricane on record in the Atlantic as a result. <b>After</b> <b>peak,</b> the system recurved around a ridge while simultaneously weakening under influence of Hurricane Igor's outflow. It fell back to tropical storm intensity by 00:00UTC on September18 and degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC on September20 while located about 1,095mi (1,760km) west of the Azores. The remnant low turned back west, dissipating late on September24.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, Gloria {{weakened}} while {{turning to}} the north, moving around {{the western end of}} the ridge, toward a cold front. By September 26, the winds had decreased to 90 mph (150 km/h), just 30 hours after its peak intensity. Later that day, a buoy about 60 mi (100 km) east of the center recorded a wave height of 46.9 ft (14.3 m), which at the time was the highest buoy wave recording in an Atlantic hurricane. While accelerating toward North Carolina, Gloria re-intensified slightly to winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. At 0530 UTC on September 27, the hurricane struck southern Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks. After weakening further, Gloria passed just east of the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey and interacted with a cold front. Its strongest winds remained on {{the eastern edge of the}} circulation, and the storm was gradually losing tropical characteristics. At 1600 UTC on September 27, the hurricane made landfall with a broad and poorly defined center between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Islip, New York, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on western Long Island. This was only about three days after Henri struck the same general area as a much weaker tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, the cyclone's eye {{soon began}} to fill and cool as {{weakening}} ensued. Defying previous forecasts, Hellen continued on a southeasterly track toward Madagascar {{and the likelihood of}} it making landfall became apparent. By the end of March30, Hellen's eye had collapsed and disappeared from satellite imagery, as the combination of dry air and land interaction took their toll on the storm. At about 0800UTC on March31, Hellen made landfall on Mitsinjo, and the previously unfavorable conditions coupled with land interaction to induce rapid weakening. The ridge to the east turned Hellen to a southwest drift over land. By early on April1, the convection largely dissipated as the center became difficult to locate, with peak winds dropping to 45km/h (30mph). As a result, Météo-France discontinued advisories that day, as did the JTWC. The remnants moved back over open waters, but were not expected to reorganize due to the poor nature of the convection. As the low continued to the west, the convection increased on April4 while approaching the coastline of Mozambique, although the system failed to redevelop before moving onshore.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katia was {{a classic}} Cape Verde {{hurricane}} that had substantial impact across Europe as a post-tropical cyclone. The eleventh named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Katia originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic on August29. It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September1, although unfavorable atmospheric conditions hindered strengthening thereafter. As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic, a more hospitable regime allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September5 and peak as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 140mph (220km/h) that afternoon. Internal core processes, increased wind shear, an impinging cold front, and increasingly cool ocean temperatures all prompted the cyclone to weaken almost immediately <b>after</b> <b>peak,</b> and Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September10.|$|E

5|$|On September3, another trough {{exited the}} coast of the United States, {{allowing}} the hurricane to accelerate toward the northeast through the diminished ridge. By that time, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h), although forecasters expected baroclinic instability to maintain much of the cyclone's remaining force. Instead of continued weakening, the hurricane began to significantly re-intensify. Early on September4, Ella again reached major hurricane status, and later that day it peaked with winds of 140mph (220km/h); {{at the time it was}} about 335miles (540km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and its peak winds were measured by Hurricane Hunters. This made it the strongest hurricane ever recorded in Canadian waters. Weakening began immediately <b>after</b> <b>peak</b> intensity due to cooler water temperatures. Early on September5, Ella passed very near Cape Race, although the strongest winds were south and east of the center. Associated convection became completely removed from the center, and the hurricane became extratropical as it was absorbed by a larger mid-latitude system.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{becoming}} a hurricane, Felix developed a well-defined eye as Hurricane Hunters began investigating the storm. Beginning at 1200UTC on August11, the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening, {{and by the}} next day, concentric eyewalls were observed, indicative of a strong storm. On August12, the Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of , suggesting peak surface winds of 140mph (220km/h). At that time, Felix was located north of the Lesser Antilles, moving to the north-northwest due to an approaching trough weakening the ridge. <b>After</b> <b>peak</b> winds, Felix weakened due to stronger wind shear and its eyewall replacement cycle. The eye became indistinct and opened on August13, {{and it became a}} minimal hurricane by August14 with a broad inner core. Late on August14, Hurricane Felix turned more to the west-northwest, after the trough that previously brought it northward split into two pieces of energy, one moving southward and the other moving northeastward. On August15, the hurricane passed about 75mi (120km) south of Bermuda, and a building ridge was anticipated to allow Felix to continue its trajectory toward North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} of a vigorous tropical wave and a disturbance within the Intertropical Convergence Zone {{led to the}} formation of a tropical depression about 520mi (835km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde by 18:00UTC on August21. Steered by a ridge to its north, the depression steadily organized as it moved west-northwest, intensifying into Tropical Storm Danielle by 06:00UTC on August22 and attaining hurricane intensity the following day. Influenced by moderate wind shear initially, Danielle maintained its status as a minimal hurricane for several days. Early on August26, however, a more conducive environment led to rapid intensification, and by 18:00UTC the next day, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 130mph (215km/h). Danielle began to round the western periphery of the steering ridge <b>after</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, curving northeast as it began an eyewall replacement cycle. The inner core change, combined with progressively cooler waters, resulted in the system weakening to a tropical storm by 18:00UTC on August30 and degenerating into a remnant low six hours later. The low became extratropical on August31 maintained distinct until dissipating well east-southeast of Greenland on September3.|$|E

5|$|The {{most intense}} {{hurricane}} {{of the season}} began as a tropical wave that organized into a tropical depression southeast of Cabo Verde early on September8. Initial organization was fast-paced, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Igor six hours after formation. Igor moved west to west-northwest for several days while embedded within the monsoon trough. Increased vertical shear caused the cyclone to temporarily weaken to a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September9, but it re-attained tropical storm intensity {{the next day and}} further strengthened to a hurricane by 00:00UTC on September12. After rapid intensification and a subsequent eyewall replacement cycle, Igor attained its peak with maximum sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h) by 00:00UTC on September15. Inner core changes continued <b>after</b> <b>peak,</b> and Igor continued as a Category4 hurricane for several days until increased shear and dry air entrainment forced a consistent weakening trend early on September17. The system recurved north-northeast while passing within 60mi (95km) of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane. It eventually made landfall near Cape Race, Newfoundland with winds of 85mph (140km/h) by 15:00UTC on September21 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone three hours later. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger such system between Greenland and Labrador on September23.|$|E
5|$|The second {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} season developed on July 22 from a tropical wave nearly midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. The depression slowly intensified, and was eventually upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur, two days later. On July 25, Tropical Storm Arthur crossed the Windward Islands chain, and {{it was noted that}} the storm made landfall on Tobago. Emerging into the Caribbean Sea, Arthur reached nearly attained hurricane status on July 25. Thereafter, wind shear began increasing over Arthur, and a weakening trend began <b>after</b> <b>peak</b> intensity. As Arthur headed further into the Caribbean Sea, it significantly weakened and was downgraded to a {{tropical depression}} on July 27. Later that day, Air Force reconnaissance and satellite imagery did not show a low-level circulation, indicating that Arthur had degenerated into open tropical wave 130mi (209.2km) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{north and}} {{northeast}} {{while under the}} influence of the aforementioned trough, Marty began to weaken soon <b>after</b> <b>peak</b> intensity as deep convection was displaced to the east due to the strong westerly shear; the low-level circulation center became fully exposed in a span of three hours late on September28. Upwelling of cooler waters further decayed the deep convection, prompting the NHC to downgrade Marty to a tropical storm at 06:00UTC (1a.m.CDT) on September29. Continuing to steadily weaken, Marty degenerated into a post-tropical low a day later about 140mi (225km) west-southwest of Acapulco, while still producing gale-force winds. The shallow system turned westwards in the low-level flow and eventually opened up into a trough twelve hours later about 195mi (315km) west of Acapulco. The low became closed once again on October1, however, it failed to produce sufficient organized deep convection to re-qualify as a tropical cyclone. It turned north-northeastwards towards the southern Gulf of California, however it dissipated before reaching the coast of Western Mexico. The remnant moisture continued into Northwestern Mexico and caused flooding in Sonora.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a hurricane on September13, Odile began to accelerate towards the north-northwest {{in the direction of}} the Baja California Peninsula under the influence of both a strengthening mid-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and an upper-level low to the northwest. Following the formation of an eye, Odile began a phase of rapid intensification. Odile attained Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 00:00UTC on September14. Six hours later, the cyclone had reached Category4 intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg), a pressure typical for a Category 5 hurricane. At the time, this pressure reading was tied for the sixth-lowest on record for an east Pacific hurricane. Even though additional deepening was forecast, strengthening leveled off thereafter as an eyewall replacement cycle, common in intense hurricanes, began to run its course. Despite the leveling off in intensity, a United States Air Force aircraft reconnaissance flight observed a barometric pressure of 922mbar (hPa; 27.23inHg); this measurement was the lowest pressure reading officially measured throughout Odile's existence. Nonetheless, the eroding of the hurricane's inner core due to the eyewall replacement cycle resulted in gradual weakening <b>after</b> <b>peak</b> intensity. Still maintaining its north-northwesterly course with little deviation, Odile made landfall near Cabo San Lucas at 04:45UTC on September15 with winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a central pressure of 941 mbar (hPa; 27.79 inHg). The wind estimates tie Odile with Hurricane Olivia in 1967 as the strongest tropical cyclone to move ashore Baja California Sur in the satellite era.|$|E
25|$|The next 30 to 60 {{days of the}} {{lactation}} {{cycle is}} characterized by peak milk production levels. The amount of milk produced per day during this period varies considerably by breed and by individual cow depending on her body condition, genetics, health, and nutrition. During this period the body condition of the cow will suffer because the cow will draw on her body stores to maintain such high milk production. Food intake of the cow also will increase. <b>After</b> <b>peak</b> lactation, the cow’s milk production levels will slowly decline {{for the rest of}} the lactation cycle. The producer will often breed the cow soon after she leaves peak production. For a while, the cow’s food intake will remain high before also beginning a decline to pre lactation levels. <b>After</b> <b>peak</b> milk production her body condition will also steadily recover.|$|E
25|$|The cyclone's rapid {{intensification}} {{phase was}} equaled by a rapid weakening phase almost immediately <b>after</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, and Bertha fell to minimal hurricane intensity by 06:00UTC on July9 {{under the influence}} of strong wind shear. These unfavorable winds quickly slackened, allowing Bertha to regain Category2 intensity by 18:00UTC that day, before the hurricane began an eyewall replacement cycle. A weak steering regime directed the storm just east of Bermuda as it weakened to a tropical storm on July13, and a large upper-level low over the central Atlantic steered it east and southeast. After generally maintaining its strength for several days, an eye redeveloped and convection became more symmetric about the feature on July18, prompting the NHC to upgrade Bertha to a hurricane around 18:00UTC that day. The storm rapidly accelerated ahead of a trough off the East Coast of the United States, forcing Bertha into rapidly cooler waters. Its wind field became extremely asymmetric and deep convection near the center dissipated, indicative of an extratropical transition that Bertha completed by 12:00UTC on July20. The post-tropical cyclone continued northeast and merged with a larger mid-latitude low near Iceland the next day.|$|E
