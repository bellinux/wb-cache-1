5|$|Early Gaelic law tracts, first {{written down}} in the ninth century, reveal a society highly {{concerned}} with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds. Scottish common law {{began to take shape}} {{at the end of the}} period, assimilating Gaelic and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and the Continent. In the twelfth century, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>in</b> the thirteenth, strong continental legal influences began to have more effect, such as Canon law and various Anglo-Norman practices. Pre-fourteenth century law among the native Scots is not always well attested, but extensive knowledge of early Gaelic Law gives some basis for its reconstruction. In the earliest extant Scottish legal manuscript, there is a document called Leges inter Brettos et Scottos. The document survives in Old French, and is almost certainly a French translation of an earlier Gaelic document. It retained a vast number of untranslated Gaelic legal terms. Later medieval legal documents, written both in Latin and Middle English, contain more Gaelic legal terms, examples including slains (Old Irish slán or sláinte; exemption) and cumherba (Old Irish comarba; ecclesiastic heir).|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{we know a}} {{great deal}} about early Gaelic law, often called Brehon Laws, which helps {{reconstruct}} native legal practices.

25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>in</b> his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E

500|$|Spicer says [...] "Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more {{polished}} and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected {{in his role}} as Simon Templar... Moore's humour was a throwaway, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>in</b> the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying [...] "to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous... I mean, this man {{is supposed to be a}} spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy... it's outrageous. So you have to treat the humour outrageously as well".|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{sometimes}} struggled {{to define the}} immense public appreciation for the film. In an interview, Freeman said, [...] "About everywhere you go, people say, The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw [...] " [...] and that such praise [...] "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, [...] "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, {{there are people who}} say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, [...] "If that isn't the best , it's one of the two or three best, <b>and</b> <b>certainly,</b> <b>in</b> moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it." [...] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was [...] "a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje {{in the form}} of {{classical}} Chinese books and sutras, likely written on paper and {{in the form of}} manuscript rolls (kansubon). This probably happened {{at the beginning of the}} 5th century (around 400), <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the introduction of Buddhism in the 6th century. The increasing popularity of Buddhism, strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622), in the late-6th century and early-7th century was one of the factors leading to a rise in the importance of writing. Buddhism required the study of sutras in Chinese. To satisfy the growing demand for them, imported Sui and Tang manuscripts were copied, first by Korean and Chinese immigrants, and later in the mid-7th century by Japanese scribes. The Sangyō Gisho ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. By 673 the entire Buddhist canon had been systematically copied. Not a single sutra survives from before the end of the 6th century. The oldest extant complete sutra copied in Japan dates to 686 and has been designated a National Treasure. During the 7th and 8th centuries, the copying of Buddhist texts, including sutras, dominated writing. Few Chinese secular or local Japanese works (which were rare) were copied. The state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (shakyōjo) before 727 with highly specialized calligraphers, proofreaders and metal polishers to satisfy the large demand for Buddhist texts.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>in</b> itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{as early}} as the 17th century, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>in</b> the 18th and 19th centuries, some Irish {{scholars}} (Charles O'Conor and John O'Donovan, for example) had suggested that the origin of the Attacotti might lie in Ireland. This was based on the perceived similarity between Latin Attacotti and the Old Irish term aithechthúatha, a generic designation for certain Irish population groups, usually translated [...] "rent-paying tribes", [...] "vassal communities" [...] or [...] "tributary peoples". In the context of well-attested Irish raids on the western coast of Britain in the late Roman period, it was suggested that {{one or more of these}} population groups might be the raiders reported by Ammianus in the 360s.|$|E
2500|$|New {{post box}} designs were ordered in 1887 for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. For {{the first time}} there was a lamp-post mounted letter box for use in London squares, but which soon {{established}} themselves in rural areas (see lamp boxes). For the big cities, a double-aperture oval-shaped pillar (designated Type C) was introduced, partly to increase capacity <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>in</b> London, to allow mail to be pre-sorted by region, normally with apertures marked separately for [...] "London" [...] and [...] "Country". All pillar and lamp boxes now had the distinctive Imperial cypher of Victoria Regina, whilst the wall-mounted boxes continued to show only a block cypher VR. The new pillar box design saw out the reign and remained little changed until 1905, when the basic design was refined.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that {{people who live in}} such estates are heavier than people who live in places where walking and cycling are more convenient. It is also reported that the extra motor-traffic such communities generate tends to increase overall per-capita traffic casualty rates. Designs that propose to resolve the contradiction between the cul-de-sac and the traditional interconnected network, such as the Fused Grid, have been proposed and built with varying levels of success. Particular issues have arisen with personal security and public order problems in some housing schemes using [...] "back alley" [...] or [...] "back garden" [...] type links. The UK Manual for Roads (2007) states: [...] "The basic tenet is ‘public fronts and private backs’.

2500|$|Trueman's first {{match in}} the 1950 season was for Yorkshire against the West Indies {{tourists}} at Park Avenue.

He again took 31 first-class wickets, but at the much higher average of 28.25 and his best analysis this time was only 3–28. On the face of it, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>in</b> terms of his bowling figures to date, {{it was a surprise}} that Trueman was selected for the Test Trial. Wisden said that this was [...] "a match immortalised by Jim Laker's eight for two". But Trueman's inclusion was designed to give the England batsmen practice against fast bowling even though, at this period of his career, Trueman was inaccurate in both length and direction. The selectors were driven by the repeated discomfiture of England batsmen against the great Australian bowlers Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, but John Arlott suspected there was also a subconscious urge to [...] "reflect public feeling, the national desire for a fast bowler, even an inexperienced one – anyone so long as he was fast".|$|E
