40|$|We {{introduce}} a facility location problem with submodular facility cost functions, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>an</b> O(log n) approximation algorithm for it.

The hierarchical facility costs model multilevel service installation. Shmoys, Swamy <b>and</b> Levi [18] <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> constant factor approximation algorithm for a two-level version of the problem.

5|$|A Dongan Charter Parade {{was held}} in 1936 for the 250th anniversary celebrations, {{and as part of}} the ceremonies the United States Congress {{authorized}} the minting of an Albany Charter half dollar coin. Tricentennial celebrations held in 1986 included a re-enactment of the signing and awarding of the charter by Governor Mario Cuomo playing Governor Dongan, and Mayor Thomas Whalen playing Mayor Schuyler. Other events during the tricentennial were fireworks, music, the unveiling of a tricentennial clock, a hot-air balloon lift-off from Lincoln Park, and a cake large enough to feed thousands. Mayors from other Albanys around the world were among the visiting dignitaries who were invited to the ceremonies <b>and</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> tour of the city by Mayor Whalen.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{returned}} from his injury on February 19, 2012 at Elimination Chamber to show support for John Laurinaitis. Christian returned on the March 16 episode of SmackDown, hosting an episode of the 'Peep Show' <b>and</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> spot on Laurinaitis' team in a 12-man tag match at WrestleMania XXVIII. On the March 26 episode of Raw, {{as part of a}} storyline, Christian was injured once again after (kayfabe) re-aggravating his neck and shoulder in a match with CM Punk. This was to write him off at WrestleMania as it was later reported that Christian has not yet been fully medically cleared to compete due to a history of shoulder injuries. Despite the injury, Christian still appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct long-time friend Edge.|$|E

5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} what he had done, confessed to the police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder.

She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and {{sentenced to life in prison}}. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico <b>and</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> 15-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, Oberscharführer Bruno Kittel {{demanded that}} Gens hand over Yitzhak Wittenberg, {{a leader of}} the FPO. Although Wittenberg was arrested, he was freed by FPO members.

On 16 July, Wittenberg turned himself in. What happened next is unclear: some sources report that Wittenberg committed suicide while in custody, possibly with a cyanide pill provided by Gens; others state that Wittenberg was poisoned by Gens then turned over to the Gestapo, or that he was tortured to death by the Gestapo <b>and</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> cyanide pill by Gens' second-in-command.|$|E
