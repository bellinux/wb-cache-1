5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who is dressed in <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe,</b> a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces {{to the people of}} Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E
25|$|LAPD detectives {{investigating}} the case quickly concluded that Rasmussen {{had been killed}} by a burglar. Rasmussen's attire (<b>a</b> <b>bathrobe,</b> nightgown, and panties) suggested she was not expecting visitors. Although a maid in a neighboring unit reported hearing screaming and fighting earlier in the day, she did not recall gunshots. She thought the whole event had been a domestic dispute and did not call police. It appeared that the perpetrator had been in the process of taking electronic equipment when Rasmussen had come upon him or them and, as a result, jewelry had been left behind and the vehicle taken as a getaway. The abandoned BMW was recovered a week later; it yielded no new evidence. The only other thing that appeared to have been taken from the home was the couple's marriage license.|$|E
25|$|Even {{when not}} under indictment, he {{prepared}} for inevitable charges (knowing the FBI was watching him). Almost {{every day he}} would return from his residence to his mother's apartment at 225 Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village and emerge dressed in <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe</b> and pajamas or a windbreaker and shabby trousers. Accompanied by one or two bodyguards, he crossed {{the street to the}} Triangle Civic Improvement Association — a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters — where he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with his associates. Regular visitors to the Triangle included senior Genovese caporegimes Liborio Bellomo, John Ardito, Tino Fiumara, Ernest Muscarella and Daniel Leo. From Gigante's 1990 indictment and after his incarceration (in La Tuna, Texas) these men ran the crime family, with all major choices authorized by Gigante from his prison cell.|$|E

500|$|... "Wintour's {{approach}} hit a nerve—this {{was the way}} {{real women}} put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts)," [...] one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe</b> and no apparent makeup. Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models. In August 2014, Gigi Hadid paid tribute to Wintour's first cover.|$|E
500|$|When Balzac was {{exhibited}} in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The Société rejected the work, {{and the press}} ran parodies. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, [...] "there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem outre to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe,</b> but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang." [...] A modern critic, indeed, indicates that Balzac is one of Rodin's masterpieces.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a woman dressed in an 18th-century white nightgown who talked to the {{audience}} briefly before disappearing. There was a video introduction in which different people told their dreams. At {{the end of the}} video, Spears appeared sleeping in a bubble. A platform with a wheel attached rose several feet above the ground, and she appeared strapped to it while wearing a black ensemble. She started rotating in a similar way to a target girl while starting to perform [...] "Oops!...I Did It Again" [...] with her dancers. [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was performed next with Spears captured by her dancers. She left the stage for a costume change while her dancers performed. [...] "Overprotected" [...] was performed next with Spears (dressed in a futuristic version of one of Elvis Presley's jumpsuit) surrounded by laser lights. The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears, with her hair growing as the song went along. In the next section, a giant musical box was raised, and Spears emerged from the middle as a ballerina to perform [...] "Born To Make You Happy". She tore off her tutu and put on a long white satin cote to perform [...] "Lucky" [...] while confetti was shot. The medley ended with a performance of [...] "Sometimes" [...] for which she donned <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe.</b>|$|E

Their voices had aroused others. Ajo {{came out of his}} room, enveloped in <b>a</b> heavy <b>bathrobe,</b> and soon after Maud and Beth joined them.|$|R
2500|$|During {{his rookie}} season in Chicago, he was criticized for {{applying}} for a job at Circuit City {{in order to get}} an employee discount. In a December 2009 Sporting News interview, Artest admitted that he had led a [...] "wild" [...] lifestyle as a young player, and that he drank Hennessy cognac in the locker room at halftime while with the Bulls. In February 2004, he wore <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe</b> over his practice uniform to a Pacers practice as [...] "a symbolic reminder to take it easy".|$|E
2500|$|Ben Hecht later {{claimed that}} {{shortly after the}} killing, he interviewed Wanderer and was struck by Wanderer's happy and {{seemingly}} impassive manner just days after his wife's murder. According to Hecht's story, he found articles of women's clothing in <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe</b> and stumbled across several love letters Wanderer had written to a man called [...] "James". Many writers dispute Hecht's account; records of Wanderer's interrogation and trial make no mention of [...] "James." [...] However, a police psychologist would accuse Wanderer of [...] "latent homosexuality" [...] during his trial.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{act as the}} character's libido. Yamada's Eros Deity {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of a super deformed version of Yamada, but she has a white mustache, and floats on a pink cloud. She occasionally narrates and recaps past events as well as breaks the fourth wall to address the audience. She is voiced by Rumi Shishido and English dubbed by Alexis Tipton. Eros Deities are also depicted for the other characters: Kosuda's Eros Deity wears <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe,</b> has a laid back attitude, and gives ineffective advice such as telling Kosuda to give up and go to bed, but in the anime he more often stands in whenever Kosuda has an erection; Mayu's Eros Deity is dressed like a magical girl and gives innocent love advice such as suggesting that Mayu [...] "indirectly kiss" [...] Takashi with her cookies; Kyoka's Eros Deity is a noblewoman with a fan; Miharu has two deities to represent her serious and her wild side; Chika's Eros Deity appears like a motion blur which indicates they are in sync with each other.|$|E
50|$|Farmer {{performed}} {{the song in}} two French television shows : in Stars 90 (TF1, 11 January 1993), and in World Music Awards (broadcast on TMC, on 13 May 1993; she then won the prize for the French-speaking artist who has sold more records in 1992). At these occasions, the singer wore <b>a</b> white <b>bathrobe</b> and performed <b>a</b> choreographied dance with two female dancers.|$|R
5000|$|When Purdy sends {{psychiatrist}} Captain McLean (Eddie Albert) {{to check}} up on Fisby, the newcomer is quickly won over. This, even after Fisby greets McLean wearing geta, <b>an</b> army <b>bathrobe</b> (which Fisby claims is his kimono) and what Fisby terms an [...] "air-conditioned" [...] straw hat (the latter being headwear worn by Okinawan farmers). McLean later proves to be enthusiastic about organic farming.|$|R
60|$|Yes, he {{was glad}} Freddie was {{engaged to be married}} to Aline Peters. He liked Aline. He liked Mr. Peters.

2500|$|In August 2009, Arudou—acting as {{the chair}} of FRANCA (the Foreign Residents and Naturalized Citizens Association)—began a letter-writing {{campaign}} to protest an advertisement by McDonald’s Japan featuring a bespectacled, mildly geeky, 43-year-old American Japanophile known as Mr. James—a burger mascot who proclaims his love for the fast-food outlet in broken katakana Japanese. Writing in The Japan Times, Arudou argued that the [...] "Mr. James" [...] campaign perpetuates negative stereotypes about non-Japanese Caucasian minorities living in Japan, and demanded that McDonald’s Japan withdraw the advertisement: [...] "Imagine McDonald's, a multinational that has long promoted cultural diversity, launching a McAsia Menu in America featuring a deep-bowing, grimacing Asian in <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe</b> and platform sandals saying 'Me likee McFlied Lice!' or 'So solly, prease skosh honorable teriyaki sandrich?'" [...] Time magazine's Coco Masters concluded: [...] "To protest Mr. James as a stereotype of a minority population in Japan because the Ohio native fails to speak or write Japanese fluently, dresses like a nerd and blogs about burgers only ends up underscoring {{the fact that there}} really aren't a lot of foreigners who fit the bill running around Japan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morissette {{hosted the}} Juno Awards of 2004 dressed in <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe,</b> which {{she took off}} to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a {{response}} to the era of censorship in the U.S. caused by Janet Jackson's breast-reveal incident during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Morissette released her sixth studio album, So-Called Chaos, in May 2004. She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with Tim Thorney and pop music producer John Shanks. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 chart to generally mixed critical reviews, and it became Morissette's lowest seller in the U.S. The lead single, [...] "Everything", achieved major success on adult top 40 radio in America and was moderately popular elsewhere, particularly in Canada, although it failed to reach the top 40 on the U.S. Hot 100. Because the first line of the song includes the word asshole, American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word nightmare instead. Two other singles, [...] "Out Is Through" [...] and [...] "Eight Easy Steps", fared considerably worse commercially than [...] "Everything", although a dance mix of [...] "Eight Easy Steps" [...] was a U.S. club hit.|$|E
2500|$|Gigante {{was even}} more {{concerned}} about keeping law enforcement at bay than Lombardo had been. [...] His best-known tactic to confuse law enforcement was by pretending insanity. Gigante frequently walked down New York streets in <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe,</b> mumbling incoherently. Gigante succeeded in convincing court-appointed psychiatrists that his mental illness was worsening, and avoided several criminal prosecutions. The New York media soon nicknamed Gigante [...] "The Oddfather". Gigante reportedly operated from the Triangle Social Club in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. He never left his house during the day, fearing that the FBI would sneak in and plant a bug. [...] At night, he would sneak away from his house and conduct family business when FBI surveillance was more lax. Even then, he only whispered {{to keep from being}} picked up by wiretaps. [...] To avoid incrimination from undercover surveillance, Gigante decreed that any mobster who spoke his name would face severe punishment. [...] In the case of his own family, anyone who spoke his name would be killed on the spot. [...] When necessary, mobsters would either point to their chins or make a [...] "C" [...] with thumb and forefinger when referring to him. In this way, Gigante managed to stay on the streets while the city's other four bosses ended up getting long prison terms.|$|E

But think of Johnny Bellchambers, the Royal High Chancellor of swell togs and the Mahatma of pink teas, up here in cold storage doing penance in <b>a</b> snuff-colored <b>bathrobe!</b> I can't get it {{straight}} in my mind. Let's ask the jolly old boy that's doing the honors." ...|$|R

Initial eyewitness reports claimed the rifle was an AK-47 assault rifle, which is similar in appearance to the semiautomatic CZ-858.The man opened fire, killing Denis Blanchette, a 48-year-old male stage technician. His 27-year-old colleague, Dave Courage, was critically wounded.|$|R

Pan reacts in surprise and confusion, pushing Suwat off of him. Suwat lands on a glass table and is killed.|$|R
2500|$|Wilson spent a {{great deal}} of the two years {{following}} his father's June 1973 death secluded in the chauffeur's quarters of his home; sleeping, abusing alcohol, taking drugs (including heroin), overeating, and exhibiting self-destructive behavior. He attempted to drive his vehicle off a cliff, and at another time, demanded that he be pushed into and buried in a grave he had dug in his backyard. During this period, his voice deteriorated significantly as a result of his mass consumption of cocaine and incessant chain smoking. Previously, Wilson claimed that he was preoccupied with [...] " [...] drugs and hanging out with Danny Hutton" [...] (whose house became the center of Wilson's social life) during the mid-1970s. John Sebastian often showed up at Wilson's Bel Air home [...] "to jam", and recollected: [...] "It wasn't all grimness." [...] Although increasingly reclusive during the day, Wilson spent many nights at Hutton's house fraternizing with Hollywood Vampire colleagues such as Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop, who were mutually bemused by an extended Wilson-led singalong of the folk song [...] "Shortnin' Bread"; other visitors of Hutton's home included Vampires Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Keith Moon. Micky Dolenz recalls taking LSD with Wilson, Lennon, and Nilsson, where Wilson [...] "played just one note on a piano over and over again". On several occasions, Marilyn Wilson sent her friends to climb Hutton's fence and retrieve her husband. Jimmy Webb reported Wilson's presence at an August 2, 1974 session for Nilsson's [...] "Salmon Falls"; he kept in the back of the studio playing [...] "Da Doo Ron Ron" [...] haphazardly on a B3 organ. Later that month, he was photographed at Moon's 28th birthday party (held on August 28 at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel) wearing only his bathrobe. Sometime in 1974, Wilson interrupted a set by jazz musician Larry Coryell at The Troubadour by leaping onto stage and singing [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula", again wearing slippers and <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe.</b>|$|E

He felt strong and happy and exuberant.|$|E
5000|$|LoleLole is {{the gypsy}} love {{interest}} of the now deceased Manu and Ugo. She is described in the novel as [...] "Her hands deep {{in the pockets of}} <b>a</b> straw-coloured <b>bathrobe.</b> The colour made her skin look browner than usual and emphasized the blackness of her hair, which she was wearing short now. Her hips may have grown thicker, he wasn't sure. She'd become a woman, but she hadn't changed. Lole, the gypsy. She'd always been beautiful." ...|$|R
50|$|Although not of Scottish heritage, Zimmer {{was often}} seen at {{conventions}} {{and other public}} occasions dressed in the MacAlpin tartan, complete with sporran. At home, he frequently wore <b>a</b> blue <b>bathrobe,</b> appearing in normal clothing only when needing to deal with officials or others outside his circle. Zimmer habitually wrote at night, and many visitors can attest to him pacing {{up and down as}} he thought through plot and wording problems, or pausing to do a martial arts dance with his swords.|$|R
50|$|Dahlia {{agrees to}} {{move closer to}} Kyle so shared custody will be easier. As she packs, a girl in <b>a</b> hooded <b>bathrobe</b> who resembles Cecilia asks her to read to her.

Natasha locks Cecilia in the shower compartment and holds her underwater. Dahlia pleads with Natasha to let her daughter go, promising to be her mother forever. Floods overwhelm the apartment, and Natasha and the ghost of Dahlia walk the hall as mother and daughter.|$|R
60|$|If {{ever there}} was an angry man, it was Asa Lemm at that {{particular}} moment. He had to change all his night clothing, and then don <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe</b> and slippers and go down below once more and {{get some of the}} hired help to clean up his room and take away the wet mattress of his bed. A dry mattress was substituted from a vacant bedroom, but it was all of half an hour before this work was accomplished; and in the meantime the professor stormed around, threatening about everything he could imagine.|$|E
60|$|As he {{was coming}} in that evening he passed her in the hall. She was clad in what he called <b>a</b> <b>bathrobe,</b> and what she called an Arabian burnoose, of black {{embroidered}} with dull-gold crescents and stars, showing a V of exquisite flesh at her throat. A shred of tenuous lace straggled loose {{at the opening of}} the burnoose. Her radiant hair, tangled over her forehead, shone with a thousand various gleams from the gas-light over her head as she moved back against the wall and stood waiting for him to pass. She smiled very doubtfully, distantly--the smile, he felt, of a great lady from Mayfair. He bobbed his head, lowered his eyes abashedly, and noticed that along the shelf of her forearm, held against her waist, she bore many silver toilet articles, and such a huge heavy fringed Turkish bath-towel as he had never seen before.|$|E

After ordering room service from {{the concierge}} in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless.

50|$|At {{approximately}} 6:20 am on September 2, 2003, Johnson {{took the}} murder weapon, a Winchester rifle from the guest house. The tenant {{of the house}} had left for Boise, Idaho, and had not planned on returning {{for a week or}} so. She then walked into her parents' bedroom and shot her sleeping mother in the head, whereupon she walked into the bathroom and shot her father in the chest, right above the heart, while he was showering. DNA evidence was presented at trial from <b>a</b> discarded <b>bathrobe</b> and <b>a</b> latex glove that police found in the garbage can in front of the house. It contained the DNA of both victims and Sarah. Along with the robe and latex glove was a leather glove that had gunshot residue on it. In Johnson's bedroom investigators located the other leather glove that belonged to the pair.|$|R
