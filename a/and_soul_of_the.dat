500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the first season, one of the show's animators confirmed that [...] "Derpy" [...] would be a scripted background character in the second season, and was a part of several sight gags.

Though most of the fans appreciated the inclusion, some viewers had a negative response to the character, believing her portrayal insulted the mentally handicapped. Hasbro subsequently modified these scenes, and while [...] "Derpy" [...] is still present in subsequent broadcast and digital versions of the episode, she is not named, and a different voice is used. According to Hasbro's Nicole Agnello, [...] "Some viewers felt that aspects of the episode 'The Last Roundup' did not stay true to the core message of friendship which is the heart <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. Hasbro Studios decided to make slight audio alterations to this single episode." [...] Despite Hasbro's intentions, some members of the brony community were disappointed, and some made efforts to restore the original voice. [...] "Derpy" [...] remained in background cameos throughout other episodes in season 2 and 3. Within season 4, Derpy was re-introduced, remaining silent and unnamed but with her original wall-eyed look, as a side character in the main story of [...] "Rainbow Falls". The appearance was planned as a big reveal for the brony fans, according to co-director Jim Miller, and that [...] "she is here to stay" [...] according to Hasbro's vice president for entertainment Mike Vogel.

IGN Monfette, less impressed by the character, criticized her storyline as [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do."
