5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent <b>assay)</b> type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional <b>assay.</b> This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release <b>assay</b> (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the mycotoxin contamination of the fodder given in the food of dairy cows from family farms, in Ilfov County. For pursuing the proposed purpose, 21 <b>assays</b> of fodder (6 <b>assays</b> of fibrous feed and 15 <b>assays</b> of concentrated feed) were gathered and analysed from farms located in the Ilfov County. The mycotoxicological analysis {{was done with the}} ELISA imunoenzymatic test for the following mycotoxins: total aflatoxins (AF), ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxinivalenol (DON), zearalenona (ZEA) and T- 2 toxin (T- 2). The results obtained have been statistically processed with the help of JMP 6. 0 program (SAS Company, 2005). The interpretation of the results was done after the CE Rules No. 1881 / 2006 and 1126 / 2007 regarding the admitted limits for mycotoxins in fodder and food. The results obtained highlighted that from the total of 21 analysed <b>assays,</b> in 9, 52 % <b>assays</b> (2 <b>assays)</b> no mycotoxin was determined, in 19, 05 <b>assays</b> (4 <b>assays)</b> one mycotoxin was determined, in 33, 3 % <b>assays</b> (7 <b>assays)</b> two mycotoxins were determined, in 28, 5 % (6 <b>assays)</b> three mycotoxins were determined, in 9, 52 % <b>assays</b> (2 <b>assays)</b> four mycotoxins were determined and in 0 <b>assays</b> were determined five mycotoxins...|$|R

40|$|The wide {{availability}} of fibrinogen estimations {{based on the}} prothrombin time (PT-Fg) has caused concern about the variability and clinical utility of fibrinogen <b>assays.</b> In a multi-centre study, we investigated fibrinogen <b>assays</b> using various reagents and analysers, Clauss <b>assays</b> generally gave good agreement, although one reagent gave 15 - 30 % higher values in DIC and thrombolysis. Two commercial reference preparations had much lower potencies than the manufacturers declared, and plasma turbidity influenced parallelism in some Clauss <b>assays,</b> PT-Fg <b>assays</b> gave higher values than Clauss and showed calibrant dependent effects, the degree of disparity correlating with calibrant and test sample turbidity. Analyser and thromboplastin dependent differences were noted. The relationship between Clauss and PT-Fg <b>assays</b> was sigmoid, and the plateau of maximal PT-Fg differed by about 2 g/l between reagents. ELISA and immunonephelometric <b>assays</b> correlated well, but {{with a high degree}} of scatter. Antigen levels were higher than Clauss, but slightly lower than PT-Fg <b>assays,</b> which appeared to be influenced by degraded fibrinogen.

25|$|An <b>assay</b> (analysis) {{is never}} an {{isolated}} process {{and must be}} combined with pre- and post-analytic procedures. The information communication (e.g. request to perform an <b>assay</b> and further information processing) or specimen handling (e.g. collection, transport and processing) that are done {{until the beginning of}} an <b>assay</b> are the preanalytic steps. Similarly, after the <b>assay,</b> the result may be documented, verified and transmitted/communicated in steps that are called post-analytic steps. Like any multi-step information handling and transmission systems, variation and errors in the communicated final results of an <b>assay</b> involve corresponding parts in every such step; i.e. not only analytic variations and errors intrinsic to the <b>assay</b> itself but also variations and errors involved in preanalytic and post analytic steps. Since the <b>assay</b> itself (the analytic step) gets much attention, steps that get less attention by the chain of users, i.e. the preanalytic and the post analytic steps, are often less stringently regulated and generally more prone to errors – e.g. preanalytic steps in medical laboratory assays may contribute to 32–75% of all lab errors.|$|E
