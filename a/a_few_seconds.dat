5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads.

5|$|Arguably {{the most}} sought-after lost episode is Episode 4 of the final William Hartnell serial, The Tenth Planet, which ends with the First Doctor's {{regeneration}} into the Second.

5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907.

The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1.

5|$|Electric {{currents}} induced in the ionosphere generate {{magnetic fields}} (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated {{near where the}} atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields {{by as much as}} one degree.

5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even for just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits.

The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the fourth stage, the level then increments, and the game repeats the stages with progressive difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs get speedier. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level however, consists of 5 stages with the final stage at 125m. The 22nd level is colloquially known as the kill screen, due to an error in the game's programming that kills Mario after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> effectively ending the game.|$|E
