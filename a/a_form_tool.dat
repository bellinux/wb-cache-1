50|$|<b>A</b> <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> is precision-ground into {{a pattern}} that resembles the part to be formed. The form tool {{can be used as}} a single {{operation}} and therefore eliminate many other operations from the slides (front, rear and/or vertical) and the turret, such as box tools. <b>A</b> <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> turns one or more diameters while feeding into the work. Before the use of form tools, diameters were turned by multiple slide and turret operations, and thus took more work to make the part. For example, <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> can turn many diameters and in addition can also cut off the part in a single operation and eliminate the need to index the turret. For single-spindle machines, bypassing the need to index the turret can dramatically increase hourly part production rates.|$|E

40|$|In this study, <b>a</b> <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> {{that has}} <b>an</b> {{integrated}} structure was redesigned. Limitations {{on the end}} product variations and high purchase price were the most significant reasons for re-creating the tool structure. The {{aim of the research}} was to develop <b>a</b> <b>forming</b> <b>tool,</b> the construction of which is the nearest thing to simple and manufacturing costs are as low as possible. With the tool to be developed it could be possible to manufacture different kind of end products with minimal tool modifications. As a result of the development process, <b>a</b> modular structured <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> was created, which makes production of different types of end products possible only by changing <b>a</b> few <b>form</b> giving components into the tool. Besides the flexibility on the end products, a significant cost advantage is attained in comparison to the integrated structure.

50|$|For the {{machining}} of complex shapes, {{it is common}} to use form tools. This contrasts with the cutting that is performed on an engine lathe where the cutting tool is usually a single-point tool. <b>A</b> <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> has the form or contour of the final part but in reverse, so it cuts the material leaving the desired component shape. This contrasts to a single-point tool, which cuts on one point at a time and the shape of the component is dictated by the motion of the tool rather than its shape.|$|E
40|$|The method {{involves}} {{providing a}} deformable substrate (11) and using <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> (15). The substrate has a polyimide film (12) sandwiched between two metallised layers (13, 14), e. g. of copper. During production, the metallisation layers are simultaneously pressed by {{displacement of the}} substrate. The substrate is displaced in a process involving pressure and temperature using the form tool and e. g. application of e. g. current, laser radiation, or ultrasound, the through contact is formed.

40|$|The {{profitability}} of forming processes strongly depends on tool life. On this account, {{the main goal}} is to minimize <b>tool</b> wear. During <b>forming</b> operations, the four main wear mechanisms adhesion, abrasion, tribochemical reaction and surface breakdown appear. Abrasion and surface breakdown depend on the stress conditions and normally occur after several strokes. Adhesion and tribochemical reaction can appear right from the first stroke and are mainly triggered by temperature. Beside the known mechanic parameters influencing wear behavior like the die clearance, there are other aspects insufficiently examined. Thermoelectric currents and voltages occur in every <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> and their influence on wear behavior has already been proven {{in the field of}} machining. However, there are no investigations on these currents and their impact on wear behavior in <b>a</b> <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> In this report, thermoelectric currents during lubricated and dry embossing respectively blanking operations were measured.

In order to record the experimental data, an accurate non-contact optical measuring method was used. Experimental and finite element results have shown that, in the fixed scan speed patterns, by increasing the speed, the longitudinal distortion and bending angle were reduced.
