500|$|Dylan {{has stated}} {{that he had to}} {{overcome}} considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer Robert Shelton: [...] "I wanted to call that album Highway 61 Revisited. Nobody understood it. I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it what he wants to call it'." [...] Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: [...] "Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long revisit, since it is such a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before , all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{positive}} reviews, Star Fox Adventures is often criticised for its setting being {{too much of}} a departure from the other Star Fox games. Casamassina said that [...] "Fans expecting a true Star Fox experience akin to the older games <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> disappointment". He also added that the Star Fox license has been utilised sparingly {{to the point where the}} game felt [...] "out of place within the confines of the Star Fox game universe". Casamassina asserted that Fox was [...] "clearly only on 'Dinosaur Planet' at Nintendo's request, not because he belongs". NGC Magazine similarly expressed concern on why Fox was added to the game, adding that Adventures was [...] "one game Fox himself would probably want to forget" [...] and further speculating that Nintendo only added the Star Fox license to prevent Dinosaur Planet from appearing on the Xbox.|$|E
500|$|Tom Laskin of Isthmus {{wrote that}} the {{significant}} [...] "sonic tweaking and abundant sampling" [...] of Version 2.0 is discarded as the songs are supported primarily by [...] "bass, drum, and guitar configurations". Observing a musical theme, it is [...] "the band's abandonment of digitally manipulated perfection in favor of rawer guitars and more immediate vocal performances." [...] He added that, overall, the album is [...] "far less commercially accommodating {{than any of the}} band's previous work. It embraces no particular sound or style. It comes across with ideas and commentary that challenge rather than coerce, and the playing lacks the burnished, artificial quality that's characteristic of so much youth-oriented music these days." [...] Peter Robinson of the NME {{wrote that the}} album was a [...] "departure from the sound Garbage had established on their first two records"; It is [...] "marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds that mix rock with hip hop, electronica, new wave, and girl groups." [...] Sound on Sound described the band's approach to recording guitars as [...] "distinctive", observing the [...] "distorted crunches cheek-by-jowl with delicate acoustics and treated sounds which are almost unrecognizable." [...] Michael Paoletta of Billboard noted that audiences expecting [...] "more of the same [...] <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wonderful surprise." [...] The band eschews [...] "disco-infused electronica foundations for more straight-up rock'n'pop". [...] "Modern tales for modern times, sung by the vocally versatile Manson, make for one of the year's best." [...] Q described it as [...] "sharp, seductive music from a band at their peak." [...] Uncut called it [...] "their most accomplished and convincing album yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even modern grandmasters {{study the}} book. Frank Brady {{wrote in his}} {{biography}} of World Champion Bobby Fischer that Chess Openings Ancient and Modern {{was one of the}} most heavily annotated books in Fischer's personal library. Fischer had pencilled in his own analyses of the Scotch Game, Giuoco Piano, Evans Gambit, Bishop's Gambit, Danish Gambit, and other openings. Specifically referring to the analysis in Chess Openings Ancient and Modern, Grandmaster Robert Byrne wrote in a 1991 New York Times chess column, [...] "Ingenious strategies and tactics were tried out in the old days, and if your opponent knows them and you don't, you <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pounding." [...] Likewise Fischer, in his famous book My 60 Memorable Games, annotating an Evans Gambit that he had won against Reuben Fine, cited analysis from the 1893 edition of Chess Openings Ancient and Modern as an improvement on Fine's ninth move.|$|E
2500|$|Terpening’s second thriller, League of Shadows (2005), was a {{contemporary}} novel of intrigue with an extensive back story {{that takes place}} in Italy during the Fascist Era. The historical scenes depict the efforts of three spies in 1943 to infiltrate Italian leader Benito Mussolini’s secret police, the OVRA. Decades after that intrigue went horribly wrong, an unknown enemy begins to hunt down the former secret agents, and their one hope for survival is an ex-cop obsessed with his mission. The Midwest Book Review called the novel “an addictive read, weaving together human drive, determination, and betrayal into a gripping whole”, while Lucille Cormier, in The Historical Novels Review, said that “You can race through this suspense thriller riding the whirlwind of drug busts, jungle guerrilla attacks, gun fights, assassinations, and love affairs right into the breathtaking climax. Or, if you are disciplined enough, you can turn each page slowly and savor the extraordinary visual and historical detail Ron Terpening has painted into his complex story. Either way, you <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> treat. This is a book to add to every collection of historical fiction.” Joel Tscherne (Cleveland Public Library) noted in Library Journal that this is a novel that “fans of Jack Higgins’s thrillers will enjoy.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Jo Garfein at TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} preview, saying, [...] "This episode {{has more of}} an early X-Files feel, in a good way... To {{those of you who}} have either given up on the series or are on the fence, I recommend that you give Fringe another try. If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season." [...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'" [...] Apparently, they're keeping track of these creatures or Observers. And if so, where are the others?" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of release, {{professional}} reviews were overall mixed. Record Mirror stated: [...] "Assuming that the title {{should be taken to}} mean that the group are trying to visit the territorial war grounds of their golden years in the singles charts I reckon they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> shock. I expect a little more than references to Big Brother, Stereo, Radio etc, in the otherwise catchy [...] "Sign of the Times" [...] and the reflection of [...] "Born to Run" [...] in [...] "Wheels Ain't Coming Down". On [...] "Nuts Bolts & Screws" [...] and [...] "My Baby's Got It" [...] Slade start to rock, but there's nothing here to distinguish them from any other rocking combo. I wasn't expecting another [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "My Friend Stan" [...] but just something a little more inspired. From a new band this would be a fairly good debut, from Slade I want more." [...] Sounds were similar in their reception, writing: [...] "Slade have managed to pull a fair to impressive performance out of the bag with this one. Sure to new wave lugs it sounds dated, but Return to Base still rocks like a good un', utilising standard rock 'n' roll/hard rock foundations for commendable displays of tightness and old time rock bite. Noddy's got one of the all time classic rock voices as he belts through ten steamy originals and one Chuck Berry cover. Slade may have stood still, but their own brand of rock shout clout still sounds good to these biased ears." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alex Lai of Contactmusic {{likewise}} noted that, [...] "Those who {{are familiar}} with the earlier work of NFG <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> shock. Beginning in more relaxed fashion than expected, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is a grand love ballad, serious in tone but retaining the group's ability to produce a catchy hook. Far from being a one-off experiment, these are actually the characteristics to the album and like Blink-182 before going on hiatus, New Found Glory have allowed their music to mature." [...] Jack Foley of Indie London, gave the album four stars out of five and described it as [...] "utterly engaging". While mentioning standout tracks, he added, [...] "The low-key [...] "Make Your Move" [...] drops some beautifully cascading riffs, while, the chiming piano chords that open [...] "It’s Not Your Fault" [...] give way into an effortlessly inspiring song." [...] People magazine declared that Coming Home is [...] "their best album yet", while Dan Aquilante of The New York Post awarded a score of three stars out of four and wrote that the album is [...] "a smart, stylistic mix rich in vocal harmonies, it's driven by guitar and piano breaks. The notion of getting back to family, friends and better days connects the 13 tracks." [...] British rock publication Kerrang! awarded the album a [...] "great" [...] four K! rating. Rae Alexandra opined that Coming Home [...] "displays a new level of sensitivity and subtlety; a new take on harmonies and melodies." [...] He noted that while the album isn't as immediate as previous material, it will [...] "move you far more deeply in the long run. It's hopeful; learned; masterfully executed. It's everything New Found Glory have been leading to all this time; and it's everything we never knew they had in them. Absolutely stunning." [...] Florida-based newspaper, The Palm Beach Post were also highly favorable and graded the album as an [...] "A-". They wrote, [...] "It's all written in beautifully vulnerable, snarkless, shout-it-out-loud terms, with an unself-conscious joy in the lyrics, the do-do-dos and the muted hand claps that find a sweet, genuine current of emotion without sacrificing edge. Pundik's delivery is never cloying, ironic or dumb. Underscored by drummer Cyrus Bolooki's strong beat, the songs are like a pre-made mix tape about {{the ups and downs of}} making yourself honestly vulnerable to another human being. Bravo." [...] Rock Sound journalist Tim Newbound rated the album at nine out of ten and particularly praised the band's progression. Writing that, [...] "New Found Glory have come of age. Their punchy punk-pop styling of old may have temporarily waned, but their knack of writing inducing melodies amid sincere delivery has only intensified. Pundik's nasal-edged vocals have now blossomed into a fuller pitch, perfectly complimenting his band's more tuneful and matured musicianship. Top notch." ...|$|E
