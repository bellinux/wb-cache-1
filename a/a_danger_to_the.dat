5|$|The New Harbour {{was later}} renamed as Keppel Harbour in 1900 after Admiral Sir Henry Keppel of HMS Meander, {{who carried out}} an on-site survey to build an {{anchorage}} in the harbour in the 1880s. He was also known for his successful campaigns against the pirates in 1842 that were boldly harassing merchant ships {{in close proximity to}} the harbour.

A Titan later appears and begins fighting the other Titans while ignoring humans; the Titan is revealed to be Eren, who has developed the ability to transform into one.

5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} vented by {{swivelling}} funnels posed <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, {{and the smaller}} one exhausted vertically a little past {{the edge of the}} flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the petition, the council set up a commission that proposed a city synod. For this gathering, Bucer provided a draft document of sixteen articles on church doctrine. The synod convened on 3 June 1533 at the Church of the Penitent Magdalens to debate Bucer's text, eventually accepting it in full. Sectarian leaders were brought before the synod and questioned by Bucer. Ziegler was dismissed and allowed to stay in Strasbourg; Hoffmann was imprisoned as <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state; and Schwenckfeld left Strasbourg of his own accord.|$|E

5|$|Support {{for reform}} {{came from an}} {{unexpected}} source—a faction of the Tory Party—in 1829. The Tory government under Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, responding to the danger of civil strife in largely Roman Catholic Ireland, drew up the Catholic Relief Act 1829. This legislation repealed various laws that imposed political disabilities on Roman Catholics, in particular laws that prevented them from becoming members of Parliament. In response, disenchanted Tories who perceived <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> established religion came to favour parliamentary reform, in particular the enfranchisement of Manchester, Leeds, and other heavily Noncomformist cities in northern England.|$|E
5|$|The main {{provisions}} of the Act were focused upon allowing the Commonwealth to enact legislation that was required for the smooth prosecution of the war. The main areas in which legislation was enacted under the War Precautions Act were: the prevention of trade with hostile nations, the creation of loans {{to raise money for}} the war effort, the introduction of a national taxation scheme, the fixing of the prices of certain goods, the internment of people considered <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war effort, the compulsory purchase of strategic goods, and the censorship of the media.|$|E

5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, {{proclaimed the}} colony of Africa Orientale Italiana (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian {{victory in the}} Second Italo-Ethiopian War, fought 3 October 1935 – May 1936) and the {{existing}} Italian possessions of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes {{along the coast of}} East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. (The Kingdom of Egypt remained neutral during World War II but the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 allowed the British to occupy Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.) Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the Comando Supremo (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.|$|E
5|$|While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented {{soldiers}} {{began to}} pose <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> young United States. Most {{of the army}} was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and {{they had not been}} paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of half their pay when they were discharged. By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers. In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander McDougall. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the lobbying of the United Fruit Company, several other factors also led the United States to launch the coup that toppled Árbenz in 1954. During {{the years of the}} Guatemalan Revolution, military coups occurred in several other Central American countries that brought firmly anti-communist governments to power. Army officer Major Oscar Osorio won staged elections in El Salvador in 1950, Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista took power in 1952. Honduras, where the land-holdings of the United Fruit Company were the most extensive, had been ruled by an anti-communist government sympathetic to the United States since 1932. These developments created tension between the other governments and Árbenz, which was exacerbated by Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion. This support also worried the United States and the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency. According to US historian Richard Immerman, during the beginning of the Cold War, the US and the CIA tended to assume that everybody who opposed it was a communist. Thus, despite Arévalo's ban of the communist party, important figures in the US government were already predisposed to believe that the revolutionary government had been infiltrated by communists, and was <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US. During the years of the revolution, several reports and memoranda were circulated amongst US government agencies that furthered this belief.|$|E
