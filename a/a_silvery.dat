5|$|Freshly {{prepared}} samarium has <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> luster. In air, {{it slowly}} oxidizes {{at room temperature}} and spontaneously ignites at 150°C. Even when stored under mineral oil, samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the oxide-hydroxide mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Lu and atomic number 71. It is <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> white metal, which resists corrosion in dry air, {{but not in}} moist air. Lutetium is the last element in the lanthanide series, and it is traditionally counted among the rare earths. Lutetium is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals, although lanthanum is more often considered as such.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 5-5.5 mm. The forewings {{are dark}} brown, {{with a slight}} reddish luster and <b>a</b> small <b>silvery</b> gray spot {{at the base of}} the costa, as well as <b>a</b> brilliant <b>silvery</b> fascia just before the middle and <b>a</b> narrow <b>silvery</b> spot at the tornus. Beyond this, near the apex, is <b>a</b> larger <b>silvery</b> costal mark. The hindwings are dark brownish gray. Adults have been recorded on wing from June to July.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The forewings are dark blackish brown with a bright, bluish metallic sheen and with <b>a</b> round, <b>silvery</b> white dot {{on the cell}} and <b>an</b> oblong, <b>silvery</b> white dash {{at the end of}} the cell. The hindwings are blackish brown with <b>a</b> large <b>silvery</b> white spot on the middle of costa and a somewhat smaller similar spot just below it on the dorsal edge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The forewings are yellowish brown, or light rust-brown, with white and shining silvery costal and dorsal streaks, {{more or less}} confluent on the wing-middle, and with two, noticeable, rosy flesh-coloured, short length-streaks, one at the upper edge of the outer end of the cell, the other wider, beyond {{the end of the}} cell. There is a rather oblique white costal streak, at one-fifth, with a few black scales along its inner edge, its outer half touched with shining silvery. This meets the apex of <b>a</b> short <b>silvery</b> dorsal streak, at about one-fourth, and is followed by <b>a</b> second, shorter, <b>silvery</b> and white costal streak to which there is no corresponding dorsal one. <b>A</b> third, <b>silvery</b> and white costal streak, is scarcely beyond the middle, and is interrupted by the first rosy flesh-coloured streak before joining <b>a</b> longer <b>silvery</b> oblique streak {{from the middle of the}} dorsum beyond this again are four short white costal streaks before the apex, the first two sometimes confluent, and both tipped with silvery, the second rosy flesh-coloured length-streak separating them from <b>a</b> long <b>silvery</b> dorsal streak arising obliquely outward from near the tornus. There are also <b>a</b> few <b>silvery</b> scales on the termen below the outer white costal streak which occupies the apex and apical cilia. The terminal cilia is whitish, touched with brown on the middle of the termen and at the tornus. The hindwings are dark slaty grey, with a strong rosy iridescence.|$|R
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|When refined, uranium is <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> white, weakly {{radioactive}} metal. It has a Mohs hardness of 6, {{sufficient to}} scratch glass and approximately {{equal to that}} of titanium, rhodium, manganese and niobium. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor. Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1g/cm3, denser than lead (11.3g/cm3), but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E
50|$|The blotched chub is <b>a</b> slender, <b>silvery</b> minnow {{with dark}} 'I' shaped {{vertical}} patches along the lateral {{portion of the}} body.|$|R
60|$|Presently it came, in <b>a</b> woman's <b>silvery</b> tones, {{that sounded}} strangely still and small in the spaces of that tomb-like church.|$|R

5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, {{it should not be}} stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. Hassium {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 8 elements: it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier homologue to osmium in group 8. The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements. In bulk quantities, hassium is expected to be <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> metal that reacts readily with oxygen in the air, forming a volatile tetroxide.|$|E
5|$|V. thapsus is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} produces a rosette of leaves {{in its first year}} of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>a</b> stout <b>silvery</b> minnow with {{moderately}} small {{eyes and}} a small mouth. Adults may reach 3.5 inches in total length.|$|R

5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding plumage has <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E

25|$|The orange-spotted {{trevally}} has <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> grey- to brassy-coloured body, becoming paler to <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> white ventrally. Many conspicuous orange {{to yellow}} spots {{occur on the}} sides of the fish, giving the species its name, and make for an easy way to identify the fish in the field. An entirely yellow variant has been reported, although the fish is thought to be able to rapidly change between its normal colour configuration and this colour. The colour of the fins ranges from hyaline to lemon yellow, and no dark opercular spot is present.|$|E
25|$|USS Silversides (SS/AGSS-236) is a Gato-class submarine, {{the first}} ship of the United States Navy {{to be named}} for the silversides, a small fish marked with <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> stripe along each side of its body.|$|E
25|$|Both grey-tailed and yellow-tailed silver Asian arowanas {{are dark}} grey {{on the back}} and silver on the sides, with dark ring patches on the lateral scales and <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> or whitish belly. In yellow-tailed specimens, the fin {{membranes}} are yellowish with dark-grey rays. In grey-tailed specimens, the fins are uniformly dark grey.|$|E
50|$|Short-Finned Molly or Common Molly: They inhabit {{fresh water}} streams and coastal {{brackish}} and marine waters of Mexico. The wild-type fish are <b>a</b> dull <b>silvery</b> color, often sprinkled black all over. The common molly can produce fertile hybrids with many Poecilia species, most importantly the sailfin molly. The wild form {{is in fact}} quite rarely kept, as it has <b>a</b> rather plain <b>silvery</b> coloration suffused with brown and green hues.|$|R

25|$|Thirdly, in {{the correct}} percentages, it can {{contribute}} <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> sheen to the article being manufactured. There is evidence of arsenical bronze daggers from the Caucasus and other artifacts from different locations having an arsenic rich surface layer which {{may well have been}} produced deliberately by ancient craftsmen, and Mexican bells were made of copper with sufficient arsenic to colour them silver.|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is bluish-grey to green above, {{changing}} to <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> white on its sides and belly. The dorsal and anal fins are pale to yellow, becoming dusky at the outer edges. The pectoral and pelvic fins are also pale with dusky upper halves, while the caudal fin is dark, {{particularly on the}} leading and trailing edges. A large black spot is present on the operculum.|$|E
25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is a {{metallic}} blue to blue-green colour above grading to <b>a</b> <b>silvery</b> white below with a characteristic broad yellow stripe {{extending from the}} upper margin of the eye to the caudal peduncle. A black opercular spot is prominent and often extends onto the shoulder. The dorsal, anal and caudal fins are pale to dusky yellow, the pelvic fins are white and the pectoral fins hyaline.|$|E
