The modes {{in which}} Nature {{produces}} variable curves {{on a large}} scale are very numerous, but may generally be resolved into the gradual increase or diminution of some given force. Thus, if a chain hangs between two points A and B, Fig. 95, the weight of chain sustained by any given link increases gradually from the central link at C, which has only its own weight to sustain, to the link at B, which sustains, besides its own, the weight of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> <b>between</b> it and C. This increased weight is continually pulling the curve of the swinging chain more nearly straight as it ascends towards B; and hence one of the most beautifully gradated natural curves--called the catenary--of course assumed not by chains only, but by all flexible and elongated substances, suspended between two points. If the points of suspension be near each other, we have such curves as at D; and if, as in nine cases out of ten will be the case, one point of suspension is lower than the other, a still more varied and beautiful curve is formed, as at E. Such curves constitute nearly the whole beauty of general contour in falling drapery, tendrils and festoons of weeds over rocks, and such other pendent objects.[89] ...|$|E

One of the most well-known examples {{in this context is}} the marriage network of sixteen families in Florence, which showed how the Medici family gained power and took control of Florence by creating a high number of inter-marriages with the other families. “Thus, decisions about profitable relations are not a situation of choice, but a situation of strategic interaction - an aspect that is best covered by Game Theory”. In these kinds of settings, the nodes are usually called players, where {1, 2,… } is a set of players that have formed links in a network. Social Networks have diverse settings, however the simplest ones can be described by an undirected graph whereas more complicated situations are represented by directed graphs. [...] There are fundamental differences in the way these games are modeled depending on their graph structure. If a link exists between player [...] and player [...] it is noted as [...] In cases of undirected networks, [...] is considered equal to [...] A network [...] represents a list of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> <b>between</b> players.

In the context of wireless sensor networks where random predistribution of keys is employed, we are the first to provide a mathematically precise proof, with a clear indication of parameter choice, that two crucial properties—connectivity via secure links and resilience against malicious attacks—can be obtained simultaneously. We also show in a mathematically rigorous way that the network enjoys another strong security property. The adversary cannot partition the network into two linear size components, compromising <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> <b>between</b> them, unless it captures linearly many nodes.

40|$|In this paper, we {{theoretically}} {{analyze the}} outage probability of decode-and-forward (DF) relaying system allowing intra-link errors (DF-IE), where the relay always forwards the decoder output to the destination {{regardless of whether}} errors are detected after decoding in the information part or not. The results apply to practical fading scenarios where <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> <b>between</b> the nodes suffer from independent block Rayleigh fading. The key idea with DF-IE system is that the data sequence forwarded by the relay is highly correlated with the original information sequence sent from the source, and hence with a proper joint decoding technique at the destination, the correlation knowledge can well be exploited to improve the system performance. We analyze this problem in the information theoretical framework of correlated source coding. Using the theorems for lossy sourcechannel separation and for source coding with side information, the exact outage probability is derived. It is then shown that the exact expression {{can be reduced to}} a simple, yet accurate approximation by replacing the theorem for source coding with side information by the Slepian-Wolf theorem. Compared with conventional DF relaying where relay keeps silent if errors are detected after decoding, DF-IE can achieve even lower outage probability. Moreover, by allowing intra-link errors, the optimal position of the relay is found to be exactly the midpoint between the source and destination. Results of the simulations are provided to verify the accuracy of the analytical results...|$|E

It also looked at whether associations between music motives and health-related outcomes remained significant when drinking motives were included among drinkers. Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation models were estimated based on data from 4, 481 adolescents from Switzerland (mean age 14. 5, SD = 0. 9). Results: It was confirmed that the four music motives and the four drinking motives obtained by crossing the valence (positive–negative) and the source (internal–external) of expected change in affect form distinct dimensions (i. e. the 8 -factor model best fitted the data). Drinkers and non-drinkers differed in the various links between music motives and health-related outcomes. For example, almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> <b>between</b> conformity music motives and the health-related outcomes were significant for non-drinkers but not for drinkers. Enhancement music motives, by contrast, were often significant for drinkers but not for non-drinkers. Coping music motives were significant among both drinkers and non-drinkers. These links were basically unchanged when drinking motives were taken into account. Discussion and conclusions: This study indicates that music serves important functions in the lives of adolescents, even among those who use alcohol for different motives.

Diagonalization implies that at each fixed time instant the equation at each joint is decoupled {{from all of}} the other joint equations. The equation involves two important variables: avector of total joint rotational rates and a corresponding vector of working joint moments. The nonlinear Coriolis term C (;) depends on the joint angles and the rates. The total joint rates are related to the relative joint-angle rates _ by a linear spatial operator m () mechanized byabase-to-tip spatially recursive algorithm. The total rate (k) at a given joint k re ects, in a very unique sense the total rotational velocity about the joint, and includes the combined effects from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> <b>between</b> joint k and the manipulator base. This di ers from the more traditional joint-angle rates _ which only reflect the relative, as opposed to total, rotation about the joints. Similarly, the working moments = `T are related to the applied moments T by the spatial operator ` () = m, 1 () mechanized by a tip-to-base spatially recursive algorithm. The working moment (k) at a given joint k is that part of the applied moment T (k) which does actual mechanical work, while its other part affects only the non-working internal constraint forces. The diagonal equations are obtained by using the recently developed [1] mass matrix factorization M () =m () m () of the system Lagrangian. The diagonalization is achieved in velocity space. This means that only the velocity variables _ are replaced with the new variables, while the original configuration variables are retained. The new joint velocity variables can be viewed as time-derivatives of Lagrangian quasi-coordinates, similar to those of classical mechanics. The velocity transformations are shown to always exist for tree-like, articulated multibody systems, and they can be readily implemented using the spatially recursive ltering and smoothing methods [1, 4, 7] advanced by the authors in recent years...|$|E
