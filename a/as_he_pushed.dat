5|$|Five {{minutes into}} the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> past Sounders FC defender Leonardo González to receive a {{diagonal}} pass from Clyde Simms. However, due to the difficult shooting angle, Pontius' shot was wide of the far post. In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. goalkeeper Josh Wicks parried the shot away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a direct free kick from , but his low kick curled just wide of the target.

25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting the Navy Cross to First Lieutenant Kurt Chew-Een Lee (MCSN: 0-48880), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism {{in connection with}} military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding Officer of a Machine-Gun Platoon of Company B, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea, on 2 and 3 November 1950. Immediately taking countermeasures when a numerically superior enemy force fiercely attacked his platoon and overran its left flank during the defense of strategic terrain commanding approaches to the main supply route south of Sudong, first Lieutenant Lee boldly exposed himself to intense hostile automatic weapons, grenade and sniper small-arms fire {{to carry out a}} personal reconnaissance, well in advance of his own lines, in order to re-deploy the machine-gun posts within the defensive perimeter. Momentarily forced back by extremely heavy opposition, he quickly reorganized his unit and, instructing his men to cover his approach, bravely moved up an enemy held slope in a deliberate attempt to draw fire and thereby disclose hostile troop positions. Despite serious wounds sustained <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> forward, First Lieutenant Lee charged directly into the face of the enemy fire and, by his dauntless fighting spirit and resourcefulness, served to inspire other members of his platoon to heroic efforts in pressing a determined counterattack and driving the hostile forces from the sector. His outstanding courage, brilliant leadership and unswerving devotion to duty were contributing factors in the success achieved by his company and reflect the highest credit upon First Lieutenant Lee and the United States Naval Service.|$|E

David Weigel of Slate called Johnson the second-biggest winner of the conference, writing that his [...] "third-place showing in the straw poll gave Johnson his first real media hook… He met tons of reporters, commanded a small scrum after the vote, and is a slightly lighter shade of dark horse now." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{scientific}} world, {{several of his}} descriptive passages generated excitement and curiosity. [...] In early 1914, he had been surveying {{a portion of the}} international boundary in the Upper Waria River between the German and British protectorates. [...] By late September, he had passed into a different portion of the highlands, where the clay-slate mountains changed into limestone highlands. [...] In this geologic transition, he said, he also found a change in the ethnographic character of the population, whom he described as a [...] "new" [...] people. [...] They were stocky, powerfully built, and long–limbed; they wore their hair in knots on the centre of their heads, which were otherwise shaven, and painted yellow and black lines across their chests. They also wore grass skirts, so he called them the skirted ones. They used bows and arrows, slings and stone axes. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> west to Mount Joseph, Detzner claimed, he had found the southern hills of the central watershed cut by numerous rivers flowing north to south. He had surmised that there were no insurmountable obstacles between him and the Sepik river. In 1917, he had travelled through the Ramu valley into the Bismarck range, northwest of the Kratke Mountains, and had continued on that route for [...] He also described the presence of an indigenous variation of German, called Unserdeutsch (our German), in several New Guinean dialects.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of the Doctor, his regenerations are usually a result of a {{previous}} incarnation sustaining mortal injury, though he can regenerate from old age and was once forced to regenerate by the Time Lords. A common side effect the Doctor frequently experiences is a period of instability and partial amnesia following regeneration. Some post-regeneration experiences have been more difficult than others. In particular, the Fifth Doctor began reverting to his previous personalities and required the healing powers of the TARDIS's [...] "Zero Room" [...] to recuperate (Castrovalva). The Sixth Doctor experienced extreme paranoia and flew into a murderous rage, nearly killing his companion (The Twin Dilemma). The Eighth Doctor experienced amnesia due to the anaesthetics affecting his physiology (1996 Doctor Who television film). While his regeneration first appeared to be smooth ("The Parting of the Ways"), the Tenth Doctor began to experience spasms and became somewhat manic, frightening his companion <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> the TARDIS to dangerous extremes (...) [...] After crash-landing the TARDIS, the Doctor collapsed and remained unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours ("The Christmas Invasion"). The experience was traumatic enough to cause one of his hearts to temporarily stop beating.|$|E
