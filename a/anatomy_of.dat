5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that}} the Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations were said to be easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
5|$|Among {{many other}} things, he gave {{accurate}} {{descriptions of the}} four-chambered stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the dogfish. His accounts of about 35 animals are sufficiently detailed to convince biologists that he dissected those species, indeed vivisecting some; he mentions the internal <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> roughly 110 animals in total.|$|E

5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism and specifically {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Criticism. According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but {{are part of an}} underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning. In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E
5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, the <b>anatomy</b> {{features}} <b>of</b> 25–30mm miniatures {{can vary}} notably from manufacturer to manufacturer {{and even from}} sculptor to sculptor: some of them rely on heavily emphasized features (to the point of distortion) closely resembling the exaggerated <b>anatomies</b> <b>of</b> comic-book characters, and are aptly called [...] "heroic"-style figures; other, more consistent with actual human physiques, are termed [...] "realistic" [...] figures.|$|R
50|$|In 1886, {{he became}} a {{professor}} <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> and head <b>of</b> the anatomical institute at the University of Dorpat. He worked as a professor in Tartu (Dorpat) for 25 years and also started the <b>anatomy</b> collection <b>of</b> the University of Tartu.|$|R
5|$|Carl Arend Friedrich Wiegmann (1893, 1898) {{discussed}} {{portions of}} the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> A. adamsii, A. porcellanus, A. contrarius, and A. sinistralis. Walter Edward Collinge (1901, 1902) briefly noted features of A. palaceus and A. parakensis (reported as A. perversus). Haniel (1921) dissected A. contrarius and A. reflexilabris, and Bernhard Rensch published a few scattered notes in his various faunistic surveys. A few earlier notes are mentioned in Pilsbry (1900).|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo also closely {{observed}} and recorded {{the effects of}} age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. Leonardo also studied and drew the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also {{made a number of}} studies of horses.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo {{started his}} {{study in the}} <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the human body under the {{apprenticeship}} of Andrea del Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject.

5|$|Naturalist {{and popular}} artist John Gould {{illustrated}} {{and described the}} koala in his three-volume work The Mammals of Australia (1845–63) and introduced the species, {{as well as other}} members of Australia's little-known faunal community, to the general British public. Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Australian mammals, presented a paper on the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the koala to the Zoological Society of London. In this widely cited publication, he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat. English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives Diprotodon and Nototherium, which had been discovered just a few years before. Similarly, Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney, noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 The Mammals of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon {{species are}} {{extremely}} well {{represented in the}} fossil record, allowing for detailed descriptions of their anatomy and analysis of their life history. Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the animal. Still, this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur, and it includes {{both male and female}} specimens of various age groups and, possibly, species.|$|E
