5|$|Greece, Australia, France, and United Kingdom are {{the only}} {{countries}} to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896.

The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games, because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Further student protests, {{including}} {{hunger strike}} and more barricades of Hamilton Hall and the Business School {{during the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the apartheid regime in South Africa. A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following <b>a</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa. The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U.S. university.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and Temple Israel, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, {{attempted}} an amalgamation. This was {{the third}} such attempt; the previous two had failed when the members could not agree on synagogue ritual. The combined congregation, which would purchase new premises, would have 150 members; members would be refunded half the purchase price of the pews in their existing buildings. Mosche and the rabbi of Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi. Though this attempt also failed, {{in the following year}} the three congregations carried out combined activities, including a picnic and <b>a</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 100th birthday of Moses Montefiore. Membership at that time still hovered around 50.|$|E
5|$|Major Shakta temple festivals are Meenakshi Kalyanam and Ambubachi Mela. The Meenakshi Kalyanam {{is a part}} of the Chithirai Thiruvizha {{festival in}} Madurai around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of goddess Meenakshi (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva {{communities}} join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Meenakshi in marriage to Shiva. Ambubachi Mela or Ameti is <b>a</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> menstruation of the goddess, by hundreds of thousands of devotees, in a festival held in June/July (during the monsoon season) at Kamakhya Temple, Guwahati, Assam. Here the Devi is worshiped in the form of a yoni-like stone, and the site is one of Shakta Pitha or pilgrimage sites in Shaktism.|$|E

5|$|Olympic {{sports are}} governed by {{international}} sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC. There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, {{but they can be}} promoted to this status during a programme revision that occurs in the first IOC session following <b>a</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Games. During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme {{on the basis of a}} two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC. There are recognised sports that have never been on an Olympic programme in any capacity, including chess and surfing.|$|E
5|$|Three Olympiads had to {{pass without}} <b>a</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Games because of war: the 1916 Games were {{cancelled}} because of World War I, and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The Russo-Georgian War between Georgia and Russia erupted on {{the opening day of}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both President Bush and Prime Minister Putin were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese president Hu Jintao. When Nino Salukvadze of Georgia won the bronze medal in the 10metre air pistol competition, she stood on the medal podium with Natalia Paderina, a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicised event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.|$|E
