German explorer Heinrich Barth, in his works of 1857, cites firearms and European intrusion <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the decrease in its numbers. It was extinct in Tunisia by the late 19th century. The last individual was shot in Missour (Algeria) in 1925.|$|E
5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them {{with the impression that}} he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Defense of the Ancients increased over time. The scenario was featured by Computer Gaming World {{in a review}} of new maps and mods in Warcraft III. DotA Allstars became an important tournament scenario, starting with its prominence at the debut of Blizzard's BlizzCon convention in 2005. DotA Allstars was also featured in the Malaysia and Singapore World Cyber Games starting in 2005, and the World Cyber Games Asian Championships beginning with the 2006 season. Defense of the Ancients was included in the game lineup for the internationally recognized Cyberathlete Amateur League and CyberEvolution leagues. Additionally, the scenario appeared in Electronic Sports World Cup (ESWC) 2008; Oliver Paradis, ESWC's competition manager, noted that the high level of community support behind the scenario, as well as its worldwide appeal, were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> it was chosen.|$|E

In 1811, Raffles - who was employed by the British East India company as Secretary to the Governor of Malacca - decided {{to take over the}} government in Batavia. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is to prevent the French from stepping in completely, as Napoleon had nominated Daendels who closely worked with the French.|$|R
5|$|When Odilo Globocnik made a {{surprise}} visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Bełżec, Josef Oberhauser, Eberl was dismissed on the spot. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for dismissal were: incompetently disposing of {{the tens of}} thousands of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of killing, and not properly concealing the mass killing. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler's Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped up the pace of the programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had previously been the commandant of the Sobibór extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.|$|E
5|$|Although born in Canada, Stastny is a dual {{citizen of}} Canada and the United States. Both {{he and his}} brother Yan have chosen to play internationally for the United States. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> that led him to choose to play for the United States was the {{possibility}} to play in an international competition with his brother, who had chosen to play for the United States before Paul. Paul represented the U.S. {{for the first time in}} the 2004 Viking Cup, where he won a silver medal playing for the junior team. According to Hockey's Future, he was one of the most important American talents in the tournament. Stastny played internationally for the United States national ice hockey team for the first time in the 2007 IIHF World Championship. He played seven games, scored four goals and four assists, had two penalty minutes and finished even in plus/minus. The United States lost in the quarterfinals against Finland. Stastny was named the best American player in the 3–0 win against Germany, when he scored two goals and had one assist. He was chosen as one of the three best United States players at the tournament, together with Lee Stempniak and Toby Petersen.|$|E

More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools, also replacing them with smaller schools.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} public {{criticism}} of FAO {{for at least}} 30 years. Dissatisfaction with the organisation's performance was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> {{for the creation of}} two new organisations after the World Food Conference in 1974, namely the World Food Council and the International Fund for Agricultural Development; by the early eighties there was intense rivalry among these organisations. At the same time, the World Food Programme, which started as an experimental 3-year programme under FAO, was growing in size and independence, with the Directors of FAO and WFP struggling for power.|$|E
50|$|Some {{people are}} deeply religious, atheists and some {{dramatic}} men visit the temples only during difficult times.

The number includes 35,859 rebel combatants but does not include members of the government security forces or pro-government foreign combatants who have died. Early in the conflict, the Syrian Martyrs number of civilian deaths was significantly higher than the ones presented by other organisations, including the UN; <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> are that they recorded deaths even when no name is given for the reportedly killed individual and that they collated reports of deaths from more sources.|$|E
25|$|<b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> {{cited for}} banning capital {{punishment}} in Canada were fears about wrongful convictions, {{concerns about the}} state taking people's lives, and uncertainty about the death penalty's role as a deterrent for crime. The 1959 conviction of 14-year-old Steven Truscott was a significant impetus (although certainly not the only one) toward the abolition of capital punishment. Truscott {{was sentenced to death}} for the murder of a classmate. His sentence was later commuted to a life sentence and in 2007 he was acquitted of the charges (although the appeal court did not state that he was in fact innocent).|$|E
25|$|Although Maynard was {{originally}} {{one of the}} city's largest landholders and strongest boosters, he is considered not to have prospered {{as well as his}} contemporaries. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> given for this are that his friendly relations with Chief Seattle and other natives made him suspect to his fellow settlers. The surviving city fathers minimized his role in their reminiscences in response to Maynard's autocratic rule of early Seattle. At any rate, he died in a mansion furnished with every comfort. It {{is important to note that}} Maynard's stated purpose was not to get rich but rather to build the greatest city in the world.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, {{a county}} civic group {{advocated}} {{for the election}} of a county executive. The group's report said that the new position would give citizens another place to go if their concerns were refused by the Montgomery County Council. The group said that the fact that the county had four appointed county managers in thirteen years demonstrates that establishing the position in 1948 had not been a stunning success. The group also advocated for nonpartisan elections for council members. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the suggested changes in governance {{is the fact that the}} county's population had more than doubled since the governmental system had been established in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{environmental}} concern {{relates to the}} population of areas affected by hydroelectric development, specifically the Innu of the North Shore and the Cree and Inuit in Northern Quebec. The hydroelectric developments of {{the last quarter of}} the 20th century have accelerated the settling process among Aboriginal populations that started in the 1950s. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of Aboriginal businesses, the introduction of paid labor, and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs, along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} however, movable type {{printing}} remained mainly the business of Europeans working from {{within the confines of}} their colonies. According to Suraiya Faroqhi, lack of interest and religious reasons were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the slow adoption of the printing press outside Europe: Thus, the printing of Arabic, after encountering strong opposition by Muslim legal scholars and the manuscript scribes, remained prohibited in the Ottoman empire between 1483 and 1729, initially even on penalty of death, while some movable Arabic type printing was done by Pope Julius II (1503−1512) for distribution among Middle Eastern Christians, and the oldest Qur’an printed with movable type was produced in Venice in 1537/1538 for the Ottoman market.|$|E
