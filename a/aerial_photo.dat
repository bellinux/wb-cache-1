25|$|When the ice melted, {{the upper}} Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River, which {{followed}} the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north-facing cliff, or cuesta. Because {{of the interactions}} of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and Lockport dolostone. That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. The <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall.|$|E
25|$|Loathing was {{specifically}} {{built around the}} Myth engine and allowed the team to modify the 3D landscape, apply lighting, determine terrain type, script the AI, and position structures, scenery, and enemies. The artists used PowerAnimator on an SGI Indigo 2 to create polygonal models and render all the characters. The 3D models were imported into the game using Fear, while the 2D sprites were cleaned up in Adobe Photoshop and imported and animated using Extractor. To create the texture maps for the terrain, the artists used Photoshop to draw the equivalent of an <b>aerial</b> <b>photo,</b> and then applied it to the 3D landscape using Loathing. Initially, the developers had planned on using fractal-generated landscapes, but they felt the randomness of such landscapes would {{make it difficult to}} design interesting levels, and so all maps were instead constructed by hand.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) images {{and black and}} white <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> of similar scale and illumination of an area in the Mojave Desert of California shows that <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> yield far more information about geology than do SLAR images because of greater resolution, tonal range, and geometric fidelity, and easier use in stereo. Nevertheless, radar can differentiate some materials or surfaces that <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> cannot; thus, they {{should be considered as}} complementary, rather than competing tools in geologic investigations. The most significant advantage of SLAR, however, is its freedom from the stringent conditions of weather, date, and time that are required by small-scale <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> taken with a specified direction and angle of illumination. Indeed, in low latitudes, SLAR {{is the only way to}} obtain small-scale images with low illumination from certain directions; moreover, in areas of nearly continuous cloudiness, radar may be the only practical source of small-scale images...|$|R

2500|$|Beaver ponds {{increase}} stream {{flows in}} seasonally dry streams by storing run-off in the rainy season, which raises groundwater tables via percolation from beaver ponds. In {{a recent study}} using 12 serial <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> mosaics from 1948 to 2002, {{the impact of the}} return of beavers on openwater area in east-central Alberta, Canada, found that the mammals were associated with a 9-fold increase in openwater area. Beavers returned to the area in 1954 after a long absence since their extirpation by the fur trade in the 19th century. During drought years, where beavers were present, [...] 60% more open water was available than those same areas during previous drought periods when beavers were absent. The authors concluded that beavers have a dramatic influence on the creation and maintenance of wetlands even during extreme drought.|$|E

Durupınar informed the Turkish government of his discovery and a group from the Archeological Research Foundation which included George Vandeman, İlhan Durupınar, and Arthur Brandenberger, professor of photogrammetry, surveyed the site in September 1960.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> as a substitute for multiple-year pre-removal field data to assess the downstream channel changes associated with a small dam removal. The Brownsville Dam, a 2. 1 m tall concrete dam on the Calapooia River, Oregon, was removed in 2007. We surveyed cross sections below the dam during the summers prior to (2007) and follow (2008) removal, and we analyzed <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> from 1994 to 2006. The field surveys and <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> were used to map the low flow channel and bars over 1. 3 km downstream from the dam and in an upstream control reach. Three types of measurement error (position error, identification error, and wetted boundary datum error) were assessed for the field surveys and <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> in order make the two methods of measurement more comparable. The first year after the dam removal, we observed changes in bar width, wetted width, and wetted width midpoint as large as 17 m ± 3 m immediately below the dam. We inferred that channel changes below the dam after removal were a result of the removal through comparison with pre-dam removal <b>aerial</b> <b>photos,</b> where changes up to 67 m ± 24 m were predominantly far from the dam, and an upstream control, where changes were only as large as 9 m ± 5 m. We conclude with suggestions of best practices for reducing errors, including establishment of permanent monuments for field surveys, taking measurements at similar, well-known discharges, and generating the highest-quality digital <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> through source and scanning choices...|$|R
