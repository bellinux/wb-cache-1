40|$|Immersed {{flame arresters}} {{are used in}} the {{chemical}} industry for gas explosion protection. The explosive gas passes a water layer thus establishing <b>arc-through</b> safety up to a certain gas flow velocity. This flow velocity limit value can be considerably increased by use of an air lift loop-type bubble column with suspended solid particles in the water layer. By the suspension the distance between the individual gas bubbles is increased. Considering the gas bubble distance, a simple connection between the safety engineering characteristics laminar frame propagation velocity and normal split width at one hand and the limit gas velocity at the other hand has been foundSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: ZN 737 (291) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
