(Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World.

30|$|This {{shows that}} half of the {{subjects}} had <b>accuracies</b> below 75 %. Since well-functioning online BCI requires relatively high <b>accuracies,</b> the subjects with <b>accuracies</b> above 75 % have been considered (six subjects: 2, 4, 7, 9, 10 and 12) for online measurements.|$|R

25|$|MIPS IV added {{several new}} FP {{arithmetic}} instructions for both single- and double-precision FPNs: fused-multiply add or subtract, reciprocal, and reciprocal square-root. The FP fused-multiply add or subtract instructions perform either {{one or two}} roundings (it is implementation-defined), to exceed or meet IEEE 754 <b>accuracy</b> requirements (respectively). The FP reciprocal and reciprocal square-root instructions do not comply with IEEE 754 <b>accuracy</b> requirements, and produce results that differ from the required <b>accuracy</b> by one or two units of last place (it is implementation defined). These instructions serve applications where instruction latency {{is more important than}} <b>accuracy.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Accuracy</b> figures {{need to be}} {{interpreted}} with care. The <b>accuracy</b> of an analog instrument usually refers to full-scale deflection; a measurement of 30V on the 100V scale of a 3% meter is subject to an error of 3V, 10% of the reading. Digital meters usually specify <b>accuracy</b> {{as a percentage of}} reading plus a percentage of full-scale value, sometimes expressed in counts rather than percentage terms.|$|E
30|$|Figure 5 {{shows that}} the {{obtained}} classification <b>accuracies</b> differ greatly for the different interpolation methods (Additional file 1). This indicates that the characteristic properties of the textures are retained to a widely varying degree under rotation.

Nearest neighbour, linear and cubic interpolation all show lower <b>accuracies</b> for all descriptors compared.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method has}} been evaluated by a CORS network under quiet and active troposphere conditions on DOY 2013 127 and 185, respectively. First, the real-time orbit and clock corrections are assessed against the IGS final products. The {{results show that}} the current IGS CLK 90 real-time stream can provide < 5  cm orbit and approximately 0.5  ns clock <b>accuracies</b> on both days. Second, using the proposed method the optimal local troposphere model has been determined with the overall precision of 1.42  cm on DOY 127 and 1.05  cm on DOY 185. Third, the determined local troposphere model is applied to augment real-time PPP at the user end. The results indicate that real-time PPP with local troposphere augmentation can provide 9.2 -cm horizontal and 10.1 -cm vertical positioning <b>accuracies</b> after 20  min of initialization time under the quiet troposphere condition, which is a significant improvement over the 13.2 -cm horizontal and 18.3 -cm vertical <b>accuracies</b> of real-time PPP with troposphere estimation. Moreover, the horizontal <b>accuracies</b> of 13.0  cm and the vertical <b>accuracies</b> of 12.4  cm have been obtained after 20 -min initialization time under the active troposphere condition, compared to the 16.0 -cm horizontal and 23.4 -cm vertical <b>accuracies</b> in the conventional troposphere estimation approach.|$|R

Overall classification <b>accuracies</b> exceeded 90 %, with similar individual class <b>accuracies.</b> <b>Accuracies</b> on a localized basis varied based on elevation. <b>Accuracies</b> also varied among administrative units, although {{we were not able to}} determine whether these differences related to inherent spatial variations or differences in the quality of available reference data...|$|R
