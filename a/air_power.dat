40|$|Road {{transportation}} using air as a fuel {{has attracted}} much attention over the past decade. The fuel (air) can be in two forms, compressed gas form and cryogenic liquid form and engines based on both forms of air have been investigated. Prototypes of <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> road vehicles are expected to emerge {{over the next few}} years. However, there have been debates over {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the two technologies. This paper aims to compare the two technologies from the technological point of view. Engines for a typical small scale passenger car are used for the analyses and the comparison is based on the shaft work, coolth, efficiency and energy density. It is shown that the shaft work outputs and the coolth available to engines powered by both fuels increase with increasing working pressure and temperature. Given the working pressure and temperature, liquid <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engines have a slightly lower specific work outputs than compressed <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engines. The volumetric energy density of liquid air, however, is much higher than that of compressed air, and liquid air has much higher coolth than compressed air. On the other hand, the efficiency of the compressed <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engines is higher than that of liquid <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engines mainly because of the higher energy consumption of liquefaction plants. The analyses also suggest that an effective use of coolth be a key to improve the overall efficiency of liquid <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{development}} of compressed <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engine {{system based on}} Subaru EA 71 model. The objective of this thesis {{is to make a}} reverse engineering and design of the engine model, and make the computational analysis of the compressed <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engine working model by using GT-Power. The thesis describes the compressed air technology that addresses the problems of exhaust gas pollution from vehicles, as well as utilization of fossil fuel. The development of the compressed <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engine model starts with dismantling the original engine, cleaning the engine with petrol, and drawing all the components into Solidworks. Then develop the engine into two working stages that working with gasoline for four cylinders in the first stage and working with compressed air for two cylinders in the second stage. In this thesis, the research focuses on the second stage. Some components such as cylinder heads and cam profile are modified based on the new design. After this, a simulation by GT-Power is run, and computational analysis the performance of new compressed <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engine. The results indicated the engine performance predictions and key cylinder predictions. The project achieves the objective of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. However the new model lacks the power output so that continuous research is needed to fully prove the viability of the technology of the compressed <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> engin...|$|R

50|$|A liquid <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> car called Liquid Air {{was built}} between 1899 and 1902 but it couldn't {{at the time}} compete in terms of {{efficiency}} with other engines. More recently, a liquid nitrogen vehicle was built. Peter Dearman, a garage inventor in Hertfordshire, UK who had initially developed a liquid <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> car, then put the technology to use as grid energy storage. The Dearman engine differs from former nitrogen engine designs in that the nitrogen is heated by combining it with the heat exchange fluid inside the cylinder of the engine.|$|R
