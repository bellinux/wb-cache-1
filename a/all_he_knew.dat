25|$|In 1937, Ture Nerman and {{his friend}} August Spångberg, {{traveled}} to Spain where General Francisco Franco's National faction had taken power and a civil war was ravaging the country. They went through Nazi Germany and managed to get to Barcelona. The civil war was a chaos. At times the Stalinists were fighting the Trotskyists, {{and at other times}} the Anarchists were fighting everyone, and the Nationalists benefited from the turmoil within the left. Ture Nerman decided he could not side with any of the groups, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> was that he was an anti-fascist.|$|E
25|$|Xiang’s extravagant life {{lasted only}} a short time. With the arrest and {{defection}} in 1931 of one of Zhou’s senior subordinates, Gu Shunzhang (Chinese: 顾顺章), who was the security guard boss of the CCP at that time, Gu sold Xiang out. Xiang was arrested on June 21, 1931 in the jewelry store he used as a front in the French Concession {{in the city of}} Shanghai. Xiang was captured in the company of his mistress, Yang Xiuzhen, a cabaret dancer at local Shanghai nightclubs. In short order, Xiang revealed <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> to his KMT captors. However, the KMT knew Xiang was useless to them as a puppet, and as a result Chiang Kai-shek ordered his execution.|$|E
25|$|In Chicago, McManigal and McNamara {{were not}} {{taken to a}} police station, but to the private home of Chicago Police Sergeant William Reed and held from April 13 until April 20. Burns {{apparently}} convinced McManigal that he knew everything and that McManigal could save himself by cutting a deal with authorities. McManigal agreed to tell <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{in order to secure}} a lighter prison sentence, and signed a confession. He said that he had not participated in the Times bombing, but that Jim McNamara had told him all about it, and that it was done by Jim (J. B.) McNamara and two others, Matthew Schmidt and David Caplan (Schmidt and Caplan evaded arrest until 1915). McManigal also said that others involved included union president Ryan, J. J. McNamara, Hockin and other Iron Worker leaders.|$|E

2500|$|Up to {{this point}} the {{fighting}} for Huế had been entirely a South Vietnamese affair. Brigadier General LaHue, the Task Force X-Ray commander, actually had very little reliable intelligence on the situation. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> was that Truong's headquarters had been under attack, as was the MACV Compound. Because of enemy mortaring of the LCU ramp in southern Huế, the allies had stopped all river traffic to the city.

2500|$|Israel, as Brody put it, {{had opened}} his eyes. [...] He had never {{previously}} traveled anywhere outside the U.S. [...] Before {{he arrived in}} Israel, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about {{it was what he}} had studied in Hebrew school. [...] To his surprise, rather than arriving in Biblical Israel (with people riding camels and living in tents), he found himself in a modern society in which {{for the first time he}} met Jews from around the globe. [...] The experience was a culture shock, and he was attracted to the culture and the everyday life. [...] It changed the NBA-bound basketball player's goals in life. Eventually, because he was Jewish he agreed to take up the challenge and stay. His decision completely changed Israeli basketball.|$|E
2500|$|On March 12, the Board of Trustees {{released}} what {{it described}} as its final {{statement on the}} ouster of Spanier and Paterno.

[...] It also said that Paterno demonstrated a [...] "failure of leadership" [...] by {{not going to the}} police. [...] The board said it had every intention of sending someone to personally inform Paterno of the decision, but was unable to do so because {{of a large number of}} people surrounding his house. [...] Rather than risk having Paterno learn about the decision via the media, the board decided to order him to leave immediately via telephone.|$|E

[...] Before a man could join the community he underwent a public inquisition to determine his suitability.

2500|$|While Branscomb and Robinson were exploring, the New England Emigrant Aid Company {{was busy}} {{assembling}} a [...] "pioneer party" [...] of twenty-nine men to found their city. On July 17, 1854, this group departed Boston; according to Cordley, [...] "Immense crowds had {{gathered at the}} station {{to give them a}} parting God-speed. They moved out of the station amid the cheering of the crowds who lined the track for several blocks." [...] In late July, the group met Robinson in St. Louis, who told them <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> and provided them with transportation. The group arrived in the future location of Lawrence on August 1 of that year, and they ate their first meal on Hogback Ridge itself. Soon, another Bostonian party was organized consisting of sixty-seven settlers. These individuals left Boston on August 31, reaching their destination a little over a week later, on September 9. After a few months of work, the settlement was beginning to take shape, and by October of 1854, the settlers began debating as to what their community should be named. When the settlers first arrived, most had referred to it simply as [...] "Wakarusa", but other names like [...] "Yankee Town", [...] "New Boston", and [...] "Plymouth" [...] were also considered. Eventually, it was agreed to call the town [...] "Lawrence City" [...] in honor or Amos Adams Lawrence, an abolitionist who, according to Cordley, was [...] "one of the first men of means" [...] to fund the Emigrant Aid Company. [...] "Lawrence" [...] was also chosen as a name because it [...] "sounded well and had no bad odor attached to it in any part of the Union." [...] The main street of the town was named [...] "Massachusetts" [...] to commemorate the origins of the pioneer party. Around this time, Hogback Ridge was also officially dubbed [...] "Mount Oread" [...] (after the Oread Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts) by the architect Ferdinand Fuller.|$|E
