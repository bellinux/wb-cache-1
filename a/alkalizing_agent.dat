5000|$|Sometimes, {{conductivity}} {{measurements are}} linked with other methods {{to increase the}} sensitivity of detection of specific types of ions. For example, in the boiler water technology, the boiler blowdown is continuously monitored for [...] "cation conductivity", which is the conductivity of the water {{after it has been}} passed through a cation exchange resin. This is a sensitive method of monitoring anion impurities in the boiler water in the presence of excess cations (those of the <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> usually used for water treatment). The sensitivity of this method relies on the high mobility of H+ in comparison with the mobility of other cations or anions. Beyond cation conductivity, there are analytical instruments designed to measure Degas conductivity, where conductivity is measured after dissolved carbon dioxide has been removed from the sample, either through reboiling or dynamic degassing.|$|E

FTD-GRN patients are still orphan for any evidence-based target-therapy approach. Interestingly, it has been recently found that <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agents</b> rescued haploinsufficiency in cellular models expressing FTD-GRN mutations. We set up a pilot phase II clinical trial in five FTD patients with GRN Thr 272 s(g. 1977 _ 1980 delCACT) mutation, to determine if amiodarone (200 mg/day) may (1) reverse progranulin deficiency and (2) delay disease progression. Each patient was scheduled for 7 study visits over 12 months period. We assessed GRN levels at baseline and after amiodarone administration during the treatment course. Somatic and neurologic examinations, along with cognitive and behavioral assessment were recorded as well. No significant effect on peripheral GRN levels was observed. In treated FTD, disease course did not differ when compared with a group of untreated FTD-GRN patients. This is the first trial targeting progranulin rescue in FTD-GRN patients using amiodarone.

50|$|Swedish snus is {{made from}} {{air-dried}} tobacco from {{various parts of the}} world. In earlier times, tobacco for making snus was laid out for drying in Scania and Mälardalen, Sweden. Later, Kentucky tobaccos were used. The ground tobacco is mixed with water, salt, an <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> (today this is sodium carbonate), and aroma, and is prepared through heating. After the heating process, food grade aromas are typically added. In Sweden, snus is regulated as a food product and, for this reason, all ingredients are listed on the label of each individual package (can) of snus. Moist snus contains more than 50% water, and the average use of snus in Sweden is approximately 800 grams (16 units) per person each year. About 12% (1.1 million people) of the population in Sweden use snus. Unlike dipping tobacco and chew, most snus today does not undergo the fermentation process, but is instead steam-pasteurized. Although steam-pasteurization is remarkably complex, it has the advantages of inhibiting the growth of bacteria that facilitate the formation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines, while preserving the desired texture and mouthfeel of the snus. The absorption of nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, from snus depends on the level of nicotine in the snus and the PH level in the box. A voluntary quality standard for snus products has been introduced (Gothiatek) that sets maximum levels for certain controversial constituents including nitrosamines, heavy metals, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Most manufacturers of Scandinavian type snus adhere to this standard.|$|E

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction <b>Alkalizing</b> <b>agents</b> have been used in high performance sports as a strategy to postpone the onset of fatigue during high intensity exercise by slowing the decline in muscle and blood pH [1, 2]. Studies have confirmed that in-creasing the extracellular pH, via an alkalizer, promotes the efflux of lactate and H+ from the active muscles [1, 3 - 5]. Therefore, artificially inducing alkalosis prior to anaerobic exercise may reduce intracellular acidosis and increase the time to fatigue [6, 7] The process known as “bicarbonate loading”, in which sodium bicarbonate is ingested pre-performance, is a popular method of blood alkalization among athletes [6, 8]. According to a recent meta-analysis by Carr et al.

The convalescence of the ureteroileosigmoidostomy was uneventful and postoperative urograms revealed no evidence of urinary stasis. Contrast medium enema showed ureteral reflux to the left upper urinary tract. Three weeks after the operation, however, she had a severe anorexia with deteriorated acid-base balance, but the administration of <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agents</b> was effective and was continued.

After the detailed case report, several advantages of ureteroileosigmoidostomy were discussed under following stand points. 1. Ureteroileal anastomosis seems to be more satisfactory compared with ureterosigmoidal anastomosis if a nonobstructive anastomosis is more desirable than an anastomosis without ureteral reflux. 2. The interposed ileum segment can be expected to act as a functional valve against pressure gradient between ureter and sigmoid colon. 3.

40|$|NaP 1, SOD, and ANA zeolites were {{synthesized}} from {{a hazardous}} aluminum waste as main aluminosilicate source by a one-step hydrothermal synthesis. This allowed the total {{transformation of the}} waste and no other solid residues were produced. The conversion of the waste into zeolites led to yields of ∼ 2. 5 kg of zeolite per kg of waste. Experimental parameters such as stirring, time, temperature, and concentration of <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> (NaOH solution) were studied {{to determine the best}} synthesis conditions. Samples were characterized by different techniques such as XRD, SEM-EDS, FTIR, TG-DTA; textural properties such as BET specific surface area, zeta potential, granulometry and cation-exchange capacity (CEC) were also determined. Temperature and alkali concentration were the parameters with strongest influence {{in the formation of the}} different zeolites. Thus, the optimal conditions to obtain NaP 1 and ANA were 1 M NaOH solution for 6 h at 120 and 200 °C, respectively, while SOD was prepared at 120 °C for 6 h, using a very much higher alkali concentration (5 M). These zeolites exhibited similar characteristics to those obtained from conventional chemical reagents. Besides, the mother liquor from the synthesis of NaP 1 was recycled twice in order to reduce water and <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> consumption. In this case, the only crystalline phase obtained was NaP 1 showing morphological, textural and crystalline characteristics very similar to those of NaP 1 prepared from fresh solutions.

There are a growing number of patients with orthotopic neobladders and a wider range of clinicians are encountering these patients. A delay in the diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity but if identified early it can be easily treated. Presentation of caseA 59 -year old patient with a recent neobladder augmentation cystoplasty was admitted under the medical team with a metabolic acidosis which was incorrectly presumed to be secondary to urosepsis. His condition rapidly deteriorated until a surgical review identified hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis secondary to neobladder augmentation. The patient required admission to the intensive care unit where he was treated with intravenous alkalising therapy which produced rapid metabolic improvement. Following a full recovery, he underwent neo-bladder excision and ileal conduit formation. DiscussionHyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis develops due to the bowel segment absorbing urinary constituents including ammonium, hydrogen ions and chloride in exchange for sodium and bicarbonate. It can be diagnosed by careful interpretation of the arterial blood gas and calculation of the anion gap. This hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis can be corrected with <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agents</b> combined with catheterisation. ConclusionHyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a well-established complication of urinary diversion. Patient with orthotopic neobladder with high residual urine and large capacity are at even higher risk of metabolic acidosis.

40|$|A novel {{dissolution}} {{method was}} developed, suitable for powder mixtures, {{based on the}} USP basket apparatus. The baskets were modified such that the powder mixtures were retained within the baskets and not dispersed, a potential difficulty that may arise when using conventional USP basket and paddle apparatus. The advantages of this method were that {{the components of the}} mixtures were maintained in close proximity, maximizing any drug:excipient interaction and leading to more linear dissolution profiles. Two weakly acidic model drugs, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and a selection of pharmaceutical excipients, including potential dissolution-enhancing <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agents,</b> were chosen for investigation. Dissolution profiles were obtained for simple physical mixtures. The f 1 fit factor values, calculated using pure drug as the reference material, demonstrated a trend in line with expectations, with several dissolution enhancers apparent for both drugs. Also, the dissolution rates were linear over substantial parts of the profiles. For both drugs, a rank order comparison between the f 1 fit factor and calculated dissolution rate, obtained from the linear section of the dissolution profile, demonstrated a correlation using a significance level of P = 0. 05. The method was proven to be suitable for discriminating between the effects of excipients on the dissolution of the model drugs. The method design produced dissolution profiles where the dissolution rate was linear for a substantial time, allowing determination of the dissolution rate without mathematical transformation of the data. This method may be suitable as a preliminary excipient-screening tool in the drug formulation development process...|$|R

Only 33 % of Ion-Aid-treated calves recovered; Revibe- and Life-Guard-treated calves had high recovery rates of 92 % and 83 %, respectively. The much higher recovery rates with Life-Guard and Revibe were attributed to the presence of an <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> in these preparations.

Hair dyes are classified, according to color resistance, into temporary, semipermanent, demipermanent and permanent. The first two are based on molecules which are already colored. Temporary dyes act through dye deposition on cuticles, but semipermanent may penetrate a little into the cortex and so the color resists up to six washes. Demipermanent and permanent dyes are based on color precursors, called oxidation dyes, and the final shade is developed by their interactions with an oxidizing agent, but they differ from the <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> used. In oxidation systems, there is an intense diffusion of the molecules into the cortex, what promotes a longer color resistance.

40|$|Irinotecan (CPT- 11, 7 -ethyl- 10 -[4 -(1 -piperidino) - 1 -piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin) has {{exhibited}} clinical activities against {{a broad spectrum}} of carcinomas by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I). However, severe and unpredictable dosing-limiting toxicities (mainly myelosuppression and severe diarrhea) hinder its clinical use. The latter consists of early and late-onset diarrhea, occurring within 24 hr or 3 ̆e or = 24 hr after CPT- 11 administration, respectively. This review highlights novel agents potentially inhibiting CPT- 11 -induced diarrhea, which are designed and tested under guidance of disposition pathways and potential toxicity mechanisms. Early-onset diarrhea is observed immediately after CPT- 11 infusion and probably due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, which can be eliminated by administration of atropine. Late-onset diarrhea appears to be associated with intestinal exposure to SN- 38 (7 -ethyl- 10 -hydroxycamptothecin), the major active metabolite of CPT- 11, which may bind to Topo I and induce apoptosis of intestinal epithelia, leading to the disturbance in the absorptive and secretory functions of mucosa. CPT- 11 and SN- 38 may also stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins (PGs), thus inducing the secretion of Na(+) and Cl(-). Early treatment of severe late-onset diarrhea with oral high-dose loperamide has decreased patient morbidity. Extensive studies have been conducted to identify other potential agents to ameliorate diarrhea in preclinical and clinical models. These include intestinal <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agents,</b> oral antibiotics, enzyme inducers, P-glycoprotein (PgP) inhibitors, cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, or blockers of biliary excretion of SN- 38.

An clinical questionairre {{has been used for}} examination specific urinary diversion items. Results: Early postoperative complications ( 30 days) in 19 patients (28 %). Early complications consisted of urine leakage of moderate degree in 5 (7 %) and ileus requiring surgical revision in 4 (6 %) patients. The late complications included acute pyelonephritis in 12 patients (18 %) and uretero-sigmoidal anastomotic site stenosis in 7 (11 %). Ureterosigmoidal anastomotic site stenosis was detected in 7 patients with 7 renoureteric units (RU). In 4 RU, metal Strecker stent was successfully applied. In 3 RU, permanent nephrostomy catheter was applied. Oral <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agents</b> were applied in 22 patients (33 %) due to metabolic acidosis. Two patients died due to severe acidosis. Continent rate was 96 %. The mean voiding frequency during the day and night was 5. 2 + 1. 8 and 2. 7 + 0. 5, respectively. Global life quality was bad for 3 (8 %), acceptable for 15 (38 %) and good for 22 (54 %) patients. Conclusion: The Mainz Pouch II urinary diversion is simple and safe procedure regarding complications rate, continence and quality of life. It is good alternative to other forms of continent urinary diversion. Patient selection and compliance following by meticulous follow-up are of utmost importance for successful operative outcome...|$|R

In each case, {{the aim was to}} obtain a product with good quality and guaranteed safety. In the sterilized product, it was demonstrated that by including a pitting step during elaboration, a product was obtained with both flavour and texture similar to those of &# 194;&# 171;green ripe olives&# 194;&# 187;, but without the need to apply an excessive number of washes. <b>Alkalizing</b> <b>agents</b> added to the packing solution negatively affected the organoleptic olive properties. In case of the pasteurized product, a pitting step during elaboration was also demonstrated to be effective in improving olive flavour. Fruit texture was not significantly affected by this step. Both herbal extracts and monosodium glutamate added to the packing solution successfully masked the &# 194;&# 171;cooked&# 194;&# 187; flavour of olives associated with pasteurisation.

40|$|We {{describe}} an improved cresolphthalein complexone procedure for calcium in which diethylamine {{is replaced by}} a nontoxic amino alcohol. Advantages of the proce-dure are increased sensitivity, excellent baseline stabili-ty, a more optimum reaction environment (pH 10. 0) that eliminates blanking problems, and freedom from inter-ference by magnesium. Values obtained by this method are not significantly different (P < 0. 05) from those ob-tamed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. AdditIonal Keyphrases: AutoAnelyzer #{ 149 }atomic absorp-tion spectrophotometry compared We wished to develop a simple, stable cresolphthalein complexone reagent system that would have low blank ab-sorbance, little or no baseline drift or noise, and would give accurate, reproducible results for serum calcium. In most continuous-flow calcium procedures, a reagent system is used that {{is similar to that of}} Kessler and Wolfman (1) as modified by Gitelman (2), which contains diethylamine. Use of diethylamine as the <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> has several dis-advantages: (a) It is so basic (pK 8 11. 0) that the cresol-phthalein complexone is colored even in the absence of calcium, thereby producing high blank absorbance and decreased sensitivity; (b) diethylamine is volatile, has a disagreeable odor, and is toxic; and (c) continuous-flow systems in which diethylamine is used generally exhibit baseline noise. The cresolphthalein complexone calcium procedure has been improved by replacing diethylamine with 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol and by changing the pH of the reaction environment from 12 to 10. Calcium values obtained by this method compare well with those obtained by atomic absorption spectrophotometry...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to produce rapidly dissolving formulations of the poorly water-soluble drug repaglinide using an innovative new technology, ultra-rapid freezing (URF), and to investigate the influence of excipient type on repaglinide stability. Repaglinide compositions containing different types and levels of excipients and different drug potencies (50 %– 86 %) were produced by the URF technology. Repaglinide/excipient solutions were frozen on a cryogenic substrate, collected, and lyophilized to form a dry powder. Surfactants, including sodium dodecyl sulfate, and alkalizing agents such as diethanolamine (DEA) and tromethamine (TRIS) were incorporated into the compositions. Forced degradation of repaglinide was conducted under stressed conditions (eg, elevated temperature, exposure to peroxide) to determine the stability of the drug in such environments. The solubility of repaglinide increased as a function of increasing pH; therefore, incorporation of an <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> into the URF formulations increased the drug's solubility. Drug instability resulted when the drug was exposed to pH values above 9. 0. URF formulations containing alkalizing agents showed no degradation or spontaneous recrystallization in the formulation, indicating that increased stability was afforded by processing. URF processing created nanostructured drug/excipient particles with higher dissolution rates than were achieved for unprocessed drug. Alkalizing agents such as TRIS and DEA, present at levels of 25 % to 33 % wt/wt in the formulations, did not cause degradation of the drug when processed using URF. URF processing, therefore, yielded fast-dissolving formulations that were physically and chemically stable, resistant to alkali degradation or spontaneous recrystallization in the formulation...|$|E
40|$|Bamboo salt is a {{traditional}} medicine produced from sea salt. It is widely used in Oriental medicine and is an <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent</b> with reported antiinflammatory, antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic properties. Notwithstanding, linking specific molecular mechanisms with these properties has been challenging to establish in biological systems. In part, this issue {{may be related to}} bamboo salt eliciting nonspecific effects on components found within these systems. Herein, we investigated the effects of bamboo salt solution on supported lipid bilayers as a model system to characterize the interaction between lipid membranes and bamboo salt. The atomic composition of unprocessed and processed bamboo salts was first analyzed by mass spectrometry, and we identified several elements that have not been previously reported in other bamboo salt preparations. The alkalinity of hydrated samples was also measured and determined to be between pH 10 and 11 for bamboo salts. The effect of processed bamboo salt solutions on the fluidic properties of a supported lipid bilayer on glass was next investigated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis. It was demonstrated that, with increasing ionic strength of the bamboo salt solution, the fluidity of a lipid bilayer increased. On the contrary, increasing the ionic strength of near-neutral buffer solutions with sodium chloride salt diminished fluidity. To reconcile these two observations, we identified that solution alkalinity is critical for the effects of bamboo salt on membrane fluidity, as confirmed using three additional commercial bamboo salt preparations. Extended-DLVO model calculations support that the effects of bamboo salt on lipid membranes are due to the alkalinity imparting a stronger hydration force. Collectively, the results of this work demonstrate that processing of bamboo salt strongly affects its atomic composition and that the alkalinity of bamboo salt solutions contributes to its effect on membrane fluidity...|$|E
40|$|Acid-base and gas {{parameters}} of CSF and sagittal sinus blood were examined {{to investigate the}} pathogenesis of acute brain swelling following elevation of ICP. Acute intracranial hypertension was produced in 26 adult mongrel dogs by means of unilateral epidural balloon inflation. ICP was monitored by a small epidural balloon connected to a pressure transducer and recorded by a strip recorder. Arterial blood pH, pCO(2) and pO(2) were measured every 10 min. {{during the course of}} the experiment, and were kept within normal range by artificial ventilation. Venous blood from the superior sagittal sinus and CSF from the cisterns magna were also sampled for pH, pCO(2) and pO(2) measurement. Cortical pH was measured using a microglass electrode placed on the brain surface. EEG was recorded in the bilateral frontoparietal cortical region. Changes of the ICP were recorded after 10 % CO(2) inhalation in order to estimate CO(2) reactivity of the cerebral vessels under intracranial hypertension. Animals used were divided into two groups: Group A consisted of six animals in which the epidural balloon was inflated to 6 ml. resulting in increase of ICP to 50 - 100 mmHg. Group B included 20 animals in which the epidural balloon was inflated to the level where the so called Cushing's response was observed. In both groups, the balloon was abruptly deflated at the point where a desingated intracranial hypertension was obtained. In 9 out of 20 animals of Group B, ICP spontaneously increased again after deflation of the epidural balloon; this situation was called "acute brain swelling". In these animals with acute brain swelling, acid-base measurement revealed not only lowering of pH in cerebral venous blood, CSF and cerebral cortical surface, but also a significant increase in pCO(2) in both cerebral venous blood and CSF. Disappearance of CO(2) reactivity of cerebral vessels associated with isoelectric EEG was observed in these animals as well. On the other hand, acute brain swelling did not develop in the animals of Group A which did not lose CO(2) reactivity with EEG and remained normal. These animals showed no disorder of acid-base balance and gas metabolism in CSF and cerebral venous blood. In order to treat cerebral acidosis and hypercapnia in 9 animals which developed acute brain swelling, the <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent,</b> tris hydroxy methyl amino methane (THAM) was administered and its beneficial effect on the acute brain swelling was examined. After drip infusion of 0. 3 mole THAM (10 ml/kg), acidosis and hypercapnia of CSF and cerebral venous blood improved in 7 out of 9 animals. These results indicate that acute brain swelling following intracranial hypertension results from cerebral vasoparesis which is mainly caused by metabolic abnormalities such as cerebral acidosis and/or cerebral hypercapnia. Moreover it is suggested that THAM is an useful agent for combating acute brain swelling since it acts to restore cerebral vasomotor tone...|$|E

These minerals are poorly soluble salts at neutral and alkaline pH {{and they can be}} recovered by alkaline precipitation (Mekmene et al. 2012). However, the exact nature of these precipitates is not well known. These isolated precipitates can be used as Ca enrichment or for their functional properties (anti-caking agent, stabilizing agent…) in food products. The present work has been undertaken in order to study the influence of different parameters on calcium phosphate precipitation (pH, <b>alkalizing</b> <b>agent,</b> temperature). The final aim was to show if the nature and structure of recovered calcium phosphate from acidified milk ultrafiltrate (pH 4. 6 obtained with lactic acid) were dependent on the physicochemical parameters. The calcium phosphate precipitates were obtained by alkalization at pH 7, 8 or 9 and at 4 or 50 °C and with four different alkalizing agents authorized as additive by codex alimentarius (NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH) 2, MgO). Materials and methods : Preparation of milk ultrafiltrate: Raw skimmed milk (Entremont Alliance, Montauban de Bretagne, France) was acidified at 4 °C by lactic acid (90 %) under stirring in 45 minutes in order to solubilize completely Ca and Pi from caseins. Then the follow up of the pH under stirring were conducted during 2 hours. This acidified skimmed milk (ASM) was kept at 4 °C in cold room during one night. Then, ASM was heated at 25 °C under stirring during 30 minutes, the curd thus formed was separated from the serum on a filter-bag. The liquid was ultrafiltrated at 25 °C using pilot (TAMI/Tech Sep) equipped with 6. 65 * 2 m 2 of membrane (molecular weight cut-off = 8 kDa) (Tami Industries, Nyons, France). The ultrafiltrate was recovered and stored at 4 °C in sterile bottles before the alkalization. It contained 1200 and 480 mg of Ca and inorganic phosphate (Pi) respectively. Precipitation of milk derived calcium phosphates (MDCP) : The calcium phosphate precipitations from ultrafiltrates (800 mL) were performed in a FC 6 s flocculator from Velp Scientifica by adding alkalizing reagents (MgO, Ca(OH) 2, NaOH and KOH, 2 M). The addition was carried out under continuous stirring at 90 rpm and at 4 or 50 °C. The increased pH values were recorded using a Multi pH Meter Cinac (Alliance Instruments, Frepillon, France). After two hours of precipitation, about 200 mL of the suspensions were filtered (Whatman 42 filters papers). The different MDCP precipitates were recovered on the filter and dried in an oven at 30 °C for 4 - 6 days. The different solids were stored in flasks in a desiccator provided with drying agent (silica gel with hygroscopic indicator) before physico-chemical characterization. The filtrates were centrifuged to 1800 g for 30 min at 20 °C using vivaspin TM for mineral analyses. Physico-chemical analyses of MDCP precipitates : Ionic concentration : Anions contents were measured in ultrafiltrate and filtrates by ionic chromatography (Dionex ICS 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Villebon sur Yvette, France). Cations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (Varian, 220 FS spectrometer, Les Ulis, France). Granulometric and zeta potential analysis : The particles analyses were carried out with a Master sizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) to determine the size distributions by laser light scattering. The zeta potentials of the particles were measured by using a Zetasizer 3000 HS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). FTIR and XRD analysis of solids : The FTIR spectra were obtained using a FTIR Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer (400 - 4000 cm- 1 spectral range) using the KBr pellet technique (1 mg of sample in 300 mg of KBr). The XRD patterns were recorded using a diffractometer Bruker D 8 Advance equipped with a K 780 generator and a 1 -D Si detector (LynxEye) ...|$|E
