5|$|Periyar was <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> {{advocate}} of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Brahmanism is accepting social inequality based on birth. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste {{was seen as}} a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler, {{after an}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to overthrow the}} German government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing <b>a</b> <b>radical,</b> racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.|$|E
5|$|After 1966, in <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> {{departure}} from past policies, the Ministry of Economy announced a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from {{an annual rate}} of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.|$|E
5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This was to be <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> {{departure}} from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, everything was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes {{would be sent to}} attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E

5|$|Baird was {{appointed}} President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006.

Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> reduction in the size of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues. One of the members was Frances Lankin, a former Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because he was willing to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as a publisher by writers from across the political spectrum. Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E
5|$|Claudius of Turin (or Claude) (fl. 810–827) was the Catholic {{bishop of}} Turin from 817 until his death. He was a courtier of Louis the Pious {{and was a}} writer during the Carolingian Renaissance. He is most noted for {{teaching}} iconoclasm, <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> idea {{at that time in}} Latin Church, and for some teachings that prefigured those of the Protestant Reformation. He was attacked as a heretic in written works by Saint Dungal and Jonas of Orléans.|$|E
50|$|As {{an example}} <b>a</b> nitrate <b>radical</b> is {{generated}} by photolysis of CAN which reacts with an alkyne to generate first a very reactive vinyl radical and then via a 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and 5-exo-trig ring-closure <b>a</b> ketyl <b>radical.</b> The ketyl dislodges <b>a</b> nitrite <b>radical</b> which is not reactive enough for propagation and the ketone is formed.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism involves a bicyclic intermediate. The reaction is initiated by thermal decomposition of AIBN. The resulting radicals abstract hydrogen from tributyltin hydride to <b>a</b> tributyltin <b>radical</b> {{which in turn}} abstracts the halogen atom to form <b>an</b> alkyl <b>radical.</b> This radical attacks the carbonyl group to an intermediate bicyclic ketyl. This intermediate then rearranges with ring expansion to <b>a</b> new carbon <b>radical</b> species which recombines with <b>a</b> proton <b>radical</b> from tributyltin hydride propagating the catalytic cycle.|$|R

5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} {{suggestion}} that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E

He also starred off-Broadway at The Public Theater in a documentary theatre piece called Privacy, {{playing the role of}} The Writer.

50|$|Radical clock {{reactions}} {{involve a}} competition between <b>a</b> unimolecular <b>radical</b> reaction with <b>a</b> known rate constant and <b>a</b> bimolecular <b>radical</b> reaction with <b>an</b> unknown rate constant to produce unrearranged and rearranged products. The rearrangement of <b>an</b> unrearranged <b>radical,</b> U•, proceeds to form R• (the clock reaction) with a known rate constant (kr).

5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that}} the whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, the Roman army {{underwent}} <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> restructuring. In {{the rule}} of Diocletian (284–305), the traditional Principate formations of legiones, alae and cohortes {{appear to have been}} broken up into smaller units, many of which bore a variety of new names. Under Constantine I (r. 312–337) it appears that military units were classified into three grades based on strategic role and to some extent quality: palatini, elite units normally part of the exercitus praesentales (imperial escort armies); comitatenses, higher-grade interception forces based in frontier provinces; and limitanei, lower-grade border troops.

5|$|John Chilembwe, born locally {{in around}} 1871, {{received}} his early education at a Church of Scotland mission and later met Joseph Booth, <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> Baptist missionary {{who ran the}} Zambezi Industrial Mission. Booth preached a form of egalitarianism and his progressive attitude towards race attracted Chilembwe's attention. Under Booth's patronage, Chilembwe travelled to the United States to study at a theological college in Virginia. There he mixed in African-American circles and was influenced by stories of the abolitionist John Brown and the egalitarianist Booker T. Washington.|$|E

50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism consists of <b>a</b> catalytic <b>radical</b> initiation step and a propagation step. The alcohol (1) is first {{converted into a}} reactive carbonothioyl intermediate such as a thionoester or xanthate (2). Then, tributylstannane 3 is decomposed by AIBN 8 into <b>a</b> tributylstannyl <b>radical</b> 4. The tributyltin radical abstracts the xanthate group from 2 leaving <b>an</b> alkyl <b>radical</b> 5 and tributyltin xanthate (7). The sulfur tin bond in this compound is very stable and provides the driving force for this reaction. The alkyl radical in turn abstracts a hydrogen atom from a new molecule of tributylstannane generating the desired deoxygenated product (6) and <b>a</b> new <b>radical</b> species ready for propagation.|$|R
