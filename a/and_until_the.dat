The estate continues to provide the service in 2007, for British Scouters of The Scout Association and international participants. Original trainers include Baden-Powell and Gilwell Camp Chiefs Francis Gidney, John Wilson <b>and,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, John Thurman.|$|E
5|$|American {{merchant}} vessels {{began to}} fall prey to Barbary Pirates, most notably from Algiers, in the Mediterranean during the 1790s. Congress responded with the Naval Act of 1794. The Act provided funds {{for the construction of}} six frigates, and directed that the construction would continue unless <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, electors from the zelanti faction {{attempted}} to elect Giuseppe Renato Imperiali, but this was not possible because of his unpopularity with both France and Spain. Following this attempt cardinals representing the Bourbons insisted that no serious attempt to elect a new pope take place until all cardinals who were traveling had arrived, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> electors had received instructions from the various Catholic monarchs.|$|E

5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{diffusion}} of national and Republican ideas across France {{during the second half of}} the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century. Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.|$|E
5|$|Economically, animals {{provide much}} of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> arrival of {{mechanised}} transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of}} the power used for work and transport. Animals serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> present day most of Bani Zeid's cultivable land {{is covered by}} olive orchards. The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions, dry legumes and fodder to a lesser degree. Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009. Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty <b>and,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, in {{connection}} with his commercial fishery, Hume built a hatchery at Ellensburg (Gold Beach), which released fish into the river. In its first year of operation, Hume collected 215,000 salmon eggs and released about 100,000fry. After the first hatchery was destroyed by fire in 1893, Hume built a new hatchery in 1895, and in 1897 he co-operated with the United States Fish Commission in building and operating an egg-collecting station {{at the mouth of}} Elk Creek on the upper Rogue. In 1899, he built a hatchery near Wedderburn, across the river from Gold Beach, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> time of his death in 1908 he had salmon eggs shipped to it from the Elk Creek station.|$|E
5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. <b>And</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E

Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki, a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side. Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions. Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received {{a reputation for being}} casual, practical and lacklustre. However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a {{crossing}} {{arose in}} the 1960s; <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1990s proposals were for a pontoon bridge further north. The Stord Bridge was conceived after the decision to combine the crossing with the Bømlafjord Tunnel. The project was resisted both by local environmental groups and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the latter because the new plans would delay completion. Construction was undertaken by a joint venue between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Construction started in 1999 {{and was the first}} bridge in Norway to have the cables spun on-site. The bridge cost 442 million Norwegian krone (NOK) and was taken into use on 27 December 2000.|$|E
5|$|Portland is {{an ancient}} royal manor, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 19th century {{remained}} a separate liberty within Dorset for administration purposes. It was an urban district from 1894 to 1974, until the borough of Weymouth and Portland formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. This merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis with Portland urban district. For local elections the borough is divided into 15 wards, and three of them cover Portland. Elections {{take place in a}} four-year cycle; one third of the councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re-election in years one, two and three, and county council elections are held in year four.|$|E

5|$|Rates of DKA {{vary around}} the world. In the United Kingdom, about 4% {{of people with}} type 1 {{diabetes}} develop DKA each year, while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. DKA was first described in 1886 <b>and,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> introduction of insulin therapy in the 1920s, it was almost universally fatal. The risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is currently around 1–4%. Up to 1% of children with DKA develop a complication known as cerebral edema.|$|E
5|$|Reptile is a Raptor, a nearly-extinct bipedal {{humanoid}} race of reptilian {{creatures and}} loyally serves the series' recurring villain Shao Kahn in hope that his race will be revived. Reptile has {{been featured in}} almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 2011 reboot, {{he had yet to}} be rewarded for his efforts. Critical reception to the character has been positive, with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s saw {{the growth}} of {{speculative}} house building by developers. These introduced English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland, which had been largely unknown before this period. Many were small and built to minimum standards with little regard to energy or environmental issues. Sales of council houses were popular in Scotland <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s as, unlike in England, local authorities could use the whole of their capital receipts for development. Under the Scottish Assembly, Scottish Homes was abolished and replaced by Communities Scotland in 2001, which had a responsibility to provide affordable housing and environmental improvement. In 2011 it was in turn replaced by the Scottish Housing Regulator, whose remit includes Scottish local authority landlords.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} unless <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> suspect {{actually}} {{stated that he}} was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying a waiver.|$|E
5|$|The Eriskay Pony {{developed}} in the Hebrides, a group of western isles in Scotland. The origins of the breed are ancient, with roots in Celtic and Norse breeding. It is physically similar to drawings of ponies on ancient Pictish stones found in north and west Scotland. It is related to other northern breeds, including the Icelandic horse and the Faroe pony. The Eriskay {{takes its name from}} the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Originally, the breed had a fairly large population, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> mid-19th century the Eriskay and similar ponies were found throughout the western islands of Scotland. They were used as crofters' ponies, as pack animals, for light draught and as mounts for children.|$|E
