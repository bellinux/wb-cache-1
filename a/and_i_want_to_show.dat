Ahead of the tournament proper, he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006: [...] "I went to Germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of. Tactically, I have learned a lot and I'm in much better condition, both physically and psychologically. This is my World Cup, I think I can play a lead role <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> I'm a player that can do it in big games." [...] After losing to Ghana in the opening group match, Serbia went on to face Germany. Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose's first-half dismissal, Žigić headed a cross down to Milan Jovanović who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game; Lukas Podolski's second-half penalty was saved, and Antić dedicated the victory to the Serbian people. In a game of missed chances against Australia, Serbia lost 2–1 and finished bottom of the group.|$|E

5000|$|She {{released}} two {{albums and}} some of her songs were instant-hits and occupied pole position on local charts and radio stations. For the track listing she worked with Smiley in 2007, they put together the album including songs like [...] "My soul" [...] and [...] "Secret of Mary", from the soundtrack of [...] "Secret of Mary" [...] webcast TV show, that promoted her on every music channel. At the public album launch, Delia had played-back and did not perform live. A different song released by the celebrity was [...] "Ziua ta"/"Your day", with a music video made to measure. The atmosphere was maintained by Connect-R - another local singer and good friend of the artist. The special moment was Delia offering her guests an impromptu duet on the spot with her mother, singer Gina Matache. On this occasion Delia has officially announced her intention to start a working with her mother, for an album in the fall. People from Romania, do not want to buy albums, so Delia resumed the idea of releasing only singles from 2008. Of late, she was more active after the split with Matteo, a local singer. The co-op with him changed Delia's direction in something more appropriate to R&B style. [...] "I accepted this offer from A.P.A.A, I carry one's heart upon one's sleeve for daws to peck at, when we talk about such problems, and through this song, my hope was to support people with psoriazis, because for them this life is a daily fight, and especially cause' a friend of mine, suffer from a disease like this, and I know very well how hard is. Not few are the moments when she is the most marginalised, or, I don't know.... excluded from a group, and this fact I'm sure it is in common for others psoriazis patients. By this song, I want to assure all of them, that I am next to they, and I impel them to be more rosiers, and to put aside others prejudices, to keep a good table, for their lives, for a normal life.

I end my discussion with an account of some fundamental objections raised by Quine and Kripke against Kantian analysis. Quine mainly wants to deny the traditional analytic and synthetic distinction. Besides, Kripke is trying to show that it is not true that the traditional account of the intimate relation between a priori and necessary proposition must be true, i. e., it is mistaken that a priori proposition must be necessary, it may be contingent.

40|$|It was an {{empirical}} discovery that Phosphorus is Hesperus. According to Kripke, {{this was also}} the discovery of a necessary fact. Now, given Kripke’s theory of direct reference one could wonder what kind of discovery this is. For we already knew Phosphorus/Hesperus, and we also knew that any entity is, necessarily, identical to itself. So what is it that was discovered? I want to show that there is more to this widely known case than what usual readings, and critics, reveal; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> this under the Kripkean pattern that what was discovered is the plain fact of identity that Phosphorus is, and necessarily is, Hesperus. Moreover, I will show how both Kripkean theses, the necessity of identity and the direct theory of reference, should not be kept apart to understand the kind of discovery this is. In particular, understanding the kind of discovery we made will help us see how intuition is displayed in metaphysics, and how metaphysical impossibilities, and metaphysical modality in general, can be discerned by reason and separated from other modalities. The study of this discovery will help us see, in a line, how identity belongs to the inner and most profound structure of reality and to the most profound structure of cognition and language...|$|E
40|$|This note high-lights {{one major}} theme in my lecture notes Logic in Games (van Benthem 1999 – 2002) : {{the need for}} {{explicit}} logics that define agents ’ strategies, as the drivers of interaction in games. Our text outlines issues, recalls published results from the last few years, and raises new open problems. Results are mainly quoted, and the mephasis is on new notions and open problems. For more details on the various topics discussed, see the relevant references. 1 Strategies as first-class citizens Much of game theory is about the question whether strategic equilibria exist. But there are hardly any explicit languages for defining, comparing, or combining strategies as such – {{the way we have}} them for actions and plans, maybe the closest intuitive analogue to strategies. True, there are many current logics for describing game structure – but these tend to have existential quantifiers saying that “players have a strategy ” for achieving some purpose, while descriptions of these strategies themselves {{are not part of the}} logical language (cf. Parikh & Pauly 2003, van der Hoek, van Otterloo & Wooldridge 2005).
