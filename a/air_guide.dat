An {{investigation}} path {{starting from}} (Mn,Ni,Co,Fe) 3 O 4 nanometric powder preparation, NTC thick-film characterization, realization and optimization of new planar thermistor geometries to custom design thermistors and their application for temperature and volume airflow sensors was recently determined.

A pair of segmented thermistors was placed in an <b>air</b> <b>guide</b> and connected to differential branches of the Wheatstone bridge. A heater {{was placed in the}} middle between the thermistors for the indirectly heated type, while for the self-heated type the same thermistors were self-heated by a constant current source.

40|$|A natural {{convection}} solar tunnel dryer comprising three major units, a solar collector unit, a drying unit, and a vertical bare flat-plate chimney, was constructed. No-load tests with a horizontal configuration of air {{entry into the}} collector resulted in a bidirectional air flow in the dryer. To correct this undesirable situation, an <b>air</b> <b>guide</b> at the collector was incorporated to ensure that air entered in a vertical direction. To investigate its performance, drying experiments with mango were carried out at the University of Zambia, Department of Agricultural Engineering. Uncertainties in the parameters measured in the experiment were analysed and quantified. The results showed that, under solar radiation between 568. 4 and 999. 5 [*]W/m 2, air temperature of up to 65. 8 °C was attained at the collector unit. The average relative humidity values were 30. 8 %, 6. 4 %, and 8. 4 % for the ambient, collector, and drying unit, respectively. Under these conditions, mango with an initial moisture content of 85. 5 % (wet basis) was dried to 13. 0 % (wet basis) in 9. 5 hours. The collector, drying, and pick-up efficiencies {{were found to be}} 24. 7 %, 12. 8 %, and 35. 0 %, respectively. The average temperature difference between the chimney air and ambient air was 12. 1 °C, and this was sufficient in driving the flow of air through the dryer...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of artificial vortex air generator {{as part of}} the preliminary of Solar Vortex Power Generator for an electrical power generation. A vortex air generator system was built, consisting of concentric cylinders. The inner cylinder was fitted with stationary <b>air</b> <b>guide</b> vanes and covered at the top by a transparent plate to capture the solar radiation and create swirling updraft flow which is able to rotate wind turbine and produces power. The influence of inlet air velocity and temperature on the swirling strength and mass flow generated has been evaluated by validated CFD simulation. ANSYS Fluent software was adopted to solve the 3 -D, steady state of Navier-Stokes and energy equations in cylindrical coordinate system integrated with discrete ordinates (DO) radiation model. For the preliminary vortex generator design, the CFD results were validated first with previous experimental measurements. Then the variable operation parameters were carried out on the proposed model. The simulation result demonstrated that inflow velocity is a key parameter for enhancing the system performance. By increasing the inflow velocity from 0. 4 m/s to 0. 6 m/s and inflow temperature 323 °k the enhancement rate of the mass air flow generated reached to 26 % compared with 7 % when increase the inflow temperature to 328 °k and inflow velocity 0. 4 m/s...|$|E
40|$|Intension In this {{graduation}} project I {{will make}} a redevelopment of the Q-Port building to a Hotel and Congress Centre: On the one hand, my project focuses on the refurbishment of an office façade into an energy producing façade. This renew has an ecological, social and economic importance. These three aspects reflect my sustainable approach. On the other hand, {{the establishment of a}} new use strategy for the Q-Port building in form of a Hotel and Congress Centre plays a key role. The Q-Port building is a bad example of urban planning when an important aspect of life – work – leads to mono-functional urban sectors. Instead of thinking in certain functional categories, I want to create spaces in the urban context in which we simply enjoy living – spaces with leeway for individuality – regardless of how large the building is. KEY Feature - “Grüne Lunge” Key feature of my design is the “Grüne Lunge”, an open public way and an energy generating technology as design element of the façade to unite the urban concept and the energy concept within the façade design. The redesign of the Q-Port building is linked to the historic urban planning strategy to be a green recreational area. Urban porosity is the key intention of the new hybrid Q-Port building with the aim of pedestrian oriented urban places. The transformed Q-Port building becomes localized a `social condenser´ for new communities: The “Grüne Lunge”, an open public space spirals upwards from the street and guides the people through the building. ReDesign The redesign is not only use related but also energy efficient with the design of an energy generating façade, which makes the building to an energy production. In the focus there is an active intelligent façade, the “Grüne Lunge”, in relation to the climate of a building and the possibility for the urban context: The façade is my fascination because it shows most dominant the architectural value of a building. It is the visible statement to the world and it gives a face to the building. Façades connect the inside space and the outside city rooms and have a high potential as multifunctional construction elements. The new task of the façade in my design is, that the “Grüne Lunge”, which is an open public way, is linked to the energy concept of the whole building and is main part of the ventilation concept. The “Grüne Lunge” is an open public way, which spirals upwards, and guaranties natural ventilation in the rooms. In the summer time it transports cold air from {{the north side of the}} building into the south part. The night cooling out of the building in the summer is done by the “Grüne Lunge”. In the winter time the air is transported from the south side of the building and is preheated in the buffer zone of the “Grüne Lunge” and flows over an <b>air</b> <b>guide</b> system in the suspended floors into the rooms. Moreover, the “Grüne Lunge” acts as an interspace and a connection point for the public and private activities within the building. Benchmark The perforated glass in the building envelope is only broken by the transparent envelope of the “Grüne Lunge”. The “Grüne Lunge” in the building`s envelope can be seen from the highway or the streets and by this people get interested in the new use strategy of the Q Port building. The new Q Port building should become a highlight building in the Brettenzone like a Benchmark for the city part Brettenzone. Therefore the installation of a media façade which offers surface for commercial activities is done in addition to the BIPV modules at the closed façade parts. This is the next step into a more sustainable future: The energy concept for the Q-Port building is able to generate energy within the façade and so unifies the energy demands of the future.
