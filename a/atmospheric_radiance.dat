40|$|AbstractThe {{radiance}} of {{the night}} sky is determined by the available light and the scattering properties of the atmosphere (particles and gases). The scattering phase function of the aerosol has a strong dependence on the scattering angle, and depending on the viewing direction different parts of the atmosphere and the ground reflectivity give the most important contribution. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radiance</b> cannot be altered by optical instruments. On the other hand the light flux of a distant star increases with the size of the telescope, thus fainter stars become visible. Light extinction, scattering function, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radiance,</b> ground reflectivity, color effects and others are discussed in detail and a simple theoretical treatment is given...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study of the}} effect of {{variations}} in the earth's seasonal and geographical horizon radiance on the location of the infrared horizon as measured by ITHACO scanwheels are presented. Two types of variations are considered. These are (1) systematic variations of the mean (averaged over all longitudes) <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radiance</b> due to macroscopic changes in temperature as a function of latitude and season and (2) random variations in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radiance</b> due to microscopic fluctuations (weather). The effect of variations in the scanner wheel speeds on the attitude determination accuracy is also presented. The computed horizon radiance and wheel speed variation - induced attitude errors are then combined with errors caused by sensor alignment and electronics tolerances to obtain an overall estimate of the SEASAT-A pitch and roll angle accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The radiometric {{accuracy}} of a sensor is {{adversely affected by}} scene polarization if its optical system is sensitive to polarization. Tests performed on the reflective bands of the NS 001 Thematic Mapper simulator, an aircraft multispectral scanner, show {{that it is very}} sensitive to the polarization state of the incoming radiations. For 100 percent linearly polarized light, errors in the measured intensity vary from - 40 to + 40 percent, depending on the scan angle and spectral band. To estimate polarization-induced errors in the intensity measured at aircraft level, the intensity and polarization of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radiances</b> were simulated using a realistic earth-atmosphere radiative transfer model. For the polarization of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radiances</b> in the solar meridian plane over a vegetated target, intensity errors may range from - 10 to + 10 percent. The polarization-induced errors are highest in the shortest NS 001 spectral band (0. 450 - 0. 525 microns) because of large atmospheric polarizations contributed by Rayleigh particles and small diluting effects caused by the small contributions of weakly polarized radiations coming from aerosols and the surface. Depending on the illumination and view angles, the errors in derived surface reflectance due to the radiance errors can be very large. In particular, for large off-nadir view angles in the forward scattered direction when the sun is low, the relative errors in the derived surface reflectance can be as large as 4 to 5 times the relative error in the radiances. Polarization sensitivity errors cannot be neglected for the shorter wavelengths when the surface reflectance contribution to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radiances</b> is very small...|$|R
