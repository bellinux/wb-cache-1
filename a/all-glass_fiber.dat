2500|$|While the {{material}} cost is significantly higher for <b>all-glass</b> <b>fiber</b> blades than for hybrid glass/carbon fiber blades, {{there is a}} potential for tremendous savings in manufacturing costs when labor price is considered. [...] Utilizing carbon fiber enables for simpler designs that use less raw material. [...] The chief manufacturing process in blade fabrication is the layering of plies. [...] By reducing the number of layers of plies, as is enabled by thinner blade design, the cost of labor may be decreased, and in some cases, equate to the cost of labor for glass fiber blades.|$|E

It is <b>all-glass</b> <b>fiber</b> supporting single mode light propagation for operating wavelength of 633 nm from the HeNe laser. A simple and modified practical setup {{to measure the}} current, based on the Faraday’s Effect is proposed.

40|$|The OH-content of an undoped core <b>all-glass</b> <b>fiber</b> is {{modified}} {{within the}} range from 1 to 100 ppm. At 860 nm wavelength the radiation resistance expressed by recovery coefficient in the long-term annealing after pulsed irradiation (10 ms - 10 s) increases with increasing water-content and with additional hydrogen-treatment. At 1310 nm wavelength the induced loss at short times after the radiation pulse is smaller due to hydrogen-treatment. The long-term recovery decreases with increasing OH-content, in contrast to 860 nm. (INT...|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and fiber optics, a plastic-clad silica fiber or polymer-clad silica fiber (PCS) is an optical fiber {{that has a}} silica-based core and a plastic cladding. The cladding of a PCS fiber {{should not be confused}} with the polymer overcoat of a conventional all-silica fiber. PCS fibers in general have significantly lower performance characteristics, particularly higher transmission losses and lower bandwidths, than <b>all-glass</b> <b>fibers.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate the interest of a consolidation process associated with the powder-in-tube technique in order to fabricate a long length of specialty optical fibers. This so-called Modified Powder-in-Tube (MPIT) process is very flexible and paves the way to multimaterial optical fiber fabrications with different core and cladding glassy materials. Another feature of this technique lies in the sintering of the preform under reducing or oxidizing atmosphere. The fabrication of such optical fibers implies different constraints that we have to deal with, namely chemical species diffusion or mechanical stress due to the mismatches between thermal expansion coefficients and working temperatures of the fiber materials. This paper focuses on preliminary results obtained with a lanthano-aluminosilicate glass used as the core material for the fabrication of <b>all-glass</b> <b>fibers</b> or specialty Photonic Crystal Fibers (PCFs). To complete the panel of original microstructures now available by the MPIT technique, we also present several optical fibers in which metallic particles or microwires are included into a silica-based matrix...|$|R
40|$|A {{structured}} sapphire-derived <b>all-glass</b> optical <b>fiber</b> with {{an aluminum}} {{content in the}} core of up to 50 mol% was used for fiber Bragg grating inscription. The fiber provided a parabolic refractive index profile. Fiber Bragg gratings were inscribed by means of femtosecond-laser pulses with a wavelength of 400 nm in combination with a two-beam phase mask interferometer. Heating experiments demonstrated the stability of the gratings for temperatures up to 950 degrees C for more than 24 h without degradation in reflectivity...|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} {{characterize}} a simple CO 2 laser processing technique for the fabrication of compact <b>all-glass</b> optical <b>fiber</b> cladding light strippers. We investigate the cladding light loss {{as a function}} of radiation angle of incidence and demonstrate devices in a 400 µm diameter fiber with cladding losses of greater than 20 dB for a 7 cm device length. The core losses are also measured giving a loss of < 0. 008 ± 0. 006 dB/cm. Finally we demonstrate the successful cladding light stripping of a 300 W laser diode with minimal heating of the fiber coating and packaging adhesives...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the advance}} of ytterbium-doped fiber laser to kW-level cw-output power, there is a {{particular}} interest in using shorter fiber length with large cores since they mitigate detrimental nonlinear effect such as stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering. However, most of the fibers lasers used currently are coated with a low-index polymer to guide the pump light. This is a simple and effective solution. These polymer coatings impede the extraction of the heat deposited in the doped region in the laser cycle because their thermal conductivity is {{an order of magnitude}} lower than that of fused silica. Therefore, the record power extraction per unit length has been held by <b>all-glass</b> rod-type <b>fiber</b> laser at about 250 - 300 W/...|$|R

This design provides suppression of high-order modes and {{of one of the}} polarization states of the fundamental mode. The polarizing fiber was fabricated by a new, simple method based on a combination of the modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD) process and the rod-in-tube technique.

40|$|Silver iodide {{metaphosphate}} {{glasses of}} the xAgI + (1 −x) AgPO 3 family are embedded inside the air capillaries {{of a commercial}} silica photonic crystal fiber (PCF) by means of vacuum-assisted infiltration technique. In this paper, we report on tuning the photonic bandgap (PBG) guidance characteristics of the fabricated <b>all-glass</b> photonic bandgap <b>fibers,</b> by varying {{the composition of the}} fast-ion-conducting phosphate glass infiltration medium. Doping AgPO 3 metaphosphate glass with AgI significantly alters the PBG guidance patterns in the examined range between 350 and 1750 nm, as it leads to the introduction of numerous additional transmission stop-bands, while affecting scattering dependant losses. The effect of phosphate glass cooling method during sample fabrication on the transmission behavior of the xAgI + (1 −x) AgPO 3 /PCFs is also considered...|$|R
