40|$|<b>A</b> {{selective}} <b>sweep</b> {{describes the}} reduction of diversity due to strong positive selection. If the mutation rate to a selectively beneficial allele is sufficiently high, Pennings and Hermisson (2006 a) have shown, that it becomes likely, that <b>a</b> selective <b>sweep</b> is caused by several indi-viduals. Such an event is called <b>a</b> soft <b>sweep</b> and the complementary event of a single origin of the beneficial allele, the classical case, <b>a</b> hard <b>sweep.</b> We give analytical expressions for the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between two neutral loci linked to the selected locus, depending on the recurrent mutation to the beneficial allele, measured by D and σ̂ 2 D, a quantity intro-duced by Ohta and Kimura (1969), and conclude that the LD-pattern of <b>a</b> soft <b>sweep</b> differs substantially from that of <b>a</b> hard <b>sweep</b> due to haplotype structure. We compare our results with simulations. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> reverse <b>sweep</b> is <b>a</b> crossbatted <b>sweep</b> shot {{played in}} the {{opposite}} direction to the standard sweep, thus instead of sweeping the ball to the leg side, it is swept to the off side, towards backward point or third man. The batsman may also swap his hands on the bat handle to make the stroke easier to execute. The batsman may also bring his back foot to the front therefore making it more like <b>a</b> traditional <b>sweep.</b> The advantage of <b>a</b> reverse <b>sweep</b> is that it effectively reverses the fielding positions and thus is very difficult to set a field to. It is also a risky shot for the batsman as it increases the chance of LBW and also is quite easy to top edge to a fielder.|$|R

Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E
