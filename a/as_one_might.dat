5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} victim is interviewed {{with her face}} hidden. She describes how she and other {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down a runway before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the audience members, who she says examined her off the runway <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Though {{described}} {{often as}} a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, in which Ivalice was created parallel to the real world. The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region, and a smaller kingdom, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice {{is also used to}} refer to the conceptual setting, rather <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> say the Medieval world of Europe and the Mediterranean.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> imagine, a woman's outfit was not {{complete}} without {{some kind of}} headwear. As with today, a medieval woman had many options- from straw hats, to hoods to elaborate headpieces. A woman's activity and occasion would dictate what she wore on her head.|$|E
25|$|Arguing {{in favor}} of a partial historicity to these figures, Rees noted that all but Elfan had long-standing {{associations}} with parish churches in the area around Llandaff, though he admitted none seemed as grand or preëminent <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect were they actually the apostles of Britain. Bartrum replied such dedications must be assumed to post-date Geoffrey's popularity.|$|E
25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> wish to have less compression for left-side events).|$|E

25|$|Everyone {{can imagine}} how terrified the peasant must have been when he saw Thor making his brows sink down over his eyes; as for what could be seen of the eyes themselves, {{he thought he would}} {{collapse}} at just the very sight. Thor clenched his hands on the shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.|$|E
25|$|A verse {{narrative}}, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect, {{is simply}} a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to {{its place in the}} flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.|$|E
25|$|Malkin {{was born}} on 31 July 1986 in Magnitogorsk, a city in the Soviet Union to Vladimir and Natalia Malkin. Vladimir worked for Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, the largest {{iron and steel works}} in Russia and the city's {{dominant}} industry, and played in the Metallurg Magnitogorsk youth and club hockey system. Malkin has one brother, Denis, who is older by one year. Malkin began skating at age 3. He joined his first organized hockey league two years later. He showed an aptitude for the sport at an early age, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect from the son of a pro. However, because both of his parents were short, no one suspected that Malkin would be a world-class athlete.|$|E

25|$|Tonga {{is notable}} for its high obesity rates with over 90% of the {{population}} being overweight. Consequently, many Tongan islanders have {{an increased risk of}} heart disease, diabetes and other obesity related diseases which place the nation's health service under considerable strain. Much of this is related to the nation's cultural love of food and eating as well as the modern influx of cheap and high-fat content meat, with corned beef and lamb belly remaining firm favourites in Tongan cuisine. Despite being a highly obese population, there is little stigma attached to being overweight <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> find in many Western civilizations. Like a great number of South Pacific cultures, large bodies are often revered, though there is growing acknowledgment of the health risks involved.|$|E
25|$|The Williams Institute {{estimates}} {{the number of}} LGBT employees as follows: 7 million private sector employees, 1 million state and local employees, and 200,000 employees of the federal government. Thirty percent {{of state and local}} LGBT employees live in California and New York. In comparison, less than half of one half of one percent of LGBT state and local employees live in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming combined. <b>As</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect, many of the documented complaints of discrimination by state and local governments against LGBT employees are in California and New York. Surveys that seek to document {{discrimination on the basis of}} perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity are often conducted with a pool of self identified LGBT people, making it difficult to ascertain the impact of this type of discrimination on non-LGBT individuals.|$|E
25|$|Since 1990, {{the rate}} of {{deforestation}} in the DRC has remained constant at 0.20%, which equates {{to the loss of}} 311,000 hectares, or roughly 1,200 square miles, annually. This amounts to destroying forests the size of Delaware every two years. The fact that {{the rate of}} deforestation has remained constant over the last twenty years is misleading <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> believe that government or non-government organizations (NGO) interventions have been responsible for the decline, but reports indicate otherwise. Three reasons have been postulated as to why deforestation rates have remained relatively low: 1) the road network within the country has been gradually in decline making access to more remote areas more difficult, 2) political and regulatory changes have disincentivized investment in the country, and 3) agriculture has expanded outside of forest areas.|$|E

25|$|Toulouse-Lautrec {{would have}} seized at once {{on all that}} was {{significant}} of the moral atmosphere, would have seized most of all on what satisfied his slightly morbid relish of depravity... But Seurat, one feels, saw it almost <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> suppose some visitant from another planet would have done. He saw it with this penetrating exactness of a gaze vacant of all direct understanding... Each figure seems to be so perfectly enclosed within its simplified contour, for, however precise and detailed Seurat is, his passion for geometricizing never deserts him—enclosed so completely, so shut off in its partition, that no other relation than a spatial and geometrical one is any longer possible. The syntax of actual life has been broken up and replaced by Seurat's own peculiar syntax with all its strange, remote and unforeseen implications.|$|E
25|$|MIL-101, a large-cavity MOF {{having the}} formula , is a cyanosilylation catalyst. The coordinated water {{molecules}} in MIL-101 are easily removed to expose Cr(III) sites. <b>As</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect, given the greater Lewis acidity of Cr(III) vs. Cu(II), MIL-101 {{is much more}} active than HKUST-1 {{as a catalyst for}} the cyanosilylation of aldehydes. Additionally, the Kaskel group observed that the catalytic sites of MIL-101, in contrast to those of HKUST-1, are immune to unwanted reduction by benzaldehyde. The Lewis-acid-catalyzed cyanosilylation of aromatic aldehydes has also been carried out by Long and co-workers using a MOF of the formula Mn3. This material contains a three-dimensional pore structure, with the pore diameter equaling 10 Å. In principle, either of the two types of Mn(II) sites could function as a catalyst. Noteworthy features of this catalyst are high conversion yields (for small substrates) and good substrate-size-selectivity, consistent with channellocalized catalysis.|$|E
25|$|Many fields {{around the}} village reflect England's history. The field known as 'the Leys' (opposite Milton House in Rectory Lane) shows clear signs of 18th-century pre-enclosure and pre-British Agricultural Revolution farming in strips {{although}} this is slowly disappearing with recent farming. The mediaeval open field system was enclosed in Milton in 1779 together with that of Collingtree. The soil is predominantly sandy <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect since the area is the bed of an ancient river. Evidence of sand and clay extraction is all around, reflecting 19th- and 20th-century industrial and urban expansion. For example, the small industrial estate in Gayton Road is on an old clay quarry; the playing and football fields in Collingtree Road are on the sites of sand quarries - {{in the latter case}} mostly filled with clay spoil from the 1950s construction of the M1. The field between Towcester Road and the A43 Milton by-pass, which opened in May 1991, {{to the west of the}} village was also the site of a sand quarry in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

Perhaps surprisingly, Russell avers that the consequences of systematic propaganda are not as dire <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect. (Russell 1938:114–115) A true monopoly over opinion leads to careless arrogance among leaders, as well as to indifference to the well-being of the governed, and a lack of credulity on behalf of the governed towards the state.
