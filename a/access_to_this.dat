5|$|About {{one percent}} of people who receive {{treatment}} for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury. Observation to monitor for worsening condition {{is an important part of}} treatment. Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E
5|$|By 1606 {{the missionaries}} had {{concentrated}} many Manche Ch'ols in nine new mission towns, and {{had started to}} penetrate {{the territory of the}} neighbouring Mopan Maya, who were on the borders of the fiercely independent Itza of central Petén. By 1628 the Dominicans were tending to 6,000 Maya in the part of Manche Ch'ol territory that they had gained <b>access</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> figure included some apostate refugees from Spanish-controlled Cahabón. Estimates of the total Manche Ch'ol population in the mid-17th century vary from 10,000 to 30,000, with prominent 20th-century Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson preferring the lower figure as opposed to the high-end estimates by 17th-century chroniclers. The Dominican penetration of Mopan territory alarmed the Itza, who started to harass the Manche Ch'ol, driving them away from the mission towns.|$|E
5|$|In his {{judgment}} of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet to release its subscribers' information {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were parties to the case. He explicitly denied Odex <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> information. He upheld District Judge Lau's decision that Odex was not the correct party to have asked for release of subscriber data. As a result, he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$20,000. Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies. The ruling may have set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by {{making it more difficult}} for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders.|$|E
30|$|The {{study showed}} that that the {{regulatory}} regime in Mozambique influences <b>access</b> <b>to</b> finance. <b>This</b> study finding disagrees {{with the findings of}} Scott and William (2001) that there is no clear relationship between regulatory restriction, interference of the government on the process of intermediation and banking system’s competitiveness and SMEs’ <b>access</b> <b>to</b> finance. <b>This</b> study therefore concludes that the regulatory regime should increase the efficiency and competitiveness in the banking system and make <b>access</b> <b>to</b> finance easier.|$|R

5|$|Kouao {{herself was}} called to the inquiry, {{becoming}} the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry. She initially refused to answer questions, and when she did, protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not the fault of the various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E
5|$|The panel issued {{over 500}} recommendations, {{including}} limiting {{the growth of}} the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.|$|E
