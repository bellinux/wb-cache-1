40|$|Abstract. The {{assignment}} of the chiral indices n 1 and n 2 in semiconducting and metallic nanotubes was performed comparing resonance Raman profiles and transition energies in a 3 rd-order Kataura plot. We find several complete branches in the Kataura plot {{and are able}} to assign the resonance peaks to n 1 and n 2 without prior assumptions about the constant of proportionality between the radial-breathing mode frequency ωRBM and the inverse diameter of the tube. We point out systematic differences in the transition energies and intensities in + 1 and − 1 nanotube families. Ever since the discovery of how to keep isolated nanotubes from rebundeling in solu-tion, it has become a realistic goal to identify the chirality of a nanotube by spectroscopic methods. Wrapping the nanotubes with SDS, Bachilo et al. [1] found that the lumines-cence from semiconducting nanotubes was large and not quenched by the presence of metallic tubes. They were able to map out luminescence energies of a sample as a func-tion of laser-excitation energy and found a series of peaks presumably orginating from different chirality nanotubes. There were, however, several possibilities for matching the experimental transition energies E 11 and E 22 to the calculated energies.

40|$|In a {{study on}} the {{problems}} of censorship and interpretation from 1984, (Censorship and Interpretation; The Conditions of Reading and Writing in Early Modern England), Annabel Patterson states that British <b>authors</b> of <b>the</b> seventeenth century often used <b>the</b> shelter of <b>ambiguity</b> as a protection from the threat of censorship. But as the text had to be understood by the intended readers, Patterson argues that the writer used a set of codes for guidance to the intended meaning of the text. One of the codes identified by Patterson was the use of historical texts, such as the classics, limiting authorial responsibility as well as providing a set of allusions directing the attention to the present day. It goes without saying that <b>the</b> <b>author</b> in late imperial China, writing under the threat of censorship, was able to use ambiguity as a protection from aggressive censorship. Some of the codes identified by Patterson in the writings from early modern England can also be traced in texts from late imperial China. But ambiguity could work in two ways; by using <b>the</b> cover of <b>ambiguity</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> also risked beeing accused of allusions never intended and thus becoming the victim of an arbitrary and hostile misinterpretation. How did authorities in the Qianlong reign react when faced with texts of a highly ambiguous, or even unintelligible nature; to what extent was the decoding arbitrary? In order to explore this issue, this paper examines a number of legal cases involving the writings of people who were classified as mentally insane by the reporting official, or others involved.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{multiplicity}} of views on integrated reporting and to consider the possibility of, and impediments to, reconciling these multiple rationales (“orders of worth”) and thus gain legitimacy through a compromise. This sheds light on the understanding of integrated reporting as such, as well as shows how legitimacy struggles are resolved in practice around complex accounting practices in heterogeneous environments. Design/methodology/approach – This explorative paper empirically applies Boltanski and The´venot’s sociology of worth (SOW) framework to analyse integrated reporting in the Dutch reporting field. Data were collected using multiple methods, including 64 semi-structured in-depth interviews with a wide range of relevant actors, and documentary analysis. Data were coded for the presence of orders of worth and legitimating compromise mechanisms. Findings – <b>The</b> <b>author’s</b> analysis suggests that integrated reporting combines the disparate domains of industrial, market, civic and green order of worth. These different logics of valuation need to be reconciled in a compromise in order for integrated reporting to become a legitimate practice. Such a compromise requires a common interest, avoidance of clarification and maintenance of <b>ambiguity.</b> <b>The</b> <b>author’s</b> analysis suggests these mechanisms are violated though, with the risk that integrated reporting gets captured by investors and accountants, leading to local private arrangements rather than durable legitimate compromise. Research limitations/implications – First, SOW informs the understanding of integrated reporting. It highlights in particular its fragility as fundamentally different rationales need to be reconciled, which is a challenge yet also gives rise to creative frictions. Second, the SOW framework creates the possibility for scholars to look closer at the dynamics of legitimacy and at the possible mechanisms to attain legitimacy in fragmented and heterogeneous environment. Practical implications – The SOW framework offers tools for practitioners, in particular those working within a pluralistic context. The various mechanisms of compromise discussed in this paper provide practical guidelines for how to manage this complexity and gain or maintain legitimacy. Originality/value – This rich empirical study combines a novel theoretical approach (the SOW framework) with an analysis of the relatively unexplored topic of integrated reporting. At the same time it introduces a conceptualisation of legitimacy that highlights communicative and constitutive dialogue and goes beyond fit and compliance...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} epistemological and literary problems surrounding Spanish Baroque {{reflection on the}} concepts of experience and perception, {{two of the most}} crucial and important notions linked to the origins of Western Modernity. Problems of experience and perception were treated by many Spanish philosophers and literary figures, including, Francisco Suárez, Francisco Sánchez, Miguel de Cervantes, Calderón de la Barca, Baltasar Gracián, and Mateo Alemán. My approach focuses on the development of these concepts in the Spanish seventeenth century, as an epistemological alternative to the crystallization of the modern Cartesian philosophical paradigm. I am particularly interested in examining the speculation about the ultimate nature of cognition, experience, and perception. I read different textual manifestations of seventeenth century Spanish Baroque thought as an alternate cognitive paradigm that gives raison d'être to well-known Baroque intellectual qualities of wit, attention, prudence, and discretion, all of which are pragmatically and epistemologically tentative. In this sense, my central hypothesis is that seventeenth century Spanish thinkers and writers avoid the Cartesian crystallization of the relationship between cognition and perception, by making it more unstable and open to heteronomy and <b>ambiguity.</b> <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> that I study struggle to design a broader idea of human experience and knowledge, and show traces of a heterodox, pre-modern philosophical framework. In numerous examples this approach shows itself to be more capable of dealing with a universe {{in a constant state of}} flux, paradoxically typified by both tension and order. At the same time, my dissertation proves that, although heterodox, the Baroque cognitive gaze is never ingenuous. The primary goal of such epistemological theory is not demarcation between true and false (as in the rationalist model) but open examination using cognitive values of juicio (discernment), agudeza (sharpness) and discreción (discretion). The Baroque's epistemological aim is not the ultimate -and typically modern- elimination of uncertainty, but the exploration of a different relationship between appearance and being conducted through an original revalidation of the notion of human experience...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this BA thesis is to {{evaluate}} curricula of the Bachelor’s and MA studies {{in the department of}} Journalism, University of Tartu. For this purpose two methodological approaches were applied. First, original questionnaires were composed in which academic staff of the department and undergraduate students were asked to evaluate how the curricula of the department correspond to the standards set by Tartu Declaration of EJTA (European Journalism Training Association). Second, the results of the questionnaires carried out in the department were used, in which students were examined of how the curriculum corresponds to their expectations. According to the results of the original questionnaires, practically focussed subjects were in a better accordance with the EJTA standards than the more theoretical subjects. In general, the opinions of the academic staff and students differed to a limited extent. However, the range of the students opinions was larger when compared to the academic staff, which is most likely related to the differences of students expectations towards every single subject. It may also be concluded from the results that one of the strongest aspects of the curriculum of the department is the a good prospect for students to learn gathering information quickly by using correct approaches. In contrast, one of the major weaknesses of the programme seems to be the lack of opportunities for students to develop their own journalistic style, which in turn, is highly expected by potential employers. The results of the analyses of the questionnaires were ambiguous. In particular, teaching style of lecturers and educational programme were evaluated by students as the most strong parts of the education in one hand, but as most weak aspects of the department in the other hand. Lack of professional experience of students is a likely reason of this <b>ambiguity.</b> <b>The</b> <b>author</b> hopes that <b>the</b> results and conclusions of this thesis have a practical value in improving educational programme of the department and thanks all persons who contributed to this thesis...|$|R

New scholarship is introduced in three key areas: curriculum: the nature and purpose of the creative curriculum and the concept of a ‘sticky curriculum’ that is actively shaped by lecturers, technicians and students; <b>ambiguity,</b> which <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> claim {{is at the heart of}} a creative education; value, asking what and whose ideas, practices and approaches are given value and create value within the curriculum. These insights from the perspective of a creative university subject area also offer new ways of viewing other disciplines, and provide a response to a growing educational interest in cross-curricular creativity. This book offers a coherent theory of art and design teaching and learning that will be of great interest to those working in and studying higher education practice and policy, as well as academics and researchers interested in creative education...|$|R
40|$|The Scarlet Letter (1850), Nathaniel Hawthorne's {{representative}} work, is an allegorical romance, {{which is}} rather {{pure and simple}} in the literary form with its allegoncal figures and the persisting unity of imagery. But {{the meaning of the}} work is rather complicated and profound, and the final theme is ambiguous. <b>The</b> <b>ambiguity</b> comes from <b>the</b> <b>author's</b> ambivalent feeling toward puritanism of seventeenth century's New England and romantic tendencies of his own age. As a whole, The Scarlet Letter is a work deeply colored by the Puritanic pessimism about the dark side of human existence-that is original sin. But we, readers of the twentieth century, who appreciate the heroine as "a new woman" and feel deep sympathy with her romantic view of life, find in this book more positive value and more light than <b>the</b> <b>author</b> intended there to be. In this article, I analyze various problems of The Scarlet Letter from the points of view of the principal characters, Hester Prynne, Arthur Dimmesdale, Roger Chillingworth, and Pearl, and show how these problems are connected with one another, and what is <b>the</b> <b>author's</b> attitude toward these problems. After that, I try further to seek the final theme that we can find in this romance of Puritan legend...|$|R
40|$|The 1998 Peace Agreement was a (consociational) form of pluralist {{settlement}} {{designed to}} end conflict in Northern Ireland through giving institutional recognition {{to the rights}} and identities of the ‘two communities’ (nationalist and unionist) in Northern Ireland (with some provision for a third category ‘other’). Critics of the consociational nature of the Agreement have argued that it overstates the extent {{and nature of the}} communal divide in Northern Ireland and has institutionalized division at the heart of governance in the region. Since 1998 Northern Ireland has shifted from being a region of net emigration to net immigration. Critics argue that this has brought greater levels of plurality to the region, but that the institutional framework established under the Agreement is not well equipped to deal with this plurality. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> draw on survey data to explore this issue. It is argued that there is a good basis to the claims made by the critics, but some other factors are identified—chiefly a retreat from politics and <b>the</b> <b>ambiguities</b> of pluralism—that <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> believe also need to be considered in any attempt to understand the place of immigrants and ethnic minorities in a ‘new’ Northern Ireland...|$|R
40|$|Data {{ambiguity}} {{from various}} sources remains as a complex problem that affects services provided by digital libraries. From {{the point of view}} of integration of information from different sources, <b>the</b> challenge of <b>author</b> <b>ambiguity</b> is one of the most important, and there are numerous methods proposed to deal with this issue using different approaches. They generally work for some scenarios but they have important limitations, specially when dealing with heterogeneous sources. In this work, we review a group of existing methods and then propose a technique that combines some of them, also incorporating a measure of distance using semantic technologies to solve <b>the</b> <b>ambiguity</b> of <b>authors</b> while integrating bibliographic data {{from various sources}}. This technique has been successfully tested in disambiguating Ecuadorian authors from both internal sources (institutional repositories) and external digital libraries...|$|R
