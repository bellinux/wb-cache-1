5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space,</b> allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|With the Red House {{batteries}} out of action, Smyth immediately {{pressed on}} with his invasion plans. However, attempts to embark his 3,000 men ended in chaos; with only 1,200 men managing to board because of a shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> on board. Amid torrential rain and freezing cold, a council of war headed by Smyth decided to postpone the invasion pending more thorough preparations that would enable the embarkation of whole force.|$|E

5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance {{standing in front of}} a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E
5|$|One World Trade Center is principally {{owned by}} the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Around 5percent equity of the {{building}} was sold to the Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for an investment of at least $100million. The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations. By September 2012, around 55percent of the building's floor space had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> leased had gone up to 62.8percent by November 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a docile {{breed of}} dog and {{is fond of}} playing with {{children}} and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However {{it can also be}} used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required. The dog is content with a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> and could suit life in the city, but also loves open spaces.|$|E

50|$|The {{playing field}} is divided into a grid, with the player having an {{overhead}} perspective of the map. Units are able to move a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> in the four cardinal directions, with how far they can go affected by several variables, including the unit's natural movement abilities and terrain. Each unit type is given a specific <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> that it can move, with some having better movement capabilities than others. There {{are a variety of}} terrain types, such as roads, forests and grass. Roads are best for movement, while some terrains slow the player down but can provide other advantages, such as extra range or defense.|$|R

5|$|The large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> {{in rural}} cemeteries permits {{the use of}} {{sculpture}} {{in a way that}} the crowded churchyard has never allowed. Many rural cemeteries, including Oakwood, subsequently became virtual outdoor sculpture museums, displaying the works of well-known contemporary sculptors as memorials to the deceased. Oakwood is home to thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea. Because of its popularity as a public park, many memorials included benches to invite visitors to rest while investigating the large, hilly property.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used a great <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> within each already-limited ship, Capps {{was forced to}} economize in other ways {{to stay within the}} tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{objectives}} and defeating enemies is rewarded with experience points, {{which are used}} to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters' statistics, such as strength or agility. Weapons, armor, and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items, which are collected throughout the game. The character's inventory is grid-based; objects occupy an allotted <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space,</b> requiring {{the management of the}} storage space available. A belt allows some items to be selected for immediate use during gameplay, such as healing items, without the need to access them in the main inventory. The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character's haven or safehouse; it automatically saves other data at specific points. An update to the game enabled players to save their in-game data at any point in the in-game narrative.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. The city's dead had been buried in and around the local churches. With a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. Despite the rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply, and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely.|$|E
5|$|Shiren the Wanderer is a roguelike game {{in which}} the player {{traverses}} thirty randomly generated grid-based, top-down areas – referred to as floors – in which they fight enemies and find items. The player can move in eight directions, attack with melee weapons and arrows, and use {{a wide range of}} items with different effects: for example, some heal the player, some fling away enemies, and some allow the player to swap positions with an enemy. The items are kept in the player's inventory, which only has a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> For every step the player takes, their health regenerates, but their fullness counter also decreases; because of this, the player needs to carry food items with them, which also take up inventory space. The gameplay is turn-based: every time the player performs an action, such as moving, attacking, or using items, all enemies and characters in the area perform one action as well. In addition to the enemy characters, there are friendly characters, three of which can join the player's party and help them with things such as healing.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{conversion}} of London to Christianity in the early 7thcentury, the city's dead had been buried {{in and around the}} local churches. With a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials, and the remains of the previous occupants transferred to charnel houses for storage. From the 14th century onwards the charnel houses themselves were overwhelmed, and exhumed bones were scattered where they had been dug up or reburied in pits. Despite this practice, by the mid 17thcentury the city was running seriously short of burial space. A proposal by Christopher Wren to use the reconstruction following the 1666 Great Fire of London as an opportunity to cease burials in the churchyards and establish new cemeteries outside the city was approved by the King and Parliament but vetoed by the Corporation of London, and burials continued at the newly rebuilt churches.|$|E

5|$|London's dead had {{traditionally}} been buried {{in and around}} local churches, and with a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. In {{the first half of}} the 19thcentury the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Graveyards became very congested. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E
