5|$|A bone of contention, however, arose {{over the}} Queen's {{inheritance}} and dowry. Duke Rinaldo refused {{to release the}} former, and left the latter £15,000 in arrears. In 1700, five years later, the Duke finally paid the Queen her dowry; her inheritance, however, remained sequestered, and relations with Modena worsened again when Rinaldo allied himself with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. Leopold was <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> Louis XIV, James and Mary's patron.|$|E

Before Andrew was successful, Arnold Hahót, <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> the Kőszegis, invited him to the fort of Štrigova and captured him. Hahót sent Andrew to Vienna, where Albert I, Duke of Austria, held him in captivity.|$|E

5|$|A July 2006 USA Today/Gallup {{poll found}} that 83% of the 1,005 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the 2006 Lebanon War, {{compared}} to 66% who blamed Israel to some degree. Additionally, 76% disapproved of the military action Hezbollah took in Israel, compared to 38% who disapproved of Israel's military action in Lebanon. A poll in August 2006 by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 68% of the 1,002 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the civilian casualties in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War, compared to 31% who blamed Israel to some degree. Another August 2006 poll by CNN showed that 69% of the 1,047 Americans polled believed that Hezbollah is unfriendly towards, or <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of,</b> the United States.|$|E
5|$|Blair {{eventually}} {{decides that}} she wants to be with Chuck, but shuns him once again after he tries to humiliate Dan. She is later courted by a prince from Monaco named Louis. During a private confrontation, a drunken Chuck punches a window after he finds out Prince Louis has proposed to Blair, which cuts Blair's face as it shatters. Afterward, Blair chooses to accept a proposal from Louis. Blair later attempts to warn Chuck about potential trouble in his family. She is then abducted by <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> the Basses, Raina's father Russell Thorpe. Chuck later rescues Blair and apologizes for his violent actions. Following a night out together, the two have sex before Chuck advises Blair to return to Louis, believing that she will be happier with him. However, the season ends with the revelation that Blair may be pregnant.|$|E

5|$|Cristóbal de Olid sailed from Mexico in January 1524, {{stopping}} off in Cuba to collect supplies {{set aside for}} him by Cortés. The governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, was <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> Cortés and persuaded Olid to take Honduras for himself. Olid arrived off northern Honduras in early May, some distance {{to the east of}} Puerto de Caballos. He disembarked with 360 Spaniards and 22 horses, and founded Triunfo de la Cruz, still known by this name, near the modern port of Tela. He claimed the new territory in Cortés' name, but after founding the new town he openly rejected him, {{with the support of the}} majority of his men. He then carried out a campaign of conquest in what is now western Honduras, subjugating the heavily populated towns of Naco and Tencoa, which did little to resist.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, {{following}} the secret {{terms of the}} Treaty of San Ildefonso, the Kingdom of Spain suddenly reversed {{its position in the}} French Revolutionary Wars turning from <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> the French Republic into an ally. The Spanish declaration of war on Great Britain forced the British Mediterranean Fleet to abandon the Mediterranean Sea entirely, retreating to ports at Gibraltar and Lisbon. This force now concentrated against the Spanish Navy, most of which was stationed at the main fleet base of Cádiz in Southern Spain. A British blockade fleet won a significant victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797, dissuading the Spanish fleet from playing {{a significant role in the}} ongoing war.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Rossen {{joined a}} picket line against Warner Bros, making <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> Jack Warner. Rossen signed a {{contract}} with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis, who had previously been Warner Bros.' head of production. However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers in 1946 and Desert Fury in 1947. In The Strange Love of Martha Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself. The relationship between Rossen and Wallis broke down when Rossen received offers from other production companies.|$|E

5|$|In February 1799, Adams {{surprised}} many {{by sending}} diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, {{realizing that the}} conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. At the Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and {{to allow for the}} peaceful transfer of non-military goods to <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> the nation. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements, as Washington had advised in his farewell address. Adams brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the impact}} of the predatory deaths {{resemble}} Henrik Ibsen's play <b>An</b> <b>Enemy</b> <b>of</b> the People, with the mayor of a small town panicking over how a problem will drive away the tourists. Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; Quint even dies the same way as Captain Ahab. The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an authority figure who is forced to provide guidance to those affected by the sudden tragedy. Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.|$|E
5|$|Larkin was {{a notable}} critic of modernism in {{contemporary}} art and literature. His scepticism {{is at its}} most nuanced and illuminating in Required Writing, a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical {{in his introduction to}} his collected jazz reviews, All What Jazz, drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for The Daily Telegraph between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts. Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> modernism, recent critical assessments of Larkin's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Later volumes {{were also}} praised; Otaku USAs Joseph Luster {{appreciated}} the series' battles and Allen's development. The revelation that Allen would be <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> the Order and the 14th Noah was well received by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock and Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post. However, Goodman criticized early-volume reliance on comedy rather than plot. Beveridge and Erkael of Manga News {{were impressed with}} Kanda's dark past. Douresseaux liked Allen's situation in volume 21 (due to the character's connections with the Noah), and wanted {{to see more of}} that and less of Kanda's fight with Alma Karma.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{using the}} Green Goblin alias is as {{commonly}} described as Spider-Man's archenemy. Mostly after {{he is the}} first villain to uncover the hero's true identity, being responsible for setting up the death of Spider-Man's girlfriend {{in one of the most}} famous Spider-Man stories of all time which helped end the Silver Age of Comic Books and begin the Bronze Age of Comic Books. He was thought to be dead after that but writers help bring him back from the 1990s and he returned to plague Spider-Man once more in the comic books (such as being involved of the killing of Aunt May) and other heroes (such as the Avengers). He is also <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> Spider-Man sometimes just as himself and not just only as his Goblin persona.|$|E
5|$|Preneuse {{separated}} in March 1798, carrying messages {{of support and}} 86 military volunteers for the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>of</b> the British in Southern India who sought to form an alliance with France. Lhermitte's instructions emphasised subtlety in the operation, but on 20 April he attacked the British port of Tellicherry and seized the East Indiaman merchant ships Woodcot and Raymond. This alerted the British to Preneuses mission and although the reinforcements were landed safely at Mangalore on 24 April, diplomatic relations between the British and Mysore collapsed, leading to the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War the following year in which Tipu Sultan was killed and his kingdom absorbed into British India.|$|E
