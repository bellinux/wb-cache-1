5|$|Over {{elevated}} surfaces, heating of {{the ground}} exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains <b>and</b> <b>valleys</b> {{is the most important}} contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills <b>and</b> <b>valleys</b> substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a barrier jet. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.|$|E

It is confirmed that miniband structure and minigaps {{caused by the}} superlattices depend on the spin <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> indices [50]. Furthermore, the spin <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> polarizations could be enhanced by the silicene superlattices [51]. Just like graphene, many novel electronic structures are expected in silicene superlattices. However, works on silicene superlattices are very few [50, 51]. In this paper, we discuss in detail a complementary aspect, namely, the spin- and valley-dependent band structure and transport property of silicene. We found that the spin <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> indices have different impacts on the extra Dirac points and anisotropic velocity which can be tuned by the structural parameters. The velocity is greatly suppressed due to the electric field {{and exchange}} field. A remarkable spin <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> polarization is achieved, which can be greatly enhanced by the disorder.|$|R

The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence.

Stratton-on-the-Fosse and Lydford-on-Fosse, two villages of the Mendips, reflect the arrival of this new road. Much of the high plateau, however, remained uncultivated and unenclosed until the 18th century, resulting in many roads remaining as narrow winding lanes between high banks and hedges or stone walls. Where the tracks had their origins as drovers roads, they typically become open roads with wide verges. The roads tend to follow the line of gorges <b>and</b> <b>valleys,</b> as at Cheddar Gorge.|$|E

5|$|Damage from Diane was {{heaviest}} in Connecticut, where rainfall {{peaked at}} 16.86in (428mm) near Torrington. The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams <b>and</b> <b>valleys</b> were flooded, and 30stream gauges reported their highest levels on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached a water level of 30.6ft (9.3m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown Winsted, {{much of which}} was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the 1938 Long Island hurricane, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184people and destroyed 813houses, with another 14,000homes heavily damaged. Monetary losses totaled $754.7million, although the inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1billion. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was retired.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, barring {{intermittent}} passes <b>and</b> <b>valleys</b> (the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass), the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian steppe by the Yin Mountains. However, if this defence were breached, China's flat terrain offered no protection {{to the cities}} on the plain, including the imperial capitals of Beijing, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. Heading west along the Yin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Looptechnically part of the steppe, but capable of irrigated agriculture. Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north, such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the steppe, {{but also for the}} security of China proper. The region's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here.|$|E
