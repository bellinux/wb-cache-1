50|$|When {{the brakes}} are <b>applied,</b> <b>brake</b> fluid is forced under {{pressure}} from the master cylinder into the wheel cylinder, which in turn pushes the brake shoes into contact with the machined surface {{on the inside of the}} drum. This rubbing action reduces the rotation of the brake drum, which is coupled to the wheel. Hence the speed of the vehicle is reduced. When the pressure is released, return springs pull the shoes back to their rest position.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{models with}} two front discs use a dual CBS System. The system was first {{installed}} in a Honda CBR1000F in 1993. Here, <b>applied</b> <b>brake</b> pressure at the front is also applied to the rear wheel and vice versa. If the front lever is applied, pressure is built up at 4 of the 6 pots in the 2 calipers at the front. A secondary master cylinder at the front wheel distributes remaining pressure to the rear wheel through a proportional control valve and acts on 2 of the 3 calipers. If strong brake force is applied at the rear wheel force is also distributed to 2 of the 6 pots of the front wheel. More modern dual CBS use front and rear calipers (and all pots) according to a preset load ratio of front to rear.|$|E

For {{the sake of}} applications of proposed Signal HIL model, electronic control unit (ECU) design scheme, for instance, the controller is developed on basis of a hardware platform, such as DSP, FPGA or MCU. Beside processing measurement signals of state variables as mentioned above, these platforms must reserve inputs for driving system (accelerator and brake pedal positions, steering angle). The estimation or control algorithm will be implemented and applied a set of control value to the outputs of the platform, i.e. drive motor’s torque command, <b>applied</b> <b>brake</b> torque or steering angle. This control set will then {{be sent to the}} HIL model through the interface system. When running the whole control system, it can be seen that, both signal HIL model and driving system are implemented in real-time and obviously, the controller will be tested in real-time. This can evaluate the accuracy and performance of control/estimation algorithm as well as stability of hardware design since the test can be repeated and expanded as needed. Furthermore, by utilizing ability of simulating critical situations, this HIL solution can assess the controller in different modes, especially in fault operation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a research {{devoted to the}} study of instability phenomena in non-linear model with a constant brake friction coefficient. This paper outlines the stability analysis and a procedure to reduce and simplify the non-linear system, in order to obtain limit cycle amplitudes. The center manifold approach, the multivariable approximants theory, and the alternate frequency/time domain (AFT) method are <b>applied.</b> <b>Brake</b> vibrations, and more specifically heavy trucks grabbing are concerned. The modelling introduces sprag-slip mechanism based on dynamic coupling due to buttressing. The non-linearity is expressed as a polynomial with quadratic and cubic terms. This model does not require the use of brake negative coefficient, in order to predict the instability phenomena. Finally, the center manifold approach, the multivariable approximants, and the AFT method are used in order to obtain equations for the limit cycle amplitudes. These methods allow the reduction of the number of equations of the original system in order to obtain a simplified system, without loosing the dynamics of the original system, as well as the contributions of non-linear terms. The goal is the validation of this procedure for a complex non-linear model by comparing results obtained by solving the full system and by using these methods. The brake friction coefficient is used as an unfolding parameter of the fundamental Hopf bifurcation point...|$|E
40|$|Design of {{the brake}} disc {{geometry}} {{for a given}} brake disc material {{provides an opportunity for}} improvement in the fatigue life of the brake disc. High thermomechanical loads at braking lead to substantial local plastification and also induce tensile residual stresses in certain areas of the brake disc. This contributes to shortening of the fatigue life of the brake disc by possible initiation and growth of cracks. In the present paper, a simulation approach for evaluation of brake disc designs with respect to thermomechanical performance is developed and <b>applied.</b> <b>Brake</b> disc performance is analysed using commercial finite element software by employing a constitutive model for grey cast iron implemented in a Fortran subroutine. The thermal loading consists of consecutive severe braking cycles at a constant brake power and a constant speed, with cooling between the brake cycles. Based on a previous experimental study, three different assumptions are made regarding the spatial distribution of the thermal load at braking. A standard commercial brake disc made from grey cast iron having straight vanes is used as the reference case. Geometrical modifications are introduced in the ventilation arrangement using a design-of-experiments approach, studying both straight cooling vanes and different pillar layouts. A preliminary assessment of the fatigue life of the brake discs is carried out. The results indicate that the introduction of different pillar arrangements instead of straight vanes make it possible to decrease the mass of the brake disc by up to 13 % or to increase the fatigue life of the brake disc by about 50 %...|$|E

This {{system was}} similar to the simple vacuum system, except that the creation of vacuum in the train pipe exhausted vacuum reservoirs on every vehicle and released the brakes.
