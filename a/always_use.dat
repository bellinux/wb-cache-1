5|$|The type of pastry used is not defined, {{as long as}} it {{is golden}} in colour and will not crack during the cooking or cooling, {{although}} modern pasties almost <b>always</b> <b>use</b> a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough to withstand a drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian {{membership in the}} European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others were {{not in favor of}} this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could <b>always</b> <b>use</b> a veto against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.|$|E

25|$|As it {{was said}} before, in its most {{traditional}} form the coladeira follows a cycle of fifths. This characteristic is a direct heritage from the morna (check main article — morna). Even so, many composers (especially more recent ones) do not <b>always</b> <b>use</b> this structure.|$|E

25|$|Binaural {{recordings}} use {{a different}} microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2kHz, often using a dummy head, and can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost <b>always</b> <b>use</b> stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening has been more popular than headphone listening.|$|E

25|$|In {{its most}} {{traditional}} form, the song starts by an introduction {{played in the}} soloist instrument (having this intro generally the same melody as the refrain), and then the song develops in an alternation between the main strophes and the refrain. Approximately after {{the middle of the}} song, instead of the sung refrain, the soloist instrument performs an improvisation. Recent composers, however, do not <b>always</b> <b>use</b> this sequence.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prev-alence of risk behaviors, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in clients of female sex workers, and to compare them with men selected from the general population. Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of men re-cruited from commercial sex venues in Lima, Peru from January to February 2002. Subjects answered a survey and provided a urine sample. Results: Men reported that in the recently concluded commercial sex encounter, 95. 8 % used condoms, and 85. 8 % <b>always</b> <b>used</b> condoms with female sex workers. Only 16 % reported <b>always</b> <b>using</b> condoms with their stable partners; 50. 8 % <b>always</b> <b>used</b> condoms with casual, noncommercial partners; and 59. 6 % <b>always</b> <b>used</b> condoms for homo-sexual anal sex. There were 8 (2 %) cases of chlamydia and no cases of gonorrhea...|$|R

25|$|Because {{the problem}} of testing whether a graph is class 1 is NP-complete, there is no known {{polynomial}} time algorithm for edge-coloring every graph with an optimal number of colors. Nevertheless, a number of algorithms have been developed that relax {{one or more of}} these criteria: they only work on a subset of graphs, or they do not <b>always</b> <b>use</b> an optimal number of colors, or they do not always run in polynomial time.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, Buber {{wrote his}} famous essay on existence, Ich und Du (later {{translated}} into English as I and Thou). Though he edited the work {{later in his}} life, he refused to make substantial changes. In 1925, he began, in conjunction with Franz Rosenzweig, translating the Hebrew Bible into German. He himself called this translation Verdeutschung ("Germanification"), since it does not <b>always</b> <b>use</b> literary German language, but instead attempts to find new dynamic (often newly invented) equivalent phrasing to respect the multivalent Hebrew original. Between 1926 and 1930, Buber co-edited the quarterly Die Kreatur ("The Creature").|$|E
25|$|Rats only {{require an}} ounce (28 grams) {{of food and}} water a day to live. Rats {{primarily}} find food and shelter at human habitations and therefore interact with humans in various ways. In particular, the city's rats adapt to practices and habits among New Yorkers for disposing of food waste. Curbside overnight garbage disposal from residences, stores, subway and restaurants, as well as littering, contribute to the sustenance of the city's rats. Rats almost <b>always</b> <b>use</b> the same routes to their food sources. Rat infestations have increased as a result of budget reductions and more wasteful disposal of food.|$|E
25|$|Medium-voltage circuit {{breakers}} rated between 1 and 72 kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break {{circuit breakers}} replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly <b>always</b> <b>use</b> separate current sensors and protective relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.|$|E

25|$|Typefaces with serifs {{are often}} {{considered}} easier {{to read in}} long passages than those without. Studies on the matter are ambiguous, suggesting that most of this effect {{is due to the}} greater familiarity of serif typefaces. As a general rule, printed works such as newspapers and books almost <b>always</b> <b>use</b> serif typefaces, at least for the text body. Web sites do not have to specify a font and can simply respect the browser settings of the user. But of those web sites that do specify a font, most use modern sans serif fonts, because it is commonly believed that, in contrast to the case for printed material, sans serif fonts are easier than serif fonts to read on the low-resolution computer screen.|$|E
25|$|Archaeopteryx has {{historically}} been considered the first bird, or Urvogel. Although newer fossil discoveries filled the gap between theropods and Archaeopteryx, {{as well as the}} gap between Archaeopteryx and modern birds, phylogenetic taxonomists, in keeping with tradition, almost <b>always</b> <b>use</b> Archaeopteryx as a specifier to help define Aves. Aves has more rarely been defined as a crown group consisting only of modern birds. Nearly all palaeontologists regard birds as coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs. Within Coelurosauria, multiple cladistic analyses have found support for a clade named Maniraptora, consisting of therizinosauroids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. Of these, dromaeosaurids and troodontids are usually united in the clade Deinonychosauria, which is a sister group to birds (together forming the node-clade Eumaniraptora) within the stem-clade Paraves.|$|E

Though Hagiwara was a fan of watching sumo from a young age, {{he was on his}} schools' baseball teams as a pitcher in primary and junior high school. He eventually gave up when he realized he was only excelling because of his size. On a chance meeting with then head of Naruto stable, the former yokozuna Takanosato, the head of the stable convinced Hagiwara's initially skeptical parents that he was a great candidate for sumo. Hagiwara eventually joined the stable upon finishing junior high school. The stable was known for its strict environment and Naruto Oyakata would encourage him to <b>always</b> <b>use</b> forward-moving techniques in training to better prepare him for tournament situations, rather than go for a quick win by stepping backwards.|$|E
