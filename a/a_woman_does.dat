To Trollope, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E

25|$|While {{the rate}} of {{domestic}} violence among immigrant groups does not differ {{from that of the}} general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations. Even when <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it difficult for her to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.|$|E

The song is {{composed}} in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range spans over an octave, from F3 to E5. The song has a basic sequence of A5–Fm7–Cm–E as its chord progression.

[...] In Canadian heraldry, by contrast, women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers (if any). [...] Women in Canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs, regardless of gender. This system of equality {{for men and women}} is a result of provisions in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantee, among other things, freedom from discrimination under the law on the basis of sex.|$|E

Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, [...] "taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison", implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational [...] "companions" [...] of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: [...] "women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses.

In October 2014, Nick Lowe announced at New York Comic Con 2014 that the character would be getting its own ongoing series after much demand. The first issue of Spider-Gwen experienced commercial success and was the third best-selling comic of February 2015 with sales of over 250,000 copies. The first volume ended after the fifth issue, with the character carrying over into the second volume of Spider-Verse as part of the Secret Wars event. After the conclusion of the event, a second volume by the same creative team began with the first issue as a part of Marvel's All-New, All-Different Marvel imprint entitled The Radioactive Spider-Gwen. Spider-Gwen was featured as a major character in a multi-part crossover entitled Spider-Women. It commenced with Spider-Women Alpha #1 and ended with Spider-Women Omega #1, with certain issues of Spider-Woman, Silk and Spider-Gwen partially depicting the storyline in between.|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>does.</b> They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

[...] For instance, the rebbetzin may often be the [...] "mikvah lady" [...] and help with more mundane questions regarding the laws of niddah.

2500|$|In Spain, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> {{not change}} her legal {{surnames}} when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother's surname and add her husband's surname to her father's surname using the preposition de ("of"), del ("of the", when the following word is masculine) or de la ("of the", when the following word is feminine). For example, if [...] "Clara Reyes Alba" [...] were to marry [...] "Alberto Gómez Rodríguez", the wife could use [...] "Clara Reyes de Gómez" [...] as her name (or [...] "Clara Reyes Gómez", or, rarely, [...] "Clara Gómez Reyes". She {{can be addressed}} as Sra. de Gómez corresponding to [...] "Mrs Gómez"). In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name.

2500|$|The Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 was a {{subcategory}} of the Hudood Ordinance. Zina is {{the crime}} of non-marital sexual relations and adultery. The Zina Ordinance included zina-bil-jabr, the category of forced intercourse. If the woman who accuses a man of zina-bil-jabr (rape) cannot prove to the judicial system that she was raped, she faces adultery charges. In order for a rapist to receive [...] "hadd," [...] the maximum punishment provided for under the Quran, either the rapist must confess to the rape, or four pious adult Muslim men must witness the [...] "act of penetration" [...] itself and testify against the rapist. Under Qanun-e-Shahadat, a woman's testimony was not weighed equally {{to that of a}} man. Thus, if <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> not have male witnesses but does have female witnesses, their testimony would not satisfy the evidence requirement. The perpetrator may be acquitted and the victim may face adultery charges. The threat of being prosecuted discourages victims from filing complaints.|$|E
2500|$|Divorce {{rates have}} risen in Japan since the 1980s, {{the spread of}} {{feminism}} weakening the stigma that {{is often associated with}} divorce.

[...] Despite this, some women cannot financially afford divorce and there have been several attempts to suppress divorce rates over the years. [...] Women without a steady income are unlikely to gain joint ownership of property and cannot acquire loans for a new home. [...] Women {{are also more likely to}} gain custody of the children, but have a difficult time getting the father to share in the costs of rearing them. [...] Due to the family registration system, it is much harder for divorced women or men to remarry. [...] In these cases, women may choose to avoid divorce for the sakes of their children, despite it being the better option.

2500|$|... 3But I {{want you}} {{to realize that the}} head of every man is Christ, {{and the head of the}} woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 4Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 5But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head {{uncovered}} dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. 6For if <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head. 7 A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 8For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 9 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 10It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. 11Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 12For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. 13Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 15but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 16If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God." ...|$|E
