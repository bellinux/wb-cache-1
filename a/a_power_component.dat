It inherently integrates the structures of a power bipolar transistor and a power MOSFET, and then it has better performance in many applications. Advantages of this device are the high current density, the outstanding breakdown voltage, {{as well as the}} excellent operating frequency and so on. And, it might make up the shortcoming of MOSFETs or BJTs utilized separately. In this paper, a smart IGBT device is developed by using the semiconductor process and device simulation tools. Therefore, a relationship between the depth of drift region, doping concentration, and breakdown voltage in an IGBT will be investigated in this work. Eventually, this device will be with the 200 V breakdown voltage and 20 A on-state driving current capability. Meanwhile, the ESD and latch-up (LU) protection structures will be accomplished in this study...|$|E

Using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the capacitive performance of the OMCs {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on the mesostructure. Specific capacitance values greater than 16 PF cm- 2 were obtained from the OMCs that featured high surface area, while the existence of additional large pores was observed to enhance the specific capacitance. We found that a power density as high as 4. 5 kW kg- 1 at an energy density of 6. 1 Wh kg- 1 can be delivered which can also be continuously charged and discharged for up to 2500 cycles with little variation in capacitance.

40|$|Due to new {{applicative}} domains like embedded systems, {{power electronic}} converters {{are getting more}} and more compact, increasing their power densities and working in extreme environments with higher lifetime requirements in accordance with design to cost optimization. Power components packaging is thus involved in many research considerations such as thermal management, electromagnetic interference reduction and reliability. The thermal characterization of the die assembly is becoming a challenge in a power module due to the inaccessibility of the semiconductor parts in the module. This paper describes an innovative experimental method used to evaluate power chip interconnection solutions {{with the help of a}} transient thermal response of <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>component.</b> The experimental setup is designed to derive the thermal impedance of a power device in the microsecond scale in order to evaluate the thermal behaviour of the physical layers close to the chip. The method is then carried out with power diodes in order to compare the thermal impedance of two power modules having different solder voids repartitions. The results show that this method has a very good sensibility that can be used to compare the quality of the thermal behaviour of different die attaches...|$|E

However, the traditional peer-to-peer live streaming techniques {{have been found to}} perform sub-optimal in wireless networks. Furthermore, the increasing energy consumption in wireless networks due to inefficient communication protocols has resulted in the need to develop greener, more energy efficient communication solutions. Therefore, we present Unwired, an OMNet++ based simulator for the development of mobile peer-to-peer live video streaming techniques.

The rig was composed of three modules, <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>component</b> containing a microturbine, a refrigeration unit consisting of an absorption chiller with gas pipe connection, and a supermarket section containing a display cabinet. This system was supposed to be effectively applied into a supermarket energy control system where cooling, heating and electricity power are simultaneously required and subsequently, valuable test results have been produced. In the mean time, a simulation model for the particular tri-generation system has been established by integrating the component models of the system in accordance with the components' actual flow paths and energy streams. These component models, which include a compressor, recuperator, combustion chamber, gas turbine, electric generator, gas pipes, generator (desorber), rectifier, absorbers, condenser and evaporator etc., were developed based upon the balance of heat and mass. The calculations of heat transfer and phase equilibrium were included in the component models and chemical reaction balances were considered in the model of the combustion chamber. The system model has been validated with the test results and has consequently been used to predict the system performance at different operating and design conditions, such as varied ambient temperature, fuel flow rate and pressure ratio etc. The ultimate results of the performance analysis formulated by the system model can contribute significantly to the optimal component and system designs in various practical applications.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused in {{modelling}} of <b>power</b> system <b>components</b> and their representation in simulations of power systems. The thesis compares different linearization techniques. These techniques are both numerical {{as well as}} analytical and are utilized when linearization of a dynamic system is desired. After a linearization {{it is possible to}} calculate the eigenvalues of the linearized system as well as to perform other applicable activities on a linear system. In the thesis it is shown how the linearization techniques influence the calculation of eigenvalues of the linear system. In the thesis bandwidth-reduced linear models of <b>a</b> <b>power</b> system <b>component</b> are developed using two techniques. The simulations with the linear models are done with an introduced interface system. The studied <b>power</b> system <b>component</b> is <b>a</b> Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC). One advantage with using a linear representation of <b>a</b> <b>power</b> system <b>component</b> is that it simplifies the simulations. The size of the complexity of a simulation when solving the equations decreases and the consumed physical time to simulate becomes shorter. A disadvantage of a linear model is that its validity might be limited. The need of building linear models of power systems will continue to attract interest in the future. With the horizon of today (year 2006) there is a need of among other models to build linear models of detailed models of High Voltage Direct Current-links (HVDC-links), Static Var Compensators (SVCs), as well as Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor...|$|R
