50|$|Air {{curtains}} {{are also}} used to control the release of smoke particulates into the environment. After a natural disaster, or during brush clearing activities, debris is disposed of by incineration in either a ceramic or earth pit containment. Just as an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> serves to separate indoor air from outdoor air as, for instance, in restaurants and walk-in refrigerators, a powerful <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> can defeat the chimney effect of the incineration process to eliminate any smoke from a brush incinerator. The <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> acts as a lid on the process, and forces the smoke back into the fuel bed for a cleaner burn.|$|E
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> may pay {{for itself}} {{in a few years}} by {{reducing}} the load on the building's heating or air conditioning system. Usually, there is a mechanism, such as a door switch, to turn the unit on and off as the door opens and closes, so the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> only operates while the door is open.|$|E

5000|$|The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) defines an {{air door}} as follows: [...] "In its {{simplest}} application, an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is a continuous broad stream of air circulated across a doorway of a conditioned space. It reduces penetration of insects and unconditioned air into a conditioned space by forcing an air stream {{over the entire}} entrance. The air stream layer moves with a velocity and angle such that any air that tries to penetrate the curtain is entrained. <b>Air</b> <b>curtain</b> effectiveness in preventing infiltration through an entrance generally ranges from 60 to 80%".|$|E

50|$|An {{air door}} or <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is a device {{used to prevent}} air or {{contaminants}} from moving from one open space to another. The most common use is a downward-facing blower fan mounted over an entrance to a building, or an opening between two spaces conditioned at different temperatures.|$|E
50|$|A {{pneumatic}} {{barrier is}} a method of containing oil spills. Air bubbling through a perforated pipe causes an upward water flow that slows the spread of oil.

40|$|Every year {{millions}} of people visit the works of art placed in museums, which aren’t the safest place to protect cultural heritages from air pollutants. The use of <b>air</b> <b>curtains</b> may often represent a protection for the cultural heritage without operating on the material of the objects, and without limiting {{the perception of the}} work of art. The aim of this work consists of the characterisation of this device, which is widely used in industry, but not yet frequently adopted in the field of conservation of works of art. As a matter of fact, the employment of <b>air</b> <b>curtains</b> to segregate pollutant diffusion near the sources of fire prevention is actually more and more diffused in industry buildings. Their success is due to the peculiarity to separate zones without fixed barriers which would interfere with people and equipment...|$|R
50|$|Laminar airflow {{is used to}} {{separate}} volumes of air, or prevent airborne contaminants from entering an area. Laminar flow hoods are used to exclude contaminants from sensitive processes in science, electronics and medicine. <b>Air</b> <b>curtains</b> are frequently used in commercial settings to keep heated or refrigerated air from passing through doorways. A laminar flow reactor (LFR) is a reactor that uses laminar flow to study chemical reactions and process mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|Air doors can be {{equipped}} with or without heaters to heat the air. The fan must be powerful enough to generate a jet of air that can reach the floor.

5000|$|The Air Movement and Control Association defines an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> as: [...] "A directionally-controlled airstream, {{moving across}} the entire height and width of an opening, which reduces the {{infiltration}} or transfer of air {{from one side of}} the opening to the other and/or inhibits flying insects, dust or debris from passing through".|$|E
5000|$|Air {{curtains}} consume {{electrical energy}} during their operation, {{but can be}} used for net energy savings by reducing the heat transfer (via mass transfer when air mixes across the threshold) between two spaces. However, a closed and well-sealed physical door is much more effective in reducing energy loss. [...] Both technologies are often utilized in tandem; when the solid door is opened the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> turns on, minimizing air exchange between inside and outside.|$|E
40|$|Every year {{millions}} of people visit works of art in museums around the world. Ironically, the museum visitors who most appreciate the cultural heritage found in museums and galleries are often {{the primary source of}} pollutants to the artwork on display. <b>Air</b> <b>curtains</b> are a promising method for protecting works of art in such situations. They have no harmful impact on the art objects and do not restrict the visibility to the crowd. CFD is a useful tool for the design of <b>air</b> <b>curtains</b> because it gives coherent answers within a timeframe shorter than that needed for lab or field tests. This is one of the principal reasons that CFD is such an advantageous instrument during the design phase of any project. It allows possible solutions to be studied for different initial configurations, geometries, and boundary conditions. As an example, consider the interior space of the Galleria dell’ Accademia in Florence. The principal nave hosts Michelangelo’s David along with other paintings and sculpture, such as the Pieta Palestrina and Prigioni. Two lateral rooms house the work of Florentine painters...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1950s and 60s, {{the term}} [...] "air doctor" [...] {{was first used}} to refer to the {{non-contact}} method of debris blow-off using compressed air.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} an opposing buoyancy force {{on the performance of}} an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> in the doorway which separates a warm indoor environment from the cold exterior. Such an opposing buoyancy force arises for example if a downwards blowing <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is heated. We conducted small-scale experiments using water, salt and sugar solutions as the working fluids. The effectiveness curve of a downwards blowing <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> {{as a function of the}} deflection modulus was measured for situations in which the initial density of the <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> was less than both the indoor and the outdoor fluid density, which corresponds to the case of a heated curtain.

We also discuss the question whether it is more energy efficient to use a heated <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> or an <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> operating at room temperature. Based on our experimental results we conclude that a heated <b>air</b> <b>curtain</b> is likely to be less energy-efficient. Further, we propose a theoretical model to describe the dynamics of the buoyant <b>air</b> <b>curtain.</b> Numerical results obtained from solving this model corroborate our experimental findings.
