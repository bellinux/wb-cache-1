Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
25|$|On {{the death}} of King Charles II of Spain on 18 November 1700, Spain was beset by the dynastic ambitions of other European powers, {{resulting}} in a succession war. The Spanish king's will ruled out <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> sharing and placed Philip, Duke of Anjou, second son of the Grand Dauphin and grand-son of Louis XIV {{at the forefront of}} legitimate contenders for the crown.|$|E
25|$|Daly was {{respectful of}} Protestant rights but opposed formal {{integrated}} education of Roman Catholics and Protestants. This policy was criticised {{by those who}} believed segregated education {{to be one of}} the causes of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, but was seen by the Roman Catholic clergy as important for passing on their faith to future generations. He was utterly orthodox in opposing divorce, contraception, abortion, the ordination of women and <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> dropping clerical celibacy.|$|E

25|$|A second {{language}} reform required the simplification of ideographs because ideographs with fewer strokes {{are easier to}} learn. In 1964 the Committee for Reforming the Chinese Written Language released an official list of 2,238 simplified characters most basic to the language. Simplification made literacy easier, although some people (especially in Hong Kong which is still using traditional Chinese) taught only in simplified characters were {{cut off from the}} wealth of Chinese literature written in traditional characters. <b>Any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> replacing ideographic script with romanized script was soon abandoned, however by government and education leaders.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{limit of}} Patagonia {{has been proposed}} to be Huincul Fault which forms a major discontinuity. The fault truncates various structures including the Pampean orogen. Ages of basement rocks changes abruptly across the fault. There have been discrepancies among geologists {{on the origin of}} the Patagonian landmass. Víctor Ramos has proposed that the Patagonian landmass originated as an allochtonous terrane that separated from Antarctica and docked in South America 250 to 270 Ma in the Permian era. A 2014 study by Robert John Pankhurst and coworkers reject <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a far-travelled Patagonia claiming it is likely of parautochtonous origin (nearby origin).|$|E

25|$|This {{possession}} of the battlefield, and the capture of 21 pieces of cannon, were the only advantages of which the French could boast as the immediate result of so severe a struggle. With these, however, {{it would seem that}} Napoleon was fully satisfied: if he had entertained <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> pursuit, it was now abandoned; he took no measures for watching the movements and prying into the designs of the Prussians: but left his troops resting in their bivouacs, offering no molestation whatever to the Prussians, whilst he in person returned to Fleurus, where he passed the night.|$|E

When working on small pieces for an oven stove in the tent, Yossarian sees his work as arduous and highly unnecessary as the pieces are too small for anything of real concern, yet at the end while using his stove, he realizes the intricate simplicity of improving the stove's performance.

25|$|The Board of Directors of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, {{armed with}} a charter, now had the task of {{surveying}} and building the line. They brought in James Fowle Baldwin, son of Col. Loammi Baldwin, who had engineered the Middlesex Canal, to do the surveying, and charged him with finding a gently sloped path from Lowell to Boston, with few grade crossings and well away from town centers. This latter point ended up being quite inconvenient later on. No one had <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the future possibility of railroads acting as public transportation, or if they did they were not paid any attention by the builders or financiers of the road.|$|E

25|$|Having taken casualties, {{and still}} trying to reorder {{themselves}}, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of}} the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery, dispersing or sabring the gunners. Disorganized and milling about the bottom of the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the counter-charge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once we begin to question {{whether there is a}} common faculty of taste (a sensus communis), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer, domesticity {{was just}} not in his line. He began his innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent astigmatism, has not only mislaid his glasses, but had in addition a fearful headache. He made a pass or two after the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for {{about a quarter of}} an hour, it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it seemed to go on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> length.|$|E

25|$|D'Aspré {{received}} a command {{in the army}} of Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and Karl Mack von Lieberich {{at the beginning of}} the War of the Third Coalition. He led a brigade-sized unit of three and one-half infantry battalions and six cavalry squadrons. When the army of Emperor Napoleon I of France reached the Danube on 6 October, Mack realized that his army was in danger of being cut off from Vienna. At that time, he made the questionable decision to assemble the corps of Franz Jellacic, Franz von Werneck, and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg near Ulm, renouncing <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> retreating south to the Tyrol. On 8 October, he issued orders for his army to concentrate at Günzburg downstream from Ulm. He hoped to put his troops in a position to sever Napoleon's supply line back to France. At this time, Napoleon was only vaguely aware of the Austrian army's position.|$|E
25|$|Lyon {{began their}} Champions League quest at home taking on Fiorentina. Lyon also {{unveiled}} their fluorescent green third kit in this match. As with the Nice match, which occurred {{just four days}} before, this match {{had its share of}} controversy. Following a disappointing first half, with Fiorentina leading 0–2 after two goals from Alberto Gilardino, Lyon came out for the second half with scoring in mind. With Lyon attacking, following a cross into the box, a collision occurred just inside the field of play between Frédéric Piquionne and Fiorentina defender Luciano Zauri, which unexpectedly injured the latter. Following a clearance by the Fiorentina defence, it was expected, by Fiorentina, that the ball would be put out of play with fair play being in mind. However, with Lyon trailing 0–2 and several Lyon players not having <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Zauri being down, they proceeded to attack and eventually a goal was scored by Piquionne. Following this incident, Lyon still trailed 1–2, but in the 86th minute, after earning a free kick, Juninho and Benzema proceeded to display excellent and sly teamwork as Benzema equalised for his side drawing the match 2–2 and giving both clubs one point through one round.|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to New York, Adams met with Maurice Daly, then the [...] "dean of billiards". Daly listened to Adams' story, {{and said that he}} was not aware that any startling shots could be accomplished using only the hands. Daly offered Adams a set of four balls, and sat down to watch Adams. After 12 shots, Daly became greatly interested, often asking Adams to repeat shots. At the end of the performance, Daly told Adams that if he ever entertained <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> entering the billiards field he would give Adams an engagement at his room.|$|E
2500|$|Denison's first {{work was}} to reorganize the Sepoy army after the 1857 rebellion. He opposed {{separate}} armies for Bengal, Madras and Bombay {{and the introduction}} of Indians into the legislative councils in the presidencies and provinces. He condemned <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> self-rule and representation by Indians. He also opposed competition for the civil services and insisted that officers were above all to be [...] "gentlemen".|$|R
500|$|Some American Scouters chafed under Wilson's authoritarian attitude. They {{found the}} course much too restrictive, demanding, and {{altogether}} too [...] "British." [...] They felt the course {{would not work}} in the United States and recommended to the National Council that the program should not be adopted, which was followed. Before further experimentation could be implemented, World War II interrupted <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> men taking time off for Scouting.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} the men were also released; not from <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> mercy, but in order that when they {{returned}} to their homes the work of picking out the better class for execution could be the more easily carried on. For three days longer the girls remained in their hiding, and were then allowed to come out, as Ned felt now that the danger of general massacre was averted.|$|R
500|$|Despite the {{grandeur}} of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5October that [...] "I feel so lonely, {{it is impossible for}} me to be happy" [...] and complaining of [...] "the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth" [...] which he considered [...] "such as no Englishman can have <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of,</b> who has not witnessed it". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26October 1816. In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.|$|E
500|$|Boydell {{realised}} {{early in}} his career that his engravings had little artistic merit, saying later that they were collected by others [...] "more to show the improvement of art in this country , since the period of their publication, than from <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> their own merits". This may explain why in 1751, when he {{became a member of the}} Stationers' Company, he started buying other artists' plates and publishing them in addition to his own. Ordinarily an engraver, such as William Hogarth, had his own shop or took his finished engravings to a publisher. In adopting the dual role of artist and print dealer, Boydell altered the traditional organisation of print shops. He was not subject to the whims of public taste: if his engraves did not sell well, he could supplement his earnings by trading in the prints of other artists. He also understood the concerns of both the engraver and the publisher. In fact, as a publisher, he did much to help raise the level of respect for engravers in addition to furnishing them with better paying commissions.|$|E
500|$|Chilembwe's aims {{have also}} come under scrutiny. According to Robert I. Rotberg, Chilembwe's speech of 23 January {{appeared}} {{to stress the}} importance and inevitability of martyrdom as a principal motivation. The same speech depicted the uprising {{as a manifestation of}} desperation but because of his desire to [...] "strike a blow and die", he did not have <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what he would replace colonialism with if the revolt succeeded. Rotberg concludes that Chilembwe planned to seize power in the Shire Highlands or perhaps in all of Nyasaland. John McCracken attacks the idea that the revolt could be considered nationalist, arguing that Chilembwe's ideology was instead fundamentally utopian and created in opposition to localised abuses of the colonial system, particularly thangata. According to McCracken, the uprising failed because Chilembwe was over-reliant on a small Europeanised petite bourgeoisie and did not gain enough mass support. Rotberg's examination the Chilembwe revolt from a psychoanalytical perspective concludes that Chilembwe's personal situation, his psychosomatic asthma and financial debt may have been contributory factors in his decision to plot the rebellion.|$|E
