5|$|At {{the eastern}} edge of the village center, NY31 and NY370 split, with NY31 {{retaining}} the Genesee Street name <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> northeast towards Oneida Lake. NY370, meanwhile, travels southeast on Salina Street, loosely paralleling the Erie Canal as it heads toward Syracuse. The route intersects NY631 before leaving Baldwinsville <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> into another rural section of Lysander. This open stretch ends at the canalside hamlet of Cold Springs, which serves as the beginning of the Syracuse suburbs. After passing through the community, NY370 crosses over the conjoined Erie Canal and Seneca River and enters the town of Salina. Not far from the canal is a junction with John Glenn Boulevard, a four-lane arterial connecting NY370 to Interstate690 (I-690).|$|E
5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – {{the difference between}} the expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by Doppler shifts as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine the aircraft's speed <b>and</b> <b>heading,</b> but multiple combinations of speed <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> can be valid solutions.|$|E
5|$|Data error {{optimisation}} – Candidate paths varied speed <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> at each handshake to minimise {{the error}} between the calculated BFO of that path versus the actual BFO recorded from Flight 370. These paths were not {{constrained by the}} behaviour of the aircraft's autopilot.|$|E

5|$|By {{combining}} {{the distance between}} the aircraft and satellite, speed, <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> with aircraft performance constraints (e.g. fuel consumption, possible speeds and altitudes), investigators generated candidate paths that were analysed separately by two methods. The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes (two are further affected by whether the navigation system used magnetic north or true north as a reference), calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes, and compared them with the values recorded from Flight 370. The second method generated paths which had the aircraft's speed <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path and the values recorded from Flight 370. A probability distribution for each method at the BTO arc of the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared; 80 percent of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO arc of the sixth handshake between 32.5°S and 38.1°S, which can be extrapolated to 33.5°S and 38.3°S along the BTO arc of the seventh handshake.|$|E
5|$|Colchester {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since pre-Roman Britain, but the ancient route to Ipswich followed a different path, leaving Duncan's Gate <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> east of Castle Park and crossing the River Colne, thereby heading northeast {{to meet the}} current road.

5|$|Plans for freeways in Los Angeles County {{evolved from}} a 1937 Automobile Club of Southern California plan, which was {{modified}} by the city's Transportation Engineering Board (TEB) in 1939. The former included a single freeway connecting Los Angeles to Long Beach, beginning at Pasadena <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> south-southwest to Lynwood, then paralleling Long Beach Boulevard to Long Beach. The TEB's plan shifted this route farther east to near the present Long Beach Freeway, while keeping the route near Long Beach Boulevard as a second freeway leaving the Ramona Parkway (San Bernardino Freeway) east of downtown <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> south near Alameda Street and Long Beach Boulevard to Long Beach. This second freeway {{came to be known}} as the Long Beach Parkway or Alamitos Parkway, and connected in north Long Beach with a Terminal Island Freeway southwest to Terminal Island. Because the Long Beach Naval Shipyard was located on the island, the U.S. Navy paid for the construction of the $14 million freeway from the island to Willow Street, including the $5.3 million Schuyler Heim Lift Bridge. Construction began in early 1946, and the completed link was dedicated on January 10, 1948, replacing the older Henry Ford Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The term rear wobble {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mode of oscillation in which lean angle (roll) <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° out of phase with steer angle. The rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6.5Hz. Rear wobble is heavily damped and falls off quickly as bike speed increases.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of camouflage, the {{intention}} of dazzle is not to conceal but to {{make it difficult to}} estimate a target's range, speed, <b>and</b> <b>heading.</b> Norman Wilkinson explained in 1919 that he had intended dazzle primarily to mislead the enemy about a ship's course and so to take up a poor firing position.|$|E
5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E

The unsigned I-296 connects I-96 north of downtown Grand Rapids with I-196 in downtown, and is signed as US131.

5|$|I. and III./JG 4 were {{to strike}} Le Culot together. Taking off at 08:20 <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> northwest, they {{comprised}} {{a force of}} 35 Bf 109s (nine from III./JG 4). Two Ju 88G-1s of II./NJG 101 lead as pathfinders. Some of I./JG 4 attacked No. 125 Wing RAF Spitfires at Ophoven airfield. Spitfire losses are unclear. Two P-47s and a B-17 were destroyed. I./JG 4 reported two Bf 109s missing, one damaged and one destroyed. Just a hangar, one P-47 and several vehicles were claimed, and the anti-aircraft battery was silenced. The attack on the Spitfires at Ophoven and the mentioned B-17 and two P-47s {{are not included in}} the total. Another source suggests two Spitfires destroyed and 10 damaged at Ophoven.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the New England states {{adopted a}} region-wide system for route numbering. New England Route 14 was {{initially}} {{designated as a}} northsouth route beginning at White River Junction, through Montpelier, {{to the city of}} Burlington. The route used modern VT 14 to Barre, then US 302 to Montpelier, and US 2 to Burlington. By 1925, an extension into New Hampshire had been designated continuing across the Connecticut River to Lebanon, New Hampshire <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> southeast to Franklin, along modern US 4 to Andover and New Hampshire Route 11 to Franklin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 904, a Byzantine renegade in Abbasid service, Leo of Tripoli, led a major naval {{expedition}} of 54 vessels from the Syrian and Egyptian fleets, whose initial target reportedly was Constantinople itself. The Arab fleet penetrated the Dardanelles and sacked Abydos, as the Byzantine navy under the droungarios Eustathios Argyros was reluctant to confront them. Emperor Leo replaced Argyros with the more energetic Himerios, but Leo of Tripoli forestalled the Byzantines, turning back west <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> for the Empire's second city, Thessalonica, which he sacked after a three-day siege on 31 July 904. The sack of the city brought the Muslim fleet enormous booty and many captives who were taken to be sold as slaves, including the eyewitness John Kaminiates, who wrote the main account of the city's siege and fall.|$|E

5|$|Media {{attention}} was also {{directed at the}} teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week {{leading up to the}} game. In {{the first half of the}} 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech had made him a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams dropped him from contention for the Heisman. Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan appeared to be the biggest offensive threat for Boston College.|$|E
