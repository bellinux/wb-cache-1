40|$|Is {{there an}} effect of aid on {{democracy}} conditional on instability from trade ? This paper reinvestigate the debated effect of aid on democracy with a new specification. We take advantage of previous empirical findings explaining the role of aid in mitigating the adverse effects of external shocks, and argue {{that in the long}} term, aggregate aid flows can potentially dampen the effects of terms-of-trade instability on the quality of democracy. An empirical investigation with data from 70 developing countries (28 of them african countries) over the period 1980 - 2003 (pooled in two twelve-years periods) provides supportive results. Moreover, the data suggest that terms-of-trade instability affects democracy through income instability. These results are robust to alternative specifications and to the use of different measures of <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> and democracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Aid {{potentially}} {{can contribute}} to democratization in several ways: (1) through technical assistance focusing on electoral processes, the strengthening of legislatures and judiciaries as checks on executive power, {{and the promotion of}} civil society organizations, including a free press; (2) through conditionality; and (3) by improving education and increasing per capita incomes, which research shows are conducive to democratization. This study provides a multivariate analysis of the impact of aid on democratization in a large sample of recipient nations over the 1975 - 2000 period. Using two different democracy indexes and two different measures of <b>aid</b> <b>intensity,</b> no evidence is found that aid promotes democracy. This result is robust to alternative model specifications and estimation techniques, including the use of exogenous instruments for aid. Results are similar if the analysis is confined to the post-Cold War period (1990 - 2000), despite the reduced dependence of the U.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the emerging literature and debates on aid, {{within the context}} of expected increases in aid flows to the continent. The trends in ODA flows indicate a reversal in aid flows to the continent since 2000, with subsequent increases in <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> and dependence. Although the more recent literature on aid is doubtful if aid only spurs growth in a in a good policy environment, the aid-institutional debate indicates a clear aid-institutional paradox, especially relating to the macroeconomic effects, the fiscal response, the absorptive capacity and the good governance aid debates. The literature further indicates that aid could serve as a barrier to vulnerable societies. From the donors' perspective, it is evident that quantity of aid does not imply quality and that the ultimate responsibility lies with recipient governments to ensure more efficient absorption of aid.

40|$|This study {{finds that}} on <b>average</b> <b>aid</b> has {{little impact on}} {{economic}} growth, although a robust finding is that aid promotes growth only in a politically stable environment irrespective {{of the quality of}} the country's economic policies. Aid is ineffective in an unstable environment even in the presence of good policies. The results, however, indicate that policy is more effective in promoting growth when supported by increased aid flows rather than aid being more effective in good policy environment. The empirical results also provide some tentative support for the presence of an aid Laffer curve in the politically stable countries. The allocation of aid is found to be influenced by the country size and its state of development, rather than the quality of policy. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} pitfalls of {{averaging}} by exploiting the longitudinal variation in aid to identify sudden and sharp increases in aid flows. Focusing on specific events, we test if aid accelerations correspond to policies and shocks in the recipient country. For a large sample of 145 recipient countries and 33 donors from 1960 - 2007, we find that positive regime changes and wars are significant predictors of aid accelerations. Disaggregating aid flows by donors, we find indicative evidence for competing allocation rules, particularly among European donors. We argue that drivers of aid accelerations differ from drivers of <b>average</b> <b>aid</b> flows - a distinction that can reconcile some of the ambiguous empirical results in the aid literature.

Thus for an <b>average</b> <b>aid</b> recipient country, doubling per capita aid leads to a reduction of about 790 deaths per million live births in a particular year.
