50|$|Both Pikmin and Pikmin 2 {{are part}} of the New Play Control series, a {{selection}} of GameCube video game remakes with additional support for features of the Wii. It was released on December 25, 2008 in Japan, February 6, 2009 in Europe and March 9, 2009 in North America (original version only). New Play Control! Pikmin uses the Wii Remote, and requires the player to point <b>and</b> <b>click</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen to do various tasks instead of manually moving a cursor with a control stick. It was also announced that the game saves day-by-day records of the player's playthrough, allowing the player to restart from any recorded day of his or her choice. In an interview, director Shigefumi Hino stated that besides adding motion controls, they wanted to include the ability to go back to saves they have made in the past, allowing players to replay all 30 days one by one in order to improve.|$|E
50|$|Sound maps {{make use}} of new {{computer}} locative technologies to achieve the similar purpose of preserving the soundscape of specific locales, but differs {{in the way of}} presenting the sound database. Through digital technologies such as mapping software and audio file encoding, the objective of using sound maps is partly that of making a soundscape database available to the public in a comprehensive fashion by uploading each site-specific soundscape onto a digital map as well as making the end product available for public collaboration. Users are able to pull up a map of the city <b>and</b> <b>click</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sound clip icons in order to hear the soundscape for that location. Some sound maps are crowd-sourced and therefore allow the public to record their own soundscapes and upload them onto the digital map provided by the site hosting the sound map. Therefore, the soundscape database is built by the public and made available to the public for use.|$|E
