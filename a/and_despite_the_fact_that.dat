5|$|Alfano {{was accused}} of being {{the man behind the}} murder of rival Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife. The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives on the scene <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge {{in front of the}} capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
25|$|During {{that first}} season the team {{came to be}} known by the {{nickname}} The Purdown Poachers, after the location of their home pitch, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> they only played there for a single season the moniker stuck for some time.|$|R
5000|$|On July 6, 2007, Swedan {{was listed}} as a {{possible}} CIA [...] "Secret Prisoner" [...] by Amnesty International, without giving any reason or evidence, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he remained on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list as of the published date (July 6, 2007).|$|R
50|$|Rocan {{supported}} his friend Reg Alcock {{in the federal}} elections of 2000 <b>and</b> 2004, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Alcock is a Liberal.|$|R
25|$|Provincially, however, it has {{remained}} Liberal. In the 2011 provincial election, the riding stayed Liberal (albeit by a narrow margin) despite the retirement of popular Liberal incumbent Jean Marc Lalonde, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Liberals lost nearly twenty seats across Ontario.|$|E
25|$|Despite Feynman's warnings, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Vaughan {{served on}} safety boards and {{committees}} at NASA, the subsequent press coverage has found {{some evidence that}} NASA's relative disregard for safety might persist to this day. For example, NASA discounted the risk from small foam chunk breakage at launch and assumed {{that the lack of}} damage from prior foam collisions suggested the future risk was low.|$|E
25|$|Having gone totally {{blind in}} 1652, Milton wrote Paradise Lost entirely through {{dictation}} {{with the help}} of amanuenses and friends. He also wrote the epic poem while he was often ill, suffering from gout, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was suffering emotionally after the early death of his second wife, Katherine Woodcock, in 1658, and the death of their infant daughter. Milton remarried five years later in 1663.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2015, Comodo {{applied for}} [...] "Let's Encrypt", [...] "Comodo Let's Encrypt", and [...] "Let's Encrypt with Comodo" [...] {{trademark}}s. These trademark applications were filed {{almost a year}} after the Internet Security Research Group, parent organization of Let's Encrypt, started using the name Let's Encrypt publicly in November 2014, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> Comodo's [...] "intent to use" [...] trademark filings acknowledge that it has never used [...] "Let's Encrypt" [...] as a brand.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Scrooge" [...] {{is used in}} English as a {{word for}} {{a person who is}} misanthropic <b>and</b> tight-fisted <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> Ebenezer Scrooge {{reformed}} later.|$|R
40|$|Acute bowel {{ischemia}} {{represents one}} of the most dramatic abdominal emergencies <b>and,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> it is more and more frequently observed in clinical practice, its mortality rate remains very high. In recent years Computed Tomography (CT) has proved to be a valid diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with acute abdominal syndrome and in the visualization of early signs of bowel ischemia. This paper reviews the aetiological and pathophysiological aspects as well as a broad spectrum of CT findings of this clinical condition...|$|R
25|$|Shusterman also {{engages in}} the {{aesthetic}} criticism of particular genres of popular arts {{and of its}} concrete works, arguing for artistic value of country music and rap. What is worth stressing is that Shusterman was probably the first art philosopher ever to write about rap, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the accuracy of his treatment of this music genre is sometimes questioned, his groundbreaking role in this area cannot be denied and has been appreciated worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The etching {{of metals}} with acid {{was known in}} Europe from at least 1400, but the {{elaborate}} decoration of armour, in Germany anyway, was an art probably imported from Italy {{around the end of}} the 15th century—little earlier than the birth of etching as a printmaking technique. Although the first extant dated etchings are the three by Albrecht Dürer of 1515, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> none of his works are dated, stylistic evidence suggests that Daniel Hopfer was using this technology as early as 1500.|$|E
25|$|After the {{enactment}} of the Civil Marriage Act, CIC adopted an interim immigration policy which did not recognize same-sex marriages which took place outside Canada. For example, a Canadian citizen, legally married in the Netherlands to his or her same-sex Dutch partner, might not sponsor his or her Dutch partner for immigration as a spouse, despite the fact that both Dutch law and Canadian law made no distinction between opposite-sex and same-sex civil marriages, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> CIC did recognize a Dutch opposite-sex marriage.|$|E
50|$|Viki Davidson and Charlie Banks tie {{the knot}} {{in a double}} {{ceremony}} with Clint <b>and</b> Nora, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Nora is really in love with Bo. Dorian Lord and Blair Cramer crash the nuptials in a drunken fit.|$|R
25|$|Proteins are {{frequently}} described as consisting of several structural units. These units include domains, motifs, <b>and</b> folds. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that there are}} about 100,000 different proteins expressed in eukaryotic systems, there are many fewer different domains, structural motifs and folds.|$|R
2500|$|The Lemon Curds – The law {{enforcement}} responsible for stopping the Jams' revolts. Their motto is [...] "to protect <b>and</b> serve", <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that it is}} [...] "not very catchy" [...] and (their words) [...] "prefer the scout one".|$|R
25|$|Regarding the euro, some {{confusion}} regarding the obverse and reverse {{of the euro}} coins exists. Officially, as agreed by the informal Economic and Finance Ministers Council of Verona in April 1996, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{a number of countries}} have a different design for each coin, the distinctive national side for the circulation coins is the obverse and the common European side (which includes the coin value) is the reverse. This rule does not apply to the collector coins as they don't have a common side.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, Iranian {{authorities}} hanged Makwan Mouludzadeh in Kermanshah {{prison for}} crimes he {{is alleged to}} have committed when he was 13 years of age. According to Human Rights Watch, this was despite the fact that his accusers had recanted their statements and Mouladzadeh had repudiated his confession as being coerced by the police, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the head of Iran’s judiciary, Ayatollah Shahrudi, had ordered a unit of the Judiciary to investigate the case and refer it back to the Penal Court of Kermanshah, before any final decision on an execution.|$|E
25|$|Five {{juvenile}} males—four {{black and}} one of Hispanic descent—were tried variously for assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and attempted murder. Based solely on confessions that they said were coerced and false, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> DNA tests on the rape kit excluded them as the source, they were convicted in 1990 by juries in two separate trials. Known as the Central Park Five, they received sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years. Four of the convictions were appealed and the convictions were affirmed by appellate courts. The defendants spent between 6 and 13 years in prison.|$|E
50|$|Back in London Williams felt {{underemployed}} <b>and</b> despondent. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he {{had witnessed}} first-hand two wars, three civil wars and revolutions, and was applauded {{as one of the}} great journalists of his age, he now found himself jobless.|$|R
50|$|Across the country, militants {{attacked}} churches, convents, and monasteries, killing {{priests and}} looking for arms, since the conspiracy theory maintained that the religious had guns, <b>and</b> this <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that not a single serviceable weapon was located in the raids.|$|R
50|$|The city of Iğdır {{is located}} between Kars <b>and</b> Ağrı. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that it has}} three {{strategically}} important neighbours, the border gate to Armenia is closed {{and there is no}} direct access to Iran, therefore this situation diminishes economic possibilities.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{recording}} contracts Blackwell was handing out, {{he also wanted}} to make a go-go film and soundtrack; a D.C.-based version of The Harder They Come, perhaps. The resultant film, Good to Go (or Short Fuse, as it was called on video) was plagued with problems: co-director Don Letts was let go halfway through production, the film became less about the music and more about drugs and violence, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most of the post-production was completed in the fall of 1985, the film was held for release until late-summer 1986. When it did poorly on release, it seemed that go-go had missed its best chance to break into the mainstream.|$|E
25|$|At the Mayor's office, Henry {{breaks in}} to get the maps as Robin stands guard. Instead of finding the map, Henry sees Cruella, who {{explains}} to him that because {{he is now the}} Author, he can bring her back to life, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he broke the Quill, it’s still alive in the Underworld as it has unfinished business to write people's stories. She tells Henry if he helps her escape the Underworld, it will be as if she never died, and therefore, Emma’s soul will be pure again. Unfortunately when Robin asks Henry if he found the map as they leave the office, Henry lies to Robin that he didn’t find anything or anyone.|$|E
25|$|When {{the affair}} was discovered, those {{involved}} (except de La Motte and Réaux de Villette, who both managed to flee) were arrested, tried, convicted, and either imprisoned or exiled. The only one imprisoned was Mme de La Motte, who {{was given a}} life sentence to Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, which {{also served as a}} prison for women. Judged by the Parlement, Rohan was found innocent of any wrongdoing and allowed to leave the Bastille. Marie Antoinette, who had insisted on the arrest of the Cardinal, was dealt a heavy personal blow, as was the monarchy, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the guilty parties were tried and convicted, the affair proved to be extremely damaging to her reputation, which never recovered from it.|$|E

25|$|In both daytime and at nightfall, the South Beach {{section of}} Miami Beach {{is a major}} {{entertainment}} destination with hundreds of nightclubs, restaurants, boutiques and hotels. The area is popular with tourists from Canada, Europe, Israel and the entire Western Hemisphere, with some having permanent or second homes. South Beach has also been visited by many American and foreign tourists {{by the fact that}} the practice of topless sunbathing by women on the beach and in a few hotel pools on Miami Beach has been considered by the local citizens as being more permissible than on most beaches of the United States, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the practice has not been officially legalized by the local government, it continues to be adopted in large scale.|$|E
25|$|Grahame was {{nominated}} for eviction four times during her initial stay in the Big Brother house and was eventually evicted on Day 58, with 37.2% of the public vote. However, less than four weeks after her exit, she was voted back into the 'House Next Door' by 63% of the voting public, along with three other ex-housemates. She was then chosen {{to return to the}} main house by the surviving contestants <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she had already been evicted, she was reinstated as an eligible housemate and was once again given the opportunity to receive the £100,000 prize handed out to the winner; a controversial move that prompted 2,700 viewers to complain to the premium rate phone watchdog, ICSTIS.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, the Sovereign Grand Commander Charles Riandey {{along with}} 400 to 500 members left the {{jurisdiction}} of the Supreme Council of France and joined the Grande Loge Nationale Française, considering that thanks to his resignation <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Supreme Council of France had continued to work without him, there was no longer a Supreme Council of France. Riandey then reinitiated the 33 degrees of the rite in Amsterdam; {{with the support of the}} Supreme Council of the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States, he founded a new Supreme Council, called the Suprême Conseil pour la France, the sole to be recognized by the Supreme Councils of the United States after it was designated as the sole authority of the Scottish Rite for France by the Supreme Council of the Southern Jurisdiction (the oldest Supreme Council in the world) at the Barranquilla conference in 1970.|$|E
