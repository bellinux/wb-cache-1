5000|$|The {{value of}} goods, accordingly, is a {{phenomenon}} that springs from the same source as the economic character of goods—that is, from the relationship, explained earlier, between the requirements for and the <b>available</b> <b>quantities</b> of goods. But {{there is a difference}} between the two phenomena. On the one hand, perception of this quantitative relationship stimulates our provident activity, thus causing goods, subject to this relationship, to become objects of our economizing (i.e. economic goods). On the other hand, perception of the same relationship makes us aware of the significance that thecommand of each concrete unit of the <b>available</b> <b>quantities</b> of these goods has, for our lives and well-being, thus causing it to attain value for us. Just as a penetrating investigation of mental processes makes the cognition of external things appear to be merely our consciousness of the impressions made by the external things upon our persons, and thus, in the final analysis, merely the cognition of states of our own persons, so too, in the final analysis, is the importance that we attribute to things of the external world only an outflow of the importance to us of our continued existence and development (life and well-being). Value is, therefore, nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, but merely the importance that we first attribute to the satisfaction of our needs, that is, to our lives and well-being, and in consequence carry over to economic goods as the exclusive causes of the satisfaction of our needs.

40|$|The {{area of the}} Western Route Project for South-to-North Water Transfer (WRP) in China, {{located in}} {{the upper reaches of}} the Yangtze River and the {{marginal}} area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has sufficient water resources that transfers could be considered. However potential transfers are limited due to a fragile eco-environment. The eco-environmental water demand is the key constraint for determining the <b>available</b> <b>quantity</b> of water that could be transferred in view of the existing water demand for local social and economic development. Considering the effect on the eco-environment, this study investigates the <b>available</b> <b>quantity</b> of transferable water in the WRP for the dual purpose of protecting the local eco-environment and decreasing the crisis of water resources in the western areas by considering the water demand for river channel eco-environment downstream of the dams as the main constraint. In order to estimate the eco-environmental water demand, the low runoff and Tennant methods are studied According to the results of risk analysis, the proposed schemes for water transfer have high reliability and low risk The risk will be further reduced if in the future reservoirs are operated jointly...|$|R

50|$|Construction {{was started}} in August 1947, but due to the marshland-geology of the site, main ground works {{contractor}} Robert M Douglas was forced to devise {{a new type of}} formwork for its construction. Timber was the traditional material for such purposes, but immediately post-war could only be obtained on permit from the Ministry of Supply. The quantity allocated by the ministry was inadequate to maintain the required progress of the work, so alternative means of providing the necessary formwork were investigated. Limited quantities of cold steel plate were available, and the timber obtained by permit was to a considerable extent used as framing to which the steel plate was fixed. The <b>available</b> <b>quantities</b> were soon absorbed and the supply was augmented by the purchase of now redundant Anderson-type air raid shelters, which were rolled flat and pressed into panels of uniform size. This was the first steel panel formwork system ever deployed in the world.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{proximate}} {{causes of}} zero-sum thinking is {{the experiences that}} individuals have with scarce resources or zero-sum interactions in their developmental environment. In 1965, George M. Foster argued that members of [...] "peasant" [...] societies have an [...] "Image of Limited Good," [...] which he argued was learned through by experiences {{in a society that}} was essentially zero-sum."The model of cognitive orientation that seems to me best to account for peasant behavior is the [...] "Image of Limited Good." [...] By [...] "Image of Limited Good" [...] I mean that broad areas of peasant behavior are patterned in such fashion as to suggest that peasants view their social, economic, and natural universes—their total environment—as one in which all of the desired things in life such as land, wealth, health, friendship and love, manliness and honor, respect and status, power and influence, security and safety, exist in finite quantity and are always in short supply, as far as the peasant is concerned. Not only do these and all other [...] "good things" [...] exist in finite and limited quantities, but in addition there is no way directly within peasant power to increase the <b>available</b> <b>quantities</b> ... When the peasant views his economic world as one in which Limited Good prevails, and he can progress only at the expense of another, he is usually very near the truth." [...] (pps. 67-68) More recently, Rozycka-Tran et al. (2015) conducted a cross-cultural study that compared the responses of individuals in 37 nations to a scale of zero-sum beliefs. This scale asked individuals to report their agreement with statements that measured zero-sum thinking. For example, one item on the scale stated that [...] "Successes of some people are usually failures of others". Rozycka-Tran et al. found that individuals in countries with lower Gross Domestic Product showed stronger zero-sum beliefs on average, suggesting that [...] "the belief in zero-sum game seems to arise in countries with lower income, where resources are scarce" [...] (p. 539). Similarly, Rozycka-Tran et al. found that individuals with lower socioeconomic status displayed stronger zero-sum beliefs.|$|E
