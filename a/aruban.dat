5|$|In January 2006, the FBI and <b>Aruban</b> {{authorities}} interviewed—or in some cases, re-interviewed—several of Holloway's fellow classmates in Alabama. On January 17, <b>Aruban</b> police {{searched for}} Holloway's body in sand dunes {{on the northwest}} coast of Aruba, as well as areas close by the Marriott beach. Additional searches took place in March and April 2006, without result.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, {{underwater}} searches {{were conducted}} by <b>Aruban</b> authorities after an American couple {{reported that they were}} snorkeling when they photographed what they thought might be human skeletal remains, possibly those of Holloway. <b>Aruban</b> authorities sent divers to investigate, but no remains were ever recovered.|$|E

50|$|Afro-Arubans or <b>Arubans</b> of African descent are <b>Arubans</b> whose ancestry {{lies within}} the {{continent}} of Africa, most notably West Africa. Most of <b>Arubans</b> are mixed of Amerindian (mainly Arawak), white and black people. Afro-Arubans are a minority ethnic group in Aruba, accounting for less 20% of the countrys population. They speak Papiamento, an Afro-Portuguese dialect spoken in the ABC islands. The language dates back at least 300 years {{and is based on}} African linguistic structures combined with vocabulary from Portuguese, Dutch, and Spanish.|$|R

5|$|On August 1, 2008, the <b>Aruban</b> athletes {{left for}} Beijing aboard KLM Flight 765. Vis and Roodzant were {{accompanied}} by their trainers and COA officials Edmundo Josiah and Chu Halabi. COA president Leo Maduro and COA officials Mary Hsing and Ling Wong left for Beijing three days later. Alongside IOC member Nicole Hoevertsz, this group formed the <b>Aruban</b> delegation to the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 2006, another suspect, Guido Wever (the son of {{a former}} <b>Aruban</b> politician) was {{detained}} in the Netherlands on suspicion of assisting in the abducting, battering, and killing of Holloway. Wever was questioned for six days in Utrecht. <b>Aruban</b> prosecutors initially sought his transfer to the island, but he was instead released by agreement between the prosecutor and Wever's attorney.|$|E
5|$|Fiderd Vis was {{the only}} <b>Aruban</b> {{participating}} as a judoka in the Beijing Olympics. He was trained by Alberto Thiel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arubans</b> often {{refer to}} Carnival as Bacchanal, a term {{based on the}} Greek and Roman {{celebrations}} dedicated to Dionysus for the Greeks and Bacchus for the Romans, their god of wine, vegetation, and cheer. Aruba's Bacchanalia shares some similarities with the ancient celebrations.|$|R

5|$|On 10 November 2005, Paulus won {{an unjust}} {{detention}} {{action against the}} <b>Aruban</b> government, clearing him as a suspect and allowing him to retain his government contract. The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages {{for himself and his}} family because of his false arrest. The action was initially successful, but the award of 40,000 <b>Aruban</b> florins (US$22,300) was reversed on appeal. The family's finances were depleted by the legal expenses. In January 2007, Paulus found work as a managing partner at the law firm that represented him.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{announced}} that <b>Aruban</b> authorities had provided its agency with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence. Investigators found {{a piece of}} duct tape with strands of blond hair attached to it; the samples were tested at a Dutch lab. A group from the <b>Aruban</b> police and prosecutor's office then traveled to the FBI central laboratory at Quantico, Virginia, to consult with American investigators. The hair samples were then tested a second time. The FBI {{announced that}} the hair samples {{did not belong to}} Holloway.|$|E
5|$|With the {{assistance}} of hundreds of volunteers, <b>Aruban</b> investigators conducted an extensive search and rescue operation. American special agents from the FBI, fifty Dutch soldiers and three specially-equipped Dutch Air Force F-16 aircraft participated in the search. In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body. Her remains were not found. On December 18, 2007, <b>Aruban</b> prosecutors announced that the case would be closed without any charges made. The <b>Aruban</b> prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Van der Sloot, {{under the influence of}} marijuana, saying that Holloway died on the morning of her disappearance, and that a friend had disposed of her body. Van der Sloot later denied that what he had said was true, and in an interview said that he had sold Holloway into sexual slavery. He later retracted his comments. In 2012, Van der Sloot was convicted of the May 30, 2010, murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru.|$|E

He succeeded in obtaining 13,000 of the 14,000 votes on Aruba, but did not gain a seat.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{languages}} spoken on the Caribbean island of Aruba. The official language is Dutch and Papiamento, although schools {{require students to}} learn English, Spanish, French, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Portuguese which is also spoken on the island. According to the Government of Aruba the mother tongue and primary vernacular of almost all <b>Arubans</b> is a local language known as Papiamento, an Afro-Portuguese Creole language spoken since the 16th century. The language, however, was not widespread in Aruba till the 18th and 19th centuries when most materials on the island and even Roman Catholic schoolbooks were written in Papiamento.|$|R
5|$|Aruba is a {{small island}} colony of 100,000 people {{that is part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the {{southern}} Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles, but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely <b>Aruban</b> delegation participated two years after the island's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial <b>Aruban</b> delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any <b>Aruban</b> delegation since then (including the Athens Olympics).|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort. During {{the first days of}} the search, the <b>Aruban</b> {{government}} gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the rescue effort. Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. <b>Aruban</b> banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied. She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel's presidential suite.|$|E
5|$|Aruba competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Their {{participation}} marked their sixth Olympic appearance, {{and included}} the smallest number of athletes {{that had ever}} represented Aruba in its history. Two Arubans competed in the Olympic games: Jan Roodzant participated as a swimmer, and Fiderd Vis participated in judo. The <b>Aruban</b> delegation arrived in Beijing between August 1 and August 4, including the athletes, coaches, and various officials from both the IOC and the <b>Aruban</b> Olympic Committee (Comité Olimpico Arubano, COA), Aruba's local Olympic committee. Fiderd Vis came to Beijing on special invitation from the IOC, which had observed his progress while he trained in Brazil. Vis was the flagbearer in the opening ceremony, while Roodzant was so in the closing ceremony. Both athletes were eliminated in the preliminary rounds on August 12, 2008; consequently, Aruba did not earn any medals.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the caves was {{initially}} linked to the Amerindians, a semi nomadic tribe {{who lived on the}} Aruba island about 4000 years ago. However, a small branch of Arawak Indians, known as Caquetio, inhabited this island around 1000 AD. The villages inhabited by them were near the towns of Santa Cruz and Savaneta, and the carvings inside the caves and rock faces testify to this inference. Historians have also inferred that <b>Arubans</b> also lived in caves but mainly for the purposes of performing sacrificial services and holding assemblies, and sometimes also to hide in the caves during enemy attacks.|$|R
5000|$|... 16.4% of {{the total}} births in 2003 were to parents of non-European origin, {{although}} they account for only 12.4% {{of the population in}} the 25-34 age group. For example, 3.8% of the births were ethnic Moroccan, although they were only 2.26% of the 25-34 age group. Respective figures were 3.27% and 3.0% for Turks. The TFR for Moroccans in 2003 was 3.3 while the general TFR was 1.73. TFR was 2.3 for Turks, 1.7 for Surinamese, 1.8 for <b>Arubans,</b> 3.0 for Africans and 1.8 for Latin Americans. (These figures compare with a figure of around 2.1 required to maintain a stable overall population figure.) ...|$|R
5|$|Aruba sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece from 13 to 29 August 2004. The delegation's participation in the Athens Olympics marked Aruba's fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics since the Dutch colony's debut at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Four athletes (three men and one woman) competed across three sports (Pierre de Windt in track and field, Davy Bisslik and Roshendra Vrolijk in swimming, and Isnardo Faro weightlifting). None of the track or swimming athletes advanced past the first round in their events, and as of Athens, no <b>Arubans</b> had medaled in any events. Roshendra Vrolijk bore Aruba's flag at the ceremonies.|$|R
5|$|On February 8, 2008, Van der Sloot {{met with}} <b>Aruban</b> {{investigators}} in the Netherlands and denied {{that what he}} said on the tape was true, stating that he was {{under the influence of}} marijuana at the time. Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, 2009, Dave Holloway transported {{a search}} dog to Aruba to search a small {{reservoir}} {{in the northern}} part of the island. The reservoir was previously identified by a supposed witness as a possible location of Natalee's remains. <b>Aruban</b> authorities indicated that they had no new information in the case, but that Holloway had been given permission to conduct the search.|$|E

5000|$|For Dia Di San Juan, <b>Arubans</b> {{dress in}} red and yellow {{traditional}} shirts and black traditional trousers to represent fire. This celebration originates {{from a combination of}} [...] Arawak harvest festivals and the works of Spanish missionaries to combine them with the celebration of San Juan. Aruba is the only country in the world that celebrates this day with dancing and singing. During the celebration a singer will chant a familiar [...] "dera gai" [...] (bury rooster) tune while players accompany the song with drum, violin, and a local instrument called a wiri. While they sing, they will choose someone to come and try to hit a fake rooster with their eyes closed. When that person hits that rooster, it will bring a wonderful smell that comes from the fruit (calabash).|$|R
40|$|Dutch {{is one of}} the two {{official}} {{languages of}} the Netherlands. It is the mother tongue of 15 million Dutchmen and 5, 5 million Belgians. The second official language is Frisian, which is spoken by the 500, 000 inhabitants of Friesland - a province of the Netherlands, 1, 248 square miles in area, in the north with coastlines on the IJsselmeer and the Waddenzee. Sranan is the native language of the 263, 000 members of the Surinamese community in the Netherlands, and Papiamento, the creole language of the Netherlands Antilles, is spoken by the 91, 000 <b>Arubans</b> and Antilleans in the Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek 1994). There are also 35, 000 Moluccans, who speak Dutch but use Malay among themselves. Major immigrant languages are Turkish, the mother tongue of 241, 000 Turkish nationals, and Arabic, spoken by the 196, 000 Moroccan citizens in the Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek 1994) ...|$|R
50|$|The two {{autonomous}} {{overseas territories}} within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, reject the Netherlands' liberal legislation regarding sexual orientation, {{and have not}} legalized same-sex marriages. However, the Netherlands Supreme Court in 2007 declared that all marriages contracted in the {{different parts of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands should be accepted in the other parts of the Kingdom as well, forcing Aruba to recognize same-sex marriages concluded in the Netherlands. This does not mean however that Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles are bound to introduce laws legalizing same-sex marriages to be concluded within their countries, since the constituent countries of the Kingdom have separate private law (see Same-sex marriage in Aruba). While homosexual relations between consenting adults in private are legal, {{most of the people in}} the island territories affiliate with the socially conservative Roman Catholic Church. As a result, many Antillians and <b>Arubans</b> do not support LGBT rights.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Aruban</b> prosecutor's office {{attempted}} {{to obtain an}} arrest warrant for Van der Sloot based on the tapes; however, a judge denied the request. The prosecutor appealed the denial, but the appeal failed on February 14, 2008. The appeals {{court held that the}} statements on the tape were inconsistent with evidence in the case and were insufficient to hold Van der Sloot.|$|E
5|$|The Twittys {{and their}} {{supporters}} criticized a perceived lack of progress by <b>Aruban</b> police. The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push {{their own version of}} events. The Twittys denied this.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of the U.S. Justice Department, {{authorities}} conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands. One of the homes belonged to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of criminal activities by Van der Sloot. <b>Aruban</b> investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Dave Holloway returned to Aruba on June 14 to pursue possible new clues.|$|E
5000|$|The {{national}} flag of Aruba was officially adopted on March 18, 1976. The blue field represents the sky, the sea, peace, hope, Aruba's future and its {{ties to the}} past. The two narrow stripes [...] "suggest the movement toward status aparte". One represents [...] "the flow of tourists to sun-drenched Aruba, enriching the island as well as vacationers", the other [...] "industry, all the minerals (gold and phosphates in the past, petroleum in the early 20th century)". In addition to sun, gold, and abundance, the yellow is also said to represent wanglo flowers. The star has particularly complex symbolism. It is vexillologically unusual in having four points, representing the four cardinal directions. These refer in turn to the many countries of origin {{of the people of}} Aruba. They also represent the four main languages of Aruba: Papiamento, Spanish, English, and Dutch. The star also represents the island itself: a land of often red soil bordered by white beaches in a blue sea. The red also represents blood shed by <b>Arubans</b> during war, past Indian inhabitants, patriotic love, and Brazil wood. The white also represents purity and honesty.|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} {{two million people}} {{involved}} in the Southern Caribbean diaspora. Grenada has more expatriates than any other island in the region, and with most leaving the island for the United Kingdom, Canada, and the USA, although some migrate to nearer countries such as Trinidad and Saint Vincent. Trinidad has a growing diaspora to Canada, mostly to Toronto, that has contributed the Toronto Caribana in the city. The Trinidadian diaspora is only second in size to the Jamaican diaspora in Canada from the Caribbean. Grenada and Guyana are two nations whose populations are migrating elsewhere, as the two countries are some of the least developed countries in the Americas. Many Guyanese have chosen the nearby island of Barbados, and many people on the island have Guyanese relatives or relations. Other than that, the Guyanese have settled in England (mostly London) and Canada, similar to Vincentians and St Lucians. Barbados has the least migration as it's developing a successful economy, and the living conditions are better than in some other Southern Caribbean countries. However, after World War II, many Barbadians moved to the USA (South Carolina, Virginia, and New York), Canada, and primarily the UK. It has a smaller diaspora compared to its neighbouring islands, however. <b>Arubans</b> most often migrate to the Netherlands or the U.S.A, but a small portion migrate to Canada or Venezuela. Many black British and mixed race people have Southern Caribbean heritage, and a few possess dual heritage of two Caribbean nations. Mostly with Jamaica, (Jamaican/Trinidadian), (Jamaican/Bajan), (Jamaican/Grenadian), and to a lesser extent, a mixture of the Southern nations,(Bajan/Guyanese),(Trini/Grenadian), and (Trini/Bajan). In the United Kingdom, parts of Canada, and the USA, Caribbean independence days are held in cities and are celebrated by people of Caribbean descent.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{church was}} constructed in 1750 by Caquetio Indians and Spanish though the island {{did not have a}} priest yet. The pioneering work of establishing the church and converting local Indians into the Catholic Christian faith was the sole work of Domingo Antonio Silvestre of Venezuela, which he achieved with his own funds. It {{is said to be the}} first church to be established in Aruba. This first church was built with stone walls and a straw roof. It was dedicated to Mother St. Mary, the “Mother of the Rosary” and hence considered exceptional in Aruba. A one-foot cross, which was brought from Venezuela by one of the priests, was installed here. Subsequent to Domingo Antonio Silvestre’s death Miguel Enrique Albarez (a son of the second fiscal) took control of the church, and then by Domingo Bernardino Silvestre son of the pioneer priest of the church. When the tragic plague stuck the place, many of the inhabitants of Alto Vista died and the remaining residents vacated the place and moved to Noord where the second church of Aruba was built. The Alto Vista Church was deserted from 1816 and went into ruins and the old wooden cross went under possession of many priests. This cross which was at the original altar is now seen in the St. Anna church in Noord. However, Francisca, a school teacher in Aruba, with single-minded dedication proceeded to revive the historic church of Aruba by locating it amidst the ruins after she came across by chance a picture of St. Mary’s with flowers. She collected funds of about 5000 Florins from local <b>Arubans,</b> got a statue of St. Mary’s made in Netherlands and brought it to Alto Vista and installed it at the new church built at the site of the old chapel, between March and May 1952, after obtaining permission from the Bishop in Curaçau. The statue was adorned with a golden crown studded with gem stones in 1954 with donations contributed by several Arubians. Unfortunately this statue was vandalized by a maniac. The statue has since been replaced by a new one. With this chapel, Catholic religion made inroads into Aruba.|$|R
