5|$|Washington Irving {{had sunk}} {{on top of}} the New York-New Jersey {{vehicular}} tube complicating its removal. The wreck became <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to navigation and was struck at 3am on 16 June by a railroad car float.|$|E
5|$|Tucker and Esther Cobblepot {{throw their}} {{deformed}} infant child Oswald into Gotham River, fearing {{he would become}} <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to society after attacking their cat. His basket floats to an abandoned zoo and a rookery of penguins raise {{him as one of}} their own.|$|E
5|$|After this success, he {{was sent}} to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become <b>a</b> <b>menace,</b> and where Turkish {{settlers}} had begun encroaching upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of these operations, and alleged that the mere mention of his approach caused fear to his enemies.|$|E

5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E
5|$|Neighbors and {{visitors}} to the region, including foreign and royal dignitaries, took interest in Olga, and visited her small home, which was also a magnet for Romanov impostors whom Olga and her family considered <b>a</b> <b>menace.</b> Welcome visitors included Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, in 1954, and Louis Mountbatten and his wife Edwina, in August 1959. In June 1959, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited Toronto and invited the Grand Duchess for lunch on board the Royal Yacht, Britannia.|$|E
5|$|The presidential {{inauguration of}} Alfonsín was {{attended}} by Isabel Perón. Despite internal recriminations for the defeat, the Peronist party agreed to support Alfonsín as president, to prevent a return of the military. By this time, the left-wing terrorism had been neutralized and was no longer <b>a</b> <b>menace.</b> There were still factions in the military ambitious to keep an authoritarian government, and {{groups such as the}} Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo seeking reparations for the actions of the military during the Dirty War.|$|E

5|$|The {{rapprochement}} {{was not to}} last long, as on 13 April 1975 a coup d'état removed Tombalbaye {{and replaced}} him with General Félix Malloum. As the coup was partly motivated by opposition to Tombalbaye's appeasement of Libya, Gaddafi considered it <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to his influence and resumed supplying the FROLINAT. In April 1976, there was a Gaddafi-backed attempted assassination of Malloum, {{and in the same}} year Libyan troops started making forays into central Chad in company of FROLINAT forces.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, while {{orbiting}} the Earth during a routine space mission with his crew, Colonel John Jameson and his ship are {{hit by a}} meteor shower. John struggles to get the ship back safely on Earth but eventually succeeds in landing it at Cape Canaveral. The next day, Jonah learns that the Globes cover story on the Goblin's rampage—featuring Peter's photos—is outselling the Bugles story on John's heroic space journey. An infuriated Jameson decides {{to meet with the}} public's demand by publishing a new cover story questioning if Spider-Man is a hero or <b>a</b> <b>menace.</b> Meanwhile, John is interviewed at the shuttle hangar when he spots a mysterious, vibrating black goo {{on the bottom of the}} shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Ten years later, Batman confronts a {{group of}} Gotham City crime bosses led by Chuckie Sol, who are {{intending}} to launder millions of counterfeit dollars in a casino. As Sol escapes to his car, a cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him to drive out {{the side of a}} parking garage and into a neighboring building. Batman arrives soon after, and bystanders blame him for Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> (despite Commissioner Gordon's protests). Attending a party at Wayne Manor, Reeves teases Bruce for allowing Andrea to leave him.|$|E

5|$|In France, {{the action}} was infamous for a {{despatch}} supposedly sent by Dupotet and subsequently printed in edited form in the newspaper Le Moniteur Universel. The report, which was later used by Mends in his dispute with Seymour, claimed that Niémen had not only been largely undamaged before Arethusas arrival, but that Seymour had actually surrendered to the French captain before Mends arrived. This story, almost totally invented, was widely believed in France at the time. The effect on the Mauritius campaign of the defeat of Niémen was not immediately apparent, Hamelin's squadron remaining <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to British shipping well into 1810. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the destructive Battle of Grand Port, the French, although the victors, were unable to repair their ships due to lack of naval stores and their effectiveness declined until they were unable to resist the Invasion of Isle de France in November 1810. This inability was directly related to the failure of all but one of the French frigates sent to reinforce and resupply the island to reach it, the others either captured or driven back en route.|$|E
5|$|Serving as {{the convoy}} {{flagship}} for Convoy HX-50, Otranto departed New York on 25 September. Six days later, {{on the evening}} of 1 October, the ship accidentally rammed the French fishing schooner Croisine off Newfoundland while the latter was returning home to St. Malo with a full load of cod. The fishing boat passed down the liner's port side and its masts destroyed some of the liner's lifeboats on that side. Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of the convoy, ordered the convoy to continue while Otranto stopped to rescue the 37 survivors. The derelict Croisine was now <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to navigation and Davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening. The liner caught back up with the convoy by daybreak. The following day, the first death from the influenza pandemic occurred and the soldier was buried at sea. Only one other flu death aboard Otranto is recorded, but others may have occurred before she met her end.|$|E
25|$|Umar never {{appointed}} governors {{for more}} than two years, for they might get influence in their county. He dismissed his most successful general Khalid ibn Walid, due to his immense popularity and growing influence that he saw as <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to his authority.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{entry into}} World War I against Germany and the Austro-Hungarian empire was a decisive turning-point for Bohn. In {{the fall of}} 1916, Bohn contributed to the Preparedness Movement by {{contributing}} articles to The New York Times condemning German militarism as <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to world peace.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that Rabbi Yisroel Hopsztajn of Kozienice, another Hasidic leader, also {{considered}} Napoleon <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to the Jewish people, but believed that after victory over Russia, Messiah will arrive. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson identifies Rabbi Yisroel as the Chasidic leader who preferred that Napoleon defeat the Czar.|$|E

25|$|The {{minimum age}} for {{students}} was fourteen, and all students {{were required to}} be at least one-fourth Indian. The Carlisle term was five years, and the consent forms which the parents signed before the agent so stated. Pratt refused to return pupils earlier unless they were ill, unsuitable mentally or <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to others.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later Salmon was {{dispatched}} from Belize to take custody of William Walker, an American citizen who had briefly been president of Nicaragua, but who was now attempting further conquests in Central America. The British Government regarded Walker as <b>a</b> <b>menace</b> to its own affairs in the region. Salmon captured Walker and delivered him to the authorities in Honduras, who promptly had him court-martialed and shot.|$|E
