5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated {{in the form of}} a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a cello. Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, {{which led to a}} fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they bound the Red Cow with a bast rope <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pile with its head towards {{the south and}} its face towards the west. The priest stood {{on the east side}} facing west. He {{slaughtered}} the cow with his right hand and received the blood with his left hand. But Rabbi Judah said that he received the blood with his right hand, put it on his left hand, and then sprinkled with his right hand. He dipped his finger in the blood and sprinkled it towards the Holy of Holies seven times, dipping once for each sprinkling.|$|E
500|$|Aldermen Edward Jones (20th) and William C. Henry (24th) {{were the}} first aldermen to arrive from the City Council session. According to the federal lawsuit, Henry showed he had a gun, and then with Jones removed the now-hung {{painting}} from the wall <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, facing the wall. After they left, another student rehung the painting. Three other aldermen, Allan Streeter (17th), Dorothy Tillman (3rd) and Rush, arrived later. They took down the painting and attempted to remove it from the school, but were stopped by a school official. The aldermen then took the painting {{to the office of}} the school president Anthony Jones (no relation to Edward Jones). The painting had a [...] gash, and it had been wrapped in brown paper.|$|E

2500|$|The United States {{military}} government banned cockfighting and bullfighting from the island. They did, however introduce a [...] "new" [...] sport called basketball.

When the soldiers played basketball, they used a plain straw basket which was cut open at both ends <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highest end of a pole. For a ball, they used a football and the game was played without any established set of rules.|$|E
2500|$|While most of North Hawthorne was {{essentially}} built {{from the ground}} up, the station house was actually relocated to the site from a nearby property. [...] Prior to 1891, the station house sat approximately a quarter mile {{to the north of}} the North Hawthorne yard, near present-day Van Winkle Avenue. [...] The station had been established as a depot called Van Winkle, which was named for the local family that had granted land to the NYS's predecessor (the New Jersey Western Railroad) for the construction of the line. [...] Against the Van Winkle family's wishes, on May 24, 1891, the NYS removed the station house from its foundation <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track. [...] A locomotive then dragged the building down the rails (which had been greased) to the North Hawthorne site, on the corner of Rea Avenue and 4th Avenue.|$|E

[...] Immediately after having {{declared}} the time <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Power Board, presenter Jeremy Clarkson removed the record because it did not meet the show's rule that the car must be able to go over a speed bump. However, Ben Scott-Geddes of Caparo has stated that, [...] "the model we supplied to Top Gear was one of our final engineering vehicles without adjustable ride height and electronic active driver control systems which are standard on our production models. When drivers select the 'road' setting, the car is more tractable in slower speed conditions and the ride height is fully adjustable to bring the car up to 90mm clearance, making it more than capable of driving over speed bumps." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1995, the McCombs {{sold the}} house to a local real estate agent, Christopher Shellabear: [...] "“Our family all left home {{and my wife and}} I were {{rattling}} around in this huge house”, Harold McComb explained. On 30 June 1995, following receipt of petition from local residents worried about the potential redevelopment of the site, the Heritage Council of Western Australia issued a Stop Work (or Conservation) order under Section 59 of the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990. On 17 July 1995, Chris Shellabear sold the now-encumbered property to Sharon Creasy, wife of prospector Mark Creasy, for $2.7 million. On 10 October 1995, the Heritage Council of Western Australia added the property to the State Register of Heritage Places on an [...] "interim" [...] basis. The Creasys contested the interim listing for nine years, and in 2004 the Heritage Council removed the dwelling from the interim listing <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> permanent register. [...] There was a legal dispute as to whether the listing was done correctly, resulting in the Heritage Council re-registering it on the permanent list in May 2005. The Creasys estimate that the dispute has cost them $225,000 in legal fees and claim that the house is now uninhabitable, estimating it would cost at least $2.8 million to make it liveable and much more to renovate it completely.|$|E
