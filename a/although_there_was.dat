5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving rerouting the road to be shorter and on more level ground, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the war was}} {{entering}} its final stages, the squadron still had to watch for anti-aircraft artillery. The fighter squadrons continued to make advances until February, {{while waiting for the}} Canadian push through the Reichwald. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some aerial fighting, the major conflict with the Luftwaffe occurred when the Canadians started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|China before westernization {{was another}} society that {{segregated}} men from women.

Outside their duties to bear sons to their husbands, women were perceived as having no sexuality at all.|$|E

5|$|The army of {{the early}} Republic {{continued}} to evolve, and <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a tendency among Romans to attribute such changes to great reformers, {{it is more likely}} that changes were the product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform. The manipular formation was probably copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, perhaps as a result of Roman defeats in the Second Samnite War.|$|E
5|$|The total costs, {{including}} all alterations, were £513,242 for Glatton and £777,197 for Gorgon, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no obvious {{reason for the}} disparity unless some of Glatton's costs had been charged against Gorgon as the lead ship of the class. A truer cost would be about £645,000 for each. This was almost double the original cost and made them more expensive {{than any of the}} other monitors.|$|E

A series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary wrecker Cruel Coppinger, culminating in a fire at Baltimore, caused the play to be considered cursed by America's actors' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it.|$|E

5|$|After San Diego's {{bankruptcy}} in 1852, the State of California took over city government {{and ran the}} city with an appointed Board of Trustees during 18521888. The President of the Board was called mayor by courtesy, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no official office of mayor.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a setback}} in {{progress}} with a stonemasons' strike between September 1841 and May 1843, the House of Lords had its first {{sitting in the}} new chamber in 1847. In 1852 the Commons was finished, and both Houses sat in their new chambers for the first time; Queen Victoria first used the newly completed royal entrance. In the same year, while Barry was appointed a Knight Bachelor, Pugin suffered a mental breakdown and, following incarceration at Bethlehem Pauper Hospital for the Insane, {{died at the age}} of 40.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{no desire}} {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{some fear}} of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow.

The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E
