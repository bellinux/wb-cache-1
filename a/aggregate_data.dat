The portal was intended to <b>aggregate</b> <b>data</b> from various crowdfunding platforms in the UK to establish a “one stop shop” for users looking to examine open deals, review firms' financials, and monitor firm funding.

25|$|Tracking the {{transmission}} of infectious diseases is called disease surveillance. Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of public health agencies, either on the (inter)national or a local level. Public health staff rely on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of reportable diseases to them. The analysis of <b>aggregate</b> <b>data</b> can show the spread of a disease and {{is at the core}} of the specialty of epidemiology.|$|E
25|$|Statistical methods {{commonly}} used {{in other areas of}} psychology are also used in OHP-related research. Statistical methods used include structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as multilevel modeling). HLM can better adjust for similarities between employees and is especially well suited to evaluating the lagged impact of work stressors on health outcomes; in this research context HLM can help minimize censoring and is well-suited to experience sampling studies. Meta-analyses have been used to <b>aggregate</b> <b>data</b> (modern approaches to meta-analyses rely on HLM), and draw conclusions across multiple studies.|$|E
25|$|Data is {{read from}} these log files using Ptail, an {{internally}} built tool to <b>aggregate</b> <b>data</b> from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data are separated out into three streams {{so they can}} eventually be sent to their own clusters in different data centers (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen {{the number of times}} needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a hash table.|$|E

25|$|By {{presenting}} such a card, purchasers typically {{earn the}} right either to a discount {{on the current}} purchase, or to an allotment of points {{that they can use}} for future purchases. Hence the card is the visible means of implementing a type of what economists call a two-part tariff. Application forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses <b>aggregate</b> <b>data</b> internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its marketing research. Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or whether he or she is a vegetarian. Where a customer has provided sufficient identifying information, the loyalty card may also be used to access such information to expedite verification during receipt of cheques or dispensing medical prescription preparations, or for other membership privileges (e.g., access to a club lounge in airports, using a frequent-flyer card).|$|E

500|$|The game {{also has}} several {{components}} that exist {{only within the}} app. The base game includes around 70 knights, which in the game's lore are sorcerers that control the golems. Players pair each golem with one knight, or three knights for the [...] "colossus" [...] golems, and different knights provide golems with different bonuses. Players can also use spells, in the game's lore by evoking ancestral gods called Ancient Ones. Ancient Ones are cast using mana, which can be acquired in several ways, including when a golem that the player controls is defeated or though missions that appear in the app. Players encounter missions, which provide optional objectives in exchange for victory points, while moving around the map. In some cases not completing the missions offers alternative rewards.
