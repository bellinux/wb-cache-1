In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E

However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was worrying about the high costs of living in Londonhe informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be anchored to an assured salary.|$|E

5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. <b>At</b> <b>times,</b> <b>the</b> public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E

He controlled the team's free agency decisions, but feuded with General manager (GM) George Young who chose the team's draft picks.* Pervin. pg. 124 Lowlights were a 35–0 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in the Monday Night season opener, and the fans pelting the Charger sideline with snowballs in the season's final game.

5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot to be interesting because it explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story did not contribute much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential for an interesting backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed their motives in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel like it was retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy <b>at</b> <b>times,</b> <b>the</b> expressive facial animations kept the cinematics captivating.|$|E
