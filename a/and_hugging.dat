5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes to his room and puts her hand on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program. After everyone begins going their separate ways, Grey remains torn on who she should follow: Shepherd or Dandridge.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|The first twelve Pikes of 2013 were {{originally}} released as limited edition, untitled albums with hand drawn covers {{and signed by}} Buckethead himself. The albums were only recognizable by their designation within the Pikes chronology {{at the moment of}} their announcement. Notably, the cover of Pike 13 contains a photograph of Buckethead unmasked; the first such image released to the public. The cover of Pike 13 does not feature the common elements of the Pikes series, and is simply a photograph of Buckethead during his teenage years, carrying an acoustic guitar <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> his father. Buckethead continued released albums throughout the year, breaking the numerical order occasionally (for example, Pike 34 Pikes was released three weeks after Pike 35 Thank you Ohlinger's).

500|$|The Indiana {{state health}} commissioner, Dr. Woodrow Myers, who had {{extensive}} experience treating AIDS patients in San Francisco, and the Centers for Disease Control both notified {{the board that}} Ryan posed no risk to other students, but the school board and many parents ignored their statements. In February 1986, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study of 101 people who had spent three months living in close but non-sexual contact with people with AIDS. The study concluded {{that the risk of}} infection was [...] "minimal to nonexistent," [...] even when contact included sharing toothbrushes, razors, clothing, combs and drinking glasses; sleeping in the same bed; <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> and kissing.|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song at the 2013 YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. She {{arrived on the}} red carpet of the event wearing the same pair of rotten, yellow teeth she wore on the cover art. John Walker from MTV News analyzed Gaga's look to be a combination of the snake from Tim Burton's 1988 fantasy film, Beetlejuice, the Scarecrow character from DC Comics and the rocker Marilyn Manson. During the performance, the singer wore a flannel shirt, her natural hair and a snapback with the NASA symbol altered to read DOPE and her face was devoid of any make-up. She performed a piano only version of [...] "Dope", without any other instrumentation and with tears falling down her face. Gaga exited the stage while shaking hands <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> the members of the audience.|$|E
500|$|Pipette then {{tries to}} coax {{the old lady}} into leaving, kissing <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> her, and {{appealing}} to her (hoped for) good nature.

She cries out in protest that she's too shy for such behaviour, but the old lady assures her that she'll [...] "get over [...] shyness {{after a year or}} two of that sort of thing". Boomblehardt approaches next, and Pipette flings herself on him, crying [...] "Kiss me!". He obliges. She responds, [...] "How dare you take such a liberty! You insolent old man! Kiss me". And so he does. She boxes his ears, much to his confusion, and then retreats into the inn in tears.|$|E

500|$|Thorpe {{lined up}} {{later in the}} night {{alongside}} Klim, Chris Fydler and Ashley Callus to anchor the 4×100m freestyle relay, an event which the Americans had never lost at Olympic level. The third leg ended with Australia only an arm's length ahead of the United States. Thorpe timed his dive much better than Gary Hall, Jr., and surfaced a body length ahead. Hall's sprinting ability allowed him to open a lead by the final turn, but Thorpe's finishing kick overhauled him in the final metres, sparking wild celebrations amongst the partisan crowd. It evoked an uncharacteristic celebration from Thorpe, who immediately {{jumped out of the}} pool, screaming <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> his ecstatic teammates. He even went as far as playing air guitar to mock Hall's pre-race claim that the Americans would [...] "smash" [...] the Australians [...] "like guitars".|$|E

On 8 February 2014, a flash mob was held in Cambridge, England featuring same-sex couples embracing <b>and</b> <b>hugging,</b> as part of a video project known as [...] "From Russia With Love".|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Greenwalt {{was very}} keen {{to acquire the}} character of Cordelia for the spin-off series, commenting, [...] "I desperately wanted {{her to come to}} Angel because Angel being dark and broody, we need a big bright smile." [...] At the same time, Whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in the fourth season of Buffy where [...] "All of our characters {{got to the point where}} they were loving <b>and</b> <b>hugging,</b> and it was sort of like, where's Cordelia?", leading him to introduce Spike (James Marsters) to the cast to accommodate her absence. Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a [...] "rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS. So in episode one of Angel, Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail, actually." [...] Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins [...] "finding within herself a new level of humanity".|$|E

500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today gave a mixed {{review of}} the collaboration, [...] commenting, [...] "Eminem puts in a cameo on 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a {{tortured}} relationship from his Recovery album." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner gave a negative {{review of the}} song, stating, [...] "She collaborated with Eminem this summer on the controversial '"Love the Way You Lie"', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on [...] "Loud" [...] with [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", {{an extension of the}} melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> her. It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people." ...|$|E
500|$|The concert {{began with}} the lights dimming and a sole {{spotlight}} being focused on the crowd. The spotlight then followed Shakira {{as she entered the}} hall wearing a hooded fuchsia gown. Singing the [...] "pensive" [...] and [...] "sentimental" [...] ballad [...] "Pienso En Tí" [...] ("I Think of You"), she began walking towards the stage while shaking her fans' hands <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> them. As soon as Shakira climbed the stage, she threw off the gown to reveal her main attire: a mesh gold crop top coupled with skin-tight leather pants. A more energetic routine followed as she [...] "sprinted, jumped, and yodelled" [...] across the stage while performing more guitar-oriented versions of [...] "Why Wait" [...] and [...] "Te Dejo Madrid" [...] ("I Leave You Madrid"). After stopping to play a harmonica solo, Shakira performed [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] ("If You Go") accompanied by [...] "dense" [...] musical instrumentation. This was followed by a more rock-tinged performance of [...] "Whenever, Wherever", during which Shakira invited four female fans onto the stage and taught them how to belly dance.|$|E

Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs. However, [...] "there were a lot of snotty, tearful faces all around the set. When we got to the very, very last scene, everybody was just a mess. We started sobbing <b>and</b> <b>hugging</b> each other," [...] said Megan Mullally, who plays Karen. Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, commented that his saddest moment was [...] "the last time I stood in Will's kitchen. That was the most colorful position for me, standing there and stirring something. It was my pulpit, the place where I delivered my best jokes." ...|$|E
