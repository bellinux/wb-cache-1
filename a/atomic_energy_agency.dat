Some best-known agencies are the International <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency,</b> the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through {{the work of the}} WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency</b> and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency</b> to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} and individuals {{associated with the}} UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work.

Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency</b> (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013.
