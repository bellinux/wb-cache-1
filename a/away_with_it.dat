5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Bryennios's victory seemed certain, for {{his wings}} began to envelop Alexios's Franks in the centre. Realizing his {{position}} and despairing {{in the face of}} defeat (and, as Bryennios the Younger records, because he had disobeyed imperial orders to wait for more Turkish reinforcements and feared punishment from Botaneiates), Alexios at first resolved to attempt an all-or-nothing attack on Bryennios himself to decapitate the enemy army, but was dissuaded by his servant. With only six of his men around him, he then managed to break through the surrounding enemy soldiers. Confusion reigned behind their lines {{as a result of the}} Pecheneg attack on the rebel camp, and in this tumult Alexios saw Bryennios's imperial parade horse, with his two swords of state, being driven away to safety. Alexios and his men charged the escort, seized the horse, and rode <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> from the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving <b>away,</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E
5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E
25|$|Tom Robbins waxed {{philosophical}} {{about the}} Remington SL3, a typewriter {{that he bought}} to write Still Life with Woodpecker. He eventually did <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> because it is too complicated and inhuman for the writing of poetry.|$|E

25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, I thought to myself. And leaned it against a hut. And walked away.

25|$|As {{one of the}} few European adventurers in the area, {{he succeeded}} in {{building}} a fortune and getting <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> He returned to Naples, where he built a grand home in San Lazzaro (Agerola). He died soon after marrying a local girl: Enrichetta Coccia. The following legal battle over his inheritance, and the many distant relatives asserting their claims, made Avitabile's cousin something of a byword in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Gemini's {{emergency}} launch escape {{system did}} not use an escape tower powered by a solid-fuel rocket, but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned {{that they could do}} <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as the Titan II's hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn. Ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle. At higher altitudes, where the ejection seats could not be used, the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft, which would separate from the launch vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Many early RISC designs {{also shared}} the {{characteristic}} {{of having a}} branch delay slot. A branch delay slot is an instruction space immediately following a jump or branch. The instruction in this space is executed, {{whether or not the}} branch is taken (in other words the effect of the branch is delayed). This instruction keeps the ALU of the CPU busy for the extra time normally needed to perform a branch. Nowadays the branch delay slot is considered an unfortunate side effect of a particular strategy for implementing some RISC designs, and modern RISC designs generally do <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> (such as PowerPC and more recent versions of SPARC and MIPS).|$|E

25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{the entire}} top order apart from Langer batted to high scores, but Clarke needed an extra life to do it. Pietersen dropped him on 21, with the Australian score 139 for 3, {{and instead of}} England getting the vital {{breakthrough}} Clarke and Martyn ran <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> hitting 155 in 34.3 overs. Flintoff was smashed to all corners, and his figures read for 84 runs in 19 overs, but England fought back {{late in the day}} – in the frantic last ten overs, started by an inside-edge from Clarke off Hoggard, Australia lost four wickets for 24 runs. However, Australia had gained a lead of 314 runs {{by the end of the}} second day, and still had Katich there on 10.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after its}} release, James {{reached the end}} of their contract, and Tim Booth {{announced}} he was leaving the band to concentrate on other projects of his own.

Their final hometown gig, at the Manchester Evening News arena on 7 December, was recorded for a live CD and DVD, Getting <b>Away</b> <b>With</b> <b>It...</b> Live. Past members Larry Gott and Andy Diagram rejoined them for the tour, and Brian Eno also joined them onstage at London's Wembley Arena during the tour. The albums Gold Mother, Laid, and Whiplash (each containing bonus tracks) were re-released by Mercury Records the following year, as well as a B-sides compilation entitled B-Sides Ultra.|$|E

25|$|Warwickshire's bowling, which lacked {{an injured}} Heath Streak, also suffered, and despite {{excellent}} figures of six for 92 from Alex Loudon the Nottinghamshire batsmen ran <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as Darren Bicknell, Jason Gallian and Australian David Hussey all made fifties. Then, {{it was a}} Nottinghamshire spinner's turn to take centre stage - Graeme Swann. In 23 overs, he took six for 57, including the entire Warwickshire middle order from three to six - only Westwood passed 25, and Warwickshire could only muster 133. As if to make the humiliation complete, Swann was promoted to number 1, and hit one boundary and four additional runs before stumps were drawn after one over. Nottinghamshire were eight for no loss overnight, chasing 12 to win, and Darren Bicknell hit the winning runs off Dewald Pretorius four balls into the fourth day.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a similar}} premise to the {{previous}} game, Danganronpa 2 puts players in control of Hajime Hinata, an amnesiac boy who has just become one of Hope's Peak Academy's 'Ultimate' students, alongside fifteen others. The students find themselves taken to the remote tropical Jabberwock Island by their alleged teacher, a small, rabbit-like mascot named Usami, who claims {{it to be a}} simple field trip. However, things turn out to be {{too good to be true}} as Hope's Peak Academy's notorious principal, Monokuma, announces they are stuck on the island for life unless they can murder another student and get <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> If the students can determine a murderer in a Class Trial, that culprit is executed, but if they make the wrong assumption, then the killer walks home free whilst everyone else is sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|Harmison and Collingwood {{continued}} {{in the style of}} the first innings, although this time it was the real pace bowler who took the most wicket. On the afternoon of the second day, he again took both openers - including England opener Marcus Trescothick, and when Ian Blackwell (87) and Andrew Caddick threatened to run <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> with their partnership of 78 for the last wicket, it was Harmison who got Blackwell out, caught by Liam Plunkett. Durham were set a tricky target of 243, but the Jamaican-born all-rounder Gareth Breese saw off the challenge of Caddick, who took yet another six-for - this time for 98 - to end with match figures of 12 for 104. However, he was the only bowler to dig in, and Michael Hussey (51), Dale Benkenstein (51) and the aforementioned Breese with 79 not out saw Durham reach the target to preserve their unbeaten run in the Championship.|$|E
