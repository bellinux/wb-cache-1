Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands.

50|$|The {{organization}} {{has been a}} vocal opponent of a recent request by the commissioners of Rabun County, Georgia, for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division {{that would allow the}} county to discharge up to 2 million gallons per day of treated wastewater into the Little Tennessee. The proposed Rabun County Water Reclamation Facility, located at a former Fruit of the Loom plant in the headwaters of the watershed, would upgrade the Fruit of the Loom building's existing treatment plant, which was formerly an industrial wastewater facility, allowing it to treat domestic and industrial wastewater and act as the county's municipal wastewater treatment plant. The LTWA outlined its primary concerns in comments submitted by the Southern Environmental Law Center on their behalf to the Georgia EPD during the 30-day permit draft comment period, calling for a public hearing to address whether the permit should be granted and to ensure that it contains <b>appropriate</b> <b>provisions</b> to protect downstream users of the river.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{hospital}} clinicians manage {{patients with}} hyperglycemia receiving nutrition support. Recent studies underscore {{the importance of}} tight glucose control in hospitalized patients. Over the short term, hyperglyce-mia can adversely affect fluid balance, immune function, inflammation, and outcome; glucose control can improve these effects. Because {{this appears to be}} true for patients with and without a known diagnosis of diabetes, hyper-glycemia should be aggressively treated in all patients. Avoidance or minimization of hypoglycemia also is impor-tant. In general, the nutrition assessment, indications for nutrition support, and estimate of nutrition requirements for critically ill patients with hyperglycemia {{are similar to those of}} nondiabetic patients. Because overfeeding may cause hyperglycemia, <b>appropriate</b> <b>provision</b> of calories i...|$|R
