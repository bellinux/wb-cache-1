500|$|Spain's first match during {{qualification}} for the 2010 World Cup {{was against}} Bosnia and Herzegovina where Villa scored the only {{goal of the}} game. He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, I really want to see it on TV. The record is very nice. I would never have imagined in years that I would be able to obtain it. I am very proud <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> can continue breaking records." ...|$|E

500|$|Cornwallis {{believed}} that the terms of union should include Catholic emancipation. [...] While some rights had been restored in the early 1790s, Catholics were still denied elective offices and other rights. [...] Almost everyone in the establishments of Dublin and London, including the king and much of Pitt's cabinet, opposed this, leading Cornwallis to write that [...] "some mode must be adopted to soften the hatred of the Catholics to our government". In {{a letter to the}} Home Secretary he wrote, [...] "I trust that your grace and His Majesty's other ministers will on no account consent to the insertion of any clause which shall unalterably bind the United Parliament to persevere in the exclusion of Catholics." [...] Protestants, including the Lord Chancellor, Lord Clare, who favoured union, opposed Catholic emancipation. [...] "I trust, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> am not deceived, that they are fairly inclined to give them up, and to bring [...] forward unencumbered with the doctrine of emancipation." [...] King George, after Cornwallis' appointment, wrote to Pitt that [...] "Cornwallis must clearly understand that no indulgence can be granted to the Catholics farther than has been". Cornwallis' efforts to include support for emancipation clearly had negative repercussions. [...] One Protestant wrote, [...] "his silly conduct, his total incapacity, and self conceit and mulishness have alone lost the question [...] ", while another wrote to Castlereagh that Cornwallis had been rendered [...] "not only an object of disgust, but of abhorrence." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of Time {{thought that}} [...] "Because You Left" [...] {{provided}} a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended {{the character of}} Faraday, partially [...] "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has {{turned him into a}} likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere [...] "offer compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. [...] This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done {{in a way that makes}} most big-screen versions pale in comparison." [...] Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it [...] "really, really great … nerd-tastic for [...] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia." [...] She concluded that the premiere is [...] "quite good" [...] (three and a half out of four stars) with [...] "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that [...] "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. [...] A bloated feeling may result." [...] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the [...] "parallel plotting" [...] of the characters on and off the island in different times. [...] Despite deeming the premiere [...] "riveting" [...] and the script [...] "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that [...] "I may be alone in this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to [...] "Lost" [...] to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it [...] "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." [...] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of [...] "baby steps" [...] that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. [...] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that [...] "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout." ...|$|E

2500|$|Singer {{and actress}} Bette Midler became {{recognized}} as a gay icon in the 1970s. After performing on Broadway, Midler began performing at the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in the city, where she became close to her piano accompanist Barry Manilow, who produced her first major album The Divine Miss M (1973).

2500|$|Jankūnas {{made his}} pro debut with the Žalgiris in the 2003–04 season. When asked about playing with European {{basketball}} legend Arvydas Sabonis in his rookie season, Jankūnas responded: [...] "No doubt {{it was the}} most remarkable season. It was fantastic to play with Arvydas Sabonis. I was very young and it was very exciting. In the beginning, I was little bit afraid and uncomfortable, but later things got easy and I learned a lot from him. When I was a kid, I used to watch him playing on TV and never dared to dream that I would be playing with Arvydas Sabonis. One day I woke up and Sabonis was my teammate. It was great. He had huge experience and gave a lot of advice to me. It was big honor to play with him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> learned something from Sabonis." ...|$|E

I wanted to do something different – I didn't want to just sing about love over regular beats". Norwood also stated how Frank Ocean inspired her on this album: [...] "We've always had that great chemistry, and we both understand music in the same ways, to work with him on this album was great as well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> can get in [...] with him some more because his music is just so moving; I'm inspired by him.

2500|$|The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment with {{attached}} infantry {{company and}} the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at Beirut on 8 October.

2500|$|Although Michaels {{expressed}} happiness at Hart's 2006 induction {{into the}} Hall of Fame, the Hart–Michaels relationship remained laced with antagonism. Michaels criticized Hart's behavior and conduct during {{his days in}} WWF in his 2005 autobiography, comparing the Screwjob to a [...] "mafia hit," [...] and Hart has stated in his 2007 autobiography that he would [...] "never forgive" [...] Michaels. In interviews prior to the induction ceremony, Hart asserted that he would walk out from the ceremony if he saw Michaels anywhere on the WrestleMania 22 weekend. Michaels {{decided to leave the}} Hall of Fame ceremony early to avoid a possible scene. Hart did not appear at the WrestleMania show in a mini-ceremony with the other inductees, explaining {{in an interview that he}} had never intended to attend or appear at the show. Hart would later return to WWE television on the June 11, 2007 edition of Raw, where he appeared in a taped promo spot mocking Mr. McMahon's [...] "appreciation night." [...] While he was able to reconcile to a degree with McMahon, Hart had never reconciled with Michaels. In a November 17, 2008 radio interview, Hart mocked Michaels' version of the incident, saying, [...] "Shawn's this Christian today; and in his book, he wrote that Vince took a dive and that I never even hit him and I thought, 'This guy is such a liar'. I wonder what kind of Christian he is." [...] Asked if he had seen or spoken to Michaels since 1997, Hart said, [...] "No. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> never do... for his sake." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sagan {{demonstrated}} {{good form}} {{once again in}} the World Tour classified Tour de Suisse by winning four stages and the points classification jersey. He kicked things off with a somewhat surprising win in the opening prologue, besting local favorite and time trial specialist Fabian Cancellara (...) by 4 seconds over the [...] course. The second stage was not suited for him since it was a mountainous affair, but he did prevail on stage 3, in a thrilling finish where the bunch caught the final two escapees inside the final kilometer. The asphalt was wet with rain and Sagan's foot came out of his pedal in one of the last bend, but he managed to stay upright and pass 's Baden Cooke before the line, arms in the air and wearing the white jersey awarded to the best sprinter. The very next day, he took his third victory in four days, once again in rainy conditions. With about 350 metres to go, Marcus Burghardt of [...] launched a sprint for the finish line. Sagan jumped out of his teammate's wheel to get into Burghardt's slipstream and sailed past him to take the win. He thanked his team for their efforts afterward, especially Moreno Moser, who [...] "shut down every attack {{at the end of the}} race, letting me do the sprint I wanted; big thanks to Moreno <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> can return the favour soon." [...] The next win came on stage 6, the last stage of the Tour which was suited to the sprinters. The final kilometres in Bischofszell were filled with urban obstacles such as roundabouts and sharp bends, and Sagan stayed with the head of the bunch. With 200 metres to go, Sagan took a left bend with a small patch of cobbles in it at full speed. He scraped the barriers as he came out of the corner with 's Michael Albasini on his left, and sprinted his way to victory. When asked about the seemingly close call he had in the aforementioned turn, the Slovak answered: [...] "The finishes in the Tour de Suisse are never straight so you need to invent something to find some space [...] ".|$|E
