Allopreening helps to reduce parasites, and it may also have important social functions. Frequency of allopreening a neighbour correlates well with current breeding success.

His highest Test score of 24 against Pakistan featured several airborne boundaries off Wasim Akram.

25|$|Early {{reports of}} sex {{reassignment}} surgery {{had been published}} in Germany in the 1920s, {{but it was not}} until approximately three decades later that the practice became more generally known; early surgeries were performed mostly in Europe and Casablanca. Burou operated his sex reassignment clinic, called “Clinique du Parc”, out of Casablanca and in 1973 reported his experience with over 3000 individual cases. Between 1956 and 1958 Burou independently developed the anteriorly pedicled penile skin flap inversion vaginoplasty in his clinic. The technique became the “gold standard” of skin-lined vaginoplasty in transsexuals. Burou performed well over 800 confirmed vaginoplasties by 1974. That year, he published his technique for the first time, and presented it at the Second Interdisciplinary Symposium on Gender Dysphoria syndrome.

25|$|The city of Kaifeng grew to {{be a major}} hub, later {{becoming}} the capital of the Song dynasty (960–1279). Although the Tang and Song dynasty international seaports—the greatest being Guangzhou and Quanzhou, respectively—and maritime foreign trade brought merchants great fortune, it was the Grand Canal within China that spurred the greatest amount of economic activity and commercial profit. During the Song and earlier periods, barge ships occasionally crashed and wrecked along the Shanyang Yundao section of the Grand Canal while passing the double slipways, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> not those were then robbed of the tax grain by local bandits. This prompted Qiao Weiyue, an Assistant Commissioner of Transport for Huainan, to invent a double-gate system known as the pound lock in the year 984. This allowed ships to wait within a gated space while the water could be drained to appropriate levels; the Chinese also built roofed hangars over the space to add further protection for the ships.|$|E
25|$|Every hymn {{begins with}} a verset with a {{continuous}} cantus firmus: the hymn melody is stated in long note values {{in one of the}} voices, usually the bass, while the other voices provide contrapuntal accompaniment. Other versets are only occasionally cast in this form. More frequently the 16th century motet practice is used: the hymn melody either migrates from one voice to another, with or without imitative inserts between verses, or is treated imitatively throughout the piece. In three versets (Veni Creator 3, Ave maris stella 3, and Conditor 2) the melody in one voice is accompanied by two voices that form a canon, in two (Ave maris stella 4 and Annue Christe 3) one of the voices provides a pedal point. In most versets, counterpoints to the hymn melody engage in imitation or fore-imitation, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> not they are derived from the hymn melody. All of the pieces are in four voices, except the canonic versets, which use only three.|$|E
25|$|Cappadocian, {{also known}} as Cappadocian Greek or Asia Minor Greek, is a mixed {{language}} spoken in Cappadocia (Central Turkey). The language originally diverged from the Medieval Greek of the Byzantine Empire following the Seljuq Turk victory at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. As {{a result of the}} population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s, all Cappadocian Greeks were forced to emigrate to Greece where they were resettled in various locations, primarily to Central and Northern Greece. The Cappadocians rapidly shifted to Standard Modern Greek and their language was thought to be extinct since the 1960s. In June 2005, Mark Janse (Ghent University) and Dimitris Papazachariou (University of Patras) discovered Cappadocians in Central and Northern Greece who could still speak their ancestral language fluently. Many are middle-aged, third-generation speakers who take a very positive attitude towards the language, as opposed to their parents and grandparents. The latter are much less inclined to speak Cappadocian <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> not switch to Standard Modern Greek. A survey of Cappadocian speakers and language use is currently in preparation.|$|E

25|$|In 1789, whites {{numbered}} 40,000; mulattoes {{and free}} blacks, 28,000; and black slaves, an estimated 452,000. The lowest class of society was enslaved blacks, who outnumbered whites and free {{people of color}} {{by a margin of}} over six to one. The slave population on the island totaled almost half of the one million slaves in the Caribbean by 1789. Two thirds were African-born, and they tended to be less submissive than those born in the Americas. The death rate in the Caribbean exceeded the birth rate, so imports of enslaved Africans were necessary to maintain the numbers required to work the plantations. The slave population declined {{at an annual rate of}} two to five percent, due to overwork, inadequate food and shelter, insufficient clothing and medical care, and an imbalance between the sexes, with more men than women. Some slaves were of a creole elite class of urban slaves and domestics, who worked as cooks, personal servants and artisans around the plantation house. This relatively privileged class was chiefly born in the Americas, while the under-class born in Africa labored hard, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> not, under abusive and brutal conditions.|$|E

LGBT historian Susan Stryker describes the relationships between Bannon's characters as mostly positive, satisfactory, and at times complex depictions of lesbian and gay relationships, which Bannon attributed to not {{letting go of the}} hope that she could [...] "salvage (her) own life." [...] One retrospective of lesbian pulp fiction remarked on the reasons why Bannon's books in particular were popular is because they were so different from anything else being published at the time: [...] "Bannon was implicitly challenging the prevailing belief that homosexual life was brief, episodic, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> not resulted in death...

Wilson appeared as officer Lou Solverson, Danson as sheriff Hank Larsson, and Smart as Floyd Gerhardt, the matriarch of the Gerhardt crime family. Wilson's casting was unique {{because he was}} the only performer to portray an already established character; Keith Carradine played Lou for the show's first season, set 27 years after the events of season two. As such, Hawley did not want to take cues from Carradine because Lou was [...] "at a different point" [...] in his life, although Wilson analyzed Carradine's performance to a point. Wilson was persuaded by Fargo critical accolades and commercial success; the actor said: [...] "There have been several times that you’ve given your heart and soul to an independent film <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> not it doesn’t match up to any commercial success or people seeing your film. So [...] were like, 'You need to do something that people see'." [...] Danson found learning the Minnesota accent difficult; to improve, he began practicing {{as soon as he was}} signed, often on set before filming began.
