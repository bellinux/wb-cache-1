6000|$|... "For the present, nevertheless," [...] he said, [...] "let me remain Mr. Sabin to him also. I do not <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{without a}} purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in our conversation, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> You read the newspapers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But since I am here," [...] he continued, [...] "and {{since we}} have met again, I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Your husband is trying to divorce you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{question}} before," [...] he said [...] "but Monsieur Grisson {{is anxious}} {{to hear it from}} your own lips. To how many people did <b>you</b> tell <b>this</b> little adventure of yours before you reached Paris?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{marry me}} when I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> summer, fearing <b>you</b> {{would be a}} burden to me; but {{now you want to}} share {{hardship}} and danger with me, and support me by the knowledge of your nearness. Dear, ought I to let you do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{that you are}} going away without coming to see me again. You are not displeased with me, I hope, for <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> or for any other reason? I am foolish enough to feel a little lonely sometimes. Will you take me out again when you come back?--Your affectionate ward, Juliet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite!" [...] {{said the}} Angel, with relief. [...] "I forgot to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning how the ancient custom of {{marriage}} was now regarded in the large?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louis," [...] I said, [...] "let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Presuming things {{remain as}} they are, and I act independently, {{do you intend}} to prevent my seeing Miss Delora?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] cried Constance excitedly. [...] "I must know, I must <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> is my mother's name, Jean Constance Irving, {{can it be}} {{possible}} she was your little Jeannie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, no, {{he shall}} not,' rejoined Frank. 'You see I have him secure here. But may I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> what <b>this</b> means, and whether <b>you</b> {{expected}} <b>this</b> old gentleman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't it {{be better}} policy," [...] urged Peter, [...] "to go for the better class of advertiser, who doesn't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>this</b> sort of thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> just <b>this,</b> Miss Galbraith: if you couldn't ride {{backwards}} in {{the other}} car, why do you ride backwards in this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘But for Mr. Honeythunder’s eloquence, I {{might have}} {{had no need to}} ask you what I am going to <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> Mr. Edwin Drood, sir: I think that’s the name?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{situation}} is stated," [...] he said. [...] "I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question {{as a matter}} of form. Do you recognise my right to forbid your marriage with my daughter, Mr. Ledsam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{in order}} that the {{confidence}} between us may be complete, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question, Why have you brought this matter to us, instead of leaving it to the ordinary authorities?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Fregelius, he says--and, mind <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> {{is a great}} compliment--that you {{sang and}} played till he {{felt as though he}} would cry when at last you sank down quite {{exhausted}} in a chair. Then, suddenly realising that he was very cold, and hearing the stable clock strike two, he went back to bed, and that's the end of the tale. Now you will understand why I have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> favour. I don't see why Morris and Thomas should keep it all to themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your wishing so won't put me there, my lord. If {{it would}} I {{should not be}} weak enough to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>this</b> money. Do <b>you</b> mean to comply with my request?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you haven't met Miss Conyers because she has been <b>asking</b> about <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> is my nephew Ronnie, Geraldine. I {{hope that you will}} be friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To see you," [...] she answered. [...] "I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Arnold. You wish Monsieur Feurgéres to go free. You wish to stay my hand. What price are {{you willing}} to pay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But don't {{you think}} it would be nice," [...] said the lady, [...] "if you were to come to lunch with us to-morrow? It was to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> that I inquired for you at the toll-gate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] remarked Philip, [...] "this is very interesting. Let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question, though. If {{you were}} so sure of your facts, why didn't you arrest me at once instead of just {{watching}} me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lawford turned. 'Look here, Sheila,' {{he began}} heavily, 'what about Alice? If you wired: well, it's useless to say {{anything}} more. But if <b>you</b> didn't, I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> just <b>this</b> one thing. Don't tell her!' ...|$|R
60|$|GILBEY. I didnt mean to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to do <b>this,</b> Mr Juggins. I wasnt {{thinking}} when I rang.|$|R
6000|$|Clarence's {{previous}} experience of this grim, smileless Californian chaff was not calculated to restore his confidence. He drew {{away from the}} cabin, and repeated doggedly, [...] "I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> if <b>this</b> {{was the way to}} the mines." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Majesty," [...] he said. [...] "We accept. Yet {{with your}} {{permission}} I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question. No man in Theos loves his country better than Nicholas of Reist. If he should desire to recall his words----?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} have hopes," [...] he {{acknowledged}} frankly, [...] "that I have been drawn into another mare's nest. Nevertheless, I am bound to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question, Miss Abbeway. Did you leave your room at all during last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Katie {{still held}} her mother's hand in hers, and lay {{back against the}} pillows which had been placed behind her back. 'And now, mamma,' she said at last, 'I am going to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> favour--I want to see Charley once more.' ...|$|E
50|$|To {{the noble}} soul trained in battles are {{understandable}} {{the sufferings of}} a military man destined to rot in idleness, when {{the glory of the}} Russian arms thunders over the cradle of the ancient world, over the grave of Mohammed. <b>Asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> grace, I do not seek advantages nor distinction: I only seek an opportunity to shed my blood for the glory of the Sovereign and honorably end the life granted to me, in order that after it the name criminal shall not be known.|$|R
6000|$|... "This month?" [...] His eyes beamed with pleasure. He {{enjoyed the}} {{procrastination}} {{as much as}} she did. [...] "But the month's only just begun! However! Yes, you shall have your way. I won't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> again <b>this</b> month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems so}} natural, mamma, to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>this</b> and that. I shall want nobody but {{you to be}} near me, or to do {{anything}} for me. But do not let me be troublesome. Check me if I encroach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You look honest," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps you are. Perhaps I have doubted {{you without}} a cause. But I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> question. Has it been {{suggested}} {{to you by}} any of them that you should watch us--my uncle and me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What the {{mischief}} can I {{do about}} it?" [...] Hebblethwaite demanded irritably. [...] "You are putting {{me in an}} impossible position. Let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Wyatt. Is there anything {{at the back of}} your head that the man in the street doesn't know about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There you are, you see!" [...] he declared. [...] "That's the one kink in your disposition, sir, {{which places}} you irrevocably outside {{the class to}} which Eve and I belong. Now let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> young man," [...] he went on: [...] "What is the most {{dangerous}} thing you've ever done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{all to the}} good," [...] said Smith. [...] "Now, {{the thing}} I wished to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> is <b>this.</b> The office of the paper was, until this morning, {{securely}} guarded by Comrade Brady, whose name will be familiar to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{what you}} like with me,' said the girl, turning to the men again; 'but do what I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> first, and I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to give <b>this</b> message for God Almighty's sake.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are all to de good," [...] said Psmith. [...] "Now {{the thing}} I wished to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> is <b>this.</b> The {{office of the}} paper on which I work was until this morning {{securely}} guarded by Comrade Brady, whose name will be familiar to you." ...|$|R
