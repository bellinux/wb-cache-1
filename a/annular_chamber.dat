The common disadvantages of existing techniques are as follows: continuous production difficulty, high process controlling requirement and low quality microstructure. In order to overcome those problems, the MSCP (Multielectromagnetic Stirring Continuous Preparation) process has been developed by GRINM. Experimental results show that <b>annular</b> <b>chamber</b> for feedstock production can improve the efficiency of electromagnetic stirring and reduce the difficulty of temperature grad control. Compared with single electromagnetic stirring, multi- electro magnetic stirring can achieve more uniform stirring.

It {{is based on a}} one-dimensional zero Mach number formulation where N burners are connected to a single <b>annular</b> <b>chamber.</b> A manipulation of the corresponding acoustic equations in this configuration leads to a simple dispersion relation which can be solved by hand when the interaction indices of the flame transfer function are small and numerically when they are not. This simple tool is applied to multiple cases: (1) a single burner connected to an <b>annular</b> <b>chamber</b> (N = 1), (2) two burners connected to the chamber (N = 2), and (3) four burners (N = 4). In this case, the tool also allows to study passive control methods where two different types of burners are mixed to control the azimuthal mode. Finally, a complete helicopter chamber (N = 15) is studied. For all cases, the analytical results are compared to the predictions of a full three-dimensional Helmholtz solver and a very good agreement is found. These results show that building very simple analytical tools to study azimuthal modes in annular chambers is an interesting path to control them...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThermo-acoustic {{combustion}} instabilities {{are due to}} {{the coupling}} mechanism between acoustic pressure oscillations and heat release rate fluctuations. This phenomenon is of great interest because combustion instabilities cause recurrent problems in modern gas turbines. The case of <b>annular</b> <b>chambers</b> largely diffused in gas turbines for power generation is of particular interest. In this work, the azimuthal modes of a three-dimensional <b>annular</b> combustion <b>chamber</b> are studied {{by means of a}} finite element (FEM) code. For each burner, the coupling between heat release fluctuations and the velocity fluctuations is modeled by means of a non-linear analytical Flame Describing Function (FDF) consisting of a third order and fifth order polynomial expression. A delay time between and is considered. The dissipation of acoustic energy of the system due to viscous and thermal boundary layer is directly modeled in the code. The weakly nonlinear analysis is performed to determining the bifurcation diagrams for these flame models, considering the acoustic-combustion interaction index n as the control parameter. The influence on the bifurcations diagram of the time delays (τ) and of the damping coefficient (ζ) is analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was the {{development}} of a short reverse-flow <b>annular</b> combustion <b>chamber</b> which would have an increased performance potential as well as a reduced NO_x-emission. By incorporating a short reverse-flow <b>annular</b> combustion <b>chamber,</b> a more compact gas turbine can be developed which would offer advantages for shaft and bearing design. Using a very short combustion chamber, the ratio of the flame tube length to the flame tube height was 1. 63. The reduced length was achieved by optimising the fuel injection system (air blast atomizer) and the design of the primary zone. The lean stability limit, the ignition and the temperature distribution of the exit of the combustion chamber correspond the specified values. NO_x-emissions, due to the high residence time of the reverse-flow <b>annular</b> combustion <b>chamber,</b> are difficult to reduce. However, a noticeable reductin can be achieved by placing emphasis on the choice of active fuel nozzles, variable combustion chamber geometry or use of a dual burner system. (orig.)

40|$|Pollutant {{emissions}} restrictions {{have driven}} gas turbine manufacturers to employ {{new technologies and}} to operate these systems in extreme operating conditions. These operating conditions produce in some cases combustion instabilities which can have dramatic effects for the turbine. Extended experimental and numerical studies are then required to analyze the possible behavior of the end design. Unfortunately tests on the real set-up are not possible and simplified cases are used. Although gas turbines can contain up to 30 burners blowing into the same <b>annular</b> <b>chamber,</b> tests in laboratories are often performed on one single burner. This simplification obviously suppresses two mechanisms: burner/burner interaction {{and the possibility of}} acoustic azimuthal modes of the full <b>annular</b> <b>chamber.</b> The objective of this thesis is to use Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to investigate whether these mechanisms are important or not. An additional issue considered is the effect of the pilot fuel injection on flame stability. First, the influence of a pilot flame on the flame stabilization of a laboratory scale burner is studied. Then, using a numerical method developed during this thesis, the impact of an azimuthal mode on a turbine is analyzed using single burner LES. A LES of a triple burner configuration is presented and the impact of the side burners on the central burner analyzed. To finish, the feasibility of full chamber LES is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The {{pneumatic}} conveying of bulk solid materials by {{the generation of}} a partial vacuum or negative pressure is the oldest form of conveying such materials through pipelines. It was developed approximately {{one hundred years ago}} to assist the rapid unloading of wheat grain from ships, barges and lighters in the London docks. However, the basic design of the device for entraining the bulk solid into the conveying pipeline has changed very little since those times. This thesis examines the effect of entrainment mechanisms in co-axial tube type suction nozzles on the performance of such conveying systems. The normal design of such nozzles is one where the inner conveying tube is retracted inside the outer tube. The work has demonstrated that with this configuration, high air velocities are necessary to effect entrainment of material beneath the nozzle into the conveying pipeline. By rearranging the nozzle so that the inner tube protrudes from the outer tube, a configuration can be obtained where, for free flowing products, the material flows readily under the action of gravity into the entraining airstream flowing down the <b>annular</b> <b>chamber</b> formed by the two tubes. The work has demonstrated that, for a given air flow rate, the product feed rate, and hence system throughput will be maximised by arranging these tubes such that the angle formed by them in the entrainment region is greater than the angle at which the product flows under the action of gravity into this region. Since a lower air flow rate and hence power consumption is required to achieve a given system throughput, this configuration has been identified as a more efficient entrainment mechanism than that associated with the usual configuration of suction nozzles. The effect of throttling the air flowing down the <b>annular</b> <b>chamber</b> on product entrainment into such nozzles is also identified and presented...|$|E

40|$|As turbine and {{rocket engine}} {{technology}} matures, performance increases between successive generations of engine development are becoming smaller. One means of accomplishing significant gains in thermodynamic performance and power density {{is to use}} detonation-based heat release instead of deflagration. This work is focused on developing and applying theoretical models {{to aid in the}} design and understanding of Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs). In an RDE, a detonation wave travels circumferentially along the bottom of an <b>annular</b> <b>chamber</b> where continuous injection of fresh reactants sustains the detonation wave. RDEs are currently being designed, tested, and studied as a viable option for developing a new generation of turbine and rocket engines that make use of detonation heat release. One of the main challenges in the development of RDEs is to understand the complex flowfield inside the <b>annular</b> <b>chamber.</b> While simplified models are desirable for obtaining timely performance estimates for design analysis, one-dimensional models may not be adequate as they do not provide flow structure information. In this work, a two-dimensional physics-based model is developed, which is capable of modeling the curved oblique shock wave, exit swirl, counter-flow, detonation inclination, and varying pressure along the inflow boundary. This is accomplished by using a combination of shock-expansion theory, Chapman-Jouguet detonation theory, the Method of Characteristics (MOC), and other compressible flow equations to create a shock-fitted numerical algorithm and generate an RDE flowfield. This novel approach provides a numerically efficient model that can provide performance estimates as well as details of the large-scale flow structures in seconds on a personal computer. Results from this model are validated against high-fidelity numerical simulations that may require a high-performance computing framework to provide similar performance estimates. This work provides a designer a new tool to conduct large-scale parametric studies to optimize a design space before conducting computationally-intensive, high-fidelity simulations that may be used to examine additional effects. The work presented in this thesis not only bridges the gap between simple one-dimensional models and high-fidelity full numerical simulations, but it also provides an effective tool for understanding and exploring RDE flow processes...|$|E
