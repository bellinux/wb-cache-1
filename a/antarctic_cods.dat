The accident left the vessel holed below the waterline and sinking close to the Ross Ice Shelf and approximately 2,000 nmi km south-east of New Zealand. The Royal New Zealand Air Force twice sent Hercules aircraft on seven-hour flights from Christchurch to air-drop equipment. (The planes had to refuel at McMurdo Station in Antarctica before returning to base.)

5000|$|Dissostichus mawsoni, the Antarctic toothfish, is {{a species}} of cod icefish native to the Southern Ocean. It is often mistakenly {{referred}} to as an <b>Antarctic</b> <b>cod,</b> consistent with the misnaming of other notothenioid Antarctic fish as rock cods. However, notothenioid fishes are unrelated to cods, which are in another taxonomic order, the Gadiformes. The generic name Dissostichus is from the Greek dissos (twofold) and stichus (line) and refers {{to the presence of}} two long lateral lines, which are very important to the species’ ecology. The common name [...] "toothfish" [...] refers to the presence of biserial dentition in the upper jaw, thought to give it a shark-like appearance. The habitat of the Antarctic toothfish is in subzero degree water below latitude 60°S.|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} nature underlying intermolecular interactions between two rod-like winter flounder antifreeze protein (AFP) molecules and their implication for {{the mechanism of}} antifreeze function are examined in this work using molecular dynamics simulations, augmented with free energy calculations employing a continuum solvation model. The energetics for different modes of interactions of two AFP molecules is examined in both vacuum and aqueous phases along with the water distribution in the region encapsulated by two antiparallel AFP backbones. The results show that in a vacuum two AFP molecules intrinsically attract {{each other in the}} antiparallel fashion, where their complementary charge side chains face each other directly. In the aqueous environment, this attraction is counteracted by both screening and entropic effects. Therefore, two nearly energetically degenerate states, an aggregated state and a dissociated state, result as a new aspect of intermolecular interaction in the paradigm for the mechanism of action of AFP. The relevance of these findings to the mechanism of function of freezing inhibition in the context of our work on <b>Antarctic</b> <b>cod</b> antifreeze glycoprotein (Nguyen et al., Biophysical Journal, 2002, Vol. 82, pp. 2892 - 2905) is discussed.

40|$|The 1 H and 13 C NMR {{spectra of}} a 14 -residue {{antifreeze}} glycopeptide from <b>Antarctic</b> <b>cod</b> (Tetramatomnus borchgrevinki) containing two proline residues have been assigned. 13 C NMR relaxation experiments indicate motional anisotropy of the peptide, with a tumbling time in water at 5 degrees C of 3 - 4 ns. The relaxation data {{and lack of}} long-range NOEs are consistent with a linear peptide undergoing significant segmental motion. However, extreme values of some coupling constants and strong sequential NOEs indicate regions of local order, which are most evident at the two ATPA subsequences. Similar spectroscopic properties were observed in the 16 -residue analogue containing an Arg-Ala dipeptide added to the C-terminus. Molecular modeling also showed no evidence of long-range order, but the two ATPA subsequences were relatively well determined by the experimental data. These motifs were quite distinct from helical structures or beta turns commonly found in proteins, but rather resemble sections of an extended polyproline helix. Thus, the NMR data provide {{a description of the}} local order, which is of relevance to the mechanism of action of the antifreeze activity of the antifreeze glycopeptides as well as their ability to protect cells during hypothermic storage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe 1 H- and 13 C-NMR {{spectra of}} {{antifreeze}} glycoprotein fractions 1 – 5 from <b>Antarctic</b> <b>cod</b> have been assigned, and the dynamics have been measured using 13 C relaxation at two temperatures. The chemical shifts and absence of non-sequential 1 H- 1 H NOEs are inconsistent with a folded, compact structure. 13 C relaxation measurements {{show that the}} protein has no significant long-range order, and that the local correlation times are adequately described by a random coil model. Hydroxyl protons of the sugar residues were observed at low temperature, {{and the presence of}} exchange-mediated ROEs to the sugar indicate extensive hydration. The conformational properties of AFGP 1 – 5 are compared with those of the previously examined 14 -mer analog AFGP 8, which contains proline residues in place of some alanine residues (Lane, A. N., L. M. Hays, R. E. Feeney, L. M. Crowe, and J. H. Crowe. 1998. Protein Sci. 7 : 1555 – 1563). The infrared (IR) spectra of AFGP 8 and AFGP 1 – 5 in the amide I region are quite different. The presence of a wide distribution of backbone torsion angles in AFGP 1 – 5 leads to a rich spectrum of frequencies in the IR spectrum, as interconversion among conformational states is slow on the IR frequency time scale. However, these transitions are fast on the NMR chemical shift time scales. The restricted motions for AFGP 8 may imply a narrower distribution of possible ø, ψ angles, as is observed in the IR spectrum. This has significance for attempts to quantify secondary structures of proteins by IR in the presence of extensive loops...|$|R

During the contralateral contraction, muscle fibres were stretched (by 5 % and 7 % at 0. 35 L and 0. 65 L, respectively) and were activated prior {{to the end of}} lengthening, before shortening by up to 12 % of resting fibre length (peak-to-peak strain).

40|$|A {{quantitative}} Histological Health Index (HHI) {{was applied}} to <b>Antarctic</b> rock <b>cod</b> (Trematomus bernacchii) using gill, liver, spleen, kidney and gonad {{to assess the impact}} of wastewater effluent from Davis Station, East Antarctica. A total of 120 fish were collected from 6 sites in the Prydz Bay region of East Antarctica at varying distances from the wastewater outfall. The HHI revealed a greater severity of alteration in fish at the wastewater outfall, which decreased stepwise with distance. Gill and liver displayed the greatest severity of alteration in fish occurring in close proximity to the wastewater outfall, showing severe and pronounced alteration respectively. Findings of the HHI add to a growing weight of evidence indicating that the current level of wastewater treatment at Davis Station is insufficient to prevent impact to the surrounding environment. The HHI for T.  bernacchii developed in this study is recommended as a useful risk assessment tool for assessing in situ, sub-lethal impacts from station-derived contamination in coastal regions throughout Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope ratios, δ 15 N and δ 13 C were {{effectively}} used {{to determine}} the geographical dispersion of human derived sewage from Davis Station, East Antarctica, using <b>Antarctic</b> rock <b>cod</b> (Trematomus bernacchii). Fish within 0 - 4 km downstream of the outfall exhibited higher δ 15 N and δ 13 C values relative to reference sites. Nitrogen in particular showed a stepped decrease in δ 15 N with increasing distance from the discharge point by 1 - 2 ‰. Stable isotopes were better able to detect the extent of wastewater contamination than other techniques including faecal coliform and sterol measures. Uptake and assimilation of δ 15 N and δ 13 C up to 4 km from the outfall adds to growing evidence indicating the current level of wastewater treatment at Davis Station is not sufficient to avoid impact to the surrounding environment.

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{associated}} with cellular cryopreservation is {{the recovery of}} cellular viability upon thawing. Current cryopreservation techniques use additives such as DMSO, sucrose and fetal bovine serum. However, each have their own respective cytotoxic issues. A significant factor in cryotoxicity is the formation of large ice crystals which can damage cellular components and cause dehydration. This has significant impacts for applications such as food preservation, scientific research, and tissue preservation. To this end, our laboratory is interested in synthesizing biologically-relevant compounds that can act as cryoprotectants by preventing the formation of large ice crystals in sub-zero temperatures. Our lab has previously synthesized structural analogues of native antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs, found {{in the blood of}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>cod),</b> that possess the unique ability to inhibit ice-recrystallization. However, the mechanism by which they inhibit ice recrystallization is unclear. This thesis focuses on efforts made to understand this mechanism, and synthesize molecules that are more potent in ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity compared to previously synthesized analogues. By assessing the IRI activity of various mono- and disaccharides, we have shown that the density of water molecules that surround a carbohydrate (Hydration Index) is directly proportional to the ability of sugars to inhibit ice crystal growth. In an effort to design functional AFGP analogues, various C-linked analogues were synthesized that contained different spacer lengths between the carbohydrate and the peptide backbone. Analyses of the solution conformations of these analogues showed that IRI-active AFGP analogues contain a distinct conformation in which the carbohydrate is oriented to form a hydrophobic pocket with the side chain. We hypothesize that this change in glycoconjugate hydration is responsible for disturbing its surrounding waters, thereby preventing water from adding to the ice lattice required for ice growth. Finally, SAR studies showed that threonine-containing AFGP and antifreeze proteins are more potent in antifreeze activity than serine-containing analogues. As the most potent AFGP analogue previously synthesized by our lab contains a C-linked-α-galactosyl -serine residue, we hypothesized that the analogous glycopeptide containing a C-α-galactosyl-threonine residue will be more potent in antifreeze activity. The final section describes efforts to synthesize a C-linked α-galactosyl-threonine glycoconjugate...|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} season 2009 / 10, a {{comprehensive}} {{environmental impact assessment}} of the sewage discharge was conducted at Davis Station in the Vestfold Hills region of East Antarctica. As part of this project, {{a survey of the}} histology of liver, gill, gonad and muscle tissues in the <b>Antarctic</b> rock <b>cod</b> Trematomus bernacchii from nearshore sites in the receiving environment close to Davis Station in was completed. Fish from 4 sites were examined; 1 site adjacent to the Davis Station sewage outfall (within 500 m of the point of discharge), 2 sites approximately 2 km from the outfall (Anchorage Island and Antennae farm), and 1 site approximately 10 km away from the outfall and adjacent to an Adelie penguin population (Kazak Island). All fish sampled from the sewage outfall site exhibited significant histological alterations in all major tissues. Fish from the other 3 sites showed some alterations in either gill and/or liver tissues. Pathological abnormalities present in all fish collected near the sewage outfall included: extensive multifocal cysts of unknown etiology with necrotic liquification; multifocal granuloma with associated inflammation; coagulative necrosis in the liver; and lamellar hyperplasia with associated proliferation and lamella fusion of the gills.

40|$|Biological {{effects of}} {{chemical}} mixtures are an emerging issue when using biomarkers in field conditions, because synergistic or inhibitory interactions, cascade, and indirect mechanisms can both enhance or suppress responses to specific classes of pollutants. The <b>Antarctic</b> rock <b>cod</b> (Trematomus bernacchii) {{was exposed to}} various trace metals (Cu, Hg, Ni, and Pb) and to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), dosed alone or in combination, to generate hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of action at the cellular level. Concentrations of metals significantly increased in liver of T. bernacchii without significant differences between organisms exposed only to the elements or cotreated with TCDD. The marked induction of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) by TCDD was greatly suppressed by cotreatment with Cu at both catalytic and protein expression levels, whereas no significant effects were caused by coexposures with Hg, Ni, and Pb. The oxidative status was measured by integrating individual antioxidants with the total oxyradical scavenging capacity toward peroxyl radicals (ROO center dot) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Synergistic oxidative effects appeared in fish coexposed to Cu and TCDD, suggesting that biotransformation efficiency is down-regulated by higher levels of hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and/or mechanisms limiting availability of heme groups. Major oxidative perturbations also were observed in organisms coexposed to TCDD and Hg; in these organisms, however, the marked increase of glutathione content could explain the absence of oxidative inhibition of the CYP system. More limited oxidative effects were caused by Ni and Pb, and the contemporary absence of inhibitory effects on CYP would further confirm the importance of pro-oxidant mechanisms in modulating the biotransformation pathway. The overall results indicate that a wide battery of biomarkers is necessary {{to assess the impact}} of chemical mixtures in field condition...|$|R

In the present study, the Antarctic fan worm Perkinsiana littoralis was shown to hyperaccumulate vanadium in the branchial tissues, and the hypothesis of an antipredatory strategy has been investigated Trace metals (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V, Zn) were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in tissues of P. littoralis and, only for V, in two Antarctic bivalves and in various Mediterranean polychaetes. Subcellular distribution of vanadium was investigated in P. littoralis after differential centrifugations; feeding trials with the <b>Antarctic</b> rock <b>cod</b> Trematomus berancchii were performed to test the palatability of P. littoralis Analyses of trace metals in tissues of P. littoralis confirmed the naturally high bioavailability of cadmium due to upwelling phenomena in the investigated area and revealed extremely high concentrations of vanadium up to 10, 000 A mu g/g, in the branchial crowns; much lower concentrations were measured in the body portions and even less in the Antarctic bivalves and in Mediterranean polychaetes. The subcellular distribution indicated that this metal was associated in branchial crowns with both heavy components and vanadium binding proteins; the latter predominated in body tissues, although with a different pattern of molecular weight. Feeding trials suggested that the elevated levels of vanadium in branchial crown of P. littoralis act as chemical deterrents against predation in more exposed tissues The hyperaccumulation of toxic metals might represent a common antipredatory strategy for unpalatable branchial crowns of sabellid polychaetes, as recently hypothesized also for the high concentrations of arsenic in the Mediterranean Sabella spallanzanii. The evolution of such adaptation and the reasons behind the possibility for different species to accumulate different metals represent a stimulating field of investigation for future studies...|$|R

During the early phase of shortening, muscle shortening velocity (V) increased dramatically whilst the load was relatively Some constant and represented a substantial fraction of the maximum isometric stress, Pre-stretch of active muscle was associated with significant force enhancement, For the contralateral contraction, V exceeded that predicted by the steady-state force-velocity relationship for considerable periods during each tailbeat, contributing to relatively high maximum instantaneous power outputs of up to 290 W kg(- 1) wet muscle mass. In vitro experiments, involving adjusting strain, cycle duration and stimulation parameters, indicated that in vivo muscle fibres produce close to their maximum power, During escape responses, the maximum velocity and acceleration recorded from the centre of gravity of the fish were 0. 71 +/- 0. 03 m s(- 1) and 17. 1 +/- 1. 4 m s(- 2), respectively (mean+/-S.

40|$|All fish, {{and other}} motile fishery resources, make migrations. These range from tens or {{hundreds}} of metres to large-scale oceanic migrations over thousands of kilometres. Migrations are usually cyclical over time scales from diurnal to annual or longer. Diurnal migrations are driven by the light/dark cycle and seem to have evolved to balance the requirement to feed against the risk of predation. The major seasonal migrations have evolved because of the differing habitat requirements for breeding and feeding, and in the oceans these migrations are linked to prevailing current patterns. There is considerable concern in world fisheries about the top-down effects of exploitation of marine resources because approximately {{one third of the}} world’s fishery resources are either fully or over exploited. However, there are also bottom-up effects, driven by pollution and manifestations of global climate change, which are increasingly recognized to be important drivers of change in the world’s fisheries. Changing ocean current systems at the surface which might be caused by global climate change have the potential to cause disruption of migration patterns and prevent the successful completion of life cycles. Bottom-up effects of variable environments on populations of migratory species such as Atlantic <b>cod,</b> <b>Antarctic</b> krill and shortfm squid have been identified and provide different kinds of examples of how changing oceanographic conditions can drive change in exploited stocks. Examples of this kind of variability provide valuable insights into the likely effects of large-scale ecological change on the world’s fisheries...|$|R
