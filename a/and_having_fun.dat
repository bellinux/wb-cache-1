(Note, however, {{that there are some}} errors in the mathematical calculations done in the study, and the study is statistically invalid as it uses the convenience sampling method.) Women's goals tend to be more relationship-oriented than men’s goals. Also, unlike men, women are usually more reserved {{when it comes to the}} sexual aspect and having sex. Women are more likely to express companionship, friendship, and romantic relationship goals than men and are also more likely to consider the first date in terms of their relational implications than men.|$|E

Squall retaliates with a backhand slash that leaves Seifer with a mirrored scar. At the following field exam in Dollet, Seifer acts independently from his teammates Squall and Zell, abandoning them; consequently, he fails and is not promoted to SeeD. Spurred by dreams of a brighter future, he defects to Sorceress Edea so he could be her [...] "knight". From his point of view, Squall and the others are [...] "evil" [...] and he recognizes himself as a hero. As Seifer is brainwashed by the sorceress, he alienates himself from his friends.

In a review by CD Journal, an editor agreed, and also noted the songs style as [...] "80s nostalgic" [...] and [...] "ultra-pop". Conversely, Kyle from Arama Japan noticed its strong influence of house music, and branded it a [...] "J-electro" [...] track.

500|$|When {{five members}} of Shiny Entertainment's MDK {{development}} team broke off to set up Planet Moon Studios in 1997 with software engineer, Scott Guest, they decided to make their first project fun and original, a game with graphics and gameplay unseen at that time. Nick Bruty, Bob Stevenson, and Tim Williams initially conceived the idea of pitting players as spacemen, pirates, and giants against each other <b>and</b> <b>having</b> <b>fun.</b> Initially projected for release in late 1999, the game suffered delays to its development {{largely due to the}} illness of their chief programmer, Andy Astor; he was suffering from stage IV mantle cell lymphoma in late 1999. The team realized they needed more resources and by 2000, they had hired two more programmers and an artist. Producing a next-generation game required them to keep up with 1998–2000's rapid advancement of technology, which resulted in further delays. The team upsized the graphic textures as they changed the graphical software to support NVIDIA graphics cards. Within a year after development started in 1999, the initial minimum graphics specification climbed from requiring [...] graphics cards to those of the GeForce-series. Planet Moon deemed game engines available during development too restrictive and inappropriate for their requirements, and built their own. Called Amityville, it could support Glide, OpenGL, and Direct3D. The team used it to create the required [...] "lush and vibrant" [...] outdoor environments, and terrain deformation effects.|$|E

Several gossip websites and local media sources identified the act as Spears, prompting the show to quickly sell out. The title, [...] "M+M's" [...] code name was claimed to be Mother (after having two children) and Miss (after being divorced).
