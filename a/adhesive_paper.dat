25|$|A {{lint roller}} or lint remover is {{a roll of}} one-sided <b>adhesive</b> <b>paper</b> on a {{cardboard}} or plastic barrel that is mounted on a central spindle, with an attached handle. The device facilitates the removal of lint or other small fibers from most materials such as clothing, upholstery and linen. The lint roller was co-invented in 1956 by American electrical engineer Nicholas McKay and his wife Helen.|$|E

So on 3 April 1973, the IBM UPC was selected as the NAFC standard. IBM had designed five versions of UPC symbology for future industry requirements: UPC A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E

50|$|Starch {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of various adhesives or glues for book-binding, wallpaper <b>adhesives,</b> <b>paper</b> sack production, tube winding, gummed <b>paper,</b> envelope <b>adhesives,</b> school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as yellow dextrins, can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or soda ash, which are mixed with the starch solution at 50 - 70 C to create a very good adhesive. Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula.|$|R

5000|$|By the 20th century a {{small circle}} of red <b>adhesive</b> <b>paper</b> affixed to the {{document}} in question was sufficient when an individual had to use a seal.

30|$|Original {{scientific}} papers or reviews {{listed in}} the Medline or ISI Web of Science databases from 1981 to 2013 were searched electronically using the following key words: endodontically-treated teeth, glass-fiber post, dentistry, resin cement, silane, and <b>adhesive.</b> <b>Papers</b> published in all languages were selected, and the most up-to-date or relevant references were chosen. Additionally, the cross-referencing of important papers identified those of historical value, which were also selected. Although papers written in all languages were considered, all the relevant studies were written in the English language. In order to discuss each item from the clinical use perspective, {{the results from the}} literature search were divided into the following six subcategories: reasons for the use of posts in dentistry; post selection criteria: glass-fiber posts; bonding systems; luting agents; post surface treatments; and critical clinical points.|$|R

5000|$|In England and Wales, {{the common}} law courts {{originally}} recognised only wax seals, but this requirement was gradually relaxed. By the 20th century a small circle of red <b>adhesive</b> <b>paper</b> affixed to the document in question was sufficient when an individual had to use a seal (most commonly on a contract {{for the sale of}} land), although the courts also held that a circle containing the letters [...] "L.S." [...] was adequate. The common law rule which required that a deed made by a private individual had to be sealed to be validly executed was finally abolished in 1989 by the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989. The Act implemented recommendations made by the Law Commission of England and Wales in their 1987 report Deeds and Escrows and replaced seals with the requirements that the document had to explicitly state that it was being executed as a deed, and had to be witnessed. [...] With regard to companies and other corporate bodies, {{the common law}} originally required that all contracts made by such a body had to be made under seal, whether they were deeds or not. This rule was gradually eroded away, for example being abolished in respect of companies by the Companies Acts {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, but until 1960 remained in force for other corporations. It was abolished by the Corporate Bodies' Contracts Act 1960. Normal contracts (i.e. not deeds) can now be made by a corporation in the same way as they can be made by an individual. The Companies Act 1989 removed the requirement for a company to have a common seal at all, and made provision for those documents which had previously needed to be executed under seal, such as deeds, to instead be executed by officers of the company. However companies can still have and continue to use seals to execute deeds if they wish, in which case the seal has to be engraved (i.e., a seal which leaves an impression on the page, not printed or a wafer facsimile) and to bear the name of the company. Some other corporations (which are not companies registered under the Companies Acts) are still required to have and use seals. For example, the Royal Charter incorporating the Royal College of Nursing requires the College to have a common seal, as does that of the BBC. [...] Also, the changes relating to deeds which were introduced in 1989 do not apply to corporations sole such as government ministers or bishops of the Church of England. Therefore, where a corporation sole has to execute a deed, it continues to have to do so by the use of an official seal.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} housing, solid {{structural}} design is vital in ensuring objects remain undamaged while stationary. This includes accounting for padding {{and support of}} the objects to prevent damage from bumps and snags, and stable display cases or mounts, which often requires collaboration with a mount maker to ensure proper creation and installation. Stands, shelves, drawers, and cases, in addition to fasteners, <b>adhesives,</b> <b>papers,</b> and foams, must all be chosen based on their compatibility with the structural design and materials of each individual object. The collections management policy should outline housing specifications {{such as the use of}} acid-free (pH neutral) and dye-free materials; types of enclosed cabinetry where available; appropriate coverings such as fabrics (e.g. unbleached muslin), polyethylene sheeting, and closed-cell foam (e.g. Ethafoam); containers made of paper, plastic, wood, or metal; enclosures such as folders or mats; and standards for frames, supports, and mounts.|$|R
50|$|A {{critical}} {{difference among}} wheat pastes is {{the division between}} those made from flour and those made from starch. Vegetable flours contain both gluten and starch.
