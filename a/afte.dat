2500|$|Robert Umfraville's {{career was}} {{predominantly}} a military one. The chronicler John Hardyng (who {{was in the}} service of Umfraville from 1403 to Umfraville's death) reports that Umfraville fough at the Battle of Otterburn in 1388, as part of the contingent of Henry Hotspur (the son of the earl of Northumberland). This, says Hardyng, was followed by the first of many border raids Umfraville led into Scotland in 1390. These continued following the deposition of King Richard II, and he probably took part in the Battle of Homildon Hill in 1402. In fact, notwithstanding the regime change of 1399, Umfraville's duties remained very much unchanged, and the [...] "old truths remained:royal service, local administration and the defence of the realm." [...] He was indentured to join Henry IV's invasion of Scotland in 1400, which came to very little; Umfraville did, however, inflict a subsequent defeat on a large Scots army at Fulhope Law, capturing some Scottish lords <b>afte</b> they attempted a raid. He continued in defence of the border through the next decade, and his expertise in local politics helped him advise the Warden of the Eastern March, the king's son, John, Duke of Lancaster. Umfraville probably acted in the capacity of 'sub-warden' to the duke, in the now by now largely defunct 'middle march.' In 1407, with his young nephew Gilbert Umfraville, he attended, as a tenant-in-chief, the enthronement of the new Bishop of Durham, Thomas Langley.|$|E

There she developed and patented a physiological training system called Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (<b>AFTE),</b> which enables people to learn voluntary self-control of up to 24 bodily responses in six hours. Her work was first tested in 1985 for (STS 51-b & STS 51c) Spacelab-3 and the first DOD shuttle mission. She tested her <b>AFTE</b> training method also on the Space J-Lab Mission (the first Japanese shuttle mission), with her work focusing on ridding of the astronaut's motion sickness. Later she trained four cosmonauts to control both motion sickness and low blood pressure after six-months in space aboard the MIR space station. She found success, and continued to teach people how to control motion sickness, improve performance of search & rescue pilots, and reduce symptoms of several patient populations suffering from nausea, dizziness and fainting. She has helped author several publications with her husband, William B. Toscano. They have a son, Christopher Michael Cowings Toscano, who traveled with them as they trained space crews.|$|E

Five {{years after they}} moved to Virginia, in 1915, the Falls Church town council passed an ordinance to create segregated districts within the town. Dr. Henderson, Joseph Tinner and seven other community members, formed the Colored Citizens Protective League, and started a letter writing campaign to address the council and this ordinance. Dr. Henderson and his wife, Mary Ellen, {{were members of the}} NAACP, in Washington, D.C., so, they also wrote a letter to W. E. B.
