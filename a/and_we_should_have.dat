2500|$|Rob Lytle {{rushed for}} 153 {{yards in the}} game to pass Gordon Bell at the number two {{position}} on Michigan's career rushing yardage list. [...] Purdue rushed for 251 yards in the game, including 162 yards by Dierking. [...] After the game, Bo Schembechler told reporters, [...] "It hurts a lot. [...] We don't accept it[...] [...] [...] We shouldn't accept it [...] [...] [...] because we should have won. [...] No defeat is good. [...] we got down {{there at the end}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> scored. [...] But when you depend on winning on a forward pass or a field goal, you're in trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 15, 2011, Schultz used an edited {{video clip}} of Texas Governor Rick Perry {{at a rally}} talking about the {{national}} debt crisis. Governor Perry said [...] "getting America back to work {{is the most important}} issue that faces this country, being able to pay off $14.5 trillion or $16 trillion worth of debt. That big black cloud that hangs over America, that debt that is so monstrous." [...] The audio of the clip was cut off after [...] "America", so Schultz's audience did not hear [...] "that debt that is so monstrous". Governor Perry refers to the debt before and after the [...] "big black cloud" [...] statement. Schultz said, [...] "That black cloud Perry is talking about is President Barack Obama." [...] The following day on his TV show Schultz apologized for taking Governor Perry out of context. [...] "We did not present the full context of those statements <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> ... No doubt about it, it was a mistake and we regret the error ... we should not have included it in our coverage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fore George," [...] quoth Crispin, [...] "I was no {{more than}} in time. Another second, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had him, too, unconscious. There, he is recovering." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{believe he}} did it because he felt <b>we</b> <b>should</b> resent being left out: <b>and</b> so <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> Mr. Cooke's {{instincts}} were delicate.|$|R
60|$|If we had forty theatres of {{this kind}} {{in this city of}} four millions, how they would educate <b>and</b> elevate! <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a body of educated theatre-goers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I wish papa had not yielded," [...] said Ethel. [...] "It {{would have}} been just as noble in dear Norman, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> the {{apparent}} disgrace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought there}} might be just a chance that she hailed from Progresso, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> no trouble in persuading them to do as we wished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, for I had no {{idea you}} could be so far up this way, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> left the {{locality}} {{as soon as the}} wind would permit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma and Emily {{say it is}} all the same. We are as safe in our cellar as {{we could}} be anywhere, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to pay elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know this, {{that if you}} had {{not been}} what you are, my boy would have borne a dishonoured name, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> been {{together}} as now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing at all. Why {{do you ask}} such silly questions? I {{only meant}} that if I <b>had</b> married I <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> been here, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> met again." ...|$|R
6000|$|I groaned. [...] "Dear me!" [...] I said. [...] "I suppose if {{they did}} that they would also bring up old Mr. Scott's mother, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a united family." ...|$|R
6000|$|If I had replied meekly by an {{unqualified}} affirmative, I {{believe he would}} have stretched out his hand, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been friends on the spot, but I answered-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Milton and Allardyce both {{thought he}} {{deserved}} it. If he'd been playing instead of Rand-Brown, they wouldn't have scored at all probably, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{got one more}} try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care; {{he would}} have married her all the same, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> made her so happy at Maplewood. I hate the place! I wish it were at Jericho!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} {{to us that}} we might have some difficulty in utilizing this smile in our present affairs, <b>and</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> probably preferred something more assuring, but Captain Jim's faith was contagious.|$|R
5000|$|... 'We should {{almost never}} take {{antisemitism}} seriously, <b>and</b> maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{some fun with}} it. I think it is particularly unimportant to the Israel-Palestine conflict, except perhaps as a diversion from the real issues." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>and</b> there <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{tried the}} thing out, {{for he was}} effervescing with fight, but {{fortunately}} I was rescued from an odious situation. A policeman was beside us, his notebook in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is first-rate, O'Grady," [...] Major Harrison said; [...] "the {{place is}} crowded down below, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> fared very badly {{if you had}} not managed {{to get hold of}} this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} {{ought to}} share it," [...] the captain said; [...] "for {{if it had}} not been for you, matters would have gone all the other way, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> undoubtedly been captured." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish there}} were {{no such thing as}} coal in the land," [...] said his wife, [...] "and then the engines {{would not be able to}} work; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> our rights again." ...|$|E
2500|$|... n bounded that jolly, fat {{and funny}} old elf, Santa Claus. His array was indescribably fantastic. He {{seemed to have}} done his best; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> think, <b>had</b> Mrs. Santa Claus to help him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come,' said Miss Ledrook, 'it's {{high time}} we were there, or we shall have poor Mrs Snevellicci {{thinking}} that you have run away with her daughter, Mr Johnson; <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a pretty to-do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No buts, no buts. You {{would come}} to the laundry girls, and the cooking-class, and all the rest with me, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> a dreary moment. Have you done {{fiddling}} over those flowers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad {{news came}} in {{yesterday}} evening, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> come straight over {{if it had}} been possible, but Mr. Mitford would not let us leave till morning. We have been very anxious about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible, my love; we {{must have}} heard of him on the way; had he gone round by Montrenil, he must still have passed over the bridge of Fouchard, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> heard of him there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is plain," [...] they said, [...] "that the Griffin {{intended}} {{at last to}} go {{and look}} for him, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been saved. Now who can tell what misery you have brought upon us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{we had a}} {{very good}} time," [...] said Rollo, [...] "till we came to put our curiosities away; <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had a good time if the boys had not pushed so, and made such a noise." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; but you see, Roger, {{the spirits}} who, as they say, serve him, cannot be of much use; {{or they would}} have warned him of the coming of Talbot, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> taken him unawares, this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} are but just in time, corporal. The {{population}} of the villages are evidently fleeing before the advance of the Spaniards. Another day <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been too late {{to get into the}} town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why so, Muley? They {{would have}} water {{close to them}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> none. If one was wounded {{he would have to}} be carried a long distance. Why do you advise that we should fight them there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! sink a man-of-war's boat!" [...] exclaimed Gascoyne; [...] "why, {{that would}} make them set us down as pirates at once, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to run the {{gauntlet}} of half the British navy before this time next year." ...|$|E
6000|$|Katie came in next. 'Oh! Harry, it's {{so lucky}} we didn't {{start in the}} punt,' said she, 'for it's going to pour, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> never <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been back from the island in that slow thing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course you'd give way, <b>and</b> {{of course}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{the young woman}} here, <b>and</b> of course <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{make the best of}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{they can}} hardly be called serviceable," [...] the master agreed. [...] "I spoke to the owner about it, {{but he said that}} as we were going to sail with a convoy it did not matter, <b>and</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> some others for the next voyage." ...|$|R
