40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of aromatic stacking on the ability of an <b>aromatic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>base</b> to accept a hydrogen bond. Substituent effects were studied at the MP 2 level for 10 complexes of a substituted benzene stacked with pyridine in a parallel offset conformation. The interaction energies between each substituted benzene and pyridine were analyzed in terms of Hartree-Fock, correlation, and electrostatic contributions. It appears that the basicity of pyridine {{is directly related to the}} electrostatic interaction between the cycles. It increases with increasing electron donating character of the benzene substituents. Also, density functional theory based descriptors such as global and local hardnesses and the benzene ring polarizability are found to adequately predict the interaction energy.

40|$|Purpose: To {{change the}} {{dissolution}} properties of indomethacin, a {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} characterized by weak solubility and bioavailability, we propose the preparation of co-crystals where the active pharmaceutical ingredient is indomethacin and the partners are <b>aromatic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>bases</b> (+ 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl-pyridine or 2 -methoxy- 5 -nitro-anyline) or saccharine. In co-crystals different molecules are linked in the same crystalline lattice by intermolecular interactions, so can be defined supramolecular complexes. Methods: The packing of structures have been determined with the employment of a X-ray Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer and have been analyzed {{from the point of}} view of intermolecular interactions. The dissolution studies have been performed by incubation of free or co-crystalized indomethacin in phosphate buffer whose concentrations have been analyzed by HPLC during time. Results: The carboxylic group usually forms COOH [...] . HOOC homosyntons to give dimers, using other functional groups to interact via H bond with the partners. In all co-crystals indomethacin has showed significantly different solubility and dissolution rates with respect to those of the free drug. The simple mix of indomethacin and partners without co-crystallization processes showed for indomethacin the same solubility and dissolution rate of the pure drug. Conclusions: The co-crystallization with appropriate partners can induce important changes in solubility and dissolution rates of indomethacin allowing to hypothesize interesting influences in the bioavailability or local delivery of the drug...|$|R

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of cyclooctene to cyclooctene epoxide by Oxone® (2 KHSO 5 *KHSO 4 *K 2 SO 4) as probe {{for evaluating}} the catalytic activity of a few manganese hemiporphyrazines has been studied. The oxidations {{have been carried out}} in an anhydrous two-phase system (solid Oxone®/solid catalyst/ 1, 2 -dichloroethane solution). In the absence of manganese hemiporphyrazine and/or of an <b>aromatic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>base</b> only the slow stoichiometric epoxidation by KHSO 5 is observed. On the contrary, in the presence of pyridine and catalytic amount of manganese hemiporphyrazine (0. 13 ¸ 1 % respect with the organic substrate) either suspended in the reaction medium or adsorbed on a suitable polymer (silica gel or poly(vinylpyridine)) enhanced reaction rates are observed. The presence of an axial ligand in the coordination sphere of the catalyst appears to be essential for promoting the catalytic activity of the manganese complex. Moreover, the manganese hemiporphyrazine was subject to a colour change upon addition of the oxidant, thus suggesting the formation of a high valent oxo intermediate that oxidizes the olefin in a successive step. Under the experimental conditions adopted, epoxide yields up to 86 % are obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of sulfides by Oxone® in {{the presence}} of catalytic amount of various manganese porphyrins in supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) has been studied. The reactions have been carried out in an anhydrous two phase-system (solid Oxone®, solid catalyst/scCO 2). In the experimental conditions employed (40 oC, 20 MPa), only the new synthesised 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetrakis(heptafluoropropyl) porphyrinate-manganese(III) chloride showed a slight solubility in scCO 2. In the absence of manganese porphyrin and/or of an <b>aromatic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>base</b> a slow stoichiometric sulfide oxidation leading mainly to sulfoxide is observed in spite of the extremely low solubility of Oxone® in scCO 2. Conversely, {{in the presence}} of 4 -tert. -butylpyridine and catalytic amount of manganese porphyrins (0. 6 % with respect to sulfide) enhanced reaction rates are observed. Furthermore, the selectivity of sulfide oxidation reverses and sulfone is formed in larger or comparable amount than sulfoxide even when an excess of sulfide over oxidant is employed. The results collected suggest that the local concentration of the intermediate sulfoxide around the catalyst is higher than that of the bulk supercritical phase thus determining unusual high reaction rates for sulfone formation...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to a clear need for a more systematic approach {{to the study of}} the interaction of copper with ligands containing the sulphhydryl group, or in thioamide tautomeric equilibrium with such, cuprous, cupric and mixed valence complexes of ligands containing a thiolate or thioamide moiety have been synthesised and characterised by spectroscopic, magnetic and crystallographic techniques. In certain cases their reactivity in aliphatic and <b>aromatic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>base</b> solvents and nitromethane have been investigated. Full names for the ligand abbreviations appear at the end of the abstract and ligand structures may be found in Figures at the beginning of the appropriate chapter. The visible, esr and resonance Raman spectra of the type I, copper protein, azurin from Alcaligenes denitrificans, have been recorded and compared with other type I proteins. Through comparison with the spectral features of a series of cluster complexes [CuII 2 CuI 10 (mmim) 12 (Y) 4](X) 2 (where Y = CH 3 CN or H 2 O, and X = BPh 4 Cl 04,PF 6, CH 3 COO or OH), and [CuII 6 CuI 8 (mea) 12 Cl]Cl 5. 7 H 2 O, the so-called "unusual" spectroscopic features of the type I proteins have been re-interpreted as being normal phenomena of a Cu(II) -thiolate interaction coupled with specific geometrical requirements. Investigation of the mbtH ligand system has led to the reformulation of a number of incorrectly formulated copper complexes as [Cu(mbtH) 2 Cl] or [Cu(mbt) ] following successful removal of a disulphide contaminant. In support of such, similar cuprous compounds of general formula [Cu(LH) 2 X] (LH = etmbtH, X = Cl, Br, I; LH = mbtH, X = Br, I; LH = mmimH, X = Cl), [Cu(LH) X]. xH 2 O (LH = mbimH, mpyH, phmtzH, Ph 2 PS 2 H, X = Cl, Br; LH = mmimH; X = Br) and [Cu(L) ] (L = bimet, dimtdz, dipmim etmbt, mpy, phmtz) have been prepared from similar ligand systems. The interaction of a number of these complexes with pyridine led to oxidation of organo-sulphur to sulphate with the production of [Cu(py) 4 SO 4]. 2 H 2 O. This reaction is postulated to occur via two oxidising species [Cu(py) 2 OH) 2] or [Cu(py) xO] depending on whether halides are present or absent in the reaction solutions. Similar sulphato species are seen when quinoline and 3 -ethylpyridine are used as solvents. However, compounds of general formula [Cu(LH) 2 X] and [Cu(LH) X] yield the complexes [Cu(3 -Mepy) 3 Cl] and [Cu(4 -Mepy) 4 Cl 2]. H 2 O, from the solvents 3 -methyl-pyridine and 4 -methylpyridine respectively, which have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography. The cupric and mixed valence complexes [Cu(ttzH) 3 X 2] (X = Cl, Br), [Cu(ttzH) 2 Br 2], [CuIICuI 3 (ttz) 5], [CuIICuI(mmim) (mmimH) 2 Cl 2], [CuIICuI(mmimH) 2 Cl 3], [Cu(mbim) 2 (H 2 O) (NH 3) ], [Cu(mbin) 2 (H 2 O) ], [Cu(dipmim) Cl] and [Cu(etu) OH] have been prepared and characterised by visible, infrared, and esr spectroscopy. When [Cu(ttzH) 3 Br 2] is refluxed in nitromethane, a new cuprous complex [Cu(tztdz) Br] is produced in which modification of the ttzH ligand to produce the new organic moiety tztdz has occurred, confirmed X-ray crystallography. Similarly the compounds [Cu(tztdz) Cl], [Cu(tztdz) Cl 2] and [Cu(mimmimz) Cl 2] are postulated from the interaction of [Cu(ttzH) 3 Cl 2] and [CuIICuI(mmimH) 2 Cl 3] with nitromethane. With reference to well-defined literature examples the technique of esr spectroscopy is shown to discriminate between equatorial donor atom sets of S 4, S 2 O 2, S 2 N 2, SO 3 and O 4 on the basis of lineshapes and position of fundamental parameters. The new compounds synthesised: (CuIICuI 2 (dimetH 2) (dimetH) 3 Cl], [CuIICuI 3 (dimetH 2) 3 (dimetH) (ClO 4) 4], [CuIICuI 3 (dimtolH) 5], [CuIICuI 3 (dimprolH) 5], [Cu(mpoH 2) (mpoH) (ClO 4) ], [Cu(phenylglyoxaldtsc) ], [Cu(benzildtsc) ]. H 2 O and [Cu(3 -n-heptoxy- 2 -oxobutyraldehydedtsc) ] have been assigned donor sets on the basis of their respective esr signals. Similarly this has been done for a number of unisolatible species produced in situ from interaction of various cupric salts with a number of sulphhydryl and thioamide containing ligands...|$|E

However, a number of previous studies found inconsistent correlation. Therefore, a study on developing new chemical-rheological models and chemical-durability indices was carried out. Two bitumen fractionation method, Rostler and Corbett methods were used to extract each chemical fraction of bitumen. A number of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of each chemical fraction on bitumen rheology such as the effect of asphaltenes, polar <b>aromatics,</b> naphthene <b>aromatics,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>bases,</b> first acidaffins, second acidaffins and paraffins on elastic modulus (G’), viscous modulus (G”) or fatigue factor (G*sin[δ]), and rutting fator (G*/sin[δ]). Two bitumen from different sources, namely Petronas petroleum bitumen and Buton rock asphalt (BRA) bitumen, were used. New chemicalrheological models were formulated to estimate the bitumen rheology in corporating parameters which are G’, G” or (G*sin[δ]), and (G*/sin[δ]) based on the chemical properties. Furthermore, new chemical durability indices that may indicate the ageing rate of bitumen during short-term and long-term ageing were also formulated. Based on statistical analyses, the models and the indices, which were developed by using chemical properties according to Rostler method were found to be invalid because the real and the predicted rheology were significantly different. While according to Corbett method the models and the indices were valid because the differences is not significant since t-score of the models and the indices were maximum 2. 679 and 2. 119 or less than t-critical 2. 797 and 2. 861 respectively). The novelties of this study are the new models and the new indices can be used to predict the bitumen rheology and ageing rate based on the chemical composition. Furthermore, they are very important as guides in modifying a bitumen chemical composition to produce a bitumen mixture with the desired rheology and short-term or long-term ageing rate...|$|R

Grinded xylem was trapped in acrylic columns and solutions of Ni(II), in the absence and presence of the four ligands prepared in KNO(3) 0 - 1 mol L(- 1) at pH 5. 5, were percolated through the column. Aliquots of solutions were recovered in the column end for Ni determination by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The experimental. data to describe Ni sorption by xylem in both the presence and absence of ligands was better explained by the Freundlich isotherm model. The decreasing affinity order of ligands for Ni was: oxalic acid > citric acid > histidine > aspartic acid. On the other hand, the Ni(II) adsorption by xylem increased following the inverse sequence of ligands. Potentiometric titrations of acidic groups were carried out to elucidate the sorption site groups available in Q. ilex xylem.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Chemistry, Washington State UniversityResponsible {{stewardship}} of used nuclear fuel requires {{the operation of}} a closed nuclear fuel cycle and proper management of the actinide materials through transmutation. The separation and isolation of the minor actinides (MA), particularly Am and Cm, from the fission product lanthanides (Ln) remains a considerable challenge towards {{the goal of a}} closed fuel cycle. Solvent extraction processes aimed at this difficult separation have shown some success, in the US, these efforts have largely focused on the TALSPEAK (Trivalent Actinide Lanthanide Separation by Phosphorus-reagent Extractant from Aqueous Komplexes) or TALSPEAK-like extraction systems. In TALSPEAK and TALSPEAK-like systems the separation of the MA from the Ln is facilitated by a polyaminopolycarboxylate (PAPC) ligand that selectively binds the MA while an cation exchanging extractant (typically di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP)) binds the Ln. Traditional PAPC ligands suffer from slow phase transfer kinetics, and require strict buffering to control pH and to improve kinetics (particularly true for lactic acid buffering in traditional TALSPEAK). <b>Aromatic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> donor (pyridine <b>based)</b> ligands have shown improved binding and dissociation kinetics over their aliphatic counterparts, and competitive complexation strength that make them a suitable replacement for traditional PAPC ligands in TALSPEAK and TALSPEAK-like extraction systems. To this end new pyridine and bipyridine based ligands have been synthesized to be used as actinide selective complexants when paired with a TALSPEAK or TALSPEAK-like solvent. Aqueous solubility limitations inherent to pyridine based ligands have been overcome by the addition of solubilizing functional groups such as 1 -methylpiperazine, and iminodiacetic acid. Newly synthesized pyridine ligands have been characterized and evaluated in TALSPEAK or TALSPEAK-like combined extractant systems TALSPEAK-MME (Mixed Monofunctional Extractant) and ALSEP (Actinide Lanthanide SEParation) using radiotracer and stable metal solvent extraction studies. The findings of these studies and their implications to MA/Ln separation techniques are discussed in this dissertation.

The nC 17 /Pristine and n C 18 /Phytane ratios, extrapolated from the GC profiles decreased from the initial value of 2. 510 and 7. 289 to 0. 132 and 0. 474 respectively at day 60...|$|R
