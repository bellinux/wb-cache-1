5000|$|The event {{originated}} in 1986, and early {{in its history}} convened in Lewes, Delaware. Due to increasing space requirements (distance of shots, number of teams, and number of spectators) new locations in Sussex County had to be found. In 2007, WCPC moved to Bridgeville (at [...] ), near the intersection of Seashore Highway and Chaplains Chapel Road. About 75 teams competed, the event drew more than 20,000 people, and grossed more than $800,000 in ticket sales and <b>associated</b> <b>revenues.</b> More than 70% of that money would be donated {{to a variety of}} community organizations. Starting with the 2014 WCPCA event, festivities were to be held at Dover International Speedway in Dover, after the landowner who hosted the event evicted the event from his property due to a 2011 lawsuit (one that was eventually settled out of court). However, the 2014 event was canceled due to logistics problems (the speedway did not have long enough of a straightaway to cover the one-mile distance the competition requires), and the contest was expected to be permanently shuttered prior to the 2015 contest due to insurance companies refusing to cover the contest. After considering a move to a location in Maryland, the organization announced plans to revive the World Championship Punkin Chunkin contest for 2016 at its previous site in Bridgeville, after the insurance concerns were addressed.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy of}} Zapolyarny {{district}} {{is dominated by}} oil and gas, constituting around 99% of all industrial activity within the whole Okrug. The dominance {{of oil and gas}} exploration within the Okrug has seen <b>associated</b> <b>revenues</b> increase dramatically, with €190 million generated in 2007 compared to only €6.7 million ten years prior, with fuel industry's share of the districts GRP increasing from 65% in 2001 to 80% in 2005. This increase in revenue has resulted from a marked increase in investment in the area by the parent companies of the concerns operating in the District, such as Rosneft, Lukoil, Total, Surgutneftegas and TNK-BP, whose input equates to approximately 90% of the total annual investment in the district. This investment has included the construction of an oil terminal in the Barents Sea at a cost of approximately €700 million by an independent company especially created to oversea the construction and administration of the terminal, a pipeline to connect the terminal to the ZPS Southern Khylchuyu oilfields at a cost of around €250 million, the completion of the Kharyaga-Indiga pipeline and a gas plant near Khumzha. This allows the transportation of oil and gas throughout the region and into the general Russian pipeline network. There are currently more than 80 separate oil and gas sites of exploration, and it is estimated that there is around 5 billion tons of oil and around 500 billion cubic meters of gas in the district.|$|E

Traditionally, retailers fi-nance their inventories through an independent financing institution or by drawing from their own cash reserves, without any supplier involvement (Independent Fi-nancing). However, suppliers may reduce their buyers ’ costs and stimulate sales and <b>associated</b> <b>revenues</b> and profits, by either (i) adopting the financing function themselves (Trade Credit), or (ii) subsidizing the inventory costs (Inventory Subsi-dies). In the first part (Chapter 2) we analyze and compare the equilibrium perfor-mance of supply chains under these three basic financing schemes. The objective is to compare the equilibrium profits of the individual chain members, the aggregate supply chain profits, the equilibrium wholesale price, the expected sales volumes and the average inventory levels under the three financing options, and thus provide important insights for the selection and implementation of supply chain financing mechanisms. Several of the financing schemes introduce {{a new type of}} inventory control problem for the retailers in response to terms specified by their suppliers. I...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLogistics management {{is a relatively}} new field of integrated management study resulting mainly from a reorganization of related materials activities that previously were scattered among the organizational units within a company. Logistics management is a comprehensive term covering the method by which one attempts to see as a single unit the materials flow to, inside, and from the company. In the broadest sense, logistics management views a company as a single operating system; it seeks to minimize total costs associated with the acquisition and handling of materials from the inception of materials requirements to the final delivery of finished products to their users. Logistics management can therefore be defined as the planning, organizing, and controlling of all move-store activities chat facilitate product flow from the point of raw material acquisition to the point of final consumption, and of the attendant information flows, for the purpose of providing a sufficient level of customer service (and <b>associated</b> <b>revenues)</b> consistent with the costs incurred for overcoming the resistance of time and space in providing the service [1; 8].

40|$|In live broadcasting, {{the break}} lengths {{available}} for commercials {{are not always}} fixed and known in advance (e. g., strategic and injury time-outs are of variable duration in live sports transmissions). Broadcasters actively manage their advertising revenue by jointly optimizing sales and scheduling policies. We characterize the optimal dynamic schedule in a simplified setting that incorporates stochastic break durations and advertisement lengths of 15 and 30 seconds. The optimal policy is a 2 ̆ 2 greedy 2 ̆ 2 look-ahead rule that accounts for the remaining number of breaks; in this setting, there is no value to perfect information at the scheduling stage, and hence knowing the duration of all breaks would not change the schedule. We present heuristics to help solve scheduling problems of even greater complexity. The performance of these heuristics under various scenarios is tested by running simulations calibrated using industry data. The simple greedy heuristic is shown to perform well except when revenues are concave in ad length, {{in which case the}} look-ahead aspect of the optimal schedule becomes more important. Finally, we recommend ways for broadcasters to balance their portfolio of booked ads by determining the optimal overbooking level and mix of ads as a function of their <b>associated</b> <b>revenues</b> generated and penalties incurred...|$|E

40|$|Tourism and {{the sharing}} of the <b>associated</b> <b>revenues</b> with local people have been {{increasingly}} fronted as key instruments for maintaining protected areas (PAs) globally. This paper focuses on a tourism revenue sharing scheme employed in Uganda′s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, involving rural farmers. We find that the scheme faces difficulties in integrating with the existing local historical, socio-economic, and institutional landscapes. Similar experiences from other cases suggest that these challenges are generic, and relate to lack of real local participation; an insignificant scale of economic returns to local people relative to costs; inept institutions in charge of planning, managing and evaluation efforts; and an institutional complexity that constrains most activities. We conclude that although tourism revenue sharing is an appealing concept, and its oft-quoted logic of promoting conservation and rural development is difficult to ignore, {{it is challenging to}} plan and implement in competent ways. We do not suggest abandoning tourism revenue sharing, but rather believe that a more concerted effort to overcome the mechanism′s economic and institutional shortcomings, as identified in this paper, may be more appropriate. The overall findings indicate that problems are not with tourism revenue sharing as an ambition, but with the difficulties encountered in putting it into practice...|$|E
30|$|The {{keiretsu}} {{system is}} a special type of network organization of production that allows the participating corporations to outsource essential tasks to interlinked long-term partners that are “embedded” in strong relationships of mutual social obligations (Granovetter 1985). The keiretsu system has been widely adopted by Japanese automobile manufacturers and credited {{for the success of}} these corporations. In 1939, Toyota organized its first-tier suppliers into an official association and refused to deal directly with suppliers outside of this group. Toyota’s approach was supported by the Japanese government and soon imitated by other Japanese automakers (Wada 1992). Logistics and quality control were significantly simplified because parts were obtained exclusively from a small number of proven intermediating partners. Such arrangements allowed Japanese auto manufacturers to reduce lead times and manufacturing costs and achieve high volumes of external production with very lean purchasing departments (Kamath and Liker 1994; Wada 1992). During the high-growth period of the Japanese economy, resource procurement through a small number of mutually cooperating suppliers was praised for its effective information-sharing, for reducing the costs of monitoring, and for keeping <b>associated</b> <b>revenues</b> within a narrow circle of companies (Cooper and Yoshikawa 1994; Handfield and Bechtel 2002; Holmstrom and Roberts 1998; Lamming 2000).

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{on climate change}} regulations are leading to {{significant changes in the}} electricity industry with volatility levels and uncertainty increasing significantly. As a result, system operators are extending the procurement of flexibility to end - users and encourage more pro - active behaviors, including provision of system balancing services. In this context, this paper will investigate the potential flexibility and benefits that a coor dinated operation of multiple households’ rooftop solar and energy storage can offer to the various sectors of the electricity market. The model will analyze the coordinated operation of multiple households and minimize the supply costs for the whole commu nity while offering flexibility services to the system operator and provide peak demand reduction at the distribution network level. Fundamentally, the proposed model will consider the possibility of households to share energy resources in a peer - to - peer a rrangement and thus minimize energy supply costs. In addition, the model also considers the provision of frequency response and reserve services and their <b>associated</b> <b>revenues.</b> Our results have shown significant cost savings can be achieved through a coordi nated energy trading and consequently reduce energy transactions with suppliers.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{specific}} effect that firing costs {{can have on}} firms facing liquidity constraints. When firing costs are zero and a time gap exists between production and its <b>associated</b> <b>revenues,</b> firing allows firms {{to hold on to}} their liquid assets by saving on wages, and thus, allows firms to cope better with liquidity shocks when external financing is too costly or unavailable. I refer to this feature as labor's liquidity service. Higher firing costs reduces the value of labor's liquidity service, and thus, increases firms' incentive for hoarding liquidity and reduces firms' demand for production inputs. In addition to this negative effect at the creation margin of production, firing costs have a relatively higher positive effect on the destruction margin of production of financially restricted firms. This paper presents a model that develops these ideas and shows that the presence of firing costs has a stronger negative effect on the output of firms facing liquidity constraints. Regression analysis, based on country-industry panel data sets, provides empirical evidence consistent with the liquidity service effect of firing costs. I find a relatively stronger negative effect of firing costs on the output of industries with higher liquidity requirements and a relatively stronger negative effect of firing costs on the output of small, and more likely financially constrained, firms.

I refer to this feature as labor’s liquidity service. The presence of firing costs reduces the value of labor’s liquidity service, which affects firms ’ demand for liquidity, and thus, firms ’ demand for inputs. In addition to this negative effect at the creation margin, I also show that firing costs imply relatively higher destruction for financially restricted firms. I present a model that develops these ideas and show that the presence of firing costs has a stronger negative effect on production levels of firms facing liquidity constraints.

40|$|International audienceInternet usages {{have changed}} with the {{emergence}} of value added services relying on a higher interactivity and needs for a better quality of experience (QoE). Telecommunication operators have to face a continuing growth of new types of Internet traffic (video, games, telepresence, etc.) imposing not only a more efficient utilization of their network infrastructure resources, but also the generation of new revenues to pursue investments and sustain the increasing demand. Such services generally cross multiple domains, but inter-domain routing protocols still have some limitations in terms of service assurance. For example, BGP's single route announce for a destination limits potential traffic engineering features (e. g. no quality of service price/efficiency optimization, inter-domain shared route protection, inter-domain load balancing, etc.). In order to provision end-to-end inter-domain connections that obey to constraints such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss for these services, an interesting approach is to compute end-to-end (e 2 e) paths over multiple inter-domain routes. This will allow establishing more efficiently the inter-domain connections with respect to requested QoS constraints and sharing these constraints (and <b>associated</b> <b>revenues)</b> among multiple operators to globally accept more demands in the system, while keep satisfying the customer QoE. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient distributed inter-domain algorithm that computes such constrained paths among a set of domains, exploring multiple inter-domain routes. We demonstrate that our algorithm not only increases success rate in delivering feasible paths, but also admits more connections and keeps a reasonable runtime...|$|E
