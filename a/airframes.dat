The first rotor is rotatably {{connected to the}} <b>airframe,</b> and a generator {{is supported by the}} <b>airframe</b> and driven by the rotor. The <b>airframe</b> is supported vertically in an elevated disposition by poles which extend vertically upwardly from the ground and support cables which extend between the vertical poles. Suspension cables suspend the <b>airframe</b> from the support cable...|$|R
25|$|Construction of the <b>airframe</b> moulds started mid-November 1992, with <b>airframe</b> {{construction}} {{beginning in}} April the following year, {{starting with the}} tailplane. The <b>airframe</b> was completed in 1994 and engine installation commenced.|$|R
5|$|A {{programme}} {{to convert}} A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters {{was set up}} by Airbus Freighter Conversion GmbH. <b>Airframes</b> would be converted by EADS EFW in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap's passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to freighter). However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to freighter programme, citing high demand for used <b>airframes</b> for passenger service.|$|E

40|$|The use of NASTRAN at Bell Helicopter Company for {{structural}} static and dynamic {{analysis of a}} helicopter <b>airframe</b> is described. Analysis of <b>airframe</b> internal loads, main rotor isolation systems, and <b>airframe</b> vibration is discussed. The use of each rigid format for these types of analysis is summarized.

40|$|A linear {{formulation}} of rotor <b>airframe</b> coupling intended for vibration analysis in <b>airframe</b> structural design is presented. The <b>airframe</b> {{is represented by}} a finite element analysis model; the rotor is represented by a general set of linear differential equations with periodic coefficients; and the connections between the rotor and <b>airframe</b> are specified through general linear equations of constraint. Coupling equations are applied to the rotor and <b>airframe</b> equations to produce one set of linear differential equations governing vibrations of the combined rotor <b>airframe</b> system. These equations are solved by the harmonic balance method for the system steady state vibrations. A feature of the solution process is {{the representation of the}} <b>airframe</b> in terms of forced responses calculated at the rotor harmonics of interest. A method based on matrix partitioning is worked out for quick recalculations of vibrations in design studies when only relatively few <b>airframe</b> members are varied.

40|$|A {{component}} {{method of}} <b>airframe</b> noise prediction {{is used to}} predict levels of operational and proposed aircraft <b>airframe</b> noise to assess the contribution of <b>airframe</b> noise to community noise levels. This is done after first evaluating the prediction method using newly acquired detailed measurements from full-scale aircraft and models. In {{the course of the}} evaluation, modeling techniques of <b>airframe</b> noise sources are examined with attention to scaling. Finally, when used to predict approach <b>airframe</b> EPNLs, the levels fell about 10 EPNdB below current noise regulations and about 5 EPNdB below proposed noise regulations...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{scheduled date}} {{of entry into}} service for the MRA4 was April 2003; however, development proved far more protracted than anticipated. Early on, an independent company, Flight Refuelling Ltd., had been contracted to undertake the conversions to MRA4 standard, however BAE discovered that the Nimrod <b>airframes</b> supplied by the RAF were not built to a common standard and this considerably complicated the refurbishment process. The task of converting the existing <b>airframes</b> was transferred in-house to BAE Systems Woodford. The BAE team at Woodford then found that the new wing was flawed, {{which resulted in the}} project being put on hold while another wing design was developed.|$|E
5|$|The two 37mm (1.46in) Bordkanone BK 3,7 cannons were {{mounted in}} {{under-wing}} gun pods, each loaded with two six-round magazines of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition. With these weapons, the Kanonenvogel ("cannon-bird"), {{as it was}} nicknamed, proved very successful {{in the hands of}} Stuka aces such as Rudel. The G-1 was converted from older D-series <b>airframes,</b> retaining the smaller wing, but without the dive brakes. The G-2 was similar to the G-1 except for use of the extended wing of the D-5. 208 G-2s were built and at least a further 22 more were converted from D-3 <b>airframes.</b>|$|E
40|$|As {{the sound}} {{generation}} in turbofan engines has decreased {{the significance of}} <b>airframe</b> related sound has increased. For example in landing approach the sound associated with the <b>airframe</b> may even dominate the overall sound radiation of an aircraft. The influence of the <b>airframe</b> on aerosound is threefold: i) <b>Airframe</b> components subjected to either their own turbulent boundary layer flow or to installation related turbulent flow act as sources of sound, ii) The aerodynamic influence of the <b>airframe</b> may considerably change the sound generation of the propulsion system, in particular of propellers, iii) the <b>airframe</b> may change the radiation characteristics of engine noise due to reflection and diffraction of the sound waves at the aircraft surface as well as refraction and scattering effects of the vortical flow in its vicinity. The presentation gives an overview about prominent sources of <b>airframe</b> component noise as well as acoustic and source installation effects related to the <b>airframe.</b> Results of research at DLR are presented on the numerical and experimental simulation of <b>airframe</b> component noise along with noise reduction technology. Recent work on aeroacoustic installation effects and their significance for exterior and interior noise will be discussed as well...|$|R

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939 Coastal Command had forces of ten Avro Anson, including four auxiliaries, two Vickers Vildebeest, two Short Sunderland, three Saro London and one Supermarine Stranraer squadrons. The Vildebeest and London were all obsolescent. The Ansons made up half of this force, but with insufficient range to undertake deep ocean reconnaissance {{it was left to}} the flying-boat squadrons, of which four out of six had obsolescent machines. This left three squadrons with suitable aircraft, the Lockheed Hudson and Sunderland that could operate effectively. Anson engines were in limited supply in 1939. Moreover, the Sunderland and Hudson <b>airframes</b> were also limited, the later being delivered at a rate of just two per month. To fill the gap in production capacity, the Air Ministry dispatched several missions to the United States to buy more Hudson <b>airframes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike other recipients, India {{did not use}} {{the gift}} to {{establish}} a national air force. The RAF in India received 20 Avro 504 <b>airframes</b> for military use.

5|$|A {{proposed}} {{variant of}} the B-52H was the EB-52H, which would have consisted of 16 modified and augmented B-52H <b>airframes</b> with additional electronic jamming capabilities. This variant would have restored USAF airborne jamming capability that it lost on retiring the EF-111 Raven. The program was canceled in 2005 following the removal of funds for the stand-off jammer. The program was revived in 2007, and cut again in early 2009.|$|E
5|$|By 17 August 1942, {{production}} {{had climbed}} rapidly after Blohm & Voss BV 138 production was scaled down and licence work had shut down at WFG. Production now reached some 150 Ju 87 D <b>airframes</b> per month, but spare parts were failing {{to reach the}} same production levels. Undercarriage parts were particularly in short supply. Milch ordered production to 350 Ju 87s per month in September 1942. This was not achievable due to the insufficient production capacity in the Reich.|$|E
5|$|By 1991, Singapore's {{fleet of}} combat {{aircraft}} included the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Northrop F-5 Tiger II, {{as well as}} the locally modernised and upgraded ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk; the Hunters were active but obsolete in comparison.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{assessment of}} the state of the art in <b>airframe</b> noise is presented. Full-scale data on the intensity, spectra, and directivity of this noise source are evaluated in light of the comprehensive theory developed by Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings. Vibration of panels on the aircraft is identified as a possible additional source of <b>airframe</b> noise. The present understanding and methods for prediction of other component sources - airfoils, struts, and cavities - are discussed. Operating problems associated with <b>airframe</b> noise as well as potential design methods for <b>airframe</b> noise reduction are identified...|$|R
40|$|Slow {{deformation}} {{modes of}} forming give considerably higher residual fatigue {{life of the}} <b>airframe</b> part. It has experimentally proven that fatigue life of complicated shape integral <b>airframe</b> panels made of high strength aluminum alloys is significantly increased after creep deformation process. To implement the slow deformation mode forming methods, universal automated equipment was developed. Multichannel forming systems provide high accuracy of <b>airframe</b> part shape eliminating residual stresses and spring effect. Forming process multizone control technology was developed and experimentally proved that static/fatigue properties of formed <b>airframe</b> parts are increased...|$|R
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the US Air Force (USAF) {{was seeking}} an {{aircraft}} to replace its piston-engined Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, {{which had been}} in service for over a decade. After issuing preliminary development contracts to three companies, the USAF picked Boeing to construct two <b>airframes</b> to test Westinghouse Electric and Hughes's competing radars. Both radars used pulse-Doppler technology, with Westinghouse's design emerging as the contract winner. Testing on the first production E-3 began in October 1975.|$|E
5|$|Other {{designs of}} the mid-H series {{included}} the He 111 H-7 and H-8. The <b>airframes</b> {{were to be}} rebuilds of the H-3/H-5 variant. Both were designed as night bombers and were to have two Jumo 211F-1s installed. The intention was for the H-8 to be fitted with cable-cutting equipment and barrage ballon deflectors {{on the leading edge}} of the wings. The H-7 was never built.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Harriers did not see further combat with the RAF after the Falklands War, although they continued to serve for years afterwards. As a deterrent against further Argentine invasion attempts, No. 1453 Flight RAF was deployed to the Falkland Islands from August 1983 to June 1985. However the second generation Harrier IIs saw action in Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The {{first generation}} Hawker Siddeley <b>airframes</b> were replaced by the improved Harrier II, which had been developed jointly between McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace.|$|E
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{conducted}} in a CV- 990 jet transport with engines at idle power to investigate aircraft <b>airframe</b> noise. Test results showed that <b>airframe</b> noise was measured for the aircraft in the landing configuration. The results agreed well with the expected variation with the fifth power of velocity. For the aircraft in the clean configuraton, {{it was concluded that}} <b>airframe</b> noise was measured only at higher airspeeds with engine idle noise present at lower speeds. The data show that landing gear and flaps make a significant contribution to <b>airframe</b> noise...|$|R

40|$|Flyover {{measurements}} of the <b>airframe</b> noise produced by the AeroCommander, JetStar, CV- 990, and B- 747 airplanes are presented for various landing approach configurations. Empirical and semiempirical techniques are presented to correlate the measured <b>airframe</b> noise with airplane design and aerodynamic parameters. <b>Airframe</b> noise for the jet-powered airplanes in the clean configuration (flaps and gear retracted) {{was found to be}} adequately represented by a function of airplane weight and the fifth power of airspeed. Results show the <b>airframe</b> noise for all four aircraft in the landing configuration (flaps extended and gear down) also varied with the fifth power of airspeed, but this noise level could not be represented by the addition of a constant to the equation for clean-configuration <b>airframe</b> noise...|$|R
