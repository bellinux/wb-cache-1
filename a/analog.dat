The territory of Croatia was split into nine digital-TV allotment regions. The <b>analog</b> broadcast network was switched off gradually (by the digital-TV allotment regions) beginning on 26 January 2010. The process was completed, achieving digital switchover on 5 October 2010, but geographically isolated areas were left with <b>analog</b> broadcasts. The last <b>analog</b> TV transmitter in Croatia was shut down on 30 September 2011, as DVB-T coverage was extended to 98.5 percent of households in Croatia and no less than 95 percent of households {{in each of the}} allotment regions. Approximately 6,000 households were left with no reception of DVB-T or <b>analog</b> TV broadcasts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe transbilayer {{movement}} of short-chain spin-labeled and fluorescent 7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl (NBD) phospholipid <b>analogs</b> in rat liver microsomes {{is measured by}} stopped-flow mixing of labeled microsomes with bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution. Extraction of <b>analogs</b> from the outer leaflet of microsomes to BSA can be directly monitored in conjunction with electron paramagnetic resonance or fluorescence spectroscopy {{by taking advantage of}} the fact that the signal of spin-labeled or fluorescent <b>analogs</b> bound to BSA is different from that of the <b>analogs</b> inserted into membranes. From the signal kinetics, the transbilayer movement and the distribution of <b>analogs</b> in microsomal membranes can be derived provided the extraction of <b>analogs</b> by BSA is much faster in comparison to the transbilayer {{movement of}} <b>analogs.</b> Half-times of the back-exchange for spin-labeled and fluorescent <b>analogs</b> were < 3. 5 and < 9. 5 s, respectively. The unprecedented time resolution of the assay revealed that the transbilayer movement of spin-labeled <b>analogs</b> is much faster than previously reported. The half-time of the movement was about 16 s or even less at room temperature. Transmembrane movement of NBD-labeled <b>analogs</b> was six- to eightfold slower than that of spin-labeled <b>analogs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} <b>analog</b> signals or digital signals. There are <b>analog</b> {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an <b>analog</b> signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in <b>analog</b> signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

Although most wild-type strains were inducible for AGA uptake, typical mutants selected from strain C 58 C 1 (pRi 8196) were found to be constitutive for uptake of AGA, as was the wild-type strain carrying pTi B 6 - 806. Such constitutive mutants grew on all sugar <b>analogs</b> of MOP, MOA, and AGA tested. The pTi B 6 - 806 -containing strain was tested for growth on a more extended series of <b>analogs,</b> including tetrose, triose, diose, and disaccharide <b>analogs,</b> all of which were accepted.

40|$|Lavendamycin, an aminoquinolinedione {{antibiotic}} {{is similar}} to streptonigrin, an antibiotic with known antiretroviral activity. Their applicability as drugs is limited due to their high toxicity to mammalian cells. A series of novel <b>analogs</b> of lavendamycin has been recently synthesized. In initial screening, three of the <b>analogs</b> showed significant inhibitory activity toward the reverse transcriptase (RT) of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and exhibited little or no animal toxicity and relatively low cellular cytotoxicity. In this study, we determined the anti-retroviral activity of nine <b>analogs</b> by assessing their anti-reverse transcriptase(anti-RT) activity in comparison to streptonigrin. Using both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AMV reverse transcriptase in vitro {{we found that the}} <b>analogs</b> exhibited significant anti-RT activity. The inhibitory activity of the <b>analogs</b> was dose dependent, and they had different effects on the two enzymes. At 30 µM seven of the <b>analogs</b> inhibited HIV-RT activity by 50 % or more. At this concentration, two of the <b>analogs</b> were significantly more effective than streptonigrin. AMV-RT was more sensitive toward both streptonigrin and several of the <b>analogs</b> than was HIV-RT.

40|$|Today, insulin <b>analogs</b> {{are used}} in {{millions}} of diabetic patients. Insulin <b>analogs</b> {{have been developed to}} achieve more physiological insulin replacement in terms of time course of the effect. Modifications in the amino acid sequence of the insulin molecule change the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the <b>analogs</b> in respect to human insulin. However, these changes can also modify the molecular and biological effects of the <b>analogs.</b> The rapid-acting insulin <b>analogs,</b> lispro, aspart and glulisine, have a rapid onset and shorter duration of action. The long-acting insulin <b>analogs</b> glargine and detemir have a protracted duration of action and a relatively smooth serum concentration profile. Insulin and its <b>analogs</b> may function as growth factors and therefore have a theoretical potential to promote tumor proliferation. A major question is whether <b>analogs</b> have an increased mitogenic activity in respect to insulin. These ligands can promote cell proliferation through many mechanisms like the prolonged stimulation of the insulin receptor, stimulation of the IGF- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R), prevalent activation of the ERK rather than the AKT intracellular post-receptor pathways. Studies on in vitro models indicate that short-acting <b>analogs</b> elicit molecular and biological effects that {{are similar to those of}} insulin. In contrast, long-acting <b>analogs</b> behave differently. Although not all data are homogeneous, both glargine and detemir have been found to have a decreased binding to IR but an increased binding to IGF- 1 R, a prevalent activation of the ERK pathway, and an increased mitogenic effect in respect to insulin. Recent retrospective epidemiological clinical studies have suggested that treatment with long-acting <b>analogs</b> (specifically glargine) may increase the relative risk for cancer. Results are controversial and methodologically weak. Therefore prospective clinical studies are needed to evaluate the possible tumor growth-promoting effects of these insulin <b>analogs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Nucleoside <b>analogs</b> act as prodrugs {{that must}} be {{converted}} to 5 '-phosphates by intracellular kinases to become active {{in the treatment of}} viral and oncological diseases. Activation may be reversed by dephosphorylation if the 5 '-phosphates are substrates for 5 '-nucleotidases. Dephosphorylation by cytosolic enzymes decreases the efficacy of the <b>analogs,</b> whereas dephosphorylation by mitochondrial enzymes may decrease mitochondrial toxicity. Both effects may influence the outcome of therapy. We investigated the dephosphorylation of the 5 '-phosphates of commonly used nucleoside <b>analogs</b> by two cytosolic (cN-II and dNT- 1) and one mitochondrial (dNT- 2) nucleotidase. Most uracil/thymine nucleotide <b>analogs</b> were dephosphorylated by all three human enzymes but cytosine-containing nucleotide <b>analogs</b> were inactive. Only cN-II showed some activity with the monophosphates of the two purine <b>analogs</b> 2 -chloro- 2 '-deoxyadenosine and 9 -beta-D-arabinosylguanine. We conclude that overproduction of any of the three 5 '-nucleotidases cannot explain development of resistance against cytosine <b>analogs</b> but that overproduction of cN-II could lead to resistance against purine <b>analogs.</b> Of the tested <b>analogs,</b> only (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine was preferentially dephosphorylated by mitochondrial dNT- 2. We propose that in future developments of <b>analogs</b> this aspect be considered in order to reduce mitochondrial toxicity. We tested inhibition of dNT- 1 and dNT- 2 by a large variety of synthetic metabolically stable nucleoside phosphonate <b>analogs</b> and found one (PMcP-U) that inhibited dNT- 1 and dNT- 2 competitively and a second (DPB-T) that inhibited dNT- 2 by mixed inhibition.
