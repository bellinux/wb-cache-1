40|$|The Master's Thesis {{research}} {{focuses on}} analyzing the possibilities of using Direct Current distribution systems to distribute power to end users. Considering the shift in load types {{in the past few}} decades and also a growing demand of distributed generation, DC distribution can potentially offer higher efficiencies and cost savings to utilities. The incorporation of DC distribution offers the opportunity to eliminate multiple conversion stages for devices which are powered using DC electricity. The integration of power sources such as photovoltaics and fuel cells, which produce DC power, offer further incentives to consider the use of DC systems. Using DC systems can help eliminate the conversion losses <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and inverters which would be part of the infrastructure if AC distribution was used. In the literature, the study of DC distribution has been limited to customized systems. The objective of this research is to analyze DC distribution when applied to systems based on standard IEEE test feeder systems. The IEEE 13 node test feeder and the IEEE 37 node test feeder will be used as the basis for the analysis. Issues such as associated costs, protection and integration of appliances will also be addressed. M. S. Committee Chair: Meliopoulos, A.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a two-phase cooling method using R 134 a refrigerant to dissipate the heat energy (loss) generated by power electronics (PE) {{such as those}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> converters, and inverters for a specific application in hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs). The cooling method involves submerging PE devices in an R 134 a bath, which limits the junction temperature of PE devices while conserving weight and volume of the heat sink without sacrificing equipment reliability. First, experimental tests that included an extended soak for more than 300 days were performed on a submerged IGBT and gate-controller card to study dielectric characteristics, deterioration effects, and heat flux capability of R 134 a. Results from these tests illustrate that R 134 a has high dielectric characteristics, no deterioration on electrical components, and a heat flux of 114 W/cm 2 for the experimental configuration. Second, experimental tests that included simultaneous operation with a mock automotive air-conditioner (A/C) system were performed on the same IGBT and gate controller card. Data extrapolation from these tests determined that a typical automotive A/C system has more than sufficient cooling capacity to cool a typical 30 kW traction inverter. Last, a discussion and simulation of active cooling of the IGBT junction layer with R 134 a refrigerant is given. This technique will drastically increase the forward current ratings and reliability of the PE device. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{fundamental}} problem that miniaturized systems, such as biomedical implants, face is limited space for storing energy, which translates to short operational life. Harvesting {{energy from the}} surrounding environment, which is virtually a boundless source at these scales, can overcome this restriction, if losses in the system are sufficiently low. To that end, the 2 - m bi-complementary metal–oxide semiconductor switched-inductor piezoelectric harvester prototype evaluated and {{presented in this paper}} eliminates the restrictions <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a <b>rectifier</b> to produce and channel 30 W from a periodic 72 - W piezoelectric source into a battery directly. In doing so, the circuit also increases the system’s electrical damping force to draw more power and energy from the transducer, effectively increasing its mechanical-electrical efficiency by up to 78 %. The system also harnesses up to 659 nJ from nonperiodic mechanical vibrations, which are more prevalen...|$|R

40|$|Modulatory α-subunits, which {{comprise}} {{one-fourth of}} all voltagegated K+ channel (Kv) α-subunits, do not assemble into homomeric channels, but selectively <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> delayed <b>rectifier</b> Kv 2 subunits to form heteromeric channels of unknown stoichiometry. Their distinct expression patterns and unique functional properties have made these channels candidate molecular correlates {{for a broad}} set of native K+ currents. Here, we combine FRET and electrophysiological measurements to determine the stoichiometry and geometry of heteromeric channels composed of the delayed rectifier Kv 2. 1 subunit and the modulatory Kv 9. 3 α-subunit. Kv channel α-subunits were fused with GFP variants, and heteromerization of different combinations of tagged and untagged α-subunits was studied. FRET, evaluated by acceptor photobleaching, was only observed upon formation of functional channels. Our results, obtained from two independent experimental paradigms, suggest the formation of heteromeric Kv 2. 1 /Kv 9. 3 channels of fixed stoichiometry consisting of three Kv 2. 1 subunits and one Kv 9. 3 subunit. Strikingly, despite this uneven stoichiometry, we find that heteromeric Kv 2. 1 /Kv 9. 3 channels maintain a pseudosymmetric arrangement of subunits around the central pore...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of the tail current <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the delayed <b>rectifier</b> K § current (I~) in isolated rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were examined using the whole cell patch clamp technique. The tail currents observed upon repolarization to- 60 mV after brief (e. g., 20 ms) or small (i. e. to potentials negative of 0 mV) depolarizations were outwardly directed, as expected given the calculated K + reversal potential of- 83 mV. The tail currents seen upon repolarization after longer (e. g., 500 ms) and larger (e. g., to + 60 mV) depolarizations tended to be inwardly directed. Depolarizations of intermediate strength and/or duration were followed by biphasic tail currents, which were inwardly directed immediately upon repolarization, but changed direction and became outwardly directed before deactivation was complete. When cells were depolarized to + 60 mV for 500 ms both IK and the subsequent inward tail current at- 60 mV were similarly blocked by phencyclidine. Both IK and the inward tail current were also blocked by 4 -aminopyridine. Application of progressively more depolarized 30 s preconditioning potentials inactivated I~, and reduced the inward tail current amplitude with a simila...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{controlling}} induction motors, together <b>with</b> <b>associated</b> AC/DC <b>rectifiers</b> and DC/AC inverters, is addressed. The control objectives are threefold: (i) the motor speed should track any reference signal despite mechanical parameter uncertainties and variations; (ii) the DC Link voltage must be tightly regulated; (iii) the {{power factor correction}} (PFC) w. r. t. the power supply net must be performed in a satisfactory way. First, a nonlinear model of the whole controlled system is developed within the Park coordinates. Then, a multi-loop nonlinear adaptive controller is synthesized using the backstepping design technique. A formal analysis based on Lyapunov stability and average theory is made to exhibit the control system performances. In addition to closed-loop global asymptotic stability, it is proved that all control objectives (motor speed tracking, rotor flux regulation, DC link voltage regulation and unitary power factor) are asymptotically achieved, up to small but unavoidable harmonic errors (ripples).
