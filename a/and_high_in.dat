5|$|The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) {{and the common}} frog (Rana temporaria) are the only {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> insects. The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} scheme covered all six greenhouse gases {{specified in the}} Kyoto Protocol and was intended to progressively apply to all {{sectors of the economy}} including agriculture. 'Participants' (who would account for their emissions) were to be few, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> the production chain of each sector. Their compliance obligation would have been to surrender one New Zealand unit (NZU) or one internationally tradable Kyoto-compliant unit for each tonne of emissions.|$|E
5|$|The {{water in}} the bog is low in {{nutrients}} <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> acidity, which {{makes it difficult for}} most plants to live there. Only specialized plants can thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of orchid. Wild cranberries and blueberries grow in the bog along with sedges, leatherleaf shrubs, Arctic cotton grass, and viburnums. The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.|$|E

50|$|The parties {{presented}} {{themselves with}} lists of candidates. The number of {{candidates on the}} list usually was {{the total number of}} seats to be taken in the council. Each list received a random number, which was assigned by a lottery. Parties that had representatives in the regional parliaments, could receive a number that is the same in the entire region. Other parties' numbers varied from municipality to municipality. These numbers started after the regional numbers (8 <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> Flanders, 14 <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> Brussels, 6 <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> Wallonia).|$|R

5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} {{within the}} park vary with elevation. The TMD has two distinct communities, desert scrub—such as fourwing saltbush and brittlebrush—at the lowest elevations and desert grassland a little higher. The RMD includes these two communities as well as four more at higher elevations, oak woodland, pine–oak woodland, pine forest <b>and,</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> the Rincons, mixed conifer forest—Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, white fir, Gambel oak, and many other trees, shrubs, and understory plants. During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds of scientists and thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of vascular plants, 25 of non-vascular plants, and 197 species of fungi in Saguaro National Park.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom {{is low in}} fat and digestible carbohydrates, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E

5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E

25|$|Air-cured {{tobacco is}} hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry {{over a period of}} four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'dark' air-cured.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{and in what}} measure scientists tend to diversify their research activity, and if this tendency varies according to their belonging to different disciplinary areas. We analyze the nature of research diversification along three dimensions: extent of diversification, intensity of diversification, and degree of relatedness of topics in which researchers diversifies. For this purpose we propose three bibliometric indicators, based on the disciplinary placement of scientific output of individual scientists. The empirical investigation shows that the extent of diversification is lowest for scientists <b>in</b> Mathematics <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> Chemistry; intensity of diversification is lowest <b>in</b> Earth sciences <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> Industrial <b>and</b> information engineering; and degree of relatedness is lowest <b>in</b> Earth sciences <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> Chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Species of the {{economically}} important gracilarioid seaweeds from the Philippines were studied {{to determine the}} monthly variation in agar quality. Yield, gel strength, melting and gelling temperatures, and sulfate contents were compared. Lowest agar yield was observed in Gracilaria changii in July (4. 15 %) <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> Gracilariopsis heteroclada in March (20. 84 %). Gel strength was lowest in G. heteroclada in November (44 g cm - 2) <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> Gracilaria tenuistipitata in January (874 g cm - 2). Melting temperature was lowest in G. heteroclada in November (68. 7 Â°C) <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> also <b>in</b> G. heteroclada in January (90. 3 Â°C). Gelling temperature was lowest at 34. 4 Â°C in G. changii and Gracilaria firma in November and December, respectively; <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> G. heteroclada in October (45 Â°C). Sulfate content was lowest in G. firma in November (0. 16 %) <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> G. heteroclada in February (2. 71 %). The variation in the agar parameters {{could be due to}} different composition of agars of different species. Sulfate is significantly lower in Gracilaria firma.

25|$|In English-speaking countries, squid as food {{is often}} marketed using the Italian word calamari. Squid are found abundantly in certain areas, and provide large catches for fisheries. The body can be stuffed whole, cut into flat pieces, or sliced into rings. The arms, tentacles, and ink are also edible; the only parts not eaten are the beak and gladius (pen). Squid {{is a good}} food source for zinc and manganese, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> copper, selenium, vitamin B12, and riboflavin.|$|E
25|$|Individuals low in reward {{dependence}} <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> norepinephrine {{levels are}} then hypothesized to be typically independent, non-conformist, practical, tough-minded, cynical, unwilling {{to share their}} intimate feelings with others, socially detached, irresolute, insensitive to social cues and pressures, and content to be alone. They are also minimally motivated to please others and act for immediate gratification. So being low in reward dependence is related to social withdrawal, with aggressive anti-social behavior, detachment, and coldness in social attitudes.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{subsistence}} foods, such as {{fish and}} marine mammals, {{and to a}} lesser extent shellfish, are the only significant direct dietary sources of two important types of the omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA protect against heart disease and possibly diabetes. The replacement of a subsistence diet that is low in fat <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> omega-3s with a market-based Western diet has increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Alaska Natives. Many market (store-bought) foods are high in fats, carbohydrates, and sodium; and these may lead to increased weight gain, high cholesterol (hypercholesterolaemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), and chronic diseases.|$|E
