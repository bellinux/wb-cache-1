2500|$|Fossey {{was born}} in San Francisco, California, the {{daughter}} of Kathryn [...] "Kitty" [...] (née Kidd), a fashion model, and George E. Fossey III, an insurance agent. Her parents divorced when she was six. Her mother remarried the following year, to businessman Richard Price. Her father tried to keep in full contact, but her mother discouraged it, and all contact was subsequently lost. Fossey's stepfather, Richard Price, never treated her as his own child. He would not allow Fossey to sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> with him or her mother during dinner meals. A man adhering to strict discipline, Richard Price offered Fossey little to no emotional support. Struggling with personal insecurity, Fossey turned to animals {{as a way to}} gain acceptance. Her love for animals began with her first pet goldfish and continued throughout her entire life. At age six, she began horse riding, earning a letter from her school; by her graduation in 1954, Fossey had established herself as an equestrienne.|$|E
50|$|Barber {{was married}} twice and fathered five children; 3 sons and 2 daughters. Perhaps fittingly, Barber died peacefully on November 29, 2007, at his farm {{of natural causes}} while sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> reading a {{cookbook}} with a pot of chicken soup simmering on the stove.

5000|$|... "Oh! for {{one breath}} of cool Carthona air, which used so to refresh us after having taken a run round the green, or when at night {{after one of}} these hot windy days, tired and wearied out, we used all to sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> window, waiting for the Southerly wind to blow, then what a rush, what a {{scramble}} to get out, and what a glorious run we would have chasing each other round! Ah, then we were happy, at least I was, always looking forward into a bright future every day I thought would bring us more happiness" ...|$|R
50|$|After {{his flight}} and death, {{his wife and}} {{children}} remained in the house. Sometime almost two decades later, in the 1870s, they sold it to William Fitch, a relative of Ezra Fitch. Later it was the property of county treasurer John Broadhead. During his tenure, {{around the turn of the}} century, the front porch was redone in a Colonial Revival mode and <b>the</b> columns <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> entryway were added. In the early 20th century, Broadhead moved to Connecticut after he was accused of stealing $80-200,000 from <b>the</b> county. <b>At</b> a public auction in 1907 it was sold to Samuel Gray, a grain dealer from Saugerties.|$|R

5000|$|The {{author has}} stated that he began writing Antiquitas Lost while sitting at Anne Rice's dining room table. Although the author and Ms. Rice were neighbors from 2003 to 2005, they have never met. The author bought Ms. Rice's dining room table from an estate sale at one of her New Orlean's properties, the old St. Elizabeth's orphanage. [...] He {{has stated that}} he hoped working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> would bring him luck, and that he {{imagined}} that Ms. Rice may have sat {{at the same table}} while working on one of her Vampire Chronicles books.|$|E
50|$|Štrba uses {{a digital}} camera to capture moments and figures in film and still, which she then colors {{with the aid of}} {{computer}} programs. This digital manipulation provides Štrba’s images with a sense of painterliness and allows her to abandon naturalism and realist details in favor of complex visual textures. She often photographs around the family homes just outside of Zurich or in the Swiss mountains, where they spend many weekends and holidays. The product is a personal and poetically abstract documentation of the life around her, capturing her subjects <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table,</b> grooming, in the chaos of untidy rooms, or surrounded by nature. Overall, a personal story is told of the intertwined lives and relationships, speaking to memories, reactions, and nostalgic realization.|$|E
50|$|Five years later, in Grand Theft Auto V, Niko is briefly {{mentioned}} by Patrick McReary, {{who says he}} does not know whether Niko is alive or not when remarking on their bank robbery; the other two crew members, Michael Keane and Derrick McReary had died since then, and Packie had lost contact with Niko in the intervening years. Another reference appears {{at the end of the}} game: should Michael survive and find his family <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table,</b> his son Jimmy is stalking Niko on LifeInvader, a parody of Facebook. Apparently Niko had moved back to Broker in the intervening years in between games and is now working as a taxi driver for Roman's cab service. A closer inspection reveals that Niko has wished Roman a happy birthday, although Rockstar noted that the choice to inadvertently cause Roman's death is not non-canon.|$|E
50|$|In March 1915, Martanda Bhairava Tondaiman, the Raja of Pudukkottai came to Australia on a {{visit and}} checked in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Hotel Majestic Mansions where he met Molly Fink <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> He was enamoured by Molly Fink and joined Molly, her mother and sister at Hotel Hydro Majestic near Sydney and {{subsequently}} accompanied them {{when they returned to}} Melbourne. Five months later, Martanda proposed to her and she accepted. The couple got engaged on 6 August 1915 and married on 10 August 1915 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> registrar's office in Melbourne. The newly-wed couple went to San Francisco in August 1915 to see the Panama Exhibition. Martanda returned to India with his Australian bride in October 1915.|$|R

60|$|The June roses {{over the}} porch were awake bright and {{early on that}} morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the {{cloudless}} sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> windows where <b>the</b> feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long.|$|R
50|$|After Fred leaves, Grudge {{once again}} hears the record playing upstairs, {{and sees a}} short vision of the {{deceased}} Marley sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table.</b> Suddenly Grudge finds himself aboard a World War I-era troopship, which is carrying many coffins. A soldier on board introduces himself as the Ghost of Christmas Past (Lawrence) and explains that the ship is carrying the dead of all nations and from all past wars, with more war dead arriving even as he speaks. The Ghost suggests {{that the way to}} stop the killing is to spend more time talking to resolve conflicts, since when talking stops, fighting starts. He and Grudge revisit a scene from Grudge's past in which Grudge, a Navy commander, accompanied by his WAVE driver (Saint), visited a hospital in devastated Hiroshima and saw Japanese schoolchildren whose faces had been destroyed by the atom bomb.|$|E

5000|$|Jones {{was devastated}} when Suzanne Crough died on April 27, 2015; Crough played {{one of her}} TV daughters on The Partridge Family. She had a very close {{relationship}} with the younger actress and remained close friends long after the series was cancelled. Jones said of Crough's death on Hollywood life: I am so devastated to hear of the sad and sudden loss of Suzanne. I still remember her as my young daughter on The Partridge Family. She was the baby of the show. It's a rude awakening that we are all mortal. How fleeting life is. My heart goes out to her family and children.

50|$|Harberton's present {{manager and}} part-owner, Tommy Goodall (born 1933), is Thomas Bridges’s great-grandson, who still manages the estancia with his wife, American {{biologist}} Rae Natalie Prosser, {{with help from}} their daughter and her children. (Though the Bridges name has been daughtered out, there is a Thomas in every generation.) The principal enterprise {{in the 21st century}} is tourism. Visitors can tour the grounds, outbuildings, gardens, cemetery, and a botanical garden with replica Yamana huts. Nearby is the Museo Acatushún de Aves y Mamíferos Marinos Australes of the natural history of the region’s marine mammals and birds. It is also possible to visit Magellanic penguin rookeries at Isla Martillo not far away. Overnight guests can rent a room in the remodeled cookhouse or, with permission, camp on the grounds.

50|$|The {{floor of}} the front entry porch, under the arcade, is raised several steps above the {{surrounding}} level. From the entry porch, a pair of timber panelled doors with a decorative glass and timber surround open into an entry vestibule. The vestibule is tiled with multi-coloured tessellated tiles and decorative mouldings including cornice, picture rail and skirting. A set of timber-framed doors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the vestibule has side panels and a fanlight, {{all of which are}} glazed with decorative leadlight. These doors open onto a corridor that runs north south through the building and a stairwell that leads to the upper floors. The corridor, which terminates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> entrance to the former senior classroom <b>at</b> <b>the</b> northern end and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> in <b>the</b> southern extension, leads past a series of smaller rooms on either side of it, including former offices and parlours. In the stairwell opposite the vestibule is a grand marble and timber staircase, square in plan and wrapped around a central void.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{supervision}} of architect Tilman François Suys, Bouchout Castle underwent a medieval metamorphosis. The Neo-Gothic renovations included, amongst others, demolishing the southern wing thereby rendering an open structure, modifying roof façades with gothic battelements, introducing neogothic windows, and adding further neo-gothic details to enhance the medieval charisma of the castle. Also illustrative for this period, were the curious objects and old paintings the noble families tend to collect. A fine example is the Armoury gallery (Salle d'armes) which was situated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first flour of Bouchout Castle. In later years, the rooms adjacent to this gallery were removed and nowadays it is a conference room of 165 m². The renovated Bouchout Castle also harboured several Neo-Renaissance elements such as <b>the</b> fireplace <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and <b>the</b> ceilings of the Empress Room and White Room. After the death of count Amedeus de Beauffort († 1858) and his wife countess Elisabeth Roose-de Baisy († 1873), their son Leopold became owner of Bouchout Castle. He did not marry and apparently lived in the Donjon tower.|$|R

Norm throws some of Carla's peas at her, and she then throws carrots back at him. Cliff throws mashed yams at Frasier, who accidentally throws gravy skin back at Woody, intended for Cliff. The whole gang is poised to start a food fight until Diane stands up and tells them loudly to stop. When she is close to scolding them, Sam throws cranberry sauce <b>at</b> her, so <b>the</b> food fight resumes. By the time the food fight ends, the turkey is finally cooked. The gang calms down and decides to eat what they can. Diane comes out of the kitchen and throws a pumpkin pie to spite Sam for throwing cranberry sauce <b>at</b> her. <b>The</b> pie misses Sam but accidentally hits Vera as she enters. Vera tells Norm to fetch his coat, and Norm says, [...] "Yes, dear." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Vote:The final {{segment of}} the show {{takes place in a}} <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> that has {{refrigerators}} labeled with each contestant's name (active contestants have their name illuminated) and filled with that contestant's favorite tempting foods. Prior to the vote, contestants facing elimination plead their case as to why they should remain on the Ranch (several episodes feature contestants making a [...] "sacrificial" [...] request to be sent home, generally a team agreeing as to which member should stay and which one should go, or one contestant feeling that they can make progress at home while another needs the Ranch setting to continue his/her progress). The other contestants are not required to honor any requests to be sent home, though generally such requests are honored. The contestants facing elimination arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> first; <b>the</b> other contestants each carry a covered plate containing the name of the person they wish to vote out.
