5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} chattel slavery (personal possession, where the slave was regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of property {{as opposed to}} a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other chattel.|$|E
5|$|The Dying Swan (originally The Swan) is a solo choreographed by Mikhail Fokine in 1905 to Camille Saint-Saëns's Le Cygne from Le Carnaval des animaux <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pièce</b> d'occasion for the {{ballerina}} Anna Pavlova, {{who performed}} it about 4,000 times. The short ballet (4 minutes) follows the last {{moments in the}} life of a swan, and was first presented in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. The ballet has since influenced modern interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and has inspired non-traditional interpretations and various adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{attracted}} many reviews, {{with interest}} from scientific, geographic, church and general periodicals. Reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories, especially {{the division of}} fauna and flora along what soon {{became known as the}} Wallace line, natural selection and uniformitarianism. Nearly all agreed that he had provided an interesting and comprehensive account of the geography, natural history, and peoples of the archipelago, which was little known to their readers at the time, and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens. The book is much cited, and is Wallace's most successful, both commercially and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of literature.|$|E

TSO director MacMillan viewed this first-ever US invitation as a golden opportunity to garner more international invitations for the orchestra. He added vocal soloist Lois Marshall to the orchestra, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> by an American composer, Herbert Elwell's work Pastorale, and Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations, to the repertoire.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, {{computer}} store owner, {{was killed}} in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed {{in the parking lot}} of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to remove it from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would play a vital role in Kaczynski's capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's involvement in the Unabomber cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Kaczynski was detained in 1996. David Kaczynski and Wright have remained friends and occasionally speak together publicly about their relationship.|$|E

5|$|Mici {{had been}} a student in Pittsburgh, and wanted {{to return to the}} United States. Her chance came in 1935, when, thanks to George Gamow, Teller was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics at George Washington University, where he worked with Gamow until 1941. At George Washington University in 1937, Teller {{predicted}} the Jahn–Teller effect, which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and Hermann Arthur Jahn analyzed it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Stephen Brunauer and Paul Hugh Emmett, Teller also made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm. Teller and Mici became naturalized citizens of the United States on March 6, 1941.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of sophisticated equipment designed to inform {{the captain of the}} ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the tube map <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of {{information}} design has led to many imitations of its format. What is probably the earliest example is the Sydney Suburban and City Underground railway map of 1939.

25|$|By 1845, {{all that}} was left of the Stourbridge Lion was its boiler. The boiler was still functional, however, and it was used in a foundry in Carbondale for about another five years until the foundry's owner headed west to try his luck as a Forty-niner. The foundry was sold a few years later to new owners who {{recognized}} the boiler's value <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of history, and reportedly tried to sell it for $1,000 (equal to $ today) in 1874. The owners weren't able to find a buyer so they hung onto it themselves.|$|E
