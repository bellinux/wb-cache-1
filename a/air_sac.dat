5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an <b>air</b> <b>sac,</b> {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|Tympanal organs {{or hearing}} organs {{consist of a}} {{membrane}} (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> and associated sensory neurons, are found in two families. Several species of the genus Cicindela (Carabidae) have hearing organs on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the Dynastinae (within the Scarabaeidae) have hearing organs just beneath their pronotal shields or neck membranes. Both families are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence indicating they function to detect the presence of bats by their ultrasonic echolocation.|$|E
25|$|Three {{distinct}} sets {{of organs}} perform respiration — the anterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> (interclavicular, cervicals, and anterior thoracics), the lungs, and the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> (posterior thoracics and abdominals). Typically {{there are nine}} <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> within the system; however, that number can range between seven and twelve, depending on the species of bird. Passerines possess seven <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> as the clavicular <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> may interconnect or be fused with the anterior thoracic sacs.|$|R
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>sacs</b> are “sac-like {{extensions}} of the larynx or {{other parts of the}} vocal tract ” (Hewitt et al. 2000) There are many different types of <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> in primates, but this poster focuses on <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> that are connected to the vocal tract above the glottis. Such <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> occur in many primates, including the great apes, but not in humans. Furthermore, fossil evidence (relating to the shape of the hyoid bone) indicates that Homo heidelbergensis (Martínez et al. 2008) did not have <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> whereas Australopithecus africanus (Alamseged et al. 2006) did. It is therefore tempting to seek a relation between <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> and the evolution of speech. There is considerable uncertainty about the role of <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> Bioacousticians generally assume an acoustic role and write about “resonance”, “impedance matching”, “radiation ” (Gautier 1964, Hilloowala 1978, Schön Ybarra 1986). Other researchers propose functions not directly related to acoustics, such as rebreathing of air (Negus 1949) or prevention of hyperventilation (Hewitt et al. 2000) The situation is complicated by the lack of accurate acoustic models of <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> In the research presented here, a detailed model of supralaryngeal <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> is constructed. Note that this research is intended as an exploration of the acoustic possibilities of <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> and that the intention is not at all to rule out potential other functions of <b>air</b> <b>sacs...</b>|$|R
25|$|Evidence of <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> {{has also}} been found in theropods. Studies {{indicate}} that fossils of coelurosaurs, ceratosaurs, and the theropods Coelophysis and Aerosteon exhibit evidence of <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> Coelophysis, from the late Triassic, {{is one of the}} earliest dinosaurs whose fossils show evidence of channels for <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> Aerosteon, a Late Cretaceous allosaur, had the most bird-like <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> found so far.|$|R
5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. <b>Air</b> <b>sac</b> extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
50|$|In {{advanced}} sauropods ("neosauropods") the vertebrae of {{the lower}} back and hip regions show signs of <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> In early sauropods only the cervical (neck) vertebrae show these features. If the developmental sequence found in bird embryos is a guide, <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> actually evolved before the channels in the skeleton that accommodate them in later forms.Evidence of <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> has also been found in theropods. Studies indicate that fossils of coelurosaurs, ceratosaurs, and the theropods Coelophysis and Aerosteon exhibit evidence of <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> Coelophysis, from the late Triassic, {{is one of the}} earliest dinosaurs whose fossils show evidence of channels for <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> Aerosteon, a Late Cretaceous allosaur, had the most bird-like <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> found so far.|$|R
5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> in their bones. The <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> are inflated. The <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|R
500|$|The lungs {{of birds}} are {{relatively}} small, but {{are connected to}} 8 or 9 <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> that extend {{through much of the}} body, and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. On inhalation, air travels through the trachea of a bird into the <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> <b>Air</b> then travels continuously from the <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively fixed in size, to the <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> at the front. From here, the air is exhaled. These fixed size lungs are called [...] "circulatory lungs", as distinct from the [...] "bellows-type lungs" [...] found in most other animals.|$|R
25|$|The {{palaeontologist}} Peter Ward {{has argued}} that the evolution of the <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> system, which first appears in the very earliest dinosaurs, may have been in response to the very low (11%) atmospheric oxygen of the Carnian and Norian ages of the Triassic Period.|$|E
25|$|However, Sauroposeidon has a gracile neck {{compared}} to Giraffatitan. If {{the rest of}} the body turns out to be similarly slender, the mass estimate may be too high. This could be similar to the way the relatively robust Apatosaurus weighs far more than the longer but much slimmer Diplodocus. In addition, it is possible that sauropods may have had an <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> system, like those in birds, which could reduce all sauropod mass estimates by 20%or more.|$|E
25|$|The avian {{vocal organ}} {{is called the}} syrinx; it is a bony {{structure}} {{at the bottom of}} the trachea (unlike the larynx at the top of the mammalian trachea). The syrinx and sometimes a surrounding <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> resonate to sound waves that are made by membranes past which the bird forces air. The bird controls the pitch by changing the tension on the membranes and controls both pitch and volume by changing the force of exhalation. It can control the two sides of the trachea independently, which is how some species can produce two notes at once.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} any ostelogical features which might prevent paradoxical movement (=lateral collapse) of the abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> in birds during inhalation. A combination of 26 fresh and frozen adult bird carcasses representing 10 avian orders were procured from local sources. Dissections of each specimen first entailed the inflation of the respiratory system via a tracheal tube. The trachea was then sealed off to prevent deflation of the <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> Next, the abdominal and thoracic cavities were carefully dissected to expose the inflated <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> Using a set of Whitworth electronic digital calipers, a series of two measurements were taken on each carcass: 1. from the posterior sternal tip to the posterior end of the abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> and 2. from the posterior sternal tip to the tip of the pubic bone. Results indicated a strong correlation between the post-sternal length and position of the abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> and the post-sternal extension of the pubic bones, such that lateral support of the abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> was provided by the pubic bones. These data suggest that during inhalation the pubic bones probably serve to prevent the lateral collapse of these <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> The pubic bones of theropod dinosaurs, and even Archaeopteryx, were vertically orientated and distally fused. Therefore, it is unlikely that these taxa ventilated a set of abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> and where unlikely to have possessed an avian lung-air sac system...|$|R
5000|$|Birds have lungs but no diaphragm. They rely {{mostly on}} <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> for ventilation. These <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> do {{not play a}} direct role in gas {{exchange}}, but help to move air unidirectionally across the gas exchange surfaces in the lungs. During inhalation, fresh air is taken from the trachea down into the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> and into the parabronchi which lead from the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> into the lung. The air that enters the lungs joins the air which {{is already in the}} lungs, and is drawn forward across the gas exchanger into anterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> During exhalation, the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> force <b>air</b> into the same parabronchi of the lungs, flowing {{in the same direction as}} during inhalation, allowing continuous gas exchange irrespective of the breathing cycle. Air exiting the lungs during exhalation joins the air being expelled from the anterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> (both consisting of [...] "spent air" [...] that has passed through the gas exchanger) entering the trachea to be exhaled (Fig. 10). Selective bronchoconstriction at the various bronchial branch points ensures that the air does not ebb and flow through the bronchi during inhalation and exhalation, as it does in mammals, but follows the paths described above.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: On inhalation, air {{travels to}} <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> {{near the back}} of a bird. The air then passes through the lungs to <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> near the front of the bird, from where the air is exhaled.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} Gouldian finches has {{decreased}} quite dramatically during the 20th century. Their habitat {{has been reduced}} or altered. Early research indicated a parasite called the <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> mite {{was responsible for the}} decline of the species. This is no longer considered to be a major factor. In general, Gouldian finches are susceptible to diseases and viral infections. Their beautiful colours mean that they are easily caught by predators. Fires are listed as the primary threat to the natural populations. The total number of Gouldian finches altogether is not low, however, because they are among the most popular pet birds, and are bred in captivity for the pet trade.|$|E
25|$|Tympanal {{organs are}} hearing organs. Such an organ is {{generally}} a membrane (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> and associated sensory neurons. In the order Coleoptera, tympanal organs {{have been described}} {{in at least two}} families. Several species of the genus Cicindela in the family Cicindelidae have ears on the dorsal surface of the first abdominal segment beneath the wing; two tribes in the family Dynastinae (Scarabaeidae) have ears just beneath the pronotal shield or neck membrane. The ears of both families are to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence that they function to detect the presence of bats via their ultrasonic echolocation. Even though beetles constitute a large order and live in a variety of niches, examples of hearing is surprisingly lacking in species, though it is likely that most are just undiscovered.|$|E
25|$|The Pelagornithidae had {{extremely}} thin-walled bones widely pneumatized {{with the}} <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> {{extensions of the}} lungs. Most limb bone fossils are very much crushed for that reason. In life, the thin bones and extensive pneumatization enabled the birds to achieve large size while remaining below critical wing loadings. Though 25kg/m2 (5lb/ft2) {{is regarded as the}} maximum wing loading for powered bird flight, there is evidence that bony-toothed birds used dynamic soaring flight almost exclusively: the proximal end of the humerus had an elongated diagonal shape that could hardly have allowed for the movement necessary for the typical flapping flight of birds; their weight thus cannot be easily estimated. The attachment positions for the muscles responsible for holding the upper arm straightly outstretched were particularly well-developed, and altogether the anatomy seems to allow for an ability of holding the wings rigidly at the glenoid joint unmatched by any other known bird. This is especially prominent in the Neogene pelagornithids, and less developed in the older Paleogene forms. The sternum had the deep and short shape typical of dynamic soarers, and bony outgrowths at the keel's forward margin securely anchored the furcula.|$|E
25|$|So far no {{evidence}} of <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> {{has been found in}} ornithischian dinosaurs. But this does not imply that ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|During {{inhalation}} air {{enters the}} trachea via the nostrils and mouth, {{and continues to}} just beyond the syrinx {{at which point the}} trachea branches into two primary bronchi, going to the two lungs (Fig.16). [...] The primary bronchi enter the lungs to become the intrapulmonary bronchi, which give off a set of parallel branches called ventrobronchi and, a little further on, an equivalent set of dorsobronchi (Fig.16). The ends of the intrapulmonary bronchi discharge air into the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> at the caudal end of the bird. Each pair of [...] dorso-ventrobronchi is connected by a large number of parallel microscopic air capillaries (or parabronchi) where gas exchange occurs (Fig.16). As the bird inhales, tracheal air flows through the intrapulmonary bronchi into the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> as well as into the dorsobronchi, but not into the ventrobronchi (Fig.18). This is due to the bronchial architecture which directs the inhaled air away from the openings of the ventrobronchi, into the continuation of the intrapulmonary bronchus towards the dorsobronchi and posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> From the dorsobronchi the inhaled air flows through the parabronchi (and therefore the gas exchanger) to the ventrobronchi from where the air can only escape into the expanding anterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> So, during inhalation, both the posterior and anterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> expand, the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> filling with fresh inhaled air, while the anterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> fill with [...] "spent" [...] (oxygen-poor) air that has just passed through the lungs.|$|R
50|$|Ravens {{have a high}} {{metabolic}} rate that drives flight. Air flow is directed through the lungs via <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> The sacs are {{used to create a}} continuous unidirectional flow of fresh air over the respiratory surface. Most birds have nine <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> grouped into anterior and posterior sacs, but the common raven {{as a member of the}} Passeriformes group only has seven <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> (missing two cervical <b>air</b> <b>sacs).</b> The common raven can be found in all parts of the globe. At higher altitudes and in warmer climates the oxygen concentration in the air is lower compared to low altitude or colder climate. Also, flight is a much more metabolically demanding movement then walking or running, and therefore we see a proportionally larger respiratory system in birds than in mammals.|$|R
500|$|The walrus has an <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> {{under its}} throat which {{acts like a}} {{floatation}} bubble and allows it to bob vertically {{in the water and}} sleep.

500|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that pterosaurs had a lung-air sac system and a {{precisely}} controlled skeletal breathing pump, which supports a flow-through pulmonary ventilation model in pterosaurs, analogous to that of birds. The presence of a [...] <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> system {{in at least some}} pterodactyloids would have further reduced the density of the living animal.|$|E
500|$|Scientists have reconstructed the {{respiratory}} system of Majungasaurus {{based on a}} superbly preserved series of vertebrae (UA 8678) recovered from the Maevarano Formation. Most of these vertebrae {{and some of the}} ribs contained cavities (pneumatic [...] ) that may have resulted from the infiltration of avian-style lungs and air sacs. In birds, the neck vertebrae and ribs are hollowed out by the cervical <b>air</b> <b>sac,</b> the upper back vertebrae by the lung, and the lower back and sacral (hip) vertebrae by the abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sac.</b> Similar features in Majungasaurus vertebrae imply the presence of these air sacs. These air sacs may have allowed for a basic form of avian-style 'flow-through ventilation,' where air flow through the lungs is one-way, so that oxygen-rich air inhaled from outside the body is never mixed with exhaled air laden with carbon dioxide. This method of respiration, while complicated, is highly efficient.|$|E
40|$|Great apes and siamangs—but not humans—possess {{laryngeal}} <b>air</b> <b>sacs,</b> {{suggesting that}} they were lost over hominin evolution. The absence of <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> in humans may hold clues to speech evolution, but {{little is known about}} their functions in extant apes. We investigated whether gorillas use their <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> to produce the staccato ‘growling’ of the silverback chest beat display. This hypothesis was formulated after viewing a nature documentary showing a display by a silverback western gorilla (Kingo). As Kingo growls, the video shows distinctive vibrations in his chest and throat under which the <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> extend. We also investigated whether other similarly staccato vocalizations—the whinny, sex whinny, and copulation grunt—might also involve the <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b> To examine these hypotheses, we collected an opportunistic sample of video and audio evidence from research records and another documentary of Kingo’s group, and from videos of other gorillas found on YouTube. Analysis shows that the four vocalizations are each emitted in rapid pulses of a similar frequency (8 – 16 pulses per second), and limited visual evidence indicates that they may all occur with upper torso vibrations. Future research should determine how consistently the vibrations co-occur with the vocalizations, whether they are synchronized, and their precise location and timing. Our findings fit with the hypothesis that apes—especially, but not exclusively males—use their <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> for vocalizations and displays related to size exaggeration for sex and territory. Thus changes in social structure, mating, and sexual dimorphism might have led to the obsolescence of the <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> and their loss in hominin evolution...|$|R
2500|$|During {{exhalation}} {{the pressure}} in the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> (which were filled with fresh air during inhalation) increases due to the contraction of the oblique muscle described above. The aerodynamics of the interconnecting openings from the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> to the dorsobronchi and intrapulmonary bronchi ensures that the <b>air</b> leaves these <b>sacs</b> {{in the direction of}} the lungs (via the dorsobronchi), rather than returning down the intrapulmonary bronchi (Fig.18). From the dorsobronchi the fresh air from the posterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> flows through the parabronchi (in the same direction as occurred during inhalation) into ventrobronchi. The air passages connecting the ventrobronchi and anterior <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> to the intrapulmonary bronchi direct the [...] "spent", oxygen poor air from these two organs to the trachea from where it escapes to the exterior. Oxygenated air therefore flows constantly (during the entire breathing cycle) in a single direction through the parabronchi.|$|R
2500|$|To {{compensate}} for the large [...] "dead" [...] space, the common ostrich trachea lacks valves to allow faster inspiratory air flow. In addition, the total lung capacity of the respiratory system, (including the lungs and ten <b>air</b> <b>sacs)</b> of a [...] ostrich is about , with a tidal volume ranging from [...] The tidal volume is seen to double resulting in a 16-fold increase in ventilation. Overall, ostrich respiration {{can be thought of}} as a high velocity-low pressure system. At rest, there is small pressure differences between the ostrich <b>air</b> <b>sacs</b> and the atmosphere, suggesting simultaneous filling and emptying of the <b>air</b> <b>sacs.</b>|$|R
500|$|Sound travels {{differently}} through water, {{and therefore}} marine mammals have developed adaptations to ensure effective communication, prey capture, and predator detection. The most notable adaptation {{is the development}} of echolocation in whales and dolphins. [...] Toothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency clicks in the direction that their head is pointing. Sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic lips. These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the 'melon'. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities.|$|E
500|$|Many saurischian dinosaurs possessed {{vertebrae}} {{and ribs}} that contained hollowed-out cavities (pneumatic foramina), which reduced {{the weight of}} the bones and may have served as a basic 'flow-through ventilation' system similar to that of modern birds. In such a system, the neck vertebrae and ribs are hollowed out by the cervical air sac; the upper back vertebrae, by the lung; and the lower back and sacral (hip) vertebrae, by the abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sac.</b> These organs constitute a complex and very efficient method of respiration. [...] "Prosauropods" [...] are the only major group of saurischians without an extensive system of pneumatic foramina. Although possible pneumatic indentations have been found in Plateosaurus and Thecodontosaurus, the indentations were very small. One study in 2007 concluded that basal sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs, based on the evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether basal sauropodomorphs had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present.|$|E
2500|$|Morphology of {{the common}} ostrich lung {{indicates}} that the structure conforms {{to that of the}} other avian species, but still retains parts of its primitive avian species, ratite, structure. The opening to the respiratory pathway begins with the laryngeal cavity lying posterior to the choanae within the buccal cavity. The tip of the tongue then lies anterior to the choanae, excluding the nasal respiratory pathway from the buccal cavity. The trachea lies ventrally to the cervical vertebrae extending from the larynx to the syrinx, where the trachea enters the thorax, dividing into two primary bronchi, one to each lung, in which they continue directly through to become mesobronchi. Ten different air sacs attach to the lungs to form areas for respiration. The most posterior air sacs (abdominal and post-thoracic) differ in that the right abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> is relatively small, lying {{to the right of the}} mesentery, and dorsally to the liver. While the left abdominal <b>air</b> <b>sac</b> is large and lies to the left of the mesentery.

While the caudal end of the mesobronchus branches into several dorsobronchi. Together, the ventrobronchi and dorsobronchi are connected by intra-pulmonary airways, the parabronchi, which form an arcade structure within the lung called the paleopulmo. It is the only structure found in primitive birds such as ratites.|$|E
