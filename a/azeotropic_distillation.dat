25|$|Extractive {{distillation}} {{is similar}} to <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillation,</b> except {{in this case the}} entrainer is less volatile than any of the azeotrope's constituents. For example, the azeotrope of 20% acetone with 80% chloroform can be broken by adding water and distilling the result. The water forms a separate layer in which the acetone preferentially dissolves. The result is that the distillate is richer in chloroform than the original azeotrope.|$|E
25|$|There are {{basically}} three dehydration processes {{to remove the}} water from an azeotropic ethanol/water mixture. The first process, used in many early fuel ethanol plants, is called <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillation</b> and consists of adding benzene or cyclohexane to the mixture. When these components {{are added to the}} mixture, it forms a heterogeneous azeotropic mixture in vapor–liquid-liquid equilibrium, which when distilled produces anhydrous ethanol in the column bottom, and a vapor mixture of water, ethanol, and cyclohexane/benzene.|$|E
25|$|To break <b>azeotropic</b> <b>{{distillation}}s</b> {{and cross}} distillation boundaries, {{such as in}} the DeRosier Problem, it is necessary to increase the composition of the light key in the distillate.|$|R
50|$|This {{piece of}} {{equipment}} is usually used in <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillations.</b> A common example is the removal of water generated during a reaction in boiling toluene. An azeotropic mixture of toluene and water distills out of the reaction, but only the toluene (density: 0.865g/ml) returns, since it floats {{on top of the}} water (density: 0.998g/ml), which collects in the trap. The Dean-Stark method is commonly used to measure moisture content of items such as bread in the food industry.|$|R

25|$|Ethylene glycol {{is used as}} a {{protecting}} {{group for}} carbonyl groups in organic synthesis. Treating a ketone or aldehyde with ethylene glycol in the presence of an acid catalyst (e.g., p-toluenesulfonic acid; BF3·Et2O) gives the corresponding a 1,3-dioxolane, which is resistant to bases and other nucleophiles. The 1,3-dioxolane protecting group can thereafter be removed by further acid hydrolysis. In this example, isophorone was protected using ethylene glycol with p-toluenesulfonic acid in moderate yield. Water was removed by <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillation</b> to shift the equilibrium to the right.|$|E
25|$|Absolute or {{anhydrous}} alcohol refers to ethanol {{with a low}} water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillation</b> is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene). Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol {{is used as a}} solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{separation}} involve introducing an additional agent, called an entrainer, {{that will affect}} the volatility {{of one of the}} azeotrope constituents more than another. When an entrainer is added to a binary azeotrope to form a ternary azeotrope, and the resulting mixture distilled, the method is called <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillation.</b> The best known example is adding benzene or cyclohexane to the water/ethanol azeotrope. With cyclohexane as the entrainer, the ternary azeotrope is 7% water, 17% ethanol, and 76% cyclohexane, and boils at 62.1°C. Just enough cyclohexane is added to the water/ethanol azeotrope to engage all of the water into the ternary azeotrope. When the mixture is then boiled, the azeotrope vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol.|$|E
40|$|Azeotropes, or close-boiling {{mixtures}} often preclude conventional distillation as {{a method}} of separation. Instead, extractive or <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillations</b> are commonly used to separate close or azeotropic boiling mixtures. For the design of these separation units, selecting suitable solvents is an indispensable step. The traditional method for solving this problem is through experimentation which is time-consuming and expensive. A new approach is offered by combining heuristic knowledge and numerical methods for solvent screening {{in the form of a}} knowledge-based expert system. The prototype expert system takes as inputs a small amount of physico-chemical property data for pure components and mixtures, and the processes which are suitable for the separation of a close boiling or an azeotropic mixture are selected. Then the expert system proposes solvents from the solvent databases based on the requirements of the process under consideration. The heuristic knowledge and numerical knowledge from different sources for selecting solvents for mass-based separation are organized through ac task-oriented framework as the representing strategy. The structured heuristic search hierarchy has been developed as the problem-solving strategy that an expert follows. At present, the prototype expert system is limited to the preliminary selection of promising solvents fo...|$|R

25|$|With {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted {{by the majority of}} modern ethanol plants. This new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from fuel ethanol. In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads. The bead's pores are sized to allow adsorption of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N2) to remove the adsorbed water. Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 kJ/L) compared to earlier <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Both {{processes}} {{require that}} the isopropyl alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. Isopropyl alcohol and water form an azeotrope and simple distillation gives a material that is 87.9% by weight isopropyl alcohol and 12.1% by weight water. [...] Pure (anhydrous) isopropyl alcohol is made by <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillation</b> of the wet isopropyl alcohol using either diisopropyl ether or cyclohexane as azeotroping agents.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{azeotrope}} is {{not considered}} sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillation.</b> Some techniques achieve this by [...] "jumping" [...] over the azeotropic composition (by adding another component {{to create a new}} azeotrope, or by varying the pressure). Others work by chemically or physically removing or sequestering the impurity. For example, to purify ethanol beyond 95%, a drying agent (or desiccant, such as potassium carbonate) can be added to convert the soluble water into insoluble water of crystallization. Molecular sieves are often used for this purpose as well.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this article, a {{systematic}} {{study of the}} separation of the n-hexane - ethyl acetate mixture with an entrainer by heterogeneous <b>azeotropic</b> batch <b>distillation</b> is performed. Based upon the thermodynamic behaviour of the ternary mixtures, potential entrainers partially miscible with one or two original azeotropic components are chosen. In all cases, the entrainer adds a heterogeneous binary or ternary azeotrope that is the lowest boiling point in the ternary diagram. Therefore, it leaves the column by the overhead stream which is subcooled to get two liquid phases in the decanter. The phase with the highest amount of the original component is removed as distillate product whereas the entrainer – rich phase is continuously refluxed to the column. Considering methanol, acetonitrile, water and nitromethane as heterogeneous entrainers, screening was performed based on the composition of the unstable heteroazeotropic mixture, the ratio of both liquid phases in the condensed top vapour and the purity of the distillate product determined by the liquid – liquid envelope at the decanter temperature. The process feasibility analysis is validated by using rigorous simulation with the batch process simulator ProSimBatch. Simulation results are then corroborated in a bench experimental column for the selected entrainer, showing several advantages of heterogeneous batch distillation compared to homogeneous systems...|$|R
40|$|Energy use in many process {{industries}} {{is dominated by}} separation processes. As energy costs are rising rapidly, there is {{a renewed interest in}} better methodologies for the synthesis, design and/or retrofitting of separation processes. In this thesis, a novel method for determining energy efficient process designs based on finding the separation with the shortest stripping line distance is proposed. A problem formulation based on mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) is given and a global optimization algorithm is presented for determining energy efficient process designs. A variety of examples of separations involving ideal, non-ideal, azeotropic and reactive mixtures are used to demonstrate the versatility and advantages of the shortest stripping line distance approach over available methods in literature. One of the major advantages of the proposed methodology is that {{it can be used to}} identify minimum energy requirement for multi-unit processes such as hybrid separations involving extraction followed by distillation and reaction/separation/recycle processes. The proposed shortest stripping line distance method is extended and a two-level distillation design procedure is developed for finding portfolios of minimum energy designs when specifications are given in terms of key component recoveries. It is shown that the proposed two-level design procedure is flexible and can find minimum energy designs for both zeotropic and <b>azeotropic</b> <b>distillations.</b> It is also shown that the two-level design method encompasses Underwood 2 ̆ 7 s solution, when it exists, and can find minimum energy designs when Underwood 2 ̆ 7 s method is not applicable. This two-level design approach also overcomes the well-know limitation of distillation line methods of sensitivity of column profiles to the product compositions. Non-pinched, minimum energy distillation designs are an important and often overlooked class of distillation designs that provided added economic advantages in practice. All current methods for designing distillation columns available in literature are based on the concept of pinch points and are incapable of finding non-pinched, minimum energy solutions. In contrast, it is demonstrated that shortest stripping line distance approach is capable of systematically and reliably finding non-pinched, minimum energy distillation designs as well as providing insights into the reasons for the existence of non-pinched, minimum energy design. These reasons include · trajectories that follow unstable branches of a pinch point curve in azeotropic systems, the inherent looping structure of trajectories in hydrocarbon separations, and the presence of ancillary constraints in multi-unit processes like extraction/distillation. Several examples are studied and many numerical results and geometric illustrations are presented in each section show that the shortest stripping line distance methodology is indeed a powerful and versatile tool for designing energy efficient processes and can be considered as a next generation method for conceptual design of energy efficient chemical processes...|$|R
