50|$|In {{his history}} essay Le Masque de fer, French novelist Marcel Pagnol, {{supporting}} his theory in particular {{on the circumstances}} of King Louis XIV's birth, claims that the Man in the Iron mask was indeed a twin but born second, and hence the younger, {{and would have been}} hidden in order to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> dispute <b>over</b> the throne holder.|$|R

5000|$|The Kentucky-Tennessee game once {{involved}} a trophy: a wooden beer barrel painted half blue and half orange which {{was awarded to}} {{the winner of the}} game every year from 1925 to 1997. The Barrel was introduced in 1925 by a group of former Kentucky students who wanted to create a material sign of their school's supremacy in the rivalry.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} design of a {{thyristor}} controlled three winding partial core resonant transformer specially designed for testing generator insulation. The tertiary winding of this transformer is closed through a Thyristor Controlled Reactor (TCR). Firing angle control of an anti- parallel connected pair of thyristors provides continuous variation of reactive power. Modelling of the three winding transformer in PSCAD/EMTDC reveals the design criteria and performance of the proposed scheme. Automatic control of thyristor valves will be achieved by sensing the reactive power in the primary winding, i. e. low voltage winding. The exact magnitude of the firing angle for the thyristors at which the primary winding supplies only real power for overcoming losses and attains almost unity power factor, will be determined by a PI controller. Thus, only the real component of current is required from the supply. Nearly all the reactive power of the iron core and TCR counterbalances the leading VArs produced by the generator insulation. Fine tuning of thyristor firing angles <b>avoids</b> <b>any</b> <b>over</b> or under compensation of the system. Consideration is also given to keeping total harmonic distortion (THD) and overall power quality on the high voltage side within standard limits...|$|R

40|$|An {{alternative}} method is proposed for deriving the time dependent Schroedinger equation from {{the pictures of}} wave and matrix mechanics. The derivation is of a mixed classical quantum character, since time is treated as a classical variable, thus <b>avoiding</b> <b>any</b> controversy <b>over</b> its meaning in quantum mechanics. The derivation method proposed in this paper requires no ad hoc assumption and avoids going through a second-order differential equation that {{can be reduced to}} the well known time-dependent Schroedinger equation only postulating a complex wavefunction with an exponential time dependence, as did by Schroedinger in its original paper of 1926.

50|$|Meanwhile, Eisenhower was {{interested}} in handing the job of space exploration to a civilian body, which would <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> potential issues <b>over</b> the militarization of space. This was formed as NASA in late 1958. This provided a solution {{of what to do}} with ABMA, which was handed over to NASA to become the Marshall Space Flight Center. When Kennedy announced the goal of landing on the Moon on 25 May 1961, two competing designs were considered for the booster, Marshall's Saturn V, and one designed by a NASA in-house team, Nova. The selection of Saturn led to the success of the Apollo project.|$|R
5000|$|The working {{titles of}} this film were A Latin from Manhattan, Rings on Her Fingers, They Met in Rio and The Road to Rio. A November 15, 1940 The Hollywood Reporter news item noted that Twentieth Century-Fox had to change the title from The Road to Rio because of a {{conflict}} with Paramount, which wanted them not to release their picture until {{six months after the}} release of Paramount's Road to Zanzibar in order to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> confusion <b>over</b> the similar titles. This film marked the sixth and final pairing of Faye and Don Ameche, and the first film in which Carmen Miranda played a character with a name other than her own. According to modern sources, Faye and Ameche recorded and filmed the song [...] "Chica, Chica, Boom Chic" [...] as a dance number, but only the sequence of Miranda and Ameche singing the song is in the released picture.|$|R
50|$|The {{championship}} was won by Werder Bremen. Schalke 04 and Karlsruher SC {{were originally}} {{going to be}} demoted to the Regionalliga. However, the German FA became aware of irregularities regarding transfer fees, signing bonuses and player wages paid by Hertha BSC. A cash audit was ordered, and the evidence collected from there was enough to revoke Hertha's license. In order to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> legal battles <b>over</b> Bundesliga membership, the FA decided to expand the league from sixteen to eighteen teams, meaning Schalke and Karlsruhe were spared relegation. Since Berlin should have a representative in the league as well, Tasmania Berlin were promoted besides {{the winners of the}} promotion play-off groups for the 1965-66 season.|$|R
50|$|First, Montcalm and Vaudreuil {{represented}} distinct martial services. Montcalm was {{a soldier}} in the army (troupes de terres), while Vaudreuil was a marine in the navy (compagnies franches de la marine). This meant that the former reported to the Ministry of War, while the latter reported to the Naval Ministry. According to historian Christian Crouch, “Separate ministries meant separate career networks, separate routes to power, and separate patrons…Jealously protective of their spheres of influence, the leaders of the war effort…were soon at odds.” This led Montcalm to consistently write to the minister of war, the Comte d’Argenson, to complain about Vaudreuil’s relative inexperience as a military strategist, among other things, in the hope of replacing him as chief strategist. Similarly, Vaudreuil would consistently write to the minister of the navy to complain about Montcalm’s insubordination in the hope of having him replaced, the latter having been made subordinate to the former by the royal council in the hope of <b>avoiding</b> <b>any</b> disagreements <b>over</b> strategy, despite otherwise holding equivalent ranks. Thus, the first source of conflict between Montcalm and Vaudreuil was very much personal.|$|R
40|$|In {{electronic}} structure calculations the optimized effective potential (OEP) {{is a method}} that treats exchange interactions exactly using a local potential within density-functional theory (DFT). We present a method using density functional perturbation theory combined with the Hylleraas variational method for finding the OEP by direct minimization which <b>avoids</b> <b>any</b> sum <b>over</b> unoccupied states. The method has been implemented within the plane-wave, pseudopotential formalism. Band structures for zinc blende semiconductors Si, Ge C, GaAs, CdTe and ZnSe, wurtzite semiconductors InN, GaN and ZnO and the rocksalt insulators CaO and NaCl have been calculated using the OEP and compared to calculations using the local density approximation (LDA), a selection of generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) and Hartree-Fock (HF) functionals. The band gaps found with the OEP improve on the calculated results for the LDA, GGAs or HF, with calculated values of 1. 16 eV for Si, 3. 32 eV for GaN and 3. 48 eV for ZnO. The OEP energies of semi-core d-states are also greatly improved compared to LDA. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
60|$|Whatever {{the word}} might imply {{to the poor}} lad, he was satisfied, and again became absorbed {{in the sight of}} fields, trees, and hedgerows; while Dr. May watched the tokens of secret dismay in their fellow-traveller, who had no doubt {{understood}} 'home' to mean his private asylum. Indeed, though the steady full dark eyes showed no aberration, there was a strange deep cave between the lid and the eyebrow, which gave a haggard look; the spare, worn, grave features had an expression--not indeed weak, nor wandering, but half bewildered, half absorbed, moreover, in spite of Tom's minute selection of apparel, it had been too hasty a toilette for the garments to look perfectly natural; and the cropped head was so suspicious, that it was no wonder that at the first station, the old gentleman gathered up his umbrella, with intense courtesy squeezed gingerly to the door, carefully <b>avoiding</b> <b>any</b> stumble <b>over</b> perilous toes, and made his escape--entering another carriage, whence he no doubt signed cautions against the lunatic and his keeper, since no one again invaded their privacy.|$|R

40|$|An {{overview}} of some studies which {{have recently been}} carried out on the control of third generation spcecraft, as modelled by the MSAT space vehicle configuration, is made. This spacecraft is highly nonsymmetrical and has appendages which cannot in general be assumed to be rigid. In particular, it is desired to design a controller for MSAT which stabilizes the system and satisfies certain attitude control, shape control, and possibly stationkeeping requirements; in addition, it is desired that the resultant controller should be robust and <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> undesirable spill <b>over</b> effects. In addition, the controller obtained should have minimum complexity. The method of solution adopted to solve this class of problems is to formulate the problem as a robust servomechanism problem, and thence to obtain existence conditions and a controller characterization to solve the problem. The final controller obtained for MSAT has a distributed control configuration {{and appears to be}} quite satisfactory...|$|R
50|$|The Whigs faced a {{different}} scenario. The victory of James K. Polk (Democrat) over Henry Clay (Whig) in the 1844 presidential election {{had caught the}} southern Whigs by surprise. The key element of this defeat, which carried over into the congressional and local races in 1845 and 1846 throughout the South, was the party's failure to take a strong stand favoring Texas annexation. Southern Whigs were reluctant to repeat their mistakes on Texas, but, at the same time, Whigs from both sections realized that victory and territorial acquisition would again bring out the issue of slavery and the territories. In the South in particular, there was already the realization, or perhaps fear, that the old economic issues that had defined the Second Party System were already dead. Their political goal was to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> sectional debate <b>over</b> slavery which would expose the sectional divisions within the party.|$|R
500|$|The soundtrack for the {{original}} version of No One Lives Forever (as well as the later Mac OS X port) was chiefly composed and produced by Guy Whitmore. The game uses DirectMusic technology, and its music {{is an example of}} an adaptive score: the music smoothly and flexibly adapts to the situations that players finds themselves in, in order to simulate film soundtracks. For instance, the music increases in tempo or urgency when the player is in a combat situation, or if enemies become aware of the player's presence. Whitmore's task as composer was [...] "to capture the flavor of the '50s/'60s spy genre, without infringing on any existing copyrights." [...] In order to <b>avoid</b> <b>any</b> legal troubles <b>over</b> music from the James Bond franchise of films and games, Whitmore was initially asked to refrain from using brass instruments; a directive he compared to [...] "being asked to produce a blues album without guitars". While some of the instrument sounds came from professional collections, others were home-made samples, including solo cello sounds performed by Lori Goldston, used in the H.A.R.M. theme. Influences for the score included German composer Peter Thomas, the soundtrack of the 1968 film Barbarella, and [...] "an array of Italian composers who did beautiful scores for low budget European erotic films." ...|$|R
