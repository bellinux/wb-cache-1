Consensus between both parties on the contents and the specific limitations of this kind of <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is vital to avoid any misunderstanding and unreasonable expectations on the part of the employee. At the conclusion of the contract, the parties need to be ad idem that employment would start at the time of the conclusion of their contract, or at a specific date or event stipulated therein, and would inevitably terminate automatically at such time as the parties have agreed upon. It should have been the mutual intention of the parties that the purpose of this type of contract is linked to a limited duration, unlike that of the traditional contract of indefinite employment, which is likely to continue for an indefinite period...|$|E
40|$|In this {{meta-analysis}} {{we provide}} new quantitative {{evidence on the}} relationship between the characteristics of working contracts and worker's health. We examine 52 studies covering 26 countries in the time period 1984 - 2010 with a combined sample size of 192. We apply a random effects model using odds ratios and their 95 % confidence intervals as measures for the effect size. We distinguish between six types of employment contracts with decreasing security levels (fixed-term, temporary, casual, on-call, daily, no formal contract) and classify the health outcomes into five subgroups (sickness absence, occupational injuries, health-related behavior, mental health and physical health). Furthermore, we control for selected dimensions of the socioeconomic environment of the studies, e. g. the unemployment rate and GDP growth rate. Summary findings show a higher risk of occupational injuries for atypical employees compared to the reference group. Atypical employment increases complaints about mental and physical health and has a negative impact on health-related behavior. Sickness absence works in the opposite direction and permanent employees {{are more likely to be}} absent from work. The heterogeneity of the effect sizes between different contracts of atypical employment is low. Effect sizes are country specific and depend on the health outcome indicators. The macroeconomic surrounding - unemployment rate and GDP growth rate - don't cause variation in study results. The 'healthy worker effect' may lead to an overestimation of the impact of workers' <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> on the health status. More research work which explicitly focuses on the problems of endogeneity, reverse causality and the selection bias is necessary.

After the boom period with high inflation from 1885 to 1990, the bubble economy crashed at 1990 and the Heisei depression began.

The deregulation of labor market was carried out in 1990 er under the effect of the globalization in this period. The enterprises of the manufacturing industries wished to cut down the productive costs of their companies from the pressure of international competition of other countries, which can use cheaper wages. And further the neo-liberalism stream influenced on Japanese enterprises and politicians.

The criteria for social risks comprise wages, participation in company training schemes and employment stability.

The most significant disadvantages are to be seen in wage levels in all forms of <b>atypical</b> <b>employment.</b> A greater stability risk is found amongst fixed-term employees and temporary workers.

40|$|Employment in {{the call}} centre {{sector in the}} Netherlands, similar to the trend in other European countries, is {{expanding}} greatly. In 2001, Datamonitor (2002) estimated that 1, 266 call centres were operating in the Netherlands. This number {{is expected to have}} risen to roughly 2, 000 in 2006. An estimated 188, 000 people work in this sector at the moment, representing 2. 5 % of the entire working population in the Netherlands. This represents the highest percentage in Europe with the exception of Ireland. The call centre workforce is employed by in-house and subcontractor call centres. In-house call centres are part of the firm for which they handle customer contacts, whereas subcontractor call centres, which provide customer contact services for other firms or institutions. The call centre sector features a large number of employees working in so-called <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> <b>contracts,</b> in particular ‘agents’ who handle the actual customer contacts (De Grip, Hoevenberg & Willems, 1997). Agents are often hired into temporary appointments, part-time contracts, irregular shifts, stand-by contracts, et cetera. The use of such atypical contracts is closely related to the great need for flexibility in the deployment of staff (Kalleberg, 2000). Such workforce flexibility is necessary in order to negotiate peaks and valleys in call volumes. In addition, many call centres prioritize on cost reduction, and this approach constrains investment in personnel. Call centres are therefore often classified as ‘electronic sweatshops’ offering only ‘dead-end jobs’ (Taylor, et al., 2002; Deery & Kinnie, 2004). The labour market for call centre agents could thus be characterised as a ‘secondary labour market’ of insecure, poorly paid jobs without any career opportunities (see e. g. Dekker, De Grip & Heijke, 2002). However, the call centre sector is heterogeneous with respect to employment conditions. For example, agents who work in in-house call centres have better employment conditions than their counterparts in subcontractor call centres. The Dutch industrial relations system offers one explanation for this difference. Agents working in in-house call centres have protections defined by the collective labour agreement (CLA) of the firm the call centre agents work in. In contrast, the subcontractor call centres did not have any comparable protections or their own CLA until 2003. The establishment of a CLA that covers agents employed in Dutch subcontractor call centres in 2003 is a unique phenomenon in the European call centre market (Roland, 2000 b). The difference in working conditions between in-house and subcontractor call centres raises the following research question addressed in this paper: To what extent is the labour market for call centre agents a dual labour market, with a secondary segment in the subcontractor call centres, and a primary segment {{in the form of a}} ‘professional labour market’ in the in-house call centres?To answer this question, we analyze survey data collected from a national survey of call centre managers in the Netherlands. Moreover, we investigate whether the aforementioned need for workforce flexibility may provide an explanation for the labour market segmentation in the call centre sector and if this segmentation is embedded in Dutch industrial relations. We begin with a brief overview of labour market segmentation theory. Next, we describe the dataset, and provide some brief background about the Dutch call centre sector and its workforce. Then, we investigate the differences between employment conditions in in-house and subcontractor call centres, to determine whether there is a segmented labour markets. Finally, we assess the influence of industrial relations in the call centre sector, and determine whether these reflect the labour market segmentation. education, training and the labour market;...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} quality of <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> to reveal whether support for the {{generation}} of temporary and part-time jobs is an effective policy for labour market renewal or whether it leads to labour market segmentation. This issue is investigated through analyses of {{the quality of}} <b>atypical</b> <b>employment,</b> with the following components of atypical work investigated: working-conditions, wages, poverty risk, exposure to unemployment and/or labour market drop out, as well as the extent to which <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> leads to the standard <b>employment</b> <b>contract,</b> termed its 'bridging function'. Strong and consistent variation in the quality of atypical work (relative to standard <b>contract</b> <b>employment)</b> combined with evidence of a weak bridging function is taken as an indicator of labour market marginalisation for these workers. Evidence of labour market marginalisation would suggest that non-standard contracts foster market segmentation. A key component of the analyses asserts that institutional context will structure atypical worker outcome with comparative analysis run on three countries to test this hypothesis. The countries chosen for the analysis varied in their combination of institutions thought to structure labour market outcome. The institutions thought to structure labour market outcome were classified into two groups, or axes, thought to structure labour markets in a different manner. The first group of institutions were thought to influence the relative openness or flexibility of markets, while the second was thought to influence the integration of labour market outsiders. Denmark is presented as a flexibly integrative labour market, the French market is presented as rigidly integrative and the United Kingdom is labelled flexibly non-integrative. The empirical analyses revealed strong and consistent variation in the quality of atypical work (relative to standard <b>contract</b> <b>employment)</b> and while the evidence suggests that temporary employment does provide a bridging function, the same was not true of part- time employment. This led us to conclude that policies which have sought to flexibilise the labour market through the generation of temporary and/or part-time employment are likely to contribute to market segmentation. Nonetheless we established important differences between countries which provided insights into the labour market conditions which were the most supportive of atypical worker inclusion. </p...|$|R

In this paper we first define three motives for the use of atypical employment: adjustment to fluctuations in business activity, improvement of personnel selection by extending probationary periods, and substitution of permanent employment in order to cut costs. We discuss what efficiency effects these types of usage have. When examined theoretically, it is possible to cite not only efficiency gains but also efficiency losses for each motive. For fixed-term contracts, {{the most common form of}} <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> in Germany, we use individual data at firm and individual level to examine the extent to which the usage in Germany corresponds with these motives for using <b>atypical</b> <b>employment,</b> and what evidence there is of the efficiency effects.

The general principle of permanent <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> is asserted when strictly regulating the use of fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> However this is not a general principle embodied in the actual <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> but is a policy preference from the perspective of stable employment. The general principle of permanent <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> would dramatically restrict the use of employees with a fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> in current <b>employment</b> practices in Japan and force these changes. However, legal restrictions on fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> cannot be considered an appropriate legal policy since they do not take into consideration how companies will meet their medium- and long-term demand for labor. Assuming that employees with fixed-term employment contracts—for which there is a medium- and long-term demand—continue to be permitted, the current legal issue becomes providing an appropriate scope of protection.

The paper then shows that there exists an equilibrium in which the private firm enters into a lifetime <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> with its employees while the public firm does not. mixed duopoly, lifetime <b>employment</b> <b>contract,</b> Cournot model...|$|R

It argues that a common concept of <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> should prevail in European private law. In that respect, the autonomous and broad interpretation which {{has been given to}} the term "worker" in Community law could be a basis for adoption of an autonomous concept of the <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> in European private law...|$|R

Since Simon (1951), economics defines authority as the opportunity for the employer to postpone {{the selection of the}} tasks the employee should perform. These definitions do not fit. Using the framework of option pricing in order to interpret Simon’s model, this paper shows that the economic concept of the <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is a spot contract paired with a call option on the employee’s tasks. Therefore, the economic formalization of the <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> does not implement what lawyers define as an employment relationship. authority, subordination, <b>employment</b> <b>contract,</b> option value, renegotiation...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{significance}} of intra-couple and intra -household influences on three broad types of employment contracts: self-employment, performance related pay, and salaried employment. Individuals may pool income risk with their partners by holding a diversified portfolio of <b>employment</b> <b>contracts,</b> introducing intra-household risk pooling. Alternatively, <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> matching may occur whereby individuals within couples or households are employed under similar contracts. Our empirical analysis, based on cross-section data drawn from the British Family Expenditure Surveys 1996 to 2000, provides evidence of <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> matching both within dual earner couples and, to a lesser extent, {{in the context of}} working household members.

As noted above, only {{individuals}} who voluntarily buy individual pension contracts or who are covered by an occupational pension plan will have roughly the same income replacement that the pre- 2001 system offered. Given the increase in <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> and the tendency of low-income and atypical workers to not buy individual pension coverage, the retirement income gap between those in full-time, standard employment and those in <b>atypical</b> <b>employment</b> is likely to increase. In addition, Bridgen and Meyer (2014) find that even standard workers in key sectors will experience significant drops in income in retirement (see also Hinrichs 2012).|$|R
