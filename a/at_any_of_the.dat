5|$|After graduation, Higginbotham {{initially}} sought employment {{with law}} firms in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, however, {{he was unable}} to find work <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major firms {{as a result of his}} race.

Higginbotham was given the opportunity to argue both in front of the Court of Common Pleas, and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The second {{video game}} {{based on the}} film was titled Beauty & The Beast: Belle's Quest and is an action {{platformer}} for the Sega Genesis. Developed by Software Creations, the game was released in North America in 1993. It {{is one of two}} video games based on the film that Sunsoft published for the Genesis, the other being Beauty & The Beast: Roar of the Beast. Characters from the film like Gaston can help the player past tricky situations. As Belle, the player must reach the Beast's castle and break the spell to live happily ever after. To succeed, she must explore the village, forest, castle, and snowy forest to solve puzzles and mini-games while ducking or jumping over enemies. Belle's health is represented by a stack of blue books, which diminishes when she touches bats, rats, and other hazards in the game. Extra lives, keys and other items are hidden throughout the levels. While there is no continue or game saving ability, players can use a code to start the game <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven levels.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 2005–06 {{season he}} was sent on loan to League One side Barnsley where he stayed for three months. Barnsley won {{promotion}} to the Championship although Nix did not play in any games. He returned to Sheffield United but he was among seven players to be released by manager Neil Warnock. Nix had an unsuccessful trial at Peterborough United, and one at Grimsby Town which was curtailed by an ankle ligament injury, and played a reserve team outing for Rotherham United. But after failing to win a place <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three league teams, he turned to non-league football. He first appeared for Northern Premier League side Buxton, making his debut against Bridlington Town on 11 November 2006. He played seven times for Buxton, scoring one goal, which came in a 9–0 Derbyshire Senior Cup victory over Blackwell Miners Welfare. For the rest of the 2006–07 season he turned out for Northern Counties East League side Parkgate. He also scored once for Parkgate—in a 4–3 Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup semi-final defeat to Stocksbridge Park Steels.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an open world environment with a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system {{which can be}} seamlessly explored. The map is composed of forest, jungle, desert, and snowy mountain regions. Mountainous terrain is traversed with the employment of parkour, which is aided {{by the use of}} zip-lines installed throughout the world. Corruption Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by corrupted machines that behave with more aggression. To uncover more of the map, one must scale large giraffe-like machines known as Tallnecks. Twenty-five robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and fast travel can be accessed by interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five Hunting Grounds, and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost impervious to damage. A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-playable characters. Collectibles include vantages that offer visual information of the Old World; metal flowers, which when acquired contain poetry; and old relics, such as ancient mugs and tribal artefacts.|$|E
