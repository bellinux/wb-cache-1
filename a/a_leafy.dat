5|$|Small {{pieces of}} gold foil {{featuring}} engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as gullgubber) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes {{a man and a}} woman with <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.|$|E

25|$|Cottage Grove, which {{historically}} {{was just}} outside Beeston parish {{and part of}} Chilwell, was originally promoted by the Labourer's Friend Society in the 1840s as plots for cottages with allotments for the labouring poor. This scheme failed and the area now consists mostly of Victorian and Edwardian houses laid out along the parallel Park Road and Grove Avenue and the two short cross streets Cedar Road and North Drive. The area retains <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> character and the roads remain unkerbed, {{and has been a}} conservation area since 2008.|$|E
25|$|Tool {{manufacture}} is much rarer {{than simple}} tool use and probably represents higher cognitive functioning. Soon after her initial discovery of tool use, Goodall observed other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs, stripping off {{the leaves and}} using the stems to fish for insects. This change of <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> twig into a tool was a major discovery. Prior to this, scientists thought that only humans manufactured and used tools, and that this ability was what separated humans from other animals. In 1990, it was claimed the only primate to manufacture tools in the wild was the chimpanzee. However, since then, several primates have been reported as tool makers in the wild.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{referred}} to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may take many forms, naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face peering out of dense foliage. Some may have leaves for hair, perhaps with <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{the entire}} area of Lockheed's Vega factory was camouflaged to fool an enemy {{reconnaissance}} effort. The factory was hidden beneath a complete suburb replete with rubber automobiles and peaceful rural neighborhood scenes painted on canvas. Hundreds of fake trees and shrubs were positioned to give {{the entire area}} a three-dimensional appearance. The fake trees and shrubs were created from chicken wire that had been treated with an adhesive and then covered with chicken feathers to provide <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> texture. Air ducts disguised as fire hydrants {{made it possible for}} the Lockheed-Vega employees to continue working underneath the huge camouflage umbrella designed to conceal their factory.|$|E
25|$|The newly hatched {{caterpillar}} {{is about}} 0.5cm long and is yellowish green. In later instars the colour changes to <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> green. The head is green and spotted with tiny black tubercules. The spiracles {{are covered with}} a continuous white line. Each segment of the body bears tiny shiny black tubercules. The tubercules immediately above the spiracular line being larger and more distinct giving {{the effect of a}} black line over the white spiracular line. The paired lines are found {{on both sides of the}} body and run from head to anus. The similar Catopsilia pyranthe caterpillar has a much broader black line leaving only a narrow green line on the back of the body.|$|E
25|$|Hornbeams {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} trees, Carpinus betulus reaching {{a height of}} 32m. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, and simple with a serrated margin, and typically vary from 3–10cm in length. The flowers are wind-pollinated pendulous catkins, produced in spring. The male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (monoecious). The fruit is a small nut about 3–6mm long, held in <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> bract; the bract may be either trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing {{is important in the}} identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10–30 seeds are on each seed catkin.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} grains in Poland were millet (often made into kasza, {{a type of}} porridge) and wheat. Barley and oats were cultivated, but used mostly as animal feed or for brewing beer. Cabbage (especially as sauerkraut), kale, peas, broad beans, and onions were the most common vegetables. Dill and mustard were almost {{ubiquitous}} potherbs and parsley was used as <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> green in stews, as a flavor additive, and applied as a coloring agent in dishes for the upper classes. Beef, pork and poultry (primarily chicken) were the most common meats, with the occasional appearance of mutton and lamb. Game, as elsewhere, was highly prized, but in short supply and usually limited to the high nobility, as hunting licenses were controlled by land owners. Fish was a staple, but unlike Germans, Poles tended only to eat it on fast days when meat was forbidden by the church.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} of dressing up in character {{continued into the}} following centuries. One of the photographic series by Julia Margaret Cameron, a pupil of the painter George Frederic Watts, was of mythical characters, for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models. Young Kate Keown sat for the head of “Circe” in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character’s use of wine to bring a change in personality. The society portrait photographer Yevonde Middleton, also known as Madame Yevonde, was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball {{as the foundation for}} her own series of mythological portraits in colour. Its participants were invited to her studio afterwards to pose in their costumes. There Baroness Dacre is pictured as Circe with <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> headdress about golden ringlets and clasping a large Baroque porcelain goblet.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} invasion is like <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> tree {{which prevents}} us from seeing our own sun, sky and stars. Therefore {{in order to}} be able to see the sky above our heads, our task is to cut this tree off at the roots. US imperialism understands very well the magic of communication through music and persists in filling our young people with all sorts of commercial tripe. With professional expertise they have taken certain measures: first, the commercialization of the so-called 'protest music'; second, the creation of 'idols' of protest music who obey the same rules and suffer from the same constraints as the other idols of the consumer music industry – they last a little while and then disappear. Meanwhile they are useful in neutralizing the innate spirit of rebellion of young people. The term 'protest song' is no longer valid because it is ambiguous and has been misused. I prefer the term 'revolutionary song'.|$|E
25|$|Pollokshields was {{established}} by the Stirling-Maxwell family in 1849, and was set out or 'feued' by the Edinburgh architect David Rhind. Many well-known Glaswegian architects contributed to its development and, amongst others, it contains villas by Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. There are several contributions by contemporaries of Charles Rennie Mackintosh including a series of good 'Glasgow style' tenements by the architect H. E. Clifford, who was also responsible for the 'A' listed Pollokshields Burgh Hall, in Scottish Baronial style which was inaugurated in 1890, with Maxwell Park. The ground for Maxwell Park was given by Sir John Stirling-Maxwell of Nether Pollok in 1888, and the park was formally opened at the same time. Such was its early population growth Pollokshields attained 'burgh' status in 1876. However, this ended in 1891 when after being offered favourable tax terms {{the residents of the}} burgh agreed to it becoming a suburb of the growing city of Glasgow. The Victorian and Edwardian architecture and the parks of this area have remained almost untouched, leaving the feeling of <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> Victorian suburb, while being well within the city.|$|E
500|$|Cabbage or headed cabbage (comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea) is <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> {{green or}} purple {{biennial}} plant, grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is {{descended from the}} wild cabbage, B.oleracea var. oleracea, and {{is closely related to}} broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis), Brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera) and savoy cabbage (var. sabauda) which are sometimes called cole crops. Cabbage heads generally range from [...] , and can be green, purple and white. Smooth-leafed firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed red and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colors seen more rarely. It is a multi-layered vegetable. Under conditions of long sunlit days such as are found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow much larger. Some records are discussed {{at the end of the}} history section.|$|E

500|$|Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is {{an annual}} plant of the daisy family, Asteraceae. It {{is most often}} grown as a leaf vegetable, but {{sometimes}} for its stem and seeds. [...] Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps; {{it can also be}} grilled. [...] One variety, the [...] (...) , or asparagus lettuce (celtuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked. In addition to its main use as <b>a</b> <b>leafy</b> green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption. [...] Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world. [...] World production of lettuce and chicory for calendar year 2013 was 24.9 million tonnes, over half of which came from China.|$|E
