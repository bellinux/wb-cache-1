After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1984. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
40|$|Single-photon {{detectors}} play a {{key role}} in many research fields such as biology, chemistry, medicine, and space technology, and in recent years, single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have become a valid alternative to photo multiplier tubes (PMTs). Moreover, scientific research has recently focused on single-photon detector <b>arrays,</b> <b>pushed</b> by <b>a</b> growing demand for multichannel systems. In this scenario, we developed a compact 32 -channel system for time-resolved single-photon counting applications. The system is divided into two independent modules: a photon detection head including a 32 $times$ 1 SPAD array built in custom technology, featuring high time resolution, high photon detection efficiency (44 % at 550 nm), and low dark count rate (mean value $ 400 cps at $- 10 ^{circ}hbox{C}$) at 6 -V excess bias voltage and a 32 -channel acquisition system able to perform time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. The TCSPC module includes eight four-channel time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) arrays, built-in 0. 35 -$mu$m Si-Ge BiCMOS technology, characterized by low differential non-linearity (rms value lower than 0. 15 % of the time bin width) and variable full-scale range.

40|$|Recent work on {{embedded}} domain specific languages (EDSLs) {{for high}} performance array programming {{has given rise}} to a number of array representations.

40|$|Nowadays, many {{research}} fields like biology, chemistry, {{medicine and}} space technology rely on high sensitivity imaging instruments that allow to exploit modern measurement techniques; among these, Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC) provides extremely high time resolution. Single-photon detectors {{play a key}} role in these advanced imaging systems, and in recent years Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) have become a valid alternative to Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs). Moreover scientific research has recently focused on single photon detector <b>arrays,</b> <b>pushed</b> by <b>a</b> growing demand for multichannel systems. In this scenario, we developed a compact, stand-alone, 32 -channel system for time-resolved single-photon counting applications. The system core is represented by a 32 × 1 SPAD array built in custom technology, featuring high time resolution, high photon detection efficiency (> 45 %) and low dark count rate. The SPAD avalanche signal is exported through an integrated inverter which is placed close to the photo detector, this way the avalanche event is detected with high time resolution while achieving negligible crosstalk between adjacent pixels. SPAD proper operation is guaranteed by a 32 × 1 mixed passive-active quenching circuit (AQC) array built in 0. 18 μm HV-CMOS technology; its digital outputs are fed to an FPGA that performs on-board processing of photon counting information. On the contrary, photon timing information is directly extracted from the pixel array and exported in Current Mode Logic (CML) standard. Preliminary experiments have been carried out on the developed system, resulting in a high time resolution (< 60 ps FWHM) and mean dark count rate lower than 8500 counts/s at 25 °C...|$|R
