5|$|In 2004, a joint <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> {{the federal}} {{government}} of the United States and Government of Canada confirmed a new border crossing would be constructed between Detroit and Windsor.

5|$|Although {{a handful}} of Chinese {{settlers}} had arrived in Madagascar {{towards the end of}} the reign of Queen Ranavalona III, the first major influx of Chinese migrants followed an <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> General Joseph Gallieni, first governor general of the colony of Madagascar, requesting 3,000Chinese laborers to construct a northern rail line between Antananarivo and Toamasina. Chinese migrants introduced a number of dishes that have become part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large Chinese communities, including riz cantonais (Chinese fried rice), soupe chinoise (Chinese-style noodle soup), misao (fried noodles), pao (hum bao) and nems (fried egg rolls).|$|E
5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> the end of the year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

5|$|The book is an {{extensive}} work of investigative journalism, {{written in the}} form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor working in Africa. He ends with the <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} immediately put 14,528 Avro employees, as well {{as nearly}} 15,000 other employees in the Avro supply chain of outside suppliers, out of work. Declassified records show Avro management was caught unprepared by the suddenness of the <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> the government; while executives were aware that the program was in jeopardy, they expected it to continue until the March review. It was widely believed during this lead-up to the review, the first Arrow MkII, RL-206, would be prepared for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she}} would not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party {{candidate}} in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a New Democratic Party candidate, notary public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding was considered to be a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} {{euphoria}} {{associated with the}} launching of new internet-based businesses, most established traditional businesses felt compelled to respond by launching web-based retail outlets of their own. Stock market response to announcements of transactional web-site launches by business-to-consumer retail outlets are examined. Results provide support for theoretical predictions {{of the effect of}} established retail outlets investing in web-based stores. In general, <b>announcements</b> <b>by</b> retail outlets yielded positive average abnormal returns.

5|$|Further {{complicating the}} sales {{situation}} was the <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> JaguarSport of a road-going {{version of the}} Jaguar XJR-9, {{the last of the}} racing cars to feature the Jaguar V12 engine. The Jaguar XJR-15 was developed by TWR and styled by Peter Stevens whilst the XJ220 was being developed at Jaguar, and featured the V12 engine {{and a host of other}} technologies not adopted for the XJ220, including carbon fibre construction and the option of a six-speed racing gearbox. It was considerably rarer and more expensive than the XJ220 when it went on sale; only 50 were built, each with a list price of £600,000 ($1 million) in 1990. It was designed primarily for racing but could be specified as a road-legal vehicle. About half were built as road-going variants, which added £55,000 to the list price.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, CWC {{became a}} member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). During this time, CWC wrestlers could compete for championships {{operated}} by the NWA. In 1958, the CWC created the United States Tag Team Championship (the first title ever owned by WWE), which inaugural champions Mark Lewin and Don Curtis won in April of that year. In 1963, CWC was renamed as the WWWF and ended its partnership with the NWA. To reflect the changes, the WWWF introduced its world heavyweight championship (WWE's second overall championship and the current WWE Championship), while the WWWF acronym was added to the United States Tag Team Titles. The titles were disbanded in 1967 without a formal <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> the WWWF, and thus, the first tag team championship (and first championship overall) to be retired by the promotion. Ten years later, the company retired its first individually contested title, the WWWF United States Heavyweight Championship, also without a formal announcement.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 NBA All-Star Game was an {{exhibition}} basketball game played on February 15, 2009 at US Airways Center in Phoenix, Arizona, {{home of the}} Phoenix Suns. The game was the 58th edition of the National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game and was played during the 2008–09 NBA season. This was the third time that Phoenix had hosted the All-Star Game; the city had previously hosted the event in 1975 and 1995. Phoenix was awarded the All-Star Game in an <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> commissioner David Stern on November 8, 2007. The other reported contenders for the 2009 contest were Air Canada Centre at Toronto, Madison Square Garden at New York City, Oracle Arena at Oakland and Bradley Center at Milwaukee.|$|E
5|$|The Latvian {{government}} took {{a number of}} steps {{in order to try}} to bring the situation under control, and in 2006 not only were the events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> Riga city council, for restoration. The monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work. Therefore, the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech. The unapproved events took place despite the ban. On November 23, 2006, the law requiring the approval of the authorities for public gatherings was ruled unconstitutional. In the future years the government mobilized the police force to guard the neighborhood of the monument and the events were relatively peaceful.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an <b>announcement</b> <b>by</b> Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) on {{television}} {{that he plans to}} travel to outer space, and is willing to pay up to thirty million dollars to do so. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) agrees to help Tracy with his dream of traveling in space, promising to call his friends at NASA. Instead of doing this, however, he asks The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to create a fake space experience for Tracy. Pete and the TGS crew construct a model space shuttle and place Tracy in it after disorienting him by flying him in a helicopter blindfolded. The deception is a success, and Tracy believes that he is, in fact, flying in space.|$|E
