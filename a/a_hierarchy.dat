5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of being, and the latter to <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was {{changed into a}} system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E

To place this number in context, in <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000bushels during the Han.

5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of clusters of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{correspondence}} between the role abstraction in Role-based Access Control (RBAC) {{and the notion of}} organizational positions, it seems easy to construct role hierarchies. This is, however, a misconception. This paper argues that, in order to reﬂect the functional requirements, <b>a</b> role <b>hierarchy</b> becomes very complex. In a bid to simplify the design of role hierarchies suitable for the expression of access control requirements in workﬂow systems, the paper proposes <b>a</b> “typed” role <b>hierarchy.</b> In <b>a</b> “typed” role <b>hierarchy</b> <b>a</b> role is of a speci ﬁc type.
