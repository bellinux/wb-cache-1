5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups tend {{to be made of}} only a few individuals. They <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E

5|$|According to Sunni jurisprudence, in the {{application}} of local custom, custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. If it is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, if it is in opposition to analogical reason, custom is given preference. Jurists <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to,</b> with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars. Shi'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of jurisprudence, nor do the Hanbalite or Zahirite schools of Sunni jurisprudence.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E

5|$|Great kivas {{are always}} much larger and deeper than Chaco-style kivas. Whereas {{the walls of}} great kivas always extend above the {{surrounding}} landscape, the walls of Chaco-style kivas are flush with the surrounding landscape. Chaco-style kivas are often found incorporated into the central room blocks of great houses, but great kivas are always separate from core structures. Great kivas almost always have a bench that encircles the inner space, but this feature is not found in Chaco-style kivas. Great kivas <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> include floor vaults, which may have served as foot drums for ceremonial dancers, but Chaco-style kivas do not.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E
5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E
5|$|A Floorless Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa (now known as Bizarro) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless Coaster. Floorless Coasters <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster. Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters, such as Griffon and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters as B classifies them as another model. Also, Maurer Söhne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car called X-Car Floorless, but currently do not have any installations.|$|E
5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E

5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Caching is {{inhibited}} by {{the presence}} of Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and grey jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident grey jays to steal cached food. Grey jays carry large food items to distant cache sites for storage more often than small food items. To prevent theft, they <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more grey jays. Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the grey jay's range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of spoilage and the reduced need for winter stores.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E

5|$|Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers {{have evolved}} a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar {{suited to the}} birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The {{blooming}} times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species {{can be attributed to}} the direction of the shift in pollinator preference.|$|E
5|$|In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to {{vote for}} the Kuomintang, {{to the point that the}} {{legislative}} seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan-blue coalition. This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the close}} {{similarity}} between play and hunting, cats prefer {{to play with}} objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with before. Cats <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> play with toys more when they are hungry. String is often used as a toy, {{but if it is}} eaten, it can become caught {{at the base of the}} cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.|$|E
