5|$|In 1943, <b>after</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called {{up by the}} army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him {{to listen to the}} greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens College in New York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E
