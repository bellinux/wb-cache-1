5|$|Brood War {{introduces}} seven new units. Each race {{is given}} access to a unique ground unit: the Zerg can create a defensive unit that can attack from the concealment of its burrow, while the Terrans can train combat medics. The Protoss are able to produce dark templar units, a powerful cloaked melee unit only given to the player in special missions of StarCraft. Protoss players can merge two of these units to create a special spellcaster unit. Each race is also {{given access to}} a dedicated air-to-air <b>attack</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{first group}} {{to arrive at}} Lviv {{airfield}} - six Yak fighters - prevented takeoff of German defence fighters. Another group of 12 fighters patrolled along the return route. The first <b>attack</b> <b>unit</b> of eight IL-2's, protected by eight fighters, attacked the German airplanes {{on the ground in}} a 1300-meter dive. This was followed by the main force of IL-2 bombers, arriving in groups of four.|$|E
25|$|No. 30 Squadron was {{established}} at RAAF Base Richmond on 9 March 1942 as a long-range fighter squadron operating the Bristol Beaufighter. After {{a brief period}} of training the squadron deployed to Townsville where it escorted anti-shipping patrols. In early September a small detachment from the squadron was sent to Milne Bay from where they attacked Japanese shipping, becoming the first RAAF Beaufighter squadron to see action. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the squadron was deployed to Port Moresby in New Guinea from where it operated as a low-level ground <b>attack</b> <b>unit</b> supporting the Allied efforts in Papua, a role in which the Beaufighter proved highly successful.|$|E
25|$|In late September 1917, the {{squadron}} flew its aircraft across the English Channel, landing in St Omer without incident or loss– and after overnighting there it moved to Baizieux. Assigned to the 13th Army Wing, RFC, it undertook its first combat operations on the Western Front a month later. Its first major action {{came during the}} Battle of Cambrai in November and December when it was heavily involved as a low-level ground <b>attack</b> <b>unit,</b> attacking German trenches, but suffering heavy casualties in doing so. On 22 November, {{the squadron}} shot down its first German aircraft in air-to-air combat during a chance encounter on a ground attack sortie. After this, several more German aircraft were shot down by the squadron's pilots before the squadron was withdrawn from operations in December to re-equip with Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a fighters. In January 1918, the squadron moved to Savy, and the following month gained its first victories with the new aircraft type.|$|E

500|$|As a freshman, Trombino was {{expected}} to be a midfielder, but he surprisingly earned a spot in the first team <b>attack</b> <b>unit.</b> [...] He became the first Princeton freshman to score at least one goal in all 15 of his games (the prior record had been a goal in 10 different games). Trombino was the 2004 Men's Ivy League Rookie of the Year. [...] The team were Ivy League co-champions with Cornell.

500|$|Though the day's {{remaining}} carrier strikes by Hellcat fighters, Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive {{bombers and}} Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo planes did significant damage to military installations on Formosa, it proved impossible to completely neutralize Japanese air power {{based on the}} island. The Japanese response was well suppressed, however, and the only effective counter-attack to develop against TF38 came from Japan itself. An elite air <b>attack</b> <b>unit</b> trained for all–weather and night flying, called the TAir Attack Force, moved south to execute Japan's first large-scale radar assisted nighttime aerial torpedo attack. The results were lackluster. U.S. Navy ships made smoke for cover and engaged in radical maneuvering to keep enemies astern as Japanese planes dropped flares to illuminate their targets. Eight Japanese planes were shot down by ships' guns during the night, and three Mitsubishi G4M Betty bombers were claimed by night fighters from the [...] [...] suffered damage from friendly fire, but no damage from enemy aircraft was incurred.|$|E

Just before 0300, Remey was illuminated briefly by an enemy searchlight. At 0300, the three destroyers {{of the eastern}} group fired their torpedoes, launching 27 [...] "fish" [...] in less than 2 minutes. Powder flashes on two of her torpedoes showed Remeys position and again she was spotlighted. Straddled by 6inch shells, she commenced making more smoke and weaving through it to make her way back up the Dinagat coast to the post-attack rendezvous point off Hibuson Island, whence the force witnessed the battleline's barrage.|$|E
2500|$|Winters sends a list {{of demands}} to the world governments and gives them thirty minutes to comply, and {{subsequently}} orders Kettlewell to connect to the launch computers and prepare to send the launch codes. Kettlewell, who never expected their plan {{to get to this}} stage, hesitates, and in the ensuing discussion, Sarah Jane and Harry attempt to escape with Kettlewell's assistance. Winters orders K1 to stop the pair, but the robot, already conflicted to its programming, inadvertently fires the disintegrator gun at Kettlewell, killing him. The death of its creator puts K1 in a further confused state, falling to the ground and apparently shutting down. [...] Winters attempts to program the countdown, but the Doctor arrives and successfully counters it. As UNIT forces take Winters and Jellicoe away, K1 reactivates and begins to <b>attack</b> <b>UNIT.</b> K1 seeks out Sarah Jane to protect her, a result of an Oedipus complex it developed from Sarah Jane's previous compassion, according to the Doctor. UNIT fires the disintegrator gun at the robot but the blast is absorbed, causing the robot to grow to an enormous size. Realising the growth is due to the living metal that Kettlewell used in constructing K1, the Doctor races back to Kettlewell's lab to synthesize a batch of metal-biodegradable virus, a side discovery made by Kettlewell. The Doctor throws a bucket of solution containing the virus onto K1, and the robot slowly shrinks down in size before it vanishes.|$|E

Breakthrough against an empty enemy-controlled hex is not allowed, but a key position can be attacked by obtaining an overstacked armoured breakthrough against a weakly held hex adjacent to it.|$|R
