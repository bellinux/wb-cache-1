25|$|During <b>a</b> <b>spin,</b> the skater rotates on {{the round}} {{part of the}} blade, called the front rocker, just behind the toe pick (the ball of the foot). Spins may be {{performed}} individually or in a sequence combining different types of <b>spins.</b> <b>A</b> <b>spin</b> may be executed on the back rocker of the blade during a change of edge <b>spin.</b> For example, <b>a</b> back scratch <b>spin</b> will flip edges to a forward inside edge. This feature of <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> will change the level of <b>a</b> <b>spin.</b> Spins may be performed on either foot. Like jumping, skaters mostly rotate in the counterclockwise direction, {{but there are some}} skaters who rotate in the clockwise direction. Some skaters are able to rotate in both directions. For skaters who rotate in a counterclockwise direction, <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> on the left foot is called <b>a</b> forward <b>spin,</b> while <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> on the right foot is called <b>a</b> back <b>spin.</b> When learning to spin, one will typically learn <b>a</b> forward <b>spin</b> then once completing that will learn how to execute <b>a</b> back <b>spin.</b>|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into <b>a</b> <b>spinning</b> protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E

5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277.

Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated <b>a</b> <b>spinning</b> wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|E
