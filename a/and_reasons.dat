5|$|In {{addition}} to the playable races, {{there are two other}} non-playable Enlightened Races, known as the Zilart and the Kuluu. These ancient races were thought extinct, and are the focus of the first two-game expansions. There is also a large supporting cast of NPCs involved in quests, missions and the game's storylines. The game features several typical Final Fantasy fiends, including Goblins, Sahagins and Tonberries. Several of these races are known as Beastmen, a distinction made between fiends who possess higher than average intelligence, exhibiting self-awareness, emotions, culture, and religion. The complex relationship, bigoted views, <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> of conflict between the Enlightened Races and Beastmen is a plot point throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E

40|$|Hegel’s {{philosophy}} is characterized, {{to a great}} extent, by the Kantian distinction between intellect <b>and</b> <b>reason.</b> However, Kant’s successor offers new meaning to both intellect <b>and</b> <b>reason</b> <b>and</b> contradicts the Kantian assumption of the intellect being a more reliable source of knowledge than reason. For Hegel, the empirical knowledge provided by the intellect {{is not enough to}} know the world as a process; reason is needed in this case, <b>and</b> by <b>reason</b> Hegel understands something much more complex and trustworthy than Kant does. This essay follows Hegel’s acception of intellect <b>and</b> <b>reason</b> <b>and</b> the process of their becoming as two opposed, but not independent sides of the fulfillment of human spirit...|$|R
5|$|That evening Napoleon and {{the four}} merchants {{discussed}} the revolution, subsequent rebellions, and their consequences. Speaking as a pro-Republican, Napoleon supported the Jacobin cause, and explained {{the benefits of the}} revolution, whilst defending Carteaux's actions in Avignon. One of the merchants from Marseille expressed his moderate views regarding the revolution, <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> for supporting civil war against a central government. The merchant stressed that Marseille did not fight for the Royalist cause, but opposed the nature of the Convention itself, condemning its decrees and deeming the execution of citizens as unlawful. Napoleon concluded that the people of Marseille should reject counter-revolutionary ideals and adopt the constitution of the French Republic in order to end the civil war and allow the regular army to restore France.|$|E
5|$|The hoard {{was buried}} as an oak box or small chest filled with items in {{precious}} metal, sorted mostly by type with some in smaller wooden boxes {{and others in}} bags or wrapped in fabric. Remnants of the chest, and of fittings such as hinges and locks, were recovered in the excavation. The coins of the hoard date it after AD 407, which coincides {{with the end of}} Britain as a Roman province. The owners <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> for burial of the hoard are unknown, but it was carefully packed and the contents appear consistent with what a single very wealthy family might have owned. Given the lack of large silver serving vessels and {{of some of the most}} common types of jewellery, it is likely that the hoard represents only a part of the wealth of its owner.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting and}} events of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne {{take place in}} a {{separate}} continuity {{to the rest of the}} Megami Tensei series. Nocturne is set in modern-day Tokyo before and after an event called the Conception, in which the normal world is destroyed through the actions of a cult to prevent the world's stagnation and ultimate demise, as dictated by the Great Will governing existence. Tokyo is transformed into a wasteland on the inside of a sphere inhabited by the spirits of humans who died in the Conception; demons who wage war with each other; <b>and</b> <b>Reasons,</b> deity-like beings formed from the gathering of Magatsuhi by people with a deity or demon sponsor. Those who possess Reasons seek to remake the world in their image by presenting themselves to Kagutsuchi, a semi-sentient manifestation of the Great Will's power which exists to perpetuate the destruction and rebirth of worlds through Conception, and proving their worth. Another realm mentioned in the story is the Shadow Vortex, a limbo where dead worlds and the beings who created them linger.|$|E

25|$|The {{inscriptions}} seldom provide solid {{historical evidence}} {{of events and}} identifiable people but instead offer insight into the development of language and poetry, kinship, and habits of name-giving, settlement, depictions from Norse paganism, place-names and communications, Viking as well as trading expeditions, and, not least, the spread of Christianity.

25|$|In {{addition}} to day roosts, Indiana bats use temporary roosts {{throughout the night}} to rest between foraging bouts. Limited research has examined the use of night roosts by Indiana bats, and thus their use and importance are poorly understood. Males, lactating and postlactating females, and juveniles have been found roosting under bridges at night. Some Indiana bats were tracked to 3 different night roosts within the same night. Night roosts are often found within the bats' foraging area. Indiana bats using night roosts are thought to roost alone and only and for short periods, typically 10 minutes or less. Lactating bats may return to the day roost several times each night, presumably to nurse their young. Pregnant bats have not been tracked back to the day roost during the night except during heavy rain. Because Indiana bats are difficult to track during their nightly movements and usually rest for such short periods of time, the specific requirements that Indiana bats need in a night roost, <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> why night roosts are needed, are still unknown.|$|E
