60|$|All these dangers, {{real and}} imaginary, passed away when England {{turned from the}} affairs of France to remedy her own {{economic}} conditions. The long Continental war {{came to an end}} with Napoleon's overthrow at Waterloo, in 1815; and England, having gained enormously in prestige abroad, now turned to the work of reform at home. The destruction of the African slave trade; the mitigation of horribly unjust laws, which included poor debtors and petty criminals in the same class; the prevention of child labor; the freedom of the press; the extension of manhood suffrage; the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> against Catholics in Parliament; the establishment of hundreds of popular schools, under the leadership of Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster,--these are {{but a few of the}} reforms which mark the progress of civilization in a single half century. When England, in 1833, proclaimed the emancipation of all slaves in all her colonies, she unconsciously proclaimed her final emancipation from barbarism.|$|E

30|$|One {{of the key}} changes democratization {{brought about}} was the more concerted {{challenges}} of political opposition to the authoritarian institutions and rules. While the democratic struggle succeeded in ending the military regime {{in the summer of}} 1987, there were entrenched authoritarian institutions and norms which could not be easily eradicated by democratic elections. Though major changes of explicit authoritarian institutions such as the revision of the Constitution, the election of political leaders and <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> civil rights were made, the legacy of authoritarian regime was ingrained in culture and practice of the state apparatus and civil society. Thus the transition to democracy should include not only an introduction of the democratic rules of game but also the inculcation of new democratic values and attitudes among the power holders and the ordinary people as well.|$|R

Izvolsky stated that his position was that annexation was a matter to be settled between the signatories to the Treaty of Berlin. With the compensation of Austro-Hungarian withdrawal from the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, Russia would not consider the annexation as reason to go to war, but Russia and other governments would insist on changes to the Treaty favorable to themselves, including opening the Straits (Russia's interest), Bulgarian independence, territorial concessions to Serbia, and <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> on Montenegrin sovereignty under article 29.

A seminal aspect of this paper is that this paper has succeeded in constructing a Cambodia specific computable general equilibrium model by using one of the first ever input-output tables of Cambodia with 35 different production sectors. One of our most striking simulation results is that the welfare loss would be about 905 million US dollars when either the amount of exports of apparel products from Cambodia or the amount of imports of textiles to Cambodia decreases by 30 percent caused by the participation of Vietnam to WTO as well as the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> on Chinese exports. Another striking result is that the government should reduce the production tax rate for the apparel sector by 68. 1 percent in order to keep the welfare of Cambodia unchanged when exports of apparel products decreases by 30 percent. Our simulation results predict that the Cambodian economy has substantially been damaged by the participation of Vietnam to WTO as well as the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> on Chinese exports to EU and the US...|$|E

Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant. Since 1900, due primarily to conversion, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion. Much of the growth has occurred after World War II, when decolonization <b>of</b> Africa and <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> various <b>restrictions</b> against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred.
