40|$|In this study, we have {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} the polyphenol epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant molecule that also enhances constitutive nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) activity, on antigen-induced <b>asthma-like</b> <b>reaction</b> in sensitized guinea pigs. For comparison, we used epicatechin, which shares antioxidant but not NOS-modulating properties with EGCG. Ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs placed in a respira-tory chamber were challenged with ovalbumin. EGCG (25 mg/kg b. wt.) or epicatechin (25 mg/kg b. wt.) was given i. p. 20 min before ovalbumin challenge. We analyzed latency time for the onset of respiratory abnormalities, cough severity, duration of dyspnea, lung tissue histopathology, mast cell activation (by granule release), leukocyte/eosinophilic infiltration (by major basic protein and myeloperoxidase), oxygen free radical-medi...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhilst BCG {{inhibits}} allergic airway {{responses in}} murine models, IL- 18 has adversary effects depending on its environment. We therefore constructed a BCG strain producing murine IL- 18 (BCG-IL- 18) and evaluated its efficiency {{to prevent an}} <b>asthma-like</b> <b>reaction</b> in mice. BALB/cByJ mice were sensitized (day (D) 1 and D 10) by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) -alum and primary (D 20 - 22) and secondary (D 62, 63) challenged with OVA aerosols. BCG or BCG-IL- 18 were intraperitonealy administered 1 hour before each immunization (D 1 and D 10). BCG-IL- 18 and BCG were shown to similarly inhibit the development of AHR, mucus production, eosinophil influx, and local Th 2 cytokine production in BAL, both after the primary and secondary challenge. These data show that IL- 18 did not increase allergic airway responses {{in the context of}} the mycobacterial infection, and suggest that BCG-IL- 18 and BCG are able to prevent the development of local Th 2 responses and therefore inhibit allergen-induced airway responses even after restimulation...|$|E

40|$|A brief {{description}} of the potential occupational health hazards encountered in the manufacture of plastics (polymers) is given. In general, these hazards are due to the monomers used to make the various plastics, to unreacted monomer contained within the finished products, and to the fillers, stabilizers, pigments, inhibitors, and initiators used in fabricating the finished products. They run the gamut from angiosarcomas of the liver due to vinyl chloride, to dermatitis and <b>asthma-like</b> <b>reactions</b> due to the initiators used with epoxy resins...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin 9 (IL- 9) is a {{cytokine}} {{produced by}} activated T lymphocytes and that activates in vitro mast cells {{as well as}} T and B lymphocytes. In vivo, transgenic mice overexpressing the gene encoding IL- 9 show several {{of the hallmarks of}} human allergic asthma: increased IgE concentration, bronchial mastocytosis, eosinophilia, increased mucus production, as well as bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Whereas some of these features reflect direct IL- 9 activities on target cells such as mast cells and B lymphocytes, increased mucus production and eosinophilia rather result from IL- 13 and IL- 5 production induced by IL- 9 in T lymphocytes and mast cells. Preclinical studies in mice have shown that anti-IL- 9 blocking antibodies interfere with the development of <b>asthma-like</b> <b>reactions.</b> In the human species, asthmatic patients produce large amounts of this cytokine and IL- 9 production correlates nicely with species biological parameters of the disease. Phase 2 clinical trials are in progress to test the efficacy of anti-IL- 9 antibodies in humans...|$|R

It is impossible, in the time allotted today, to describe for you in any detail all of the occupational and environmental health hazards of plastics. At best, all we can hope to do is outline some of the more obvious ones in a general way. I have previously reviewed this topic in more detail (1). We might start by defining a plastic as "a material that contains as an essential ingredient an organic substance of large molecular weight, is solid in its finished state, and, at some stage in its manufacture or in its processing into finished articles, can be shaped by flow " (2). In many cases, the terms plastic and resin are used in an overlapping sense. However, strictly speaking, a resin is the more or less homogeneous polymer used as the starting material in the production of a molded article, while plastic signifies the finished product which may contain fillers, plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, etc. In general, the principal hazards of plastics are associated with their monomers and with the plasticizers, stabilizers, "activators, " fillers, and pigments that are used in them. Although there are exceptions to this, this statement generally holds true. Of course, the hazard we are all most acutely aware of today is that of liver angiosarcom...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} studies, as well {{as those}} of others, have demonstrated that local or systemic Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Gue´rin (BCG) infection can inhibit de novo allergen-induced asthma-like reactions, but the effect of this infection on established allergic responses is unknown. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the effect of mycobacterial infection on established allergy in a murine model of <b>asthma-like</b> <b>reaction.</b> Mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) in alum followed by infection with BCG and subsequent intranasal challenge with the same allergen. In some experiments, mice were sensitized with OVA followed by intranasal challenge with OVA and then given BCG infection with subsequent rechallenge with OVA. Mice without BCG infection but treated with OVA in the same manner, were used as a control. The mice were examined for immunoglobulin E (IgE) response and eosinophilic inflammation, mucus production, cytokine/chemokine patterns and adhesion molecule expression in the lung. The results showed that postallergen BCG infection suppressed the established airway eosinophilia and mucus overproduction, but not IgE responses. The inhibition of asthma-like reactions by BCG infection was correlated with a shift of allergen-driven cytokine production pattern and, more interestingly, with a dramatic decrease of vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) expression in the lung. These findings suggest that intracellular bacterial infection can inhibit established allergic responses via alteration of local cytokine production and the expression of adhesion molecules...|$|E
40|$|Preclinical {{data have}} shown that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) can exert {{significant}} suppressive effects on Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph) -positive cells. The {{aim of this study}} combining IFN-alpha, low-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and ATRA was to increase the proportion of patients achieving a major cytogenetic response, in comparison with a group of 140 patients previously treated with IFN-alpha plus low-dose ara-C. Forty three patients with Ph-positive CML in early chronic phase were treated with IFN-alpha 5 MU/m 2 s. c. daily, low-dose ara-C 10 mg s. c. daily and ATRA 45 mg/m 2 orally daily, for 7 consecutive days every other week. Overall, 76 % of patients achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR). A cytogenetic response was in observed 59 % (major in 38 % and complete in 17 %). Compared with patients treated with IFN-alpha and low-dose ara-C, those receiving additional ATRA had a lower CHR rate (p. 014), but other response rates were similar. Severe toxicities were common with the triple regimen (64 %), mostly related to ATRA therapy. Two patients experienced pseudotumor cerebri; two patients had leukocytosis during the week on ATRA treatment, decreasing during the week off (one suffered a severe <b>asthma-like</b> <b>reaction</b> followed by pulmonary edema, resembling ATRA syndrome). Six patients had other unusual side-effects: aseptic necrosis of the hip (1 patient), ataxic syndrome (1 patient), paranoid syndrome (2 patients), syncopal episodes (1 patient), pure red cell aplasia (1 patient). In conclusion the results of IFN-alpha and low-dose ara-C combined with ATRA in patients with early CML-chronic phase were disappointing, due to excessive toxicity. Whether different ATRA dose schedules may result in fewer side-effects and improve hematologic and cytogenetic response remains to be determined...|$|E
