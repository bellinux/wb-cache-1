30|$|During 1965 to 1967, {{detailed}} stratified zooplankton samplings {{from the}} surface to the deep sea (maximum depth 2, 615  m) were made <b>across</b> the <b>North</b> Pacific (0 ° to 56 °N), and the collected calanoid copepods were identified to the species level. In this study, we analyzed the calanoid copepod community down to great depths <b>across</b> the entire <b>North</b> Pacific.

5|$|The summer {{breeding}} range stretches <b>across</b> <b>North</b> America {{from coast to}} coast. It is bounded on the north by Saskatchewan and stretches south <b>across</b> <b>North</b> America to North Carolina on the east coast, and northern California on the west coast. The American goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact flocks, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.|$|E
5|$|Bodies {{recovered}} were {{preserved and}} taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. A large temporary morgue {{was set up in}} a curling rink and undertakers were called in from all across Eastern Canada to assist. Relatives from <b>across</b> <b>North</b> America came to identify and claim the bodies of their relatives. Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns <b>across</b> <b>North</b> America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Of the remaining 150 unclaimed bodies, 121 were taken to the non-denominational Fairview Lawn Cemetery; 19 were buried in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery, and 10 were taken to the Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered.|$|E

She rowed, cycled and kayaked her way eastward from London around the world, sharing stories about the adventure and experience. The 20000 mi journey was scheduled to take 2.5 years to complete.

5|$|A {{study showed}} that high levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes <b>across</b> <b>North</b> America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Across</b> <b>North</b> America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E

5|$|El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{influences}} the average location of upper-level jet streams, {{and leads to}} cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature <b>across</b> <b>North</b> America, as well as affecting tropical cyclone development across the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Combined with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, ENSO can also impact cold season rainfall in Europe. Changes in ENSO also change {{the location of the}} jet stream over South America, which partially affects precipitation distribution over the continent.|$|E
