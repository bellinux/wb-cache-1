40|$|We {{construct}} a {{general equilibrium model}} in which credit {{is used as a}} medium of exchange, and banks participate in a settlement system to finalize their customers' transactions. We study the optimal settlement system design, and find that a trade-off arises endogenously within the model. A higher frequency of settlement and more costly intra-day borrowing policies limit the banks' <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liabilities</b> and promote conservative reserve management, hence limiting the risk of default should a bank fail for any reason. However, such policies also imply higher banking costs, less interest paid on deposits, and less capital allocated by banks to productive investments. After characterizing equilibrium and welfare, we parameterize the economy and analyze how the optimal settlement system policies depend on several features of the economy, including the risk of bank failure, the fragility of the settlement system, the volume of trade by banks' customers, and the rate of return on investments available to banks. ...|$|E

In particular, it highlights and quantifies the role played by net capital gains on the U. S. external portfolio and ‘residual adjustments’ in explaining this discrepancy.

The empirical results indicate that Pakistan’s fiscal behavior is consistent with tax smoothing, but not Sri Lanka’s. Moreover, fiscal behavior in both countries was dominated by a stagnation of revenues, large tax-tilting-induced deficits, and the consequent <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> excessive public <b>liabilities.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> the time-series characteristics of tax-tilting behavior indicates that for both countries the stock <b>of</b> public <b>liabilities</b> is unsustainable under unchanged fiscal policies. ...|$|R

40|$|New EU members share {{two very}} marked {{features}} which have conflicting {{implications for the}} evolution of their real exchange rates in the long run: accelerated growth and systematic current account imbalances, which would anticipate, respectively an appreciation and a depreciation of their currencies, according to different theories of exchange rate determination. Furthermore, both elements are intertwined, for current account imbalances are the other side of capital inflows which have been central in boosting potential output and productivity convergence in these economies. In this paper, we aim at achieving some insight on the role of persistent and substantial capital inflows and the consequent <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> net foreign <b>liabilities</b> in improving competitiveness and in the determination of the exchange rate for the three largest new EU members: Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. We adopt a sequential approach that sheds light on the role of capital flows and their interaction with the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. We start by noting in a bivariate cointegration analysis that the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> net foreign <b>liabilities,</b> far from depressing the exchange rate in the long-run, has gone hand-in-hand with exchange rate appreciation. We claim that {{this may be due to}} the induced effect that capital inflows are expected to have on productivity and competitiveness. After testing that foreign direct investment is cointegrated with productivity trends, we show that a extended empirical model comprising relative productivity and net foreign assets is well-suited in general to capture this indirect, opposite effect <b>of</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>accumulation</b> on the real exchange rate. Finally, the model makes it possible to estimate for the considered countries equilibrium exchange rates and misalignments and perform some simulations on their expected future path. new EU members, Balassa-Samuelson, FDI, REER, current account, convergence...|$|R

In the environment with a financial frictions this generates inefficiency (fire-sale externality). In particular consumers tend to overaccumulated dollarized liabilities in the decentralized economies and take excessive risk. On the other hand benevolent social planner internalizes these effects and tries to restrict speculative capital inflows and accumulate international reserves in order to insure against macroeconomic instability, caused by excessive and inefficient <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> dollar-denominated <b>liabilities.</b> In this paper I consider general equilibrium effects of such policies in a multi-country setup. I show that country-specific social planners fail to internalize the effect of their policies on the world interest rate. As a result in a uncooperative equilibrium developing countries insure against fire-sales externalities at the price of deteriorating terms of trade. This terms of trade effect can offset benefits from insurance, so that in uncooperative equilibrium country-specific social planners may have lower welfare relative to the decentralized economies. These results are robust to market completeness and correlation of shocks in developing economies. Fire-Sales Externalities; International Cooperation...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1950 s, the {{lifecycle}} hypothesis {{has been}} the dominant explanation for the 'inverse U' in household wealth accumulation. This paper advances an alternative explanation, rooted in the ideas of Veblen, that emphasises the role of lifestyle conformity: Because people tend to adopt lifestyles common to their social group and modify them in standard ways as they age, lifecycle norms impart a certain order to the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> assets and <b>liabilities,</b> which enables people to 'do' lifecycle saving via habitual thinking. After laying out the argument conceptually, the paper provides empirical evidence {{on the role of}} conformity in lifecycle saving and discusses its contribution to the current low saving rate in the USA.

40|$|The {{current account}} {{has always been}} a {{neglected}} variable in the management of the Euro area and in the assessment of its members' performance; so has, as a consequence, the savings-investment balance. This paper first reviews the arguments that explain this attitude and justify, under some conditions and in some cases, the persistence of current account deficits. It then examines some peculiar features of the growth experience under monetary union in four Euro area countries which do not conform to the conventional convergence pattern. Models establishing the optimality of a succession of current account deficits in a catching-up process implicitly assume that the intertemporal budget constraint is satisfied, so that the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>liabilities</b> is matched by future surpluses. In section 3 we first introduce explicitly this constraint in a simple two-period, two-good model and show that its fulfilment requires that growth be driven by an adequate increase of the country's production capacity of traded goods and services. By examining the composition of output and demand we show that this has not been the case in the four countries considered and argue that monetary union has helped relax the necessary discipline. The common monetary policy moreover did nothing to prevent an extraordinary growth of credit that fed the imbalances in the four countries. The paper closes addressing some policy issues related to the future sustainability o the monetray union. ...|$|R

The energy sector (the locomotora minero-energetica, to use the rhetorical expression of President Juan Manuel Santos) grew much faster {{than the rest of the}} economy, while the manufacturing sector registered a negative rate of growth. These are classic symptoms of the well-known ‘Dutch disease’, but our purpose here is not to establish whether the Dutch disease exists or not, but rather to shed some light on the financial viability of several, simultaneous dynamics: (i) the existence of a traditional Dutch Disease being due to a large increase in mining exports and a significant exchange rate appreciation, (ii) a massive increase in foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in the mining sector, (iii) a rather passive monetary policy, aimed at increasing purchasing power via exchange rate appreciation, (iv) more recently, a large distribution of dividends from Colombia to the rest of the world and the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> mounting financial <b>liabilities.</b> The paper will show that these dynamics constitute a potential danger for the stability of the Colombian economy.

Limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable.

40|$|A {{settlement}} {{system is a}} set of rules and procedures that govern when and how funds are transferred between banks in order to finalize their customers’ transactions. Perhaps the most crucial feature of such a system is the frequency with which settlement occurs. A lower frequency allows banks to retain fewer idle reserves, and therefore economizes on financial opportunity costs. However, the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> outstanding interbank <b>liabilities</b> under infrequent settlement introduces a large risk should a bank default on its payments. Moreover, when a bank retains fewer reserves, it is more vulnerable to external shocks. Conversely, a higher frequency of settlement decreases both the size and probability of defaults, but is more costly. This paper introduces a partial equilibrium model of a banking sector in which this tradeoff between cost and risk arises endogenously. We then complete the economy with a trading sector that has a micro-founded role for credit as a media of exchange. The result is a dynamic general equilibrium model that incorporates a sophisticated banking environment. Within this general equilibrium framework, we are able to conduct welfare and policy analysis. In particular, we study the optimal intra-day borrowing policy that the operator of a {{settlement system}} should impose on member banks.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation <b>of</b> shipowners' <b>liability.</b> In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus <b>of</b> cargo <b>liability</b> law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law is affected by the availability <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance. Contrary the popular belief the thesis attempts to prove that the presence <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance is not necessarily a hindrance but can be a complementary force towards the realization of deterrent goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law...|$|R
