40|$|Objective To explore various {{contributors}} to people's reporting of self reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems in area of living, including GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution,</b> and {{to investigate whether}} those with respiratory or other chronic diseases tend to over-report <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems, compared to healthy people. Methods Cross-sectional data from the Oslo Health Study (2000 – 2001) were linked with GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> data from the Norwegian Institute of Air Research. Multivariate regression analyses were performed. 14 294 persons aged 30, 40, 45, 60 or 75 years old with complete information on modeled and self reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> were included. Results People who reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems were exposed to significantly higher GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> levels {{than those who did}} not report such problems. People with chronic disease, reported significantly more <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems after adjustment for modeled levels of nitrogen dioxides, socio-demographic variables, smoking, depression, dwelling conditions and an area deprivation index, even if they had a non-respiratory disease. No diseases, however, were significantly associated with levels of nitrogen dioxides. Conclusion Self reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems in area of living are strongly associated with increased levels of GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution.</b> Over and above this, those who report to have a chronic disease tend to report more <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems in area of living, despite no significant difference in <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> exposure compared to healthy people, and no associations between these diseases and NO 2.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>pollution</b> {{simulation}} {{has several}} components, including data preparation, atmospheric circulation and <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> dispersion modelling and computation, visualization {{of the model}} computation results, analysis and model evaluation. Of these components, only atmospheric circulation and <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> dispersion modelling and computation are mature, while the other components are weak {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. To address these weaknesses, this thesis proposes to integrate the data, modelling and analysis into a multi-dimension, virtual geographically referenced environment. In addition, collaboration is used to solve the problem of multi-disciplinary knowledge requirements for conducting <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation. Based on this model, a concept of collaborative virtual geographic environments (CVGE) is proposed. The <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> that is associated with global economic growth is a global problem. Scientists, governmental officials and the public are focusing on improving understanding, accurately predicting and efficiently controlling levels of <b>air</b> <b>pollution.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation is one method used to achieve these goals. This research will consider a computer supported simulation. The contributions can be drawn from two aspects [...] -CVGE and practice of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation. Regarding CVGE, thesis 1 develops the conceptual framework of CVGE; 2 designs the architecture of a CVGE prototype in order to facilitate <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation; 3 proposes the concept of a "fuzzy boundary volume object", and designs a solution composed of a particle system wrapped in pollution boxes; and 4 examines the levels of geo-collaboration for <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation. For <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation, thesis 1 integrates <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> sources, geo-data, an atmospheric circulation model, an <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> dispersion model, geo-visualization and analysis into a collaborative virtual geographic environment, which is able to supply a new research methodology and platform for <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation; in 2, the new platform is scalable and able to free the restrictions of operations on visualization, which paves the way for further extension; 3 couples <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> dispersion models with geo-information, opening up opportunities for cross studies between <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> and other research areas, such as the economy, public health and urban planning. The focus of this thesis is two-fold: one is on the development of a conceptual framework and prototype of CVGE from practice of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation; the other is on applying this framework to facilitate <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation. The work of this thesis can be summarized as follows. (1) Defining the concept of CVGE, developing a conceptual framework for CVGE and discussing primary theories of CVGE. (2) Designing the architecture of a CVGE prototype to facilitate <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation. (3) Integration and computation of a complex atmospheric circulation model and an <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> dispersion model based on high performance computation. (4) Geo-visualization of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> distribution and dispersion based on calculations using <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> dispersion models. (5) Geo-collaboration for <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation. And finally (6) CVGE prototype based <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation. The motivation for future research has two main aspects again [...] -CVGE and practice of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> simulation. For the aspect of CVGE, possibilities for future research include: 1 more detailed research on the CVGE concept, primary theories and methodologies; 2 the efficient integration and management of heterogeneous geo-models with CVGE in standardization; and 3 the efficient rendering of a complex structured object in CVGE. Regarding practice, future research can be conducted into: 1 extending <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> dispersion models; and 2 improving the efficiency of air pollutant rendering with a particle system wrapped in pollution boxes.
