According to the World Health Organization in 2012, 80% of Zimbabweans had access to improved, i.e. clean, drinking-water sources, and only 40% of Zimbabweans had access to improved sanitation facilities. Access to improved water supply and sanitation is distinctly less in rural areas.|$|E

Notably, the graphical department of the original Mega Drive version was compromised in the porting process to the Amiga, resulting in slight loss of color, some missing backgrounds, and <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> animations and graphical effects. The music and sound effects were ported to the Amiga sound capabilities with readjustments in various track's compositions being made in the process.

The New Zealand government provided about $80million (1988NZD) to the east coast region of the North Island for assisting in cyclone damage. $8million was used to create an East Coast Forestry Conservation Scheme, which was set to protect forests and prevent erosion. A study was taken five years after the storm, consisting of a group of 112people who were evacuated or received monetary assistance in response to the cyclone; the study showed 12% of the respondents as experiencing Posttraumatic stress disorder, of which they reported <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> assistance and public support.|$|E

Meade, Maryland. Both divisions {{participated in the}} large-scale war games of the Louisiana Maneuvers in August and September 1941, and the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941. Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed armored unit and equipment operational deficiencies, plus <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal deficiencies that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E

The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS {{as required by the}} ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative <b>of</b> <b>a</b> well-known, <b>general</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.|$|R
40|$|Confidence is {{a feeling}} of trust in someone or something. To be self-confident is to have {{confidence}} in yourself. Self-confident people don't doubt themselves. This is usually a positive word: you can be self-confident without being cocky, arrogant, or overconfident. If you know what you’re doing, you {{have every reason to}} be selfconfident. To be precise being self-confident means “A feeling of trust in one’s abilities, qualities, and judgment: Self-confidence has direct correlation with self-esteem. People with low self-esteem have low self-confidence. Self-esteem is your own rating about yourself. If that does not change, self-confidence will not improve.

The frigate , which had fired the last shots of the American Revolutionary War, was also the last ship in the Navy. A faction within Congress {{wanted to keep the}} ship, but the new nation did not have the funds to keep her in service. Other than <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> money, factors for the disarmament of the navy were the loose confederation of the states, a change of goals from war to peace, and more domestic and fewer foreign interests.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. <b>A</b> <b>general</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E
40|$|Software {{development}} with limited resources {{is a challenge}} encountered by most developers {{at one time or}} another. The limited resources in question can involve many things like: Time, money, manpower, knowledge etc. Developing countries, due to their <b>general</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> resources are particularly well suited as arenas for the study of this concept The research questions we aim to explore are: 1) 	How can limited resources affect one s work organizationally? 2) 	How can technological decisions affect the resource pool? Our case involves a study of the effects of limited resources on the development process of a person-based family health system in India. Our results indicate that a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> most specific resources often manifests itself into <b>a</b> more <b>general</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> the resource: Time. Technological decisions can influence time through alteration of the resource pool. Making a technological decision in a limited resource environment should therefore be motivated by the management of time for facilitating the execution of critical tasks. </p...|$|R

After this, the 7th Division began to prepare for an invasion of Vichy French-held Syria and Lebanon. A short-lived campaign, from early June until mid-July, the 2/33rd {{took part in the}} fighting around Merdjayoun– attacking Fort Khiam {{in the early stages of}} the campaign– and Jezzine, fighting mainly in disparate company groups. Following the French capitulation, the battalion undertook garrison duties in Lebanon as part of the Allied occupation force established there to defend against a possible German invasion through Turkey; in September the battalion occupied a position around the port of Tripoli. They remained there until early 1942 when the Australian government requested the return of the 7th Division to Australia, following Japan's entry into the war. The battalion's role, and indeed that of the whole 7th Division, in the fighting against the Vichy French was largely censored at the time due to concerns about negative public opinion in Australia and the battalion's historian, William Crooks, notes that later this caused some friction between 7th Division personnel and those from the 6th and 9th Divisions, and <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> public awareness of what they had done. Casualties sustained by the battalion in Syria and Lebanon numbered 21 dead, 84 wounded and 26 captured.|$|E

In the auto industry the main thrust of firm activity has been to discard older workers who are viewed as dispensable because of their higher wages and health care costs compared to younger workers. The primary tactics employed have been to offer early retirement incentives and to extend overtime to older workers during periods of production increases instead of hiring younger workers.
