5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was {{the prospect of a}} Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations <b>alive</b> <b>as</b> by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E

During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were <b>alive</b> <b>as</b> Deodato claimed.|$|E
