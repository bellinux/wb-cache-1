The criterion of an optimum constituent optical depth is developed and applied to generate estimates of range resolved measurement errors.

With current lidar system technology, atmospheric backscatter density profiles may be adequately determined up to about 60 -km altitude at the doubled-ruby wavelength, 3472 A, for a 1 -J/pulse laser and a 1 -sq m receiver.

40|$|<b>Atmospheric</b> <b>trace</b> <b>constituent</b> {{measurements}} {{with higher}} vertical resolution than attainable with passive radiometers are discussed. Infrared {{differential absorption lidar}} (DIAL), which depends on Mie scattering from aerosols, has special advantages for tropospheric and lower stratospheric applications and has great potential importance for measurements from shuttle and aircraft. Differential absorption lidar data reduction involves comparing large amplitude signals which have small differences. The accuracy of the <b>trace</b> <b>constituent</b> concentration inferred from DIAL measurements depends strongly on the errors in determining the amplitude of the signals. Thus, the commonly used SNR expression (signal divided by noise {{in the absence of}} signal) is not adequate to describe DIAL measurement accuracy and must be replaced by an expression which includes the random coherent (speckle) noise within the signal. A comprehensive DIAL computer algorithm is modified to include heterodyne detection and speckle noise.

Atmospheric data such as temperature, relative humidity, pressure and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>trace</b> <b>constituent</b> in the function of altitude are the basic requirement for estimating solar irradiance {{and it is very}} limited. Static atmospheric model such as Air Force Geophysics Laboratory Atmospheric Constituent Profiles does provide the required parameter however it is outdated and does not reflect the local atmospheric condition. A Local Static Atmospheric Model for Malaysia was built in this study to provide the needed atmospheric parameters. The model was built based on monthly data from Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder in a period of ten years at peninsular Malaysia and validated with local meteorological data. Along with the atmospheric model, simple model of the atmospheric radiative transfer of sunshine was rewritten in MATLAB environment with some minor modification that allows the local atmospheric model to be integrated into the radiative transfer model. The modified radiative transfer model takes five parameters for the calculation of the solar irradiance which are, date, time, longitude, latitude and altitude. It reduces the parameter needed by the conventional radiative transfer model such as the inputs of atmospheric parameter, pressure, zenith angle, path length, and earth-sun distance. The modified the radiative transfer model was design to include the local atmospheric model as the main atmospheric input which improve its accuracy and suitable to be used locally.
