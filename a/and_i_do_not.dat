5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

25|$|Nurses {{continue}} to nurse seriously injured {{people who can}} not depend on who the sanitary left behind during the movement of the military. That situation is very serious <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe it was a very temporary feeling.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} as yet {{been able to}} {{discover}} the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, {{have no place in}} experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.|$|E
25|$|I am {{sent here}} as a peace chief; all here is to be peace, but north of the Arkansas is General Sheridan, the great war chief, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> control him; and {{he has all the}} {{soldiers}} who are fighting the Arapahoes and Cheyennes. Therefore, you must go back to your country, and if the soldiers come to fight, you must remember they are not from me, but from that great war chief, and with him you must make peace.|$|E

25|$|How {{by means}} of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not {{describe}} my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction {{at the bottom of the}} sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.|$|E
25|$|Bertrand Russell {{made the}} {{following}} {{comment on the}} Philosophical Investigations in his book My Philosophical Development:I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.|$|E

25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my primary care physician as another. That is not to say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E
500|$|According to Kenton Kilmer, {{the upstairs}} {{room in which}} the poem was written looked down the hill over the family's [...] "well-wooded lawn" [...] that {{contained}} [...] "trees of many kinds, from mature trees to thin saplings: oaks, maples, black and white birches, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know what else." [...] A published interview with Joyce Kilmer in 1915 mentioned the poet's large woodpile at the family's Mahwah home: ...|$|E
500|$|On 11 November 2005, he and Rupert Grint {{presented}} Liz Carnell {{with the}} Daily Mirrors Pride of Britain Award {{for all of}} her work {{to raise awareness of}} the dangers of bullying. Felton worked on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix throughout 2006. Having read more of the Harry Potter books, Felton reflected: [...] "I have had input into Draco. If they give me a line <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think it is something he would say, I suggest changing it. They do listen to you and you do feel a part of it." ...|$|E

500|$|George {{warned in}} the Senate, [...] "I {{do not want}} a {{president}} of the U.S. to conclude an executive agreement which will make it unlawful for me to kill a cat in the back alley of my lot at night <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want the President of the U.S. to make a treaty with India which would preclude me from butchering a cow in my own pasture." [...] Senator George was ideal as an opponent as he was a hero to conservatives of both parties for his opposition to the New Deal and his survival of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's unsuccessful effort to purge him when he sought re-election in 1938. [...] "Democrats and Republicans alike respected him and recognized his influence." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{arrived in}} Palermo on 20 July, and Murphy was sidelined by illness for a week. Allied {{capture of the}} transit port of Messina was crucial to taking Sicily from the Axis. En route there, Company B was {{assigned}} to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of}} the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello. The Axis began their evacuation of Messina on 27 July. Although the 3rd Infantry Division's 7th Infantry Regiment secured the port on 17 August, the Axis had already completed their evacuation hours before. During the fighting in Sicily, Murphy became realistic about military duty: [...] "I have seen war as it actually is, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> like it. But I will go on fighting." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his initial}} reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving {{practical}} advice {{to help the}} composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, {{and to get the}} orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, [...] "I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now." [...] However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was [...] "now fifty years old, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring".|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{political}} climate of {{the country at the}} time, on April 1, 2003, Madonna pulled the video and released a statement explaining why: [...] "I have decided not to release my new video. It was filmed before the war started <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe it is appropriate to air it at this time. Due to the volatile state of the world and out of sensitivity and respect to the armed forces, who I support and pray for, I do not want to risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video." [...] After pulling the original video, it was then released an edited version that premiered on April 16, 2003 on VH1, immediately after a special program called Madonna Speaks. This version features Madonna singing in front of a backdrop of ever-changing flags of different countries.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1905 season got underway, Schulz {{contracted}} malaria in the spring. [...] Newspapers {{reported it}} was a [...] "serious attack" [...] and that he [...] "has been quite ill", but {{he was able to}} recuperate before the 1905 football season. [...] In October 1905, Coach Yost said: [...] "In looking over the whole bunch, I do not see anyone who has improved more than Schulz. [...] He is bigger and stronger than ever, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know a man in the world that has it the least bit over him in the center position. [...] I would not trade him for any other center rush in the country today. [...] He looks good to me for the All-America team right now". [...] Though he was not selected for the All-America team in 1905, Schulz did receive All-Western honors.|$|E
500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In {{response}} to the minister's fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, [...] "Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? Go back to your people and tell them to get some rest if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> give you fighting enough, I will never call on you to come again." [...] Stark's forces again swelled the next day with the arrival of some Stockbridge Indians, bringing his force (excluding Warner's men) to nearly 2,000 men.|$|E
6000|$|It was cold, I was sleepy, my bed {{was very}} comfortable, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{wish to be}} disturbed. I merely growled, [...] "Let him alone." ...|$|R
