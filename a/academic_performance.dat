Adolescent obesity has been related to metabolic disease, in addition to psychological disorders, which {{may lead to a}} negative impact on <b>academic</b> <b>performances.</b> Objective To assess <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> in adolescents with obesity Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Junior High School No. 14 in Bandung from December 2010 to July 2011. Subjects were aged 12 to 14 years, and were divided into two groups: obese or good nutritional status. Statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test was performed to assess the association of obesity and <b>academic</b> <b>performances.</b> T-test was used to compare subjects' mean mathematics and English performances in the two groups. Results There were 24 D students who met the inclusion criteria. Since there were 40 obese subjects in the first group, we randomized the remaining students to obtain 40 subjects with good nutritional status for the second group. Best <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> in mathematics and English was obtained mostly by subjects in the good nutrition group (38 / 40 and 39 / 40, respectively). Statistical analysis revealed a significant association of lower performances in mathematics (mean difference - 2. 8; 95 %CI - 5 to - 0. 6; P= 0. 043) and English (mean difference - 1. 9; 95 %CI - 3. 5 to - 0. 2; P= 0. 001) to obesity. We also found a significant association of better mathematics (P= 0. 001) and English performances (P= 0. 004) to the father's occupation. Additional English lessons were not associated with higher English performances in the obese group (mean difference 0. 2; 95 %CI - 2. 9 to 3. 2; P= 0. 885).

40|$|Employability is {{referred}} to as the relative potential of an individual to obtain and retain suitable employment in the labour market. Success in higher education is an effective way of enhancing the employability of youth. Competitiveness of examinations has added in to the challenges and aspirations of youth. The objective of the study was to examine the impact of high school students' emotional intelligence (EI) for their Training (study) approaches and employability potential. Eighty five high school (Advanced Level) students (40 girls, and 45 boys) were randomly selected from two high schools in Sri Lanka. They were preparing in three different subject streams for the university entrance examination. Emotional intelligence of the respondents was measured through Genos EI Inventory. Respondents' training (study) approaches were assessed through the 'revised two-factor Study Process Questionnaire' of Biggs et. al. SPSS computer software was employed for descriptive and inferential analysis of data. The employability potential of the students was assessed based on their <b>academic</b> <b>performances.</b> Emotional intelligence, and the Training (study) approaches (motives, and strategies) used by the respondents were assessed. Relationships were sought with students' employability potential (<b>academic</b> <b>performances).</b> High school girls revealed deeper training (study) approaches and their <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> were superior to the boys. There was no significant impact of EI level to the training (study) process behavior of the respondents, and to their employability potential (<b>academic</b> <b>performances).</b> However, findings revealed a positive relationship between the Emotional Self Control and Employability potential (<b>Academic</b> <b>performances)</b> of high school students. This warrants further analysis, especially in a cultural context. It implies a competitive advantage (employability potential) for students with a better control of self emotions. This has the potential to generate a practical sense in academic and corporate environments alike. Further research is recommended on varying socio-cultural, and demographic segments...|$|R
