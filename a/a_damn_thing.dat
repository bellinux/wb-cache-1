500|$|Amiga reviewers had {{a common}} grouse: the {{frequent}} disk swaps required were tedious. [...] Regardless, the game's tense atmospheregenerated by {{the combination of}} game mechanics, use of sounds, and artificial intelligenceprovided memorable moments to many reviewers. [...] As one of themSimon Clays of Amiga Computingput it, Space Hulk was [...] "a very difficult strategy-cum-3D dungeon-esque title with plenty of action and gripping play." [...] May said the game offered [...] "demented" [...] violence but was [...] "irresistibly exhiliarating when the action erupts in nonstop, heartpounding carnage." [...] A decade after the game's release, several reviewers mentioned Space Hulk as a Warhammer 40,000 video game worthy of praise. [...] Meer reflected on replaying the game fifteen years after its release, [...] "The panic and terror of facing 90 degrees away from your enemy, and knowing that you can't do <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> about it before your lower intestine spills onto your feet, is still something pretty special." ...|$|E

500|$|Treasury Secretary Mellon also {{recommended}} to Congress that {{income tax rates}} be cut. He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, [...] "I can't make <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> out of this tax problem. I listen to one side, and they seem right, and then—God!—I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right." [...] Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House {{after the end of}} the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it.

McNamara watched on as Taylor played with Minh, waiting anxiously for any signals from Minh to [...] "broad hints of our interest in other subjects which we gave him during breaks in the game". Minh revealed nothing of his thoughts about a possible coup, leaving his guest bewildered to his intentions in inviting them. McNamara later grumbled to Kennedy that [...] "I sat on a sideline two feet from Big Minh for over an hour and I couldn't get <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> out of him." [...] Taylor got one of the tennis players, Colonel Raymond Jones, to contact Minh about the situation, to which Minh replied with a complaint about a perceived lack of support from Washington for a coup. Minh claimed that he thought McNamara and Taylor were seeking nothing but a match of tennis and offered to discuss military affairs at any time.|$|E
2500|$|Although Tormented {{received}} {{very little}} critical attention, reviews were positive, with critics finding fault in the album's production but praising its heaviness and aggression. AllMusic gave the album {{a very positive}} review, writing: [...] " [...] shows a band with its alternative metal heart {{in the right place}} [...] Despite some spotty production, this impressive debut unleashes a band whose amps are overloaded, and whose aim is deadly. The original version of [...] "Mudshuvel" [...] (which later appeared on Dysfunction) is one of several highlights."

Their studio debut, tOrmenteD, shows either a natural knack for milking the most out of a crunchy guitar, or they had some good coaching."

500|$|From late 1910 {{to early}} 1912, Cerna {{was at the}} University of Leipzig, where he {{attended}} courses held by the philosophers and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt, Eduard Spranger and Hans Volkelt. Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of [...] "decrepit" [...] Orthodox members of the Romanian Jewish community, adding: [...] "But I do love this decrepit exterior beyond measure..." [...] Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his PhD thesis of 1913, Die Gedankenlyrik (German for [...] "Contemplative Poetry"). According to Călinescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of [...] "natural ideas" [...] over reasoning, and concluded that [...] "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul." [...] Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding ("An idea is <b>a</b> <b>damned</b> <b>thing</b> {{when it comes to}} poetry"). Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted in the author being made a co-recipient of the Romanian Academy's Vasile Adamachi Award. Some of his new poems were still being published by Convorbiri Literare in 1911.|$|R

It was this that shocked him into consciousness of the orgy his imagination had been playing him. From the wall above her, the stiff portraits of Isaac and Eliza Travers looked down like reproachful spectres. Infuriated, he left the room. He had never dreamed such potencies resided in music.

It was remarked that his acquaintance with colloquial English slang, for a foreigner, was quite unusual. Occasionally he was too rude, even for a scientist, informing ladies, clamouring to know how he liked English women, that he didn't like them silly; telling one gentleman, a friend of Dan, a rather important man who once asked him, referring to his yard of ribbon, what he got it for, that he got it for fourpence.
