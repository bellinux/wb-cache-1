5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin or taken orally to treat acne and {{are thought to}} work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
