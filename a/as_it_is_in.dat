5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually.

5|$|English (American English) is the {{de facto}} {{national}} language.

5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E
5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E

5|$|The golden white-eye {{differs from}} the other {{white-eyes}} in having large eyes and an outermost primary wing feather that is not reduced (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the other species). It is a large white-eye, 14cm (5.5in) long and weighing around 20g (0.7oz). The species has bright, unmistakable plumage, with: an orange-yellow head coupled with a pale eye-ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. The bill and legs are also orange. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males can be told from the females only when examined in the hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown-yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs.|$|E
5|$|Tree {{of heaven}} {{is a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions. It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results. Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> America. In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland. In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens. The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{isotopes}} of nobelium are known, {{with mass}} numbers 250–260 and 262; all are radioactive. Additionally, nuclear isomers {{are known for}} mass numbers 251, 253, and 254. Of these, the longest-lived isotope is 259No with a half-life of 58minutes, and the longest-lived isomer is 251mNo with a half-life of 1.7seconds. However, the still undiscovered isotope 261No is predicted to have a still longer half-life of 170min. Additionally, the shorter-lived 255No (half-life 3.1minutes) is more often used in chemical experimentation {{because it can be}} produced in larger quantities from irradiation of californium-249 with carbon-12 ions. After 259No and 255No, the next most stable nobelium isotopes are 253No (half-life 1.62minutes), 254No (51seconds), 257No (25seconds), 256No (2.91seconds), and 252No (2.57seconds). All of the remaining nobelium isotopes have half-lives that are less than a second, and the shortest-lived known nobelium isotope (250No) has a half-life of only 0.25milliseconds. The isotope 254No is especially interesting theoretically <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the middle of a series of prolate nuclei from 231Pa to 279Rg, and the formation of its nuclear isomers (of which two are known) is controlled by proton orbitals such as 2f5/2 which come just above the spherical proton shell; it can be synthesized in the reaction of 208Pb with 48Ca.|$|E
