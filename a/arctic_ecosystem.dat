40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Historically, the {{function}} of <b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in terms of cycles of nutrients and carbon has led to low levels of primary production and exchanges of energy, water and greenhouse gases have led to low local and regional cooling. Sequestration of carbon from atmospheric CO 2, in extensive, cold organic soils and the high albedo from low, snow-covered vegetation have had impacts on regional climate. However, many aspects of {{the function}}ing of <b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are sensitive to changes in climate and its impacts on biodiversity. The current Arctic climate results in slow rates of organic matter decomposition. <b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> therefore tend to accumulate organic matter and elements despite low inputs. As a result, soil-available elements like nitrogen and phosphorus are key limitations to increases in carbon fixation and further biomass and organic matter accumulation. Climate warming is expected to increase carbon and element turnover, particularly in soils, which may lead to initial losses of elements but eventual, slow recovery. Individual species and species diversity have clear impacts on element inputs and retention in <b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Effects of increased CO 2 and UV-B on whole ecosystems, on the other hand, are likely to be small although effects on plant tissue chemisty, decomposition and nitrogen fixation may become important in the long-term. Cycling of carbon in trace gas form is mainly as CO 2 and CH 4. Most carbon loss {{is in the form of}} CO 2, produced by both plants and soil biota. Carbon emissions as methane from wet and moist tundra ecosystems are about 5 % of emissions as CO 2 and are responsive to warming in the absence of any other changes. Winter processes and vegetation type also affect CH 4 emissions as well as exchanges of energy between biosphere and atmosphere. <b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> exhibit the largest seasonal changes in energy exchange of any terrestrial ecosystem because of the large changes in albedo from late winter, when snow reflects most incoming radiation, to summer when the ecosystem absorbs most incoming radiation. Vegetation profoundly influences the water and energy exchange of <b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Albedo during the period of snow cover declines from tundra to forest tundra to deciduous forest to evergreen forest. Shrubs and trees increase snow depth which in turn increases winter soil temperatures. Future changes in vegetation driven by climate change are therefore, very likely to profoundly alter regional climate...|$|R
40|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are {{important}} {{in the context of}} global climate change because the most rapid rises in air temperature are expected at high northern latitudes during winter. The presence of extensive soil carbon reserves in the Arctic suggests that substantial feedbacks to CO 2 -induced climate change could occur if warming alters carbon cycling below-ground. Characterization of the controls on regional patterns of belowground CO 2 release through the annual cycle is an important step towards evaluat-ing potential feedbacks from <b>arctic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> to climate change. In this study, we assess seasonal control over the influences by climate and vegeta-tion-type on CO 2 efflux from belowground in the Alaskan tundra. Our results indicate that climate had strong effects on belowground CO 2 release in both seasons. By contrast, vegetation-type had little impact on CO 2 efflux from belowground in winter but was the principal control in summer. Together, these results demonstrate that seasonality is a critical factor regulat-ing climate and vegetation-type effects on belowground CO 2 release, which should be included in regional models of net carbon balance in <b>arctic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Key words: Arctic; soil respiration; carbon dioxide; soda lime; climate; vegetation...|$|R

5000|$|In Weinbaum's {{description}} of the Solar System, {{in accordance with the}} then-accepted near-collision hypothesis of planetary formation, the gas giants radiate enough heat to bring their inner satellites up to Earth-like temperatures. Being over 600,000 miles from Saturn, Titan receives only a third of its heat from its primary. Titan's temperature is comparable to Earth's Antarctic regions, ranging from just above freezing during the day to eighty below zero Fahrenheit during the nine-hour-long nights. Due to Saturn's tidal pull, Titan is also subject to 100 mph winds, which blow from east to west during half of the moon's sixteen-day revolution around its primary, and west to east during the other half, only dying down for half an hour in between each shift in direction. Despite all this, Titan has a flourishing <b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> apparently at the top of which is a clawed, blubbery seal-like native race of infant-like intelligence. [...] "The natives", as they are simply known, have developed a barter system with settlers from Earth, trading rare, precious and expensive Titanian gems for knives, beads, mirrors, and other trinkets. Less sentient Titanian life-forms include the elastic, stinging [...] "Whiplash Trees"; small, three-legged [...] "Ice-Ants" [...] which create oval ice-hives; giant, one-eyed, hypnosis-inducing, cave-dwelling [...] "Threadworm"; and an airborne predator the size of a pterodactyl called a [...] "Knife-Kite." [...] There are also strong hints of a former intelligent civilization on Titan that created their own architecture such as carved pillars; this is also perhaps a surviving intelligent native culture which remains unseen. All life on Titan has a metabolism based on arsenic, and so have to be chemically treated to render them safe before being eaten by humans. It is mentioned in the story that the eating of the semi-intelligent natives is forbidden, although some humans of the settlement of Nivia ignore this rule and eat this prohibited meat in secret.|$|E

There is, however, relatively little information on the role, patterns, and vulnerabilities of CO 2 fluxes during the nonsummer seasons in <b>Arctic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Presented here is a year-round study of CO 2 fluxes in an Alaskan <b>Arctic</b> tussock tundra <b>ecosystem,</b> and key environmental controls on these fluxes. Important controls on fluxes vary by season. This paper also presents a new empirical quantification of seasons in the Arctic based on net radiation. The fluxes were computed using standard FluxNet methodology and corrected using standard Webb-Pearman-Leuning density terms adjusted for influences of open-path instrument surface heating. The results showed that the nonsummer season comprises a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere. The summer period was a net sink of 24. 3 g Cm- 2, while the nonsummer seasons released 37. 9 g Cm- 2. This release is 1. 6 times the summer uptake, resulting in a net annual source of + 13. 6 g Cm- 2 to the atmosphere. These findings support early observations of a change in this particular region of the Arctic from a long-term annual sink of CO 2 to an annual source from the terrestrial ecosystem and soils to the atmosphere.
