40|$|Background and Aims: Intra-operative {{identification}} {{and preservation of}} extraocular motor nerves {{is one of the}} main goals of surgeries for skull base tumours and this is done by monitoring the extraocular movement (EOM). Intra-operative electromyographic monitoring has been reported, but it is a complex and skilful process. Electrooculography (EOG) is a simple and reliable technique for monitoring EOMs. We aimed to assess the utility of EOG monitoring in preventing extraocular motor nerve dysfunction during skull base surgeries. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, intra-operative EOG recordings were obtained using disposable needle electrodes placed on the periorbital skin and the polarity of the waves noted for interpretation. Triggered as well as continuous EOG responses were recorded after monopolar electrode stimulation of cranial nerve (CN) during tumour removal which helped the surgeon with careful dissection and avoiding potential nerve injuries. Results: Of the 11 cases monitored, oculomotor and <b>abducent</b> <b>nerves</b> were identified in all cases, but the trochlear nerve could not be definitively identified. Six patients had no pre- or post-operative extraocular motor nerve dysfunction. The other five patients had pre-existing deficits before surgery, which recovered completely in two, significantly in one, and did not improve in two patients at 3 - 6 months follow-up. Conclusions: EOG was found to be a simple and reliable method of monitoring extraocular motor nerves (CNs III and VI) intraoperatively...|$|R

5000|$|The {{sella turcica}} is bounded posteriorly by a {{quadrilateral}} plate of bone, the dorsum sellae, the upper angles {{of which are}} surmounted by the posterior clinoid processes: these afford attachment to the tentorium cerebelli, and below each is a notch for the <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E
50|$|Onset {{of first}} symptom has been {{reported}} between 1-12 years, {{with a mean age}} of onset at 8 years.

40|$|A {{persistent}} primitive trigeminal artery {{was found}} in the left side of a 75 -year-old Japanese male cadaver at Sapporo Medical College, 1990. This variant artery arises from the lateral side of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus at about the first third of the carotid sulcus of the sphenoid bone. Then the artery runs backwards between the <b>abducent</b> and trigeminal <b>nerves</b> and penetrates the dura mater to enter the subarachnoid cavity. The artery sends a fine branch ventral to the pons in order to make an anastomosis with a pontine artery, and then mainly distributes to the left lateral parts of the superior and inferior semilunar lobules of the cerebellum as the lateral branch of the left superior cerebellar artery. The trigeminal artery is considered to ontogenetically have some relation to the pontine artery. It appears to be not homogeneous in origin and thus to belong to the secondary artery. Histologically, the tunica media of the variant artery is partly hypoplastic. This finding is of interest in association with mechanisms in the formation of aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The sphenopetroclival region (SPCR) and {{cavernous}} sinus {{are among}} the most difficult-to-access areas in the surgery of the skullbase due to the narrow operation corridors and its proximity to eloquent and important neurovascular structures. Oculomotor (CN 3), trochlear (CN 4), trigeminal (CN 5) and <b>abducent</b> (CN 6) <b>nerves</b> can be traumatized during the approaches because of their localizations in the SPCR. The aim of our study is to determine the relative localizations of CN 3, CN 4, CN 5 and CN 6 in SCPRMethods: On 20 basis cranii, which were obtained from adult human cadavers fixed in formaline, the entrance points of CN 3, CN 4, CN 5 and CN 6 into the dura mater of the cavernous sinus (CS) were dissected under Carl Zeiss OPMI. The distances between the entrance points of the CNs to dura mater and the distances between the CNs and the PCP were measured. Results: The mean distances between the entrance points of CN 3, CN 4, CN 5 and CN 6 to the dura mater of CS were measured as, CN 3 to the CN 4 2. 94 ± 0. 91 mm, CN 4 to the CN 5 4. 59 ± 2. 04 mm, CN 5 to the CN 6 6. 50 ± 1. 74 mm. The minimum distance values of CN 3 and CN 4 to the PCP was 1, 69 mm and 3, 82 mm, respectively. Conclusion: During the surgical approaches, conserving the eloquent neurovascular structures in the SPCR is important with regard to postoperative complications. The data revealed in our study may help in determining a safe approach in SPCR surgery...|$|R

40|$|If {{the origin}} of {{isolated}} <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy cannot be found on neuroradiological examinations, diabetes mellitus {{is known as a}} probable cause; however, some cases show no potential causes of isolated <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. Here, we report a 74 -year-old male who suffered from diplopia due to isolated left <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. Magnetic resonance angiography and fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition imaging clearly showed a dolichoectasic vertebrobasilar artery compressing the left <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> upward and outward. There were no abnormal lesions in the brain stem, cavernous sinus, or orbital cavity. Laboratory data showed no abnormal findings. We concluded that neurovascular compression of the left <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> might cause isolated left <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. We observed him without surgical treatment considering his general condition with angina pectoris and old age. His symptom due to the left <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy persisted. From previous reports, conservative treatment could not improve <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy.

40|$|Objective: The {{location}} and {{course of the}} <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> within the cavernous sinus are very important. We aimed to investigate the sinus and neighbouring structures to decrease the complications which may occur during surgery to this area. Methods: The anatomical relationship of the <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> with the internal carotid artery and its course and size were examined in 30 fetuses&# 8217; cavernous sinus.

40|$|A 52 -year-old Japanese woman {{complaining}} of horizontal double vision for 10 days {{was admitted to}} our hospital. Neurological examination revealed left <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy and muscle swelling in her thighs. Brain MRI showed obstruction in the spinal fluid space of the left Dorello 2 ̆ 7 s canal, which transmits {{a portion of the}} <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve.</b> In Ga- 67 -enhanced citrate scintigraphy, wide accumulation was seen in her bilateral thighs, lower legs, and gluteus muscles. Muscular MRI showed a star-shaped central structure on short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images, and the three stripes sign on T 2 -weighted images. These MRI findings indicated nodular-type muscular sarcoidosis. A muscle biopsy from the quadriceps femoris showed granulomatous epithelioid giant cells and non-necrotizing chronic lymphadenitis, which also indicate sarcoidosis. Her condition was considered to be caused by sarcoid granulomas obstructing Dorello 2 ̆ 7 s canal.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> is {{difficult}} to identify reliably and consistently with conventional radiologic techniques. In this study, a 3 D fast asymmetrical spin-echo MR imaging technique was used to obtain detailed images of the <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> in normal volunteers. METHODS: The 3 D fast asymmetrical spin-echo MR protocol was used to image the abducent nerves in 24 normal volunteers by using a 1 -mm section thickness in the tilted axial and parasagittal planes. The microanatomy of the <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> within Dorello’s canal was also demonstrated in a cadaver study. RESULTS: In 24 normal volunteers, the anatomy of 47 abducent nerves was clearly depicted on MR images. The length of the cisternal segment of the <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve,</b> extending from the brain stem to its dural foramina, ranged from 6. 7 to 19. 6 mm (mean, 13. 1 mm). The abducent nerves were at an angle of 5 to 90 degrees (mean, 24. 5 degrees) to the clivus. CSF evagination was detected {{in the region of}} Dorello’s canal in 36 (77 %) of 47 abducent nerves. The length of CSF evagination varied: 0. 9 mm in five nerves, 1. 0 to 1. 9 mm in 18 nerves, 2. 0 to 2. 9 mm in eight nerves, and 3. 0 mm or more in five nerves.

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> is well known; its {{duplication}} (ranging from 5 to 28. 6 %), however, has rarely {{been reported in the}} literature. The authors performed a microanatomical study in 100 cadaveric specimens (50 heads) to evaluate the prevalence of this phenomenon and to provide a clear anatomical description of the course and relationships of the nerve. The surgery-related implications of this rare anatomical variant will be highlighted. The 50 human cadaveric heads (100 specimens) were embalmed in a 10 % formalin solution for 3 weeks. Fifteen of them were injected with colored neoprene latex. A duplicated <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> was found in eight specimens (8 %). In two (25 %) of these eight specimens the nerve originated at the pontomedullary sulcus as two independent trunks: in one case the superior trunk was thicker than the inferior and in the other it was thinner. In the other six cases (75 %) the nerve originated as a single trunk, splitting in two trunks into the cisternal segment: in two of them the trunks ran below the Gruber ligament, whereas in four specimens one trunk ran below and one above it. In all the specimens, the duplicated nerves fused again into the cavernous sinus, just after the posterior genu of the internal carotid artery. Although the presence of a duplicated <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> is a rare finding, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to rule out this possibility, thus tailoring the operation to avoid postoperative deficits...|$|E

Method: A case series from Rabin Medical Center and all cases of cranial nerves palsies secondary to sphenoid sinusitis that {{have been reported in}} the literature were reviewed. Results: Seventeen patients were identified. The <b>abducent</b> <b>nerve</b> was the most common cranial nerve affected (76 %), followed by the oculomotor nerve (18 %). One patient had combined oculomotor, trochlear and abducent palsies. The most common pathology was isolated purulent sphenoid sinusitis in 64 % followed by allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) in 18 %, and fungal infection in 18 %. 94 % had an acute presentation. The majority (85 %) received a combined intravenous antibiotics and surgical treatment. The remainder received conservative treatment alone.
