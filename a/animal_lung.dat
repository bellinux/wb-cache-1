40|$|Objectives: To {{perform a}} {{meta-analysis}} of gene expression microarray data from animal studies of lung injury, {{and to identify}} an injury-specific gene expression signature capable of predicting the development of lung injury in humans.

A random effects model was used to integrate individual effect sizes calculated from each experiment. Classification models were built using the gene expression signatures generated by the meta-analysis to predict the development of lung injury in human lung transplant recipients.

40|$|Asbestos fibres {{have been}} shown to cause cancer and there is {{increasing}} concern that man-made vitreous fibres, commonly used for insulation purposes, may also cause similar effects {{as a result of their}} fibrous geometry. The exact mechanisms of the asbestos carcinogenesis are not yet fully understood but there are two main factors of influence: fibrous geometry and biopersistence. Biopersistence describes the time that an inhaled fibre remains in the lung. According to the German TRGS 905 (technical rules for hazardous materials) definition (1) a fibre has to be considered as potentially carcinogenic if the dimensions are: length > 5 um, diameter 3 and if the biopersistence is sufficiently high. The measurement of the biopersistence is usually carried out in animal tests (2).

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the recent article by Stehpan and colleagues [1] titled ‘Sildenafil extends survival and graft function in a large <b>animal</b> <b>lung</b> transplantation model’. We appreciate the effort and hard work of the authors on this topic. Indeed large animal model studies are notorious for being time and labor intensive and require approval from statutory authorities. Lung transplantation is an established therapy for end-stage lung disease [2]. Although improving survival figures in lung transplantation remain inferior to that achieved with other organ transplantation. One major area of concern is that of significant ischemia—reperfusion injury leading to allograft dysfunction. Therefore, any laboratory work that can translate into improved graft function in the clinical setting would be most welcome. Interestingly, sildenafil is finding more and more uses as a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Some work has focused on its role in pulmonary hypertension. Recent work by Dark’s group [3] in Newcastle upon Tyne has focused on deleterious effects of brain-stem death on donor lungs in the animal model. This brain-stem death induced injury to the lung {{appears to be a}} major determinant of its function following transplantation. Therefore, we would welcome further studies of sildenafil in the brain-stem death damaged donor lungs...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{nanoparticles}} are generated as by-products during ultrashort-pulsed laser ablation. Airborne nanoparticulate matter {{is well known}} as potential health risk when workers are exposed during operation of laser machinery. In order to provide safety-related statements on nanoparticles generated during laser micromachining, we studied the particle size distribution dur-ing picosecond (ps) and femtosecond (fs) laser ablation. At the same pulse energy, fs pulses release similar share of nanoparticles (> 80 %) in the aerosol fraction, with fs compared to ps generating a far higher share 7 nm sized particles during machining of metals (steel, brass) and ceramics (zirconia). These nanoparticles sampled at the workplace have the same chemical composition than the ablated material (iron-chromium-nickel alloy, yttria-doped zirconia). A quantitative risk assessment is car-ried and compared with indicators of toxicological effects of inhaled nanoparticles. The surface equivalent of the nanoparticles dispersed in the air of the workplace is not likely to exceed the sur-face dose which cause inflammatory response in <b>animal</b> <b>lung.</b> But within one 8 h shift, the back-ground level is exceeded by a factor of 20 so that efficient fume extraction is strongly recommended for safe operation during fs and pf laser micromachining even in research laboratories...|$|E
30|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the fate of CNTs in the environment or their half-life; {{it is important to}} consider whether ENMs transform or are transported between different media, and if so, over what timescales. It is becoming well-established that the nature and behaviour of CNTs can alter, sometimes quite radically, depending on the environment they encounter, governed by their physical chemistry, including their surface functional groups, and physical form. The influence on the environment will be controlled by the emergent characteristics of the CNTs and a range of possible mechanisms, including the release of dissolved species, passivation, local depletion of species, or direct CNT uptake by organisms. Besides, the negative effect of CNTs can be minimized by understanding the effects of the physicochemical properties of CNTs on their toxicity. For instance, a research conducted by Wang et al. [27] on decreasing the lung fibrosis potential of MWCNT through pluronic F 108 coating finds that the coating was able to confer MWCNT dispersion and reduce profibrogenic effects of these tubes in vitro and in the intact <b>animal</b> <b>lung.</b> The mechanism of this effect has the capacity to prevent lysosomal damage in macrophages and possibly other cell types. The author suggested that PF 108 coating could be applied as a safe design approach for MWCNTs in biomedical fields such as drug delivery and imaging [27].|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} {{inhabitant}} exposures {{arising from the}} inhalation of 222 Rn and 220 Rn progeny, and lung cancer mortality {{has been carried out}} in two adjacent areas in Guangdong Province, People’s Republic of China, designated as the “high background” and the “control” area. Annual exposure rates are 0. 38 working level months (WLM) per year in the high background, and 0. 16 WLM/yr in the control area. In 14 yr of continuous study, from 1970 to 1983, age-adjusted mortality rates were found to be 2. 7 per 105 living persons of all ages in the high background area, and 2. 9 per 105 living persons in the control area. From this data, we conclude that we are unable to determine excess lung cancers over the normal fluctuations below a cumulative exposure of 15 WLM. This conclusion is supported by lung cancer mortality data from Austrian and Finnish high-background areas. A theoretical analysis of epidemiological data on human lung cancer incidence from inhaled 222 Rn and 220 Rn progeny, which takes into account cell killing as competitive with malignant transformation, leads to the evaluation of a risk factor which is either a linear-exponential or a quadratic exponential function of the α-particle dose. <b>Animal</b> <b>lung</b> cancer data and theoretical considerations can be supplied to support either hypothesis. Thus we conclude that at our current stage of knowledge both the linear-exponential and the quadratic-exponential extrapolation to low doses seem to be equally acceptable for Rn-induced lung cancer risk, possibly suggesting a linear-quadratic transformation function with an exponential cell-killing term, or the influence of risk-modifying factors...|$|E
