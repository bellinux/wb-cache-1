We examined the grazing effect of the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus on fouling species, which colonize scallop pearl nets. We placed different densities of shrimp (0, 2, 5 and 10 individuals) in pearl nets with juvenile scallops (mean shell height 4. 9  cm) at Tongoy Bay in northern-central Chile. We sampled the nets after 4  months (January-May 2007) and recovered 35 - 50 % of the shrimp from the different treatments. The nets with 10 initial shrimp had <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cover</b> of the bryozoan B. neritina and lower densities of the ascidians C. intestinalis and Pyura chilensis, {{which resulted in a}} 50 % decrease in biomass of fouling on nets.

The native rock shrimp is therefore considered a good candidate as a biological control of fouling communities and this could have a potential for polyculture. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

He also showed that each element of the free lattice has a shortest term representing it and this term is unique up to commutivity and associativi-ty. He gave an algorithm for finding this term. Almost all the work on free lattices uses these algo-rithms. Building {{on the work of}} Ralph McKenzie, J. B.

This paper studies the efficiency of both Whitman’s algorithm and the algorithms of Freese and Nation. It is shown that although it is often quite fast, the straightforward implementation of Whitman’s algorithm for testing u < u is exponential in time in the worst case. A modification of Whitman’s algorithm is given which is polynomial and has constant minimum time. The algorithms of Freese and Nation are then shown to be polynomial.

40|$|To arctic {{breeding}} geese, {{the salt}} marshes of the International Wadden Sea are important spring staging areas. Many of these marshes {{have always been}} grazed with livestock (mainly cattle and sheep). To evaluate the influence of livestock grazing on composition and structure of salt-marsh communities and its consequences for habitat use by geese, a total of 17 pairs of grazed and ungrazed marshes were visited both in April and May 1999, and the accumulated grazing pressure by geese was estimated using dropping counts. Observed grazing pressure was related to management status and to relevant vegetation parameters. The intensity of livestock grazing influences the vegetation on the marsh. Salt marshes that are not grazed by livestock are characterised by stands with a taller canopy, <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cover</b> of grasses preferred by geese, and a higher cover of plants that are not preferred. Overall goose-dropping densities are significantly lower in ungrazed marshes compared to marshes grazed by livestock.

Snow grooming {{in particular has}} the potential to disturb both soils and vegetation. Field visits to three west Otago ski fields located on land managed by DOC showed that cushionfields are the most vulnerable to damage from snow grooming. To determine {{the nature and extent of}} damage to cushionfields 10 permanent 30 m transects were established across cushionfields in 1997 in areas that were groomed and skied, areas that were skied, and in undisturbed (control) areas at Treble Cone Ski Field. Data were collected at 0. 3 m intervals to estimate percentage ground cover for six classes: live vascular plants, moss, lichen, dead vegetation and litter, bare ground, and rock and gravel. The frequency of each plant species was also recorded. Measurements of depth of Ahorizon, soil bulk density, and penetration resistance were made at 3 m intervals along each transect. There was a statistically significant difference in the cover of live vegetation among the three treatments. Cushionfields that were groomed had <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cover</b> of live vascular vegetation than the other treatments.

40|$|The {{erosion of}} {{biodiversity}} {{is caused by}} many factors. Large ungulates, which occupy {{a large part of}} the Walloon forests, can also influence the distribution and dynamics of plant species. Therefore, they impact the biodiversity of our temperate forests. The aim of the present study is to identify changes in forest understory vegetation due to the pressure exerted by wild ungulates thanks to an exclosure-enclosure experiment. This study was conducted on a high plateau of the Ardenne, in the forest of St Michel Freyr (South Belgium). The forested area is dominated by beech and spruce where red deer, wild boar and roe deer are living in sympatry. 150 sampling plots were established in 2000. Each plot consisted of two closed enclosures of 4 m² each and one exclosure of 4 m² as control under pressure of ungulates. Sampling was carried out systematically by a 500 m-square mesh. The cover rate and height of some easily identifiable species were measured regularly since 2000 (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2011 - 2012). In addition, we identified each herbaceous species in 2011 - 2012 to analyze the species richness after more than 10 years exclosure. Ligneous species showed an increase of developpement in the fenced area. These species are more impacted when they are not much represented in the study site. Species richness and diversity are higher in areas impacted by herbivory. Monocotyledons are mainly favorised while tree seedlings are unfavorised. Browsing on the trees keeps the area free from high vegetation and allows light to reach the ground. In the same time, herbaceous species have <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cover</b> rate in the enclosure because of the competitive exclusion induced by shrub and tree seedlings layer. If the apparition of most species is favorised by ungulates, they induce a lag of gowth on dicotyledons which have a higher palatability than monocotyledons. Ungulates have the ability to impact the distribution of vegetal species by the modification of the competitive interaction. By their pressure on tree and shrub species, they induce a higher diversity of the ground flora. However, this change in vegetation composition is slow and requires a long-term studie, specially in areas of low biomass productivity like the St-Hubert forest. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The embedding algorithm typically makes use of the quantization errors available when converting the precover to <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> quality <b>cover</b> object.

Inspired by the side-informed (SI) UNIWARD embedding scheme, in this paper we describe a general principle for incorporating the side-information in any steganographic scheme designed to minimize embedding distortion. Further improvement in security is obtained by allowing a ternary embed-ding operation instead of binary and computing the costs from the unquantized cover. The usefulness of the proposed embedding paradigm is demonstrated on a wide spectrum of various information-reducing image processing operations, including image downsampling, color depth reduction, and filtering. Side-information appears to improve empirical security of existing em-bedding schemes by a rather large margin. I...|$|R

In contrast, little damage to young trees was noted under high densities of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) with <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> snow <b>cover</b> the following winter. The bark of deciduous trees was more attractive to voles (22 % damaged) than conifers (8 %). Young trees growing in open and grassy localities suffered more damage from voles than those under canopy of forest stands (2 = 44. 04, < 0. 001). Natural regeneration in Nature Reserve was less damaged compared to planted trees (2 = 55. 89, < 0. 001). The main factors influencing the impact of rodent species on tree regeneration were open, grassy habitat conditions, higher abundance of vole species, tree species preferences- and snow-cover condition. Under these conditions, the impact of rodents on forest regeneration can be predicted. Foresters should prefer natural regeneration to the artificial plantings...|$|R
40|$|Native bee {{communities}} that use emergent wetlands {{are among the}} least studied systems in bee research. Most native bee species {{are thought to be}} in decline based on the loss of usable habitat across the United States. I surveyed emergent wetlands in the lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley of Arkansas during the summers of 2015 and 2016 using pan traps, blue-vane traps, and sweep nets to determine the current status of bee communities in this system. I surveyed 11 sites in 2015 and 17 sites in 2016 and found that bee communities were similar in actively versus passively managed emergent wetlands. I estimated that the probability of detecting a bee species in my study area to be high (67 - 86 %). I also estimated that species richness in emergent wetlands ranged from 69. 5 - 83. 5 species throughout the growing season. Actively managed emergent wetlands had <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> percent <b>cover</b> of flowering plants throughout the growing season in comparison to passively managed wetlands. Through better understanding of bee communities in emergent wetlands, I provide a foundation to inform conservation and management decisions on emergent wetlands while also justifying continued support of Farm Bill programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program...|$|R
40|$|The {{asset value}} of {{government}} {{has traditionally been}} seen as the accounting value of public assets. We develop a detailed financial economics view on sovereign asset values using market measures to arrive at implied sovereign asset values. We establish definition and dependencies within the resulting framework. Unlike the private sector, {{it is not a}} necessary public sector objective to maximise functional asset value as such; indeed some wealthier countries can run <b>a</b> habitually <b>lower</b> asset <b>cover.</b> Governments exposed more to economic shocks need to make more provision for buffering implied equity exposure. The ability to do so endows a real option value to budget flexibility. We identify the economic drivers of the implied asset values and the real option value in a broad sample of industrialized countries. Our theoretical framework and empirical results are instructive for market participants as well as for governments...|$|R
