5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|E
5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} while {{standing beside the}} instrument, holding the upper edge of its flange between the thumb and other fingers with the left hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks about half <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. Using these balus, players handle the agung {{similar to the way}} a brass tom-tom is played.|$|E
5|$|Then (on {{the ninth}} page) {{he arrives at}} the first species in the volume, the Greek {{tortoise}}, Testudo graeca. It is summed up in a paragraph, Cuvier noting {{that it is the}} commonest tortoise in Europe, living in Greece, Italy, Sardinia and (he writes) apparently all round the Mediterranean. He then gives its distinguishing marks, with a highly domed carapace, raised scales boldly marked with black and yellow marbling, and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail. He gives its size—rarely reaching <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> length; notes that it lives on leaves, fruit, insects and worms; digs a hole in which to pass the winter; mates in spring, and lays 4 or 5 eggs like those of a pigeon. The species is illustrated with two plates.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, Roy Chapman Andrews {{discovered}} {{the first known}} fossilized dinosaur eggs, in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Each egg was about 8inches long, and newborn hatchlings estimated to have been about <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> length. Due to the proximity and abundance of Protoceratops, these eggs were believed {{at the time to}} belong to this genus.|$|E
25|$|Racewalking {{is a form}} of {{competitive}} walking that usually takes place on open-air roads, although running tracks are also occasionally used. Racewalking is the only sport in athletics in which judges monitor athletes on their technique. Racewalkers must always have <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> contact with the ground and their advancing leg must be straightened, not bent at the knee – failure to follow these rules results in disqualification from the race.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the name are {{controversial}} and are attributed by some authors to ancient Celtic tribes. According to a local legend, King Afonso I (Afonso Henriques) exclaimed to incite his troops storming the stronghold: Coragem! Já estamos com o pé nela! (Courage! We have already set <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> it!). A more plausible hypothesis is, however, that penela is a diminutive of penha, a place selected to build a fortress on.|$|E
25|$|Four days later, on June 20, {{more human}} remains {{were found on}} the upper deck between the aft turret and the engine room. These {{included}} two forearms and <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> a boot. All the remains were heavily charred. Additionally, workers were recovering {{a very large number of}} relics such as bayonets, binoculars, books, clothing, dishes, and papers (some of them in watertight boxes, and still dry).

The mechanics of the model locomotive incorporated a number of innovations, such as a boiler safety valve, having the cylinder partly immersed in the boiler and using a new valve system on {{the lines of the}} D-slide valve.|$|E
25|$|Like most bivalves, mussels {{have a large}} organ called <b>a</b> <b>foot.</b> <b>In</b> {{freshwater}} mussels, {{the foot}} is large, muscular, and generally hatchet-shaped. It is used to pull the animal through the substrate (typically sand, gravel, or silt) in which it lies partially buried. It does this by repeatedly advancing the foot through the substrate, expanding the end so it serves as an anchor, and then pulling {{the rest of the}} animal with its shell forward. It also serves as a fleshy anchor when the animal is stationary.|$|E
25|$|But {{the main}} {{motivating}} and integrating factor {{was that the}} Muslims' intellectual class wanted representation; the masses needed a platform on which to unite. It was the dissemination of western thought by John Locke, Milton and Thomas Paine, at the Aligarh Muslim University that initiated the emergence of Pakistan Movement. According to Pakistan Studies curriculum, Muhammad bin Qasim {{is often referred to}} as 'the first Pakistani'. Muhammad Ali Jinnah also acclaimed the Pakistan movement to have started when the first Muslim put <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the Gateway of Islam.|$|E

Khánh was later dispatched to the Central Highlands as the commander of the II Corps. His American advisers were impressed with him and regarded him as an effective force against the Việt Cộng. Khánh also tried to win over the indigenous Montagnard tribesmen, trying to learn their languages.|$|E
25|$|Claude {{was known}} as the singing killer. Keep in mind that there was another Claude Dubois at the time whose career was purely musical. Claude was a nightclub singer in his spare time and was {{acknowledged}} as the singer of the Montreal organization.

He ran his empire very efficiently and would insure regular meetings {{to make sure he was}} on top of everything. Claude was very active in the downtown drug trafficking trade along with his brother Adrien. At the end of Claude’s career he was sentenced to 25 years for the murder of Cotroni’s brother-in-law in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Regeneration among hydra {{occurs as}} foot {{regeneration}} {{arising from the}} basal part of the body, and head regeneration, arising from the apical region. Regeneration tissues that are cut from the gastric region contain polarity, which allows them to distinguish between regenerating a head in the apical end and <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the basal end so that both regions {{are present in the}} newly regenerated organism. Head regeneration requires complex reconstruction of the area, while foot regeneration is much simpler, similar to tissue repair. In both foot and head regeneration, however, there are two distinct molecular cascades that occur once the tissue is wounded: early injury response and a subsequent, signal-driven pathway of the regenerating tissue that leads to differentiation. This early-injury response includes epithelial cell stretching for wound closure, the migration of interstitial progenitors towards the wound, cell death, phagocytosis of cell debris, and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, British Waterways {{began to}} {{introduce}} a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those on bottom gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated hydraulic pump. A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by small bore pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals it became very common. There {{turned out to be}} two serious drawbacks. It was much more expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the raised position could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer. These factors led to the abandonment of the policy in the late 1990s, but examples of it survive all over the system, as it is usually not removed until the gates need replacing, which happens about every twenty years.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation {{started a}} program to {{eradicate}} hookworm in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything. This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated {{that there was a}} crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the hookworm program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico. The Hookworm Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the hookworm campaign was to get <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the door and swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's hookworm campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social and political problems on many levels.|$|E
