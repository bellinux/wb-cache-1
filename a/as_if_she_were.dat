5|$|When Amir {{does not}} return, Tati and her aunt are worried: as Tati saw Amir with Omi, she {{fears that the}} two have run away together. Heartbroken, she intends to return to Cigading. When she and her aunt visit their boss, Abdul Sidik, they unknowingly pass PardiAbdul Sidik's doctor. Upon {{returning}} home, Pardi calls Abdul Sidik and asks him to take Tati in <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> his daughter and educate her. Tati is a fast learner, and is soon comparable to any woman from a wealthy family.|$|E
5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E

25|$|She has superhuman {{strength}} {{and the ability to}} fly and is the first chairwoman of the Justice Society of America. She sports a bob of blond hair; wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume; and has an aggressive fighting style. Throughout her early appearances in All Star Comics, she is often at odds with Wildcat because his penchant for talking to her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> an ordinary human female rather than a superpowered Kryptonian annoys her.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{critics have}} focused on the gender system of Early Modern England. For example, they point to the common {{classification}} of women as maid, wife or widow, with only whores outside this trilogy. Using this analysis, the problem of Hamlet becomes the central character's identification of his mother as a whore due to her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet, in consequence of which he loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a whore also.|$|E
25|$|The {{method by}} which Cybersix obtains {{sustenance}} is different among the series' incarnations. In the comic book, Cybersix sucks sustenance directly from the neck of those she hunts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a vampire; however, {{she does not have}} fangs, instead simply making a wound in the victim's neck with her teeth, then drinking the Sustenance that bleeds from it instead of blood. Conversely, in the animated series, Von Reichter's creations carry glowing vials of Sustenance with them, which Cybersix would open and drink.|$|E

25|$|The second first-person {{narration}} we {{have from}} Alhambra is altogether different from the first – here we are not offered her history, but rather a history of 20th century cinema – a past which she seems to adopt as her own, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> each {{of the characters in}} those films. “The Middle” deals, again, with each of the family members’ experiences of Amber: she throws Astrid’s camera off a bridge into the road, she seduces Magnus, and reveals flaws in Eve and Michael’s relationship. “The Middle” ends with Eve throwing Amber out of their holiday home.|$|E
25|$|Zoey (Miles?): A baby {{orangutan}} who {{was brought}} into the Miles' family after being rejected by her mother. Zoey is very playful and curious, which is the biggest reason she gets into tight, and sometimes near fatal, situations. Having an aggravating tendency to rip things apart (mainly Molly's homework), throw food around, and trash anything she comes across, {{she has to be}} carefully monitored <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a human toddler. She once swallowed an entire bottle of shampoo and became seriously dehydrated, which caused Molly to rush her to a hospital in order to keep her from dying. This act has probably led to Zoey bonding strongly with Molly and learning the most from her.|$|E
25|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the original portrayals of the Onibaba, the Onibaba has undergone a few striking transformations. One example is that of Bappy-chan, the Onibaba mascot of the Adachigahara Furusatomura Village, a tourist destination in Japan depicting a replica of a traditional Japanese village that lies on the Onibaba’s stomping grounds. Unsurprisingly, Bappy-chan has horns and fangs, sports an angry face, and is posed in a fashion <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> about to chase after you. But controversially according to her original image, she is drawn in a super-deformed fashion that gives her a harmless, cute, and loveable appearance. The Village sells merchandise featuring Bappy-chan and even offers a virtual Onibaba for download on their website.|$|E

25|$|Joined At The Heart is {{a musical}} with music & lyrics by Graham Brown & Geoff Meads, book by Frances Anne Bartam and {{directed}} by Frances Brownlie. It tells the love story of Victor Frankenstein and his step sister Elizabeth, a young orphan girl taken in by Victor's parents and cared for <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> their own daughter. When Victor's mother dies, he vows to end the suffering that death brings by pursuing eternal life. Joined At The Heart reached {{the final of the}} Worldwide Search for Musicals competition. The show was produced at The Junction 2 in Cambridge, UK from 1–4 August 2007 and at the Edinburgh Fringe in Scotland from 12–18 August 2007.|$|E
25|$|After graduation, {{she spent}} some time in France. Returning to California, Swett became a teacher in the {{kindergarten}} schools of San Francisco. It was in 1879, when the second Free Kindergarten west of the Rocky Mountains was organized, at 116 Jackson Street, that Swett, then an earnest, enthusiastic student, became deeply interested in the needy, neglected children of the Barbary Coast, that had been grouped for training and improvement. It was not long until a Second Class was organized in the same building, from the overflow of Class No.1. In the absence of a trained Kindergartner, and while waiting to secure the same, Swett took the work in hand, and day after day, was as faithful at her post <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a paid teacher of the Association.|$|E
25|$|Four years later, however, Kim Nio's husband dies, {{leaving her}} a single mother. She returns {{to live with}} her family, but is furtively sought by the local regent, who wants her as his second wife. Using bribery and magic, he is able to {{convince}} her to elope with him. Oeij Se, distraught at Kim Nio having married outside her race, disowns her and acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> dead, going as far as to construct a grave for her. To avoid the shame of his daughter's actions, Oeij Se moves to Batavia. Some months later Kim Nio (now a Muslim and known as Siti Fatimah) visits, seemingly to make amends with her family. She takes back her daughter and then returns to Pekalongan, dying there after seeing her own grave.|$|E

25|$|Captain Lord {{had gone}} to the {{chartroom}} at 11:00p.m. to spend the night; however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10a.m. that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said {{that he did not know}} and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50a.m. and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> listing. At 2:15a.m., Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.|$|E
25|$|His final {{departure}} from Rome {{was motivated by}} a solemn weariness of the burdens imposed on him by his social position, and apparently the difficulties of meeting the ordinary expenses {{of living in the}} bustling metropolis (x. 96); and he looks smilingly ever forward to a return to the rosy scenes familiar to his youth, apparently. The well-known epigram addressed to Juvenal (xii. I 8) shows that for a time his ideal was happily realized; but the more trustworthy evidence of the dry prose epistle prefixed to Book XII. proves and that he could not live happily away from the literary and social pleasures of Rome for long. The one consolation of his exile was a lady, Marcella, of whom he writes rather platonically <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> his patronessand it {{seems to have been a}} necessity of his being to have always a patron or patronessthan his wife or mistress or harlot or muse or shrewish burden.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation {{as to the}} actual paternity of Paul I. It is suggested {{that he was not}} Peter's son at all, but that his mother had engaged in an affair—to which Elizabeth had consented—with a young officer named Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, and that he was Paul's real father. In any case Peter never gave any indication that he believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone but himself. He also did not take any interest in parenthood. Elizabeth though most certainly took an active interest. She removed the young Paul and acted <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> his mother and not Catherine. The Empress had ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her. Catherine was not to see her child for another month and then on the second time briefly for the churching ceremony. Six months later Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. The child had in effect become a ward of the state and in a larger sense, the property of the state, to be brought up by Elizabeth as she believed he should be — as a true heir and great-grandson of her father, Peter the Great.|$|E

25|$|An elderly cultivator, {{with several}} wives and likely several young male children, {{benefits}} {{from having a}} much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation {{and is likely to}} have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second wife will usually do the most tiresome work, almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status. A 1930s study of the Mende in the west African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset, since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers. Polygyny is considered an economic advantage in many rural areas. In some cases, the economic role of the additional wife enables the husband to enjoy more leisure.|$|E
25|$|A genius swordsman and {{officer of}} the Shinsengumi. He has strong bonds with Kondōwho raised Okita {{from the age of}} nine after Okita's mother and {{siblings}} could no longer afford to care for him, and Hijikatawhom he loves and respects like a brother. He is the first person to discover Sei's true sex and he is her main confidant on matters relating to it. He had wanted her {{to go back to a}} normal girl's life after she had gotten her revenge because of the brutality of the life of a samurai. After the Ikedaya Affair, he admits he has affections for Sei <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> his own kin. Over a year after those events he realizes he is in love with her. When he was 17, a woman he rejected attempted suicide in front of him and Okita came to the conclusion that falling in love was not worth such pain, and he has kept his distance from women ever since. Another hindrance to romance is that he has dedicated his life to the path of the samurai and has vowed to himself that he will never marry. The character is based on the historical figure of Okita Sōji.|$|E
