25|$|Whilst the German commanders were {{finalising}} {{their plans}} for Operation Grünpfeil (Green Arrows) to invade the islands with assault troops, a German Dornier Do 17 pilot decided to land on 30 June at Guernsey airport <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> around. He returned to France and notified his superiors that the island appeared to be undefended. More aircraft were sent over. A Junkers Ju 52 landed, and the Germans were given a note {{by the head of}} the police confirming the islands were not defended. The next day, aircraft brought German troops to both islands: the occupation had begun.|$|E
25|$|Much {{controversy}} surrounded Selig and {{his involvement}} in Bonds' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig {{and the possibility that}} he and Henry Aaron would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the San Diego Padres, sitting in Padres owner John Moores' private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep {{his hands in his pockets}} <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the San Francisco Giants' game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run against the Washington Nationals; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the graph}} to the right, the {{retailer}} has seen rapid growth since the end of 2008, doubling the number of their stores from 61 in November 2008 to 123 in December 2009. Company owner Lalani said that finding sites was getting easier because of the new empty rate tax on commercial property. Whereas, previously, landlords would decline to have a discount shop filling their empty stores, they are now less reluctant to fill them with discount stores, as they are now being charged for stores which lie empty. Stuart Donnelly, head of property at 99p Stores, notes that landlords are now being much more proactive, inviting potential retailers to come <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at their locations with the hope of them taking up a lease, as the property market has been badly affected by the recession, allowing the company to drive competitive deals to further expand their portfolio of stores with less expenditure, something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago. Landlords are now regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores can bring to a location.|$|E
