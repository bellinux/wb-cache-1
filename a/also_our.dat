Through lax environmental laws {{set up in}} developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing {{is still one of}} the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 20000 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013) The daily life of local people is significantly affected as Buriganga River is their source of bathing, irrigation and transportation. Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of his monistic philosophy, Schopenhauer was {{very concerned about the}} welfare of animals. For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word [...] "will" [...] designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and <b>also</b> <b>our</b> own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other. For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.|$|E

[...] "And we cannot of course forget South Africa, because although it wasn't a military regime, it was certainly an authoritarian regime." [...] She added: [...] "We wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and <b>also</b> ... <b>our</b> great strong point is that, because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after {{publishing}} Riddles of the Sphinx, Schiller became {{acquainted with}} the work of pragmatist philosopher William James and this changed the course of his career. For a time, Schiller's work became focused on extending and developing James' pragmatism (under Schiller's preferred title, [...] "humanism"). Schiller even revised his earlier work Riddles of the Sphinx to make the nascent pragmatism implicit in that work more explicit. In one of Schiller's most prominent works during this phase of his career, [...] "Axioms as Postulates" [...] (1903), Schiller extended James' will to believe doctrine to show how it could be used to justify not only an acceptance of God, but <b>also</b> <b>our</b> acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more.|$|E

2500|$|Although some antiquarians {{had made}} {{attempts}} to excavate and catalogue the Anglo-Saxon grave-sites, on the whole, such sites were commonly damaged and destroyed in eighteenth and {{early nineteenth century}} England, with little attempt being made to properly study them. Due to the Society of Antiquaries' inability {{to act on the}} situation, in 1843 Charles Roach Smith and Thomas Wright [...] both keen Anglo-Saxonists [...] founded the British Archaeological Association (BAA), which held its first conference the following year in Canterbury. The BAA's leadership campaigned for better rights for native British archaeology, asking for it to be protected legally and to be recognised by major institutions. When the British Museum refused to purchase Faussett's collection of Anglo-Saxon artefacts following his grandson's death in 1853, Roach Smith complained that [...] "not only does the Government begin with gathering the monuments, ancient and modern, of all foreign countries, but it ends there <b>also.</b> <b>Our</b> national antiquities are not even made subservient and placed in the lowest grade; they are altogether unrecognised and ignored." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Werner Heisenberg [...] recollects a {{friendly}} conversation among young {{participants at the}} 1927 Solvay Conference, about Einstein and Planck's views on religion. Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg, and Dirac took part in it. Dirac's contribution was a poignant and clear criticism of the political manipulation of religion, that was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr, when Heisenberg reported it to him later. Among other things, Dirac said: [...] "I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest – and as scientists honesty is our precise duty – we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} human imagination. [...] I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another. [...] " [...] Heisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli had kept silent, after some initial remarks. But when finally he was asked for his opinion, jokingly he said: [...] "Well, I'd say that <b>also</b> <b>our</b> friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is 'God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet'". Everybody burst into laughter, including Dirac.|$|E

He informed that they were guarded, by soldiers from the Baltic provinces. [...] “They treat us like comrades, and have not locked our cells after the second day, while they allow us to walk in the small garden in the courtyard. Our food is brought from outside. ” [...] While imprisoned, rumors of the tsar's assassination reached them; this seemed to indicate the worst and Grand Duke George was, of the three Grand Dukes, the more pessimistic. On 21 July, all of the exiled Grand Dukes in Vologda were again transferred back to Petrograd. In the former Imperial capital, the men were quickly imprisoned with six other detainees in a cell at Cheka Headquarters.|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{release date}} {{was once again}} pushed back to January or March 2005 while a final {{recording}} session was held in Mississauga, Ontario to re-record most of the songs {{that would make the}} album. During these sessions, guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian visited with them and contributed his guitar playing to several tracks. [...] "He [...] came {{in the last couple of}} sessions to help us out and to get a little different guitar perspective on there." [...] Duncan Coutts explained, [...] "We had a couple of our friends that came and played. One guy, Adam, played a little B3, and Jason Lader played on that song. He was <b>also</b> <b>our</b> Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of it, doing Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar. Eric Helmkamp, Bob’s assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer—he sang on some stuff. It was just about a musical team." [...] These sessions brought the whole project back into focus for the band, easing many of the tensions that had arisen earlier.

2500|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>our</b> {{view that}} Lessig and later Ninth Circuit {{decisions}} refining and applying it are {{inconsistent with the}} policy of the Sherman Act. The purpose of the Act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market. The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself. It does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest. Thus, this Court and other courts have been careful to avoid constructions of § 2 which might chill competition, rather than foster it. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish robust competition from conduct with long-term anticompetitive effects; moreover, single-firm activity is unlike concerted activity covered by § 1, which [...] "inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk." [...] Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 767-769, 104 S.Ct., at 2739-2740. For these reasons, § 2 makes the conduct of a single firm unlawful only when it actually monopolizes or dangerously threatens to do so. Id., at 767, 104 S.Ct., at 2739. The concern that § 2 might be applied so as to further anticompetitive ends is plainly not met by inquir ing only whether the defendant has engaged in [...] "unfair" [...] or [...] "predatory" [...] tactics. Such conduct may be sufficient to prove the necessary intent to monopolize, which is something more than an intent to compete vigorously, but demonstrating the dangerous probability of monopolization in an attempt case also requires inquiry into the relevant product and geographic market and the defendant's economic power in that market.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010 {{during the}} United States {{diplomatic}} cables leak, WikiLeaks leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009, where the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Rahul Gandhi, then the General Secretary of the AICC. One {{of the guests}} who was invited for the lunch was the United States Ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer. In a [...] "candid conversation" [...] with Roemer, {{he said that he}} believes Hindu extremists pose a greater threat to his country than Muslim militants. Rahul Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the Bharatiya Janata Party. Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the Islamist militant organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Rahul Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous Muslim population. In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Rahul Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Rahul Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, [...] "In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in Pakistan, and also some segments of Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as <b>also</b> <b>our</b> strategic security." [...] Adding that terrorism has no religion, he said that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the RSS and has compared them to terrorist organisations like SIMI.|$|E
