In 1942, she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into her own apartment in the exclusive neighborhood of Recoleta, on 1567 Calle Posadas. The next year Eva began her career in politics, as {{one of the founders of}} the Argentine Radio Syndicate (ARA).|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 2012, Alessandro Del Piero {{signed a}} two-year deal with Sydney FC. He was paid {{approximately}} AU$3.5million {{for each of}} his first two seasons, and therefore became the highest-paid footballer to ever play in Australia. Del Piero had been linked to Liverpool prior to signing for Sydney, but later revealed due to his memories of Heysel {{he would not have}} been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to the club.|$|E
5|$|Players are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{around the}} {{battlefield}} freely, {{but they have}} the option to create predefined paths for the character to follow. While moving along these paths, characters gain access to Hero actions, which make them immune to damage and speed up charge times. However, the use of these Hero actions requires the use of Bezels; these items are an essential element in battle and are recharged through a variety of methods, such as destroying portions of an enemy's weapons and armor, or killing an enemy. Characters using Hero actions can attack while jumping in the air, and are also able to unleash special attacks which manifest as stylish firearm maneuvers. Enemies are only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> while the player's current character is moving and will usually attack only that character.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCreary's election, his wife Kate was the {{youngest}} first lady in the Commonwealth's history. Due to the near completion of an annex to the state capitol building by {{the time of}} McCreary's inauguration, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the official governor's office out of the governor's mansion, freeing his family from the intrusion of public business into their private quarters. McCreary's receipt of the executive journal and Great Seal of the Commonwealth from outgoing Governor Leslie in the mansion's office {{is believed to be the}} last official act performed by a governor there.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E

5|$|Despite the damage, Tyler was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{back into}} his castle, which was now {{protected}} by a small Parliamentary garrison. After investigation by Parliamentary agents Brown and Selden, however, the castle was slighted the following year, which rendered it impossible to defend. The Countess of Kent, the new owner of the castle, was given £1,000 in damages, but chose not to rebuild the fortification as it was by then virtually uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{occupation}} of South Kasai, the South Kasaian state was not dismantled and co-existed {{with the rest of}} the Congo. Congolese delegates, as well as ANC and UN troops were generally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian authorities while their sporadic campaign against Katangese forces continued. Nevertheless, throughout much of the period, the South Kasaian gendarmerie fought with Kanyok and Lulua militias across the region while local ethnic violence persisted.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly, to acclimatise them during the process, and to allow more {{realistic}} training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain, Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942. Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment. The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches and is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> head-first down trees. Seeds form {{a substantial part}} of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June, the French {{suffered}} a defeat at the Battle of Trebbia, and consequently the Austrians were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> more decisively against Mantua. On 4 July the siege {{entered a new}} stage, with Austrian reinforcements arriving, and the besieging force growing from 8,000 to 40,000. The Austrians were commanded by Hungarian general Baron Pal von Kray, an artillery expert. Artillery bombardment was constant. On 24-25 July the assault begun; and the Austrians slowly advanced {{over the next few}} days. On 27 July Foissac-Latour began negotiating surrender terms.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} four years all three of the regiment's {{operational}} squadrons eventually served in Vietnam, providing invaluable close support to the infantry, particularly during the clearance of Viet Cong bunker systems. Although their value in Vietnam was originally questioned by some, they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence, and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties. The Centurions were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> through the countryside more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield. The tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success {{in his study}} and promotion {{of the concept of}} a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience, those easily <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> would consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is filled}} {{with a variety of}} puzzles that must be solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve {{competing}} against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> through game areas and work on different challenges.|$|E
