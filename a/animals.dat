5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild <b>animals.</b> Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These <b>animals</b> would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from <b>animals</b> to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in <b>animals</b> would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912.

It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to <b>Animals</b> Act.

5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} book would have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply to <b>animals.</b> Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for <b>animals</b> was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to <b>Animals</b> and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore <b>animals</b> from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) <b>animals</b> should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include <b>animals.</b> He argues that sentient <b>animals</b> possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of <b>animals,</b> the use of <b>animals</b> in entertainment and sport, the relationship of <b>animals</b> to environmental practices and the use of <b>animals</b> in cultural practices.|$|E

The results show that the economic efficiency of an <b>animal</b> tracking system depends on such factors as inter herd contact rates, effectiveness of <b>animal</b> disease response actions, and the extent to which an <b>animal</b> tracking system decreases the time of tracing <b>animal</b> movements. In case of a highly infectious <b>animal</b> disease outbreak substantial economic losses could be avoided if an effective <b>animal</b> tracking system is implemented.
