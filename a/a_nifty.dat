25|$|After getting only 2 {{points on}} draws {{in the first}} two games of the four-game homestand, United was desperate for a win when Portland Timbers came to town. The start of the game was delayed an hour because of record-setting heat that {{exceeded}} 100 degrees (on the Fahrenheit scale), but United got off to a hot start themselves. An early corner was headed on by Boswell to Birnbaum, who took his chance on a sharp volley to give D.C. an early lead. The team doubled that lead in the 29th minute, just before a scheduled heat break, when Acosta finished a chance in front of goal, set up by <b>a</b> <b>nifty</b> chipped pass from Mullins. Thanks to the usual heroics by Hamid, the team held on for a 2-0 shutout win that lifted United ahead of New England and at least temporarily holding the sixth and final postseason spot in the East.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} Arrow/Flash crossover, Brian Lowry of Variety applauded the {{producers}} for replicating {{the success of}} Arrow, but with [...] "a lighter tone," [...] and [...] "a hero with genuine super powers" [...] in The Flash. He noted while the crossover [...] "does <b>a</b> <b>nifty</b> job of bringing the two series together" [...] it was unlikely [...] "to boost the shared audience between them much more than already exists". Meredith Borders of Birth.Movies.Death called the crossover episodes [...] "fun," [...] noting that..."plenty of show-specific plot stuff was advanced without spelling it out for newbies. New viewers to either show could follow along {{and have a good}} time, but veteran viewers were rewarded with major storyline motion." ...|$|E
500|$|Ulam {{still only}} gave the design a [...] "50–50 chance" [...] {{of success in}} February 1950. At the end of March, he {{reported}} {{that it would not}} work at all. Scientists like Hans Bethe and George Gamow felt that Teller had committed the nation to an expensive crash program {{on the basis of a}} model that he knew was flawed. However, in February 1951, Ulam had a new idea, in which the shock wave from an atomic bomb [...] "primary" [...] stage, through an arrangement he called [...] "hydrodynamic lensing", would compress a [...] "secondary" [...] stage of deuterium fusion fuel wrapped around a plutonium rod or [...] "spark plug". On being informed, Teller immediately grasped the potential for using the X-rays produced by the primary explosion for hydrodynamic lensing. This arrangement, which made thermonuclear weapons possible, is now known as the Teller-Ulam design. Although it was not what Truman had approved, the design did work, and was capable of producing multi-megaton explosions. [...] "Rarely in the history of technology", wrote Howard Morland, [...] "has such a seemingly daunting problem turned out to have such <b>a</b> <b>nifty</b> solution." ...|$|E
5000|$|The trade {{magazine}} Variety, however, {{was not so}} enthusiastic, saying “Sinkhole has the elements of <b>a</b> potentially <b>nifty</b> noir: evocative cinematography, a seedy criminal underworld and vivid, well-drawn lowlife characters. But utterly languorous pacing saps the film of its vitality; it's like a trip without a destination." ...|$|R

500|$|Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek said of {{the first}} episode; [...] "In terms of writing and acting, Mad Dogs is good, but not perfect, and much of its knock-about banter is uncannily like any Brit gangster flick you've ever seen," [...] like [...] "Sexy Beast: the series." [...] However Lambie noted [...] "when events push its premise from naff lads' drama into exotic thriller, Mad Dogs gets {{infinitely}} better, and if nothing else, it keeps you guessing. As the series progressed, Lambie noted that Mad Dogs was [...] "developing into <b>a</b> <b>nifty</b> TV thriller with an engaging sense of the absurd. Writer, Cris Cole, enjoys picking holes in his characters' machismo as the tension mounts, and the strange billboard posters dotted all over the sun-scorched island, which say [...] "Yenda a ninguna parte," [...] ("Going nowhere") are perhaps a foreshadowing of their imminent fate." [...] Lambie was disappointed at the ending, calling it [...] "unexpectedly flat," [...] adding [...] "the major plot twist that the previous three-or-so hours appeared to allude to never arrives, [...] I couldn't help but feel that, as the closing credits rolled on the whole saga, the tension and intrigue that had gradually built up in previous weeks {{had been allowed to}} slip away.|$|E
500|$|Jay Cocks of TIME {{magazine}} {{offered a}} mixed review, stating [...] "or all its sass, {{there is something}} a little too careful about this album: the rhythms are too studied and studiobound, the sexiness slightly forced. It's as if Jackson, aware that this was her premier effort under a new, $40 million record deal, felt weighed down by the burden of proving herself. When, however, she kicks loose on What'll I Do, <b>a</b> <b>nifty,</b> '60s-style soul stirrer, it's clear that Jackson's got nothing to prove to anyone, including herself." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times compares Jackson to her brother Michael and Madonna, stating [...] "Jackson's real strength, abetted by Jam and Lewis, is the way she tops dance-club rhythms with pop melodies. Less up-to-the-second than Madonna but still effective, the Jackson team has obviously {{been listening to the}} competition. Madonna's 'Justify My Love' echoes in 'That's the Way Love Goes,' and 'If' resembles Michael Jackson's 'Why You Wanna Trip on Me,' starting with screaming guitar and a chanted verse, rising to a sweet melody." [...] He also comments that despite its shortcomings, [...] "he album's not about being real; it's about seamlessness and ingenuity, about giving the public something it can use. For a superstar, Jackson is downright selfless, but she gets the job done." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to its release, Batgirl #1 {{sold out}} at the {{distribution}} level with over 100,000 copies printed in its first run according to Diamond Comic Distributors. Along with Action Comics #1, Justice League #1, Batman #1, Batman and Robin #1, [...] #1, Detective Comics #1, Flash #1, Green Lantern #1, and Superman #1, retailers were required to order a second printing. Calvin Reid of Publishers Weekly states {{in a review of}} the first issue: [...] "The artwork is okay though conventional, while Simone’s script tries to tie up {{of the end of the}} previous Barbara Gordon/Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl. Her formula: murderous villains, blood splattering violence and high flying superheroics mixed with single-white-female bonding... plus a cliffhanger ending to the first issue that offers <b>a</b> <b>nifty</b> [...] into the new world of Barbara Gordon and Batgirl." [...] The New York Times critic George Gene Gustines wrote: [...] "Unlike some of the other DC comics I read this week, Batgirl achieves a deft hat trick: a well-shaped reintroduction to a character, an elegant acknowledgement of fundamental history and the establishment of a new status quo. This is a must-buy series." [...] Earning a B+ rating in a review from Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker writes that Simone [...] " [...] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. The result is a burst of exhilaration, as Barbara/Batgirl revels in her new freedom even as she encounters a so-far not-terribly-chilling villain called Mirror." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark Braxton of Radio Times {{praised the}} {{introduction}} of Baker and Marter, {{as well as the}} K1 concept. However, he felt that the villains were stereotypical and wrote that Robot [...] "boasts perhaps the show's worst visual effect ever". IGN reviewer Arnold Blumburg gave the story a rating of 7 out of 10, attributing its success to Baker. He too criticised the effects, feeling that it made the story [...] " [...] when trying to present an epic conclusion". DVD Talk's Nick Lyons wrote that it [...] "may not be the most original episode, but {{it is one of the}} stronger episodes of the Baker years simply because it never drags and is a breezy action-adventure. It doesn't hurt that the robot itself is <b>a</b> <b>nifty</b> villain". He gave the serial three and a half out of five stars.

2500|$|The {{match against}} Orlando City {{was a hit}} at the box office, as the {{official}} attendance at RFK Stadium exceeded 25,000 {{for the first time}} in years. D.C. rewarded the big home crowd with a fluid performance that produced a 4-1 win and gave United a cushion over the visitors in the playoff chase. Mullins opened the scoring in the 34th minute, getting a foot on a cross across the goalmouth from Kemp, which followed <b>a</b> <b>nifty</b> back heel from Nyarko that created Kemp's chance. Two goals in quick succession put the game out of reach early in the second half. Sam got a header on a cross by Kemp, who had his second assist of the match. That was followed by Mullins' second goal, when the striker collected a pass from Nyarko, slipped wide of a defender, and cut the ball back just inside the far post. Orlando did get one back on a free kick in the 72nd minute, [...] but the rookie Julian Büscher, who subbed on for an injured Sarvas in the first half, capped off the scoring with a goal in the 90th minute.
