Transient analysis is performed to obtain the dynamic characteristics of EMFA. The distribution of static magnetic flux is obtained using the finite element method. The coupled problems of electrics and mechanics governing equations are solved using the time-difference method. According to the interception rate of each contactor, investigation of the contactor spring load condition is conducted and applied to the three-link system. Comparisons of the dynamic characteristics of the three-link simulation and experimental data are performed...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{enhancement}} {{effect of}} N 2 /O 2 gas addition in thermal plasma irradiation on the spallation phenomena from polyamide- 66 (PA 66) specimens with water absorption. The polyamide materials are widely used, for example, in low-voltage circuit breakers and arcing horns as ablation material. In such devices, the polymer is often contacted with arc discharges to be ablated, {{which increases the}} arc current interruption ability of the circuit breakers. In our previous experiments, not only ablation but also spallation phenomena had been found to occur from PA 66 specimens with water absorption by Ar thermal plasma irradiation. The present work was conducted to investigate effect of N 2 /O 2 inclusion in the irradiating thermal plasma on the occurrence of spallation phenomena because the <b>air</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> was used in air. Relative oxygen admixture ratio to N 2 was changed from 0 % to 100 % with a fixed heat flux irradiated to PA 66 specimens.

40|$|Beryllium is a {{naturally}} occurring element with many unique properties {{and a variety}} of uses. When combined with other elements, such as copper, specialized alloys may be made that are of particular value for certain applications. In the electrical industry copper beryllium alloys are frequently present in electrical components in the contactors, relays, springs and other metallic components. Though beryllium has many excellent physical properties and poses minimal to no human health hazard when in a solid finished form, inhaling the dust or fumes of beryllium containing materials can cause serious health issues. This project assesses whether removable beryllium surface contamination is present on four different types of electrical switchgear equipment. A total of 119 wipe samples were collected from four different styles of electrical switchgear. All wipe sample results were well below the established criteria of 0. 2 μg/ 100 cm 2. Equipment sampled and results in μg/ 100 cm 2 included Siemen Allis Contactors (CI 95 % 0. 019, 0. 029), Westinghouse Vacuum Circuit Breakers (CI 95 % 0. 014, 0. 019), Westinghouse <b>Air</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> (CI 95 % - 0. 009, 0. 047), and GE Power Vacuum Breaker (CI 95 % 0. 02). In addition, 6 bulk samples were collected from 6 Westinghouse Vacuum Circuit Breakers with all results below the criteria established of 2 μg/g, (CI 95 % 0. 21, 0. 46).

40|$|The {{design of}} arc rupturing parts of {{low-voltage}} <b>air</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> {{depends upon the}} strength and distribution of the magnetic blowout field by which the arc is forced. The magnetic blowout causes the arc {{to move into a}} set of slotted iron grids, where the arc is extinguished rapidly. The current in the conductors and the arc make up a magnetic field through the grids around the arc. Thus, {{the first step in the}} calculation of the motion of the arc is the prediction of the magnetic blowout force. In many cases, however, it was not easy to calculate the forces owing to the complicated three dimensional structure of arc chutes and contact systems. In this paper, a developed method which can calculate the distribution of magnetic blowout forces along arc which lie at arc rupturing Parts 　of a <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> is described. The forces are calculated in the same way that a conductor is moved in the magnetic field. The flux density in the arc is obtained by 2 -D or 3 -D finite element method taking into account magnetic saturation of iron plates. And then, the differences between 2 -D and 3 -D finite element method are discussed by calculated results of the model...|$|R

50|$|In December 1965 a {{generator}} coil failed on unit 2, {{followed by a}} series of further failures between 1971 and 73, which in an effort to correct, the windings were reversed. Units 1, 3 and 4 had their stators rewound in 1975 to 76.The sluice gates 3 in 1996 and gate 2 in 2001 were modified to enable the power station to pass an increased maximum design flood of 200,000 cusec (5,663 m3/s). Gate 1 was also plugged with concrete. To improve the structures seismic withstand ability the original heavy chain and counterweight spillway gate operating system was replaced with a hydraulic system while the dam's top bridge was strengthened and the gantry towers lowered.In the 1990s the power station's control systems were automated with new control and protection systems which allowed it to be demanned. Control of the power station is now undertaken from a control centre at Clyde Power Station. On 1 April 1996 ownership of Roxburgh was transferred to Contact Energy, a State Owned Enterprise which subsequently passed into private ownership in 1999.With the separation of Transpower a new control room was constructed on the former carpark to house the Transpower equipment needed to operate the transmission equipment.
