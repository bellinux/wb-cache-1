40|$|Background: Many {{patients}} with glaucoma have difficulty using <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> because of dry eye symptom. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated {{the effect of}} Korean Red Ginseng on dry eye syndrome in {{patients with}} glaucoma treated with <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> Methods: Forty-nine participants were allocated to the Korean Red Ginseng (3  g/day; n =  24) or placebo (n =  25) groups for 8 weeks. Tear film stability, fluorescein corneal staining, conjunctival hyperemia, tear production, grade of meibomian gland dysfunction, and dry eye questionnaire (Ocular Surface Disease Index) were evaluated at baseline and on completion of the treatment. Results: Almost all patients displayed dry eye symptoms and signs at baseline. After the 8 -week intervention, Korean Red Ginseng supplementation significantly improved the tear film stability and total Ocular Surface Disease Index score, as compared to placebo (p <  0. 01). Conclusion: Korean Red Ginseng supplementation may provide an additional treatment option for dry eye and patients with glaucoma using <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops...</b>|$|E

The incidence and severity of superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), patient gender and age, type of glaucoma, and type of eye drops were recorded. SPK was graded according to the AD (A, area; D, density) classification. The severity score (SS) was calculated from A &times; D. Results: SPK was observed in 382 (51. 0 %) of 749 eyes that had received any type of <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> While 254 eyes (33. 9 %) were classified as A 1 D 1 (SS 1), 34 eyes (4. 6 %) had severe SPK with SS 4 or more. The number of eye drops and the total dosing frequency per day were significantly greater in SPK-positive eyes than in eyes without SPK. The number of eye drops was proportional to the frequency and severity of SPK. Among eyes that were treated with three or more eye drops, SPK was more severe and more frequent in older patients (&ge; 71 years). In addition, a considerable difference was detected {{for each type of}} glaucoma. Conclusion: Drug-induced keratoepitheliopathy is often observed in eyes that have received recent <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> The number of eye drops, the total dose frequency per day, patient age, and type of glaucoma may affect this condition. We have to consider not only the effects on intraocular pressure but also the incidence and severity of drug-induced keratoepitheliopathy as a frequent side effect of glaucoma medications.

40|$|Purpose. Assessment of the {{effectiveness}} of low-frequency magnetic therapy on the dynamics of intraocular pressure in the treatment of primary and uncompensated medical means of open-angle glaucoma. Patients and Methods. 46 patients with uncompensated open-angle glaucoma. The first group: 24 patients (42 eyes) with open-angle glaucoma (I, II, III stages during 2 – 13 years). The second group: 22 patients (22 eyes) with newly diagnosed elevated intraocular pressure in one eye. The age of patients ranged from 43 to 59 years. Treatment included <b>antiglaucoma</b> hypotensive <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and TRANS-orbital magnetic stimulation on the domestic device “Polus- 2 ”. Results. Intraocular pressure before treatment ranged from 25 to 32 mm Hg. (average of 28. 9 ± 1. 4 mm Hg.) in the first group. After magnetic stimulation IOP decreased within 2 – 5 days in all patients to 18 to 21 mm Hg (average of 17. 9 ± 1. 1 mm Hg), reaching values “pressure goal. ” Second group: in the primary treatment in patients IOP was 28 – 39 mm Hg (average of 32. 6 ± 1. 8 mm Hg) on one of the eyes.

We randomly allocated 39 patients who had been treated with three <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> (prostaglandin F 2 &alpha; analogues plus beta-blockers and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) into two groups. Group A (n = 20) were treated with latanoprost&ndash;timolol and brinzolamide 1 % therapy and Group B (n = 16) were treated with dorzolamide 1 %/timolol and latanoprost. Thirty-six patients completed all 12 weeks of this study. The major clinical parameters measured were intraocular pressure (IOP), conjunctive hyperemia, superficial punctate keratopathy and hyperpigmentation of eyelid at baseline, 4, and 12 weeks. Additionally noted were adverse events and patient preferences, measured using a questionnaire at study initiation and at 12 weeks. Results: At baseline, IOPs were (Group A: 14. 1 &plusmn; 2. 9 mmHg, B: 14. 5 &plusmn; 2. 9 mmHg; P = 0. 658), (Group A: 13. 8 &plusmn; 2. 6 mmHg, B: 14. 3 &plusmn; 2. 8 mmHg; P = 0. 715) at 4 weeks, and (Group A: 14. 1 &plusmn; 2. 7 mmHg, B: 14. 2 &plusmn; 2. 7 mmHg; P = 0. 538) at 12 weeks.

A total of 48 albino rabbits were used and seven groups of treatments were constituted. Solutions (50 µl) of PBS, 0. 02 %BAK, (0. 02 %BAK+) latanoprost, (0. 015 %BAK+) travoprost, (0. 005 %BAK+) bimatoprost, (BAK-free) travoprost preserved with the SofZia® system or (BAK-free) tafluprost were instilled 15 times at 5 -min intervals in both eyes. CALT changes were analyzed using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), immunohistology in cryosections for detecting MUC- 5 AC+ mucocytes and CD 45 + hematopoietic cells. <b>Antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> stimulated inflammatory cell infiltration in the CALT, {{and seemed to be}} primarily related to the concentration of their BAK content.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: Using an {{established}} three-dimensional (3 D) toxicological model based on reconstituted human corneal epithelium (HCE), {{this study investigated}} the tolerability of four topical intraocular pressure (IOP) -lowering agents: the commercial solutions of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) -containing 0. 005 % latanoprost, 0. 004 % travoprost, 0. 03 % bimatoprost containing 0. 02 %, 0. 015 %, and 0. 005 % BAC, respectively and the preservative-free (PF) tafluprost. Solutions of 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % BAC alone were also evaluated for comparison. Methods: The 3 D-HCEs were treated with either solutions for 24 hours followed or not by a 24 -hour recovery period. We used a modified MTT procedure to assess cell viability in the HCE. Frozen sections of HCE were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy {{for the evaluation of}} apoptosis (TUNEL), inflammation (ICAM- 1), and proliferation (Ki 67). Corneal epithelial tight junctions (occludin and ZO- 1) were also assessed by en-face confocal microscopy in response to the different eye drops. Results: The MTT test revealed that the cytotoxicity of <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> was primarily related to the concentration of their common BAC preservative (0. 02 %BAC-latanoprost > 0. 015 %BAC-travoprost > 0. 005 %BAC-bimatoprost).

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the optimal energy level {{to be used}} in selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) for maximal intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in open-angle glaucoma (OAG) patients. Patients and Methods: This cohort sequentially recruited OAG subjects in Hong Kong, China during 2011 to 2012. All subjects received a single session of SLT with near confluent spots to 360 degrees of the trabecular meshwork. An initial energy of 0. 8 mJ was titrated until bubble formation was just visible. The main outcomes included: change in IOP (pre-SLT to 1 mo post-SLT) and total SLT energy (SLT spots multiplied by the mean energy). For statistical analysis, only the right eye of each subject was used. Bandwidth selection by generalized cross-validation was used to determine the optimal interval and point of total SLT energy that resulted in the largest IOP reduction. Results: A total of 49 Chinese OAG subjects had a mean age of 64. 2 ¡Ó 11. 1 years. The pre-SLT IOP was 17. 1 ¡Ó 2. 9 mm Hg while on 1. 9 ¡Ó 1. 1 types of <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> The mean total energy was 167. 1 ¡Ó 41. 4 mJ (171. 5 ¡Ó 41. 2 spots at 1. 0 ¡Ó 0. 06 mJ). The 1 month post-SLT IOP was 13. 5 ¡Ó 2. 8 mm Hg. The percentage of SLT success was 57. 1 % (28 / 49).

40|$|PURPOSE:: To {{identify}} the optimal energy level {{to be used}} in selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) for maximal intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in open-angle glaucoma (OAG) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS:: This cohort sequentially recruited OAG subjects in Hong Kong, China during 2011 to 2012. All subjects received a single session of SLT with near confluent spots to 360 degrees of the trabecular meshwork. An initial energy of 0. 8 mJ was titrated until bubble formation was just visible. The main outcomes included: change in IOP (pre-SLT to 1 mo post-SLT) and total SLT energy (SLT spots multiplied by the mean energy). For statistical analysis, only the right eye of each subject was used. Bandwidth selection by generalized cross-validation was used to determine the optimal interval and point of total SLT energy that resulted in the largest IOP reduction. RESULTS:: A total of 49 Chinese OAG subjects had a mean age of 64. 2 +/- 11. 1 years. The pre-SLT IOP was 17. 1 +/- 2. 9 mm Hg while on 1. 9 +/- 1. 1 types of <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> The mean total energy was 167. 1 +/- 41. 4 mJ (171. 5 +/- 41. 2 spots at 1. 0 +/- 0. 06 mJ). The 1 month post-SLT IOP was 13. 5 +/- 2. 8 mm Hg. The percentage of SLT success was 57. 1 % (28 / 49). The 95 % confidence band by bootstrap method was plotted showing that a total energy between 214. 6 and 234. 9 mJ significantly decreased the IOP> 25 %, with the optimal total energy at 226. 1 mJ. CONCLUSIONS:: A higher SLT energy, in the range of 214. 6 to 234. 9 mJ, seems to be associated with an improved IOP-lowering response.

Patients and methods: A total of 1, 255 patients with glaucoma and dry eye symptoms related to antiglaucoma topical medication participated in an open-label, uncontrolled, prospective, and multicenter study and were instructed to take three capsules a day of the nutraceutical formulation (Brudypio® 1. 5  g) for 12  weeks. Dry eye symptoms (graded as 0 – 3 [none to severe, respectively]), conjunctival hyperemia, tear breakup time, Schirmer I test, Oxford grading scheme, and intraocular pressure were assessed. Results: After 12  weeks of administration of the dietary supplement, all dry eye symptoms improved significantly (P< 0. 001) (mean 1. 3 vs 0. 6 for scratching, 1. 4 vs 0. 7 for stinging sensation, 1. 6 vs 0. 7 for grittiness, 1. 0 vs 0. 4 for tired eyes, 1. 1 vs 0. 5 for grating sensation, and 0. 8 vs 0. 3 for blurry vision). The Schirmer test scores and the tear breakup time also increased significantly. There was an increase in the percentage of patients grading 0 –I in the Oxford scale and a decrease in those grading IV–V. Compliance was recorded in 62. 5 % of patients. In compliant patients, the mean differences at 12  weeks vs baseline of dry eye symptoms were statistically significant as compared to noncompliant patients. Conclusion: Dietary supplementation with Brudypio® may be a clinically valuable additional option for the treatment of dry eye syndrome in patients with glaucoma using <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> These results require confirmation with an appropriately designed randomized controlled study.

Our {{aim is to}} evaluate the {{toxicity of}} antiglaucoma medications to CECs using an in vitro toxicity assay. Methods: Primary cultures of human (H) CECs derived from eye bank specimens were established. Following exposure of HCECs to test solutions for 10, 30, or 60 minutes, or 48 hours, we measured cell viability using a WST- 1 assay. Test solutions were diluted in culture media and included 0. 5 % Timoptol&reg;, preservative-free 0. 5 % timolol maleate, 1 % Trusopt&reg;, preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, Travatan&reg;, Travatan Z&reg;, Xalatan&reg;, and benzalkonium chloride (BAK). To assess cell viability, {{the value of the}} test culture well after treatment was expressed as a percentage of that of the control well. Toxicity of each solution was compared using the cell viability score (CVS). Results: After exposure to 10 -fold dilutions of test solutions for 48 hours, HCEC viabilities were 48. 5 % for 0. 5 % Timoptol, 80. 9 % for preservative-free 0. 5 % timolol maleate, 47. 0 % for 1 % Trusopt, 71. 7 % for preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, 55. 5 % for Travatan, 88. 5 % for Travatan Z, and 52. 5 % for Xalatan. Exposure to test solutions diluted 100 -fold or more resulted in HCEC viabilities &gt; 80 %, with the exception of preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, which resulted in a viability of 72. 0 % at a dilution of 100 -fold. Based on CVS, the order of cell viability was Travatan Z&nbsp;&ge; preservative-free timolol maleate = preservative-free dorzolamide &gt; 0. 5 % Timoptol = 1 % Trusopt &gt; Travatan&nbsp;&ge; Xalatan. Assessment of the combined effect of drug and BAK revealed that latanoprost reduced the toxicity of BAK.

40|$|Glaucoma is {{the first}} cause of {{irreversible}} blindness in the world. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) mostly combines retinal neuropathy with abnormal elevation of the intraocualar pressure, which {{is the first}} risk factor for the disease. Ocular hypertension is caused by a trabecular meshwork degeneration whose primary mecanisms are still unknown. Indeed, the current antiglaucoma treatment does not target the intial trabecular pathology so it is not currative. Moreover, <b>antiglaucoma</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> often contain a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride (BAC), which has been demonstrated to cause ocular surface inflammation in glaucomatous patients treated over a long term period. Chemokines, small proteins from the cytokine family, have been first described for their chemotactic properties for leukocytes through their interaction with G protein coupled receptors. Aside from its immune properties, the chemokine CXCL 12 is involved in the regulation of cell viability and extracellulare matrix remodelling through its receptor CXCR 4. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} proteolytic cleavage of CXCL 12 yields a proapoptotic form, SDF- 1 (5 - 67), acting via another chemokine receptor :CXCR 3. In this thesis, CXCL 12, CXCR 3 and CXCR 4 have been detected in trabecular cells in human glaucomatous trabecular tissue and immortalized cell line. We originally describe a balance between the protective system CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 and SDF- 1 (5 - 67) /CXCR 3 which induces trabecular apoptosis under the control of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases known to be involved in POAG. We report the sucessful use in vivo of a non-peptide specific antagonist of CXCR 3 in reducing ocular hypertension and restoring trabecular function in an animal model of glaucoma, opening up new therapeutic avenues in glaucoma. We also studied the role of another chamokine, CX 3 CL 1, in the ocular surface inflammation induced by BAC. CX 3 CL 1 is charaterized by powerful chemoattract properties on CX 3 CR 1 -bearing leukocytes. In this study, we report an overexpression of CX 3 CL 1 in conjunctival epithelial cells in glaucomatous patients treated with a BAC-containing medication. In vitro, we demonstrate that BAC-stimulated conjunctival epithelial cells attract lymphocytic and monocytic subpopulations by producing CX 3 CL 1. In an animal model of BAC-induced ocular toxicity, we report a decrease in macrophage infiltration to the conjunctiva in CX 3 CR 1 -deficient mice compared to wild-type animals, further confirming that CX 3 CL 1 /CX 3 CR 1 is involved in immune cell trafincking in the ocular surface. Our results originally show that chemokines are involved in the pathophysiology of the anterior segment in glaucoma. Chemokines appear as a new regulating system for the pathogenesis of trabecular degeneration in glaucoma as well as for ocular surface inflammation, and could constitute new specific therapeutic targets in such deleterious diseasesLe glaucome primitif à angle ouvert est une neuropathie optique rétinienne dont le premier facteur de risque, l'hypertonie intraoculaire, est causé par une dégénérescence du trabéculum dont les mécanismes demeurent inconnus. Ainsi, les traitements actuels ne ciblent pas la trabéculopathie originelle, ce qui pourrait expliquer leur inefficacité parfois observée. En outre, ces traitements contiennent un conservateur, le chlorure de benzalkonium (BAC), qui est responsable d'une inflammation iatrogène de la surface oculaire mise en cause dans l'inobservance thérapeutique. Les chimiokines, cytokines initialement décrites du fait de leurs propriétés chimioattractantes, sont également impliquées dans le contrôle de la viabilité cellulaire et du microenvironnement tissulaire. Dans cette thèse, nous démontrons l'existence d'une balance au niveau trabéculaire entre le système CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 aux effets protecteurs et le système SDF- 1 (5 - 67) /CXCR 3 proapoptotique. Nous rapportons de façon originale que l'utilisation in vivo d'un antagoniste non-peptidique spécifique de CXCR 3 diminue la pression intraoculaire en restaurant la fonction trabéculaire dans un modèle animal de glaucome. En parallèle, nous révélons que les cellules épithéliales conjonctivales exposées au BAC attirent certaines populations leucocytaires via CX 3 CL 1 /CX 3 CR 1, montrant ainsi que ce système est impliqué dans le trafic immunitaire au sein de la surface oculaire. De façon originale, les chimiokines apparaissent comme un système inédit de régulation de l'environnement trabéculaire et de la surface oculaire, constituant ainsi de nouvelles cibles thérapeutiques spécifique...|$|E

Topically applied carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions are commonly used to treat glaucoma. However, local eye irritation and multiple daily administrations may hamper their clinical usefulness. Aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> formulations that improve their topical bioavailability and reduce their eye irritation can improve their clinical efficacy. Earlier studies showed that dorzolamide and closely related CAIs are more effectively delivered into the eye from acidic <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions than from comparable neutral solutions. Consequently, dorzolamide was marketed as an aqueous pH 5. 6 <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solution (Trusopt(®), Merck). Later, it was shown that increasing the pH of the <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> from pH 5. 6 to physiologic pH significantly reduced their local irritation. Earlier attempts to use cyclodextrins (CDs) as ocular penetration enhancers in dorzolamide <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions failed since; although the CDs were able to enhance the aqueous solubility of dorzolamide, increasing the pH from 5. 6 to physiologic pH reduced {{the ability of the}} drug to permeate into the eye. Later, it was discovered that formulating the drug as aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microparticle suspension resulted in significant bioavailability enhancement. The solid dorzolamide/γCD microparticles are mucoadhesive and release dorzolamide into the aqueous tear fluid for extended time period.
