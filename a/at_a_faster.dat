5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> rate of speed.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with a well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa on September 3. It quickly developed an area of deep convection with a well-defined circulation, which prompted it being classified a tropical depression on September4. At the time it was situated hundreds of miles south of Cape Verde at a very low latitude of 7.2°N. Initial intensification was slow as the system moved northwestward, a movement caused by a large mid-level trough over the central Atlantic. On September5 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isidore. Subsequently, it intensified <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> rate, becoming a hurricane on September6. The following day, satellite estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested a peak intensity of 100mph (165km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg).|$|E
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight.

5|$|By September29, Georges had {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} storm and completed a small clockwise loop over southern Mississippi. Subsequently, the storm began tracking west-northwestward <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> pace. Around 1200UTC, Georges weakened to a tropical depression, and the NHC issued their final advisory on the system. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) initiated public advisories. The depression maintained a well-defined circulation as it tracked close to the Gulf of Mexico; however, the center of circulation remained inland. Large quantities of tropical moisture fed the storm, allowing it to produce torrential rainfall. By September30, the low-level circulation began to detach from the upper-level circulation. The HPC issued their final advisory on the depression early on October1 as it neared the Atlantic Ocean, and it fully dissipated several hours later.|$|E

Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall he bowled the least overs due to his injured finger. McCool had the worst economy rate among the regular bowlers, but he took his wickets <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> rate; his strike rate was second only to paceman Ray Lindwall.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine (RSMC Nadi designation: 12F, JTWC designation: 10P) was a {{powerful}} and long-lived annular tropical cyclone that affected several countries, particularly Vanuatu and Tonga, over a 16-day span in February 2012. The system was the second cyclone and the only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively quiet 2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Jasmine developed from an area of disturbed weather on 1February in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Initially, the storm moved towards the east and across the Cape York Peninsula. As it moved across the South Pacific, earlier existing wind shear conditions lessened, and Jasmine began to strengthen <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> rate. Steadily intensifying, Jasmine reached peak intensity on 8February as a Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, while beginning to show annular characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Clara, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Rubing, left {{flooding}} in the northern Philippines and southern China during September1981. An area of disturbed weather was first detected on September11 near Ponape. After moving westward, the system gradually became better organized and thunderstorm activity increased. On September16, the system attained tropical storm status. Two days later, Clara attained typhoon intensity and subsequently began to deepen <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> rate. On September19, Clara reached maximum intensity, before making landfall along {{the northern tip of}} Luzon. Clara steadily weakened after interacting with land, but by late on September20, Clara leveled off in intensity over the South China Sea. The next day, Clara moved ashore to the east-northeast of Hong Kong while still at typhoon intensity before rapidly dissipating over land.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis {{inherited}} his father's estate. He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop the coastal area {{on the east side}} of the stream. Bournemouth's first hotel, later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel, opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing. Bournemouth started to grow <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> rate as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton. Despite enormous investment, the town's share of the market remained modest. In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay. Granville was the author of The Spas of England, which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of the book, and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dot of August 1959 was at {{its time}} the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Hawaiian history. Dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawaii on August1. The storm was potentially a continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July24-27, but was never confirmed {{due to a lack}} of ship reports. Dot was quick to intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. By August3, Dot reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150mph (240km/h). Intensity leveled off afterwards as Dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August5, after which the hurricane weakened <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> clip. Dot made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August8.|$|E

5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> rate and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E
