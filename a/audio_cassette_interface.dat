5000|$|The SDK-51 MCS-51 System Design Kit {{released}} 1982 contained all of {{the components}} of a single-board computer based on Intel's 8051 single-chip microcomputer, clocked at 12 MHZ. SDK-51 used the external ROM version of the 8051 (8031). Provides a serial port which can support either RS232 or current loop configurations, and also an <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>interface</b> to save and load programs. Unlike some of Intel's other SDKs (e.g. SDK-85, SDK-86), the built-in monitor can only be controlled via the built-in QWERTY keyboard and cannot be commanded via the serial port. However, memory dumps and disassembly listings can be dumped out to the serial port, and it {{can also be used to}} transfer data to/from a connected PC in the form of Intel hex files.|$|E
5000|$|This {{processor}} provided better {{cost performance}} than conventional 8-bit microcomputers with its enhanced speed (about 200%) and reduced memory usage (about 60%). The unique {{features of the}} Lkit-16 were: (1) a simplified keyboard for assembler input, (2) console functions that allowed easy debugging, and (3) a built-in <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>interface</b> for data I/O. Through a simplified program input by a one-step assembler and implementation of Tiny BASIC that was popular among microcomputer users at that time, the Lkit-16 greatly contributed {{to the expansion of}} computer knowledge from would-be engineers to amateur users who were interested in microcomputers. Main unit price was \98,000.Main specifications:- CPU: MN1610 (clock rate of 2 MHz, 16-bit parallel processing)- ROM: 1KW (maximum 2KW)- RAM: 0.5KW (maximum 1KW)- I/O port: MN1630- Other specifications: Equipped with an audio cassette interface*1 ...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the memory capable of holding 16 presets, the Source features a 37-note keyboard, and two VCOs that can be selected among three waveforms and three octaves. Programmed presets can be saved to an <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>interface</b> to free up the onboard memory for additional new patches. The 24dB/octave VCF has parameters for keyboard tracking, cutoff frequency, resonance, and envelope amount. There are two ADSR envelope generators that can be set in single or multi trigger modes, one for the VCF {{and one for the}} VCA. For modulation, the Source features LFO and sample and hold. The unit also features a rudimentary sequencer. The Source was made in at least 2 versions the latter offering more voltage control options. A modification offered by Encore Electronics offers the addition of MIDI, increased memory and more sequence storage.|$|E
5000|$|The SYM-1 was a {{competitor}} {{to the popular}} MOS Technology KIM-1 system, with which it was compatible to a large extent. Compared to the KIM-1, enhancements included the ability to run on a single +5 volt power supply, an enhanced monitor ROM, three configurable ROM/EPROM sockets, RAM expandable on board to 4 kB, an RS-232 serial port, and a [...] "high speed" [...] (185 bytes/second, the KIM-1 supported about 8 bytes/second) <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> storage <b>interface.</b> It also featured on-board buffer circuits to ease interfacing to [...] "high voltage or high current" [...] devices.|$|R

50|$|The first Apple II {{computers}} {{went on sale}} on June 10, 1977 with a MOS Technology 6502 (later Synertek) microprocessor {{running at}} 1.023 MHz, 4 KB of RAM, an <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>interface</b> for loading programs and storing data, and the Integer BASIC programming language built into the ROMs. The video controller displayed 40 columns by 24 lines of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with NTSC composite video output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set {{by way of a}} separate RF modulator. The original retail price of the computer was US$1298(with 4 kB of RAM) and US$2638 (with the maximum 48 kB of RAM). To reflect the computer's color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. The earliest Apple IIs were assembled in Silicon Valley, and later in Texas; printed circuit boards were manufactured in Ireland and Singapore.|$|E

The earliest Apple IIs were assembled in Silicon Valley, and later in Texas; printed circuit boards were manufactured in Ireland and Singapore. The first computers went on sale on June 10, 1977 with a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor running at 1.023 MHz, two game paddles (no longer bundled as of 1980 because they violated FCC regulations), 4 kB of RAM, an <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> <b>interface</b> for loading programs and storing data, and the Integer BASIC programming language built into the ROMs. The video controller displays 24 lines by 40 columns of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 20h to 5Fh) text on the screen, with NTSC composite video output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set {{by way of a}} separate RF modulator.

To reflect the computer's color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing has rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. Perhaps most significantly, the Apple II was a catalyst for personal computers across many industries; responsible for opening the doors to software marketed at consumers.|$|E

Thesis. Yogyakarta: Graduate School, State University of Yogyakarta. This research is limed {{to find out}} the effectivieness of using: (1) <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder media (2) computer media (3) the conventional media in story listening learned Indonesian language children. This research was an experiment research, with Randomized Pretest- Postest Control Group Design. In this research, observation was done to three learning groups, i. e. the first experiment group that was given a treatment using <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder media, the second experiment group using computer media, and the control group using convensional media. Population of this research was all five grade students of SDN 02 Kebondalem Pemalang Regency, of which the sample were VA, VB and VC. The research instrument was story listening test with of Alpha 0. 826. Technique analyse data use continued One-way Anova with Scheffe test. The results of this research show that: (1) there is {{a significant difference in the}} effectiveness between using media computer and conventional media in story listening learned Indonesian language children, [(p) = 0. 005, Î± = 0. 05]; (2) there is no significant differenced in the effectiveness between using media computer and conventional media in story listening learned Indonesian language children, ((p) = 0. 028, Î± = 0. 05); (3) there is a significant difference in the effectiveness between using <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder and computer media in story listening learned Indonesian language children, <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder media, computer media, the convensional media in story listening learned Indonesian language children, [(p) = 0. 028, Î± = 0. 05]; and (4) there is a significant difference in the effectiveness among using of <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder media, computer media, the convensional media in story listening learned Indonesian language children, (F cos = 20. 809 > F tabel = 3. 15, Î± = 0. 05). These show that computer media are better than <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder media, <b>audio</b> <b>cassette</b> recorder media are not better than conventional media, and computer media are the most effective media in story listening learned Indonesian language children.
