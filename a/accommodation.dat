30|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} why some people who could benefit from workplace <b>accommodations</b> do not receive them, {{it is useful to}} consider the process by which workplace <b>accommodations</b> are provided to employees. One path is that an employer observes that a worker has a disability and offers accommodations; workers who would benefit from the <b>accommodations</b> would accept while those who would not benefit from the <b>accommodations</b> would decline. In this framework, workers with unobservable disabilities who need <b>accommodations</b> or those whose employers do not offer <b>accommodations</b> would not receive them and likely leave their job due to an inaccessible workplace. A second path of receiving <b>accommodations</b> is that the worker asks the employer for <b>accommodations</b> and the employer complies. In this case, only workers who need <b>accommodations</b> in order to stay in the workplace would request them and those that do not need <b>accommodations</b> will not. However, in this framework, workers who need but do not ask for <b>accommodations</b> or those whose employers do not comply with their request will not receive <b>accommodations</b> and likely leave their job due to the workplace no being accessible. In both of these scenarios, increasing workplace <b>accommodations</b> (either by encouraging workers to ask for <b>accommodations,</b> encouraging employers provide <b>accommodations,</b> or providing <b>accommodations</b> directly to workers through programs such as VR) would increase employment for people with disabilities.|$|R

30|$|Although the {{majority}} of studies indicate a positive perception of testing <b>accommodations,</b> some research asserts that variability exists in how students perceive the use of <b>accommodations</b> (Bolt et al. 2011; Kurth and Mellard 2006; Rickey 2005).

40|$|National Assessments {{seeks to}} include all {{students}} in the sampling frame from which students are selected to participate in the assessment. However, some students with disabilities (SWD) are either unable to take tests under standard testing conditions or are unable to perform at their best under standard testing conditions. In many testing situations, <b>accommodations</b> to standard testing conditions are given to SWD to improve measurement of their knowledge, skills and abilities. This practice is in the pursuit of more valid test score interpretation; however, it produces the ultimate psychometric oxymoron – an accommodated standardized test. In this paper, I review validity issues related to test <b>accommodations</b> and summarize some empirical studies in this area. The focus of the paper is on <b>accommodations</b> for reading tests because some types of <b>accommodations</b> on these tests are particularly controversial. The specific <b>accommodations</b> emphasized in this review are extended time and oral (read-aloud) <b>accommodations.</b> A review of professional standards, validity theory, and recent empirical research in this area suggests that extended time <b>accommodations</b> may be appropriate for reading tests, but read-aloud <b>accommodations</b> are likely to alter the construct measured.
