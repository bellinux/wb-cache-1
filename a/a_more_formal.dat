5|$|At age fourteen, Pascu's voice changed. He {{was still}} a soprano in the choir, but had to use his head voice. As a high school student, Pascu had to enlist in the Union of Communist Youth (UTC), the Romanian {{communist}} regime compulsory youth organization. In 1976, he enrolled at the Agnita High School, which later became the Agro-Industrial High School. The same year, he gave up handball and began <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> study of guitar music, using the Maria Boeru textbook as his guide. He debuted as an amateur actor in 1977, with a school theater performance at the Agnita House of Culture.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{official}} student government during the first few decades at Georgia Tech, the ANAK society acted as an unofficial student government and proposed an Honor Code, modeled on that of West Point's, in 1908. ANAK worked to set up <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> organization, the Student Council (later the Student Government Association), in 1922, at which point it relinquished any decision-making privileges it had over the student body.|$|E

5|$|The {{people of}} Uttar Pradesh dress {{in a variety}} of {{traditional}} and Western styles. Traditional styles of dress include colourful draped garments—such as sari for women and dhoti or lungi for men—and tailored clothes such as salwar kameez for women and kurta-pyjama for men. Men often sport head-gear like topi or pagri. Sherwani is <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> male dress and is frequently worn along with chooridar on festive occasions. European-style trousers and shirts are also common among the men.|$|E
5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E
5|$|By now the beachhead {{had been}} reinforced; the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had all arrived during the day. Communication {{between the two}} sides {{resulted}} in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> truce on 24 May. At 07:30 all firing ceased and parties moved out to bury the dead. This lasted until 16:30 when the truce ended and both sides returned to their own lines. Firing recommenced at 16:45. The Turkish commanders now realised just what would be required to capture the beachhead. Instead of trying again they left two of their depleted divisions, the 16th and 19th, to man their lines while the others were withdrawn. The still independent 77th Infantry Regiment also remained behind, in the same position covering the south.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while {{mustering}} the militia, finally set {{out from}} Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, {{within striking distance of}} a number of native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (rice pudding with raisins was called Bête Noire a la Bolshevik).|$|E

5|$|In {{diplomatic}} {{talks with}} the Ho-Chunks {{at the close of}} the war, General Atkinson promised that the U.S. government would look into their grievances in the lead mining region. Thomas McKenney requested military aid to evict American miners who were trespassing on Ho-Chunk land, but after the war, settlers poured into the region in unprecedented numbers, and U.S. officials proved to be unable or unwilling to stem the tide. By January 1828, there were as many as 10,000 illegal settlers on Ho-Chunk land, including militia general Henry Dodge, who established a mining camp after the war and boasted that the U.S. Army could not make him leave. Having no other options, on August 25, 1828, the Ho-Chunks signed a provisional treaty with the United States, agreeing to sell the land occupied by the miners in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> treaty to be held later.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residents}} of the western frontier petitioned against passage of the whiskey excise. When that failed, some western Pennsylvanians organized extralegal conventions to advocate repeal of the law. Opposition to the tax was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties: Allegheny, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland. A preliminary meeting held on July 27, 1791 at Redstone Old Fort in Fayette County called for the selection of delegates to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> assembly, which convened in Pittsburgh in early September 1791. The Pittsburgh convention was dominated by moderates such as Hugh Henry Brackenridge, who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence. The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S House of Representatives, both located in Philadelphia. As {{a result of this}} and other petitions, the excise law was modified in May 1792. Changes included a 1-cent reduction in the tax that was advocated by William Findley, a congressman from western Pennsylvania, but the new excise law was still unsatisfactory to many westerners.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 1600, Kepler met Tycho Brahe and {{his assistants}} Franz Tengnagel and Longomontanus at Benátky nad Jizerou (35km from Prague), {{the site where}} Tycho's new {{observatory}} was being constructed. Over {{the next two months}} he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access. Kepler planned to test his theory from Mysterium Cosmographicum based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to two years (since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use). With the help of Johannes Jessenius, Kepler attempted to negotiate <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on April 6. Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family.|$|E

5|$|The Bastille {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a prison and a royal fortress under both Henry IV and his son, Louis XIII. When Henry clamped down on a Spanish-backed plot among the senior French nobility in 1602, for example, he detained the ringleader Charles Gontaut, the Duke of Biron, in the Bastille, and had him executed in the courtyard. Louis XIII's chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, is credited with beginning the modern transformation of the Bastille into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>formal</b> organ of the French state, further increasing its structured use as a state prison. Richelieu broke with Henry IV's tradition of the Bastille's captain being a member of the French aristocracy, typically a Marshal of France such as François de Bassompierre, Charles d'Albert or Nicolas de L'Hospital, and instead appointed Père Joseph's brother to run the facility. The first surviving documentary records of prisoners at the Bastille also date from this period.|$|E
