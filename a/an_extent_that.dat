The elder Symeon was not an ordained priest, but a simple monk who was considered holy by many people. The younger Symeon was extremely zealous in his practices and in following his teacher—to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> the abbot of the monastery insisted that Symeon leave {{after only a few}} months.|$|E
5|$|Burial 6 was a cist located {{under the}} first chamber of the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). It had been heavily looted, to <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> it was not {{possible}} to determine if the scattered human remains of at least four people belonged to one burial or several. The bones belonged to two children and two young adult females and fragments of ceramic offerings were also identified.|$|E

5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed blessing. In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded {{by the introduction of}} the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} memorable {{match between}} the two sides came on 1 February 1958, when they met in a league fixture at Highbury. It was the last league game that United played before the Munich air disaster five days later, which claimed the lives of eight of their players and saw two other players injured to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> they never played again. United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet. Five of the United players who would lose their lives {{as a result of the}} crash took to the field in the game – captain and full-back Roger Byrne, right-half Eddie Colman, centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Edwards and centre-forward Taylor.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the then megas doux, Michael Stryphnos, was accused by Niketas Choniates of {{enriching}} himself by selling off the equipment {{of the imperial}} fleet, while by the early 13th century {{the authority of the}} central government had weakened to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces. The general atmosphere was one of lawlessness, which enabled men like Leo Sgouros in southern Greece and the imperial governor of Samos, Pegonites, to use their ships for their own purposes, launching raids of their own. Even Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195–1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|By December 1974, Lennon and Pang {{considered}} {{buying a}} house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, {{who claimed to have}} found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her that his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen is {{recognized}} as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include {{the handling of the}} Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E

It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices {{in the majority}} were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only take one year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> the running plate was the only component recognisable to the casual observer.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced {{on a number of}} lines with automatic sliding doors {{along the length of the}} carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E

5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed to such <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his book would sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies.
