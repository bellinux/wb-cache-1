25|$|The {{security}} {{of these resources}} is impacted by riparian conflicts. Several hundred million cubic meters of groundwater in the West Bank Mountain Aquifer are disputed between Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> Under the 1995 Interim Agreement {{as part of the}} Oslo Peace Process Israel provided 52 million cubic meters of water to the Palestinians in 2011, but prevents them from drilling new wells in the Mountain Aquifer. The surface water of the Jordan River remains disputed with Syria, Lebanon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> Only with Jordan was Israel able to reach an agreement on the sharing of water resources in 1995 as part of the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty. 48 million cubic meters of water per year were provided to Israel under the Peace Treaty in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{on various}} points of view, a one-state {{solution}} to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict {{is presented as a}} situation in which Israel would ostensibly lose its character as a Jewish state <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> would fail to achieve their national independence within a two-state solution or, alternatively, as the best, most just, and only way to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{element of}} the party's politics was that it advocated cooperation with Israel. While there were several other movements on the Christian side in Lebanon that cooperated with Israel during the war, the LNR was the only organization openly and ideologically committed to this, regarding a Lebanese-Israeli axis as the best protection against Arabism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b>|$|E
25|$|The book's second {{central theme}} {{revolves}} around {{the connection between the}} Arab-Jews <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> Shenhav's claim is that the Iraqi government's nationalization of the Iraqi Jews' property served as a governmental excuse for Israel's keeping of the Palestinian refugees' property following their exodus. Israel could thus argue for an interrelatedness between the two and claim that a population and capital exchange took place.|$|E

25|$|Mearsheimer {{was also}} {{critical}} of Israel's offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip {{that began in}} December 2008.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, an {{official}} Lebanese government report stated that the total number of casualties for these battles was put at 3,781 dead and 6,787 injured in the fighting between Amal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> Furthermore, the number of Palestinians killed in inter-factional clashes between pro-Syrian and pro-Arafat organizations was around 2,000. The real number is probably higher because thousands of Palestinians were not registered in Lebanon and the blockade meant that no officials could access the camps, so that all the casualties could not be counted.|$|E

On 29 October, the second stage of the Palestinian prisoners' release was completed as 26 prisoners were released.|$|E
