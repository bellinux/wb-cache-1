5|$|Bézout's {{identity}} {{states that}} the greatest common divisor g of two integers a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> can be represented as a linear sum of the original two numbers a <b>and</b> <b>b.</b> In other words, it is always possible to find integers s and t such that g = sa + tb.|$|E
5|$|Let g = gcd(a,b). Since a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> {{are both}} {{multiples}} of g, {{they can be}} written a=mg and b=ng, {{and there is no}} larger number G>g for which this is true. The natural numbers m and n must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of m and n to make g greater. Thus, any other number c that divides both a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> must also divide g. The greatest common divisor g of a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> is the unique (positive) common divisor of a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> that is divisible by any other common divisor c.|$|E
5|$|The A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A <b>and</b> <b>B.</b> A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B <b>and</b> <b>B</b> equivalent to a subset of A, then A <b>and</b> <b>B</b> are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E

5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a <b>and</b> <b>b</b> is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a <b>and</b> <b>b.</b> Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E
