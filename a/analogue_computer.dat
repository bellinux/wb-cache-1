By the end of July the dish surface was completed, and first light was on 2 August 1957; the telescope did a drift scan across the Milky Way at 160MHz, with the bowl at the zenith. The telescope was first controlled from the control room on 9 October 1957, by a purpose-built <b>analogue</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E

25|$|An analog {{computer}} or <b>analogue</b> <b>computer</b> {{is a form}} of computer that uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model the problem being solved. In contrast, digital computers represent varying quantities symbolically, as their numerical values change. As an {{analog computer}} does not use discrete values, but rather continuous values, processes cannot be reliably repeated with exact equivalence, as they can with Turing machines. Unlike digital signal processing, analog computers do not suffer from the quantization noise, but are limited by analog noise.|$|E
25|$|In an Engine Management System (EMS), {{electronics}} control {{fuel delivery}} and ignition timing. Primary sensors {{on the system}} are crankshaft angle (crankshaft or Top Dead Center (TDC) position), airflow into the engine and throttle position. The circuitry determines which cylinder needs fuel and how much, opens the requisite injector to deliver it, then causes a spark {{at the right moment}} to burn it. Early EMS systems used an <b>analogue</b> <b>computer</b> to accomplish this, but as embedded systems dropped in price and became fast enough {{to keep up with the}} changing inputs at high revolutions, digital systems started to appear.|$|E
25|$|By 1865, the Smithsonian Institution began {{a catalog}} of current {{scientific}} papers, which became the International Catalogue of Scientific Papers in 1902. The following year the Royal Society began publication of its Catalogue of Papers in London. In 1868, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S. W. Soule produced the first practical typewriter. By 1872 Lord Kelvin devised an <b>analogue</b> <b>computer</b> to predict the tides, and by 1875 Frank Stephen Baldwin was granted the first US patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions. Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison invented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and the American Library Association was founded in Philadelphia. In 1879 Index Medicus was first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, with John Shaw Billings as librarian, and later the library issues Index Catalogue, which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.|$|E

A particularity of the models is combination of continuous internal processes with discrete set of output states. The modeling of the system by classical <b>analogue</b> <b>computers</b> was offered long times ago, {{but now it is}} not very effectively in comparison with modern digital computers.

25|$|An {{important}} {{advance in}} analog computing was {{the development of}} the first fire-control systems for long range ship gunlaying. When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer a simple matter of calculating the proper aim point, given the flight times of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect, weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying. In 1912, British engineer Arthur Pollen developed the first electrically powered mechanical <b>analogue</b> <b>computer</b> (called at the time the Argo Clock). It was used by the Imperial Russian Navy in World War I. The alternative Dreyer Table fire control system was fitted to British capital ships by mid-1916.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Columbia-Princeton {{developed}} the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer, the first programmable synthesizer. This device {{was actually a}} special-purpose, digitally controlled <b>analogue</b> <b>computer,</b> {{it was the first}} electronic music synthesizer in which a large range of sounds could not only be produced and sequenced but also be programmed by the user. This programming feature had a profound influence on the nature of Babbitt's electronic music. Prominent composers such as Vladimir Ussachevsky, Otto Luening, Milton Babbitt, Charles Wuorinen, Halim El-Dabh, Bülent Arel and Mario Davidovsky used the RCA Synthesizer extensively in various compositions. One of the most influential composers associated with {{the early years of the}} studio was Egypt's Halim El-Dabh who, after having {{developed the}} earliest known electronic tape music in 1944, became more famous for Leiyla and the Poet, a 1959 series of electronic compositions that stood out for its immersion and seamless fusion of electronic and folk music, in contrast to the more mathematical approach used by serial composers of the time such as Babbitt. El-Dabh's Leiyla and the Poet, released as part of the album Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in 1961, would be cited as a strong influence by a number of musicians, ranging from Neil Rolnick, Charles Amirkhanian and Alice Shields to rock musicians Frank Zappa and The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band.|$|E
500|$|For a short while, Cauer {{worked for}} the Wired Radio Company in Newark, New Jersey but then {{returned}} to Göttingen {{with the intention of}} building a fast <b>analogue</b> <b>computer</b> there. [...] However, he was unable to obtain funding due to the depression.|$|E

50|$|After World War II {{predictors}} {{changed from}} being electro-mechanical <b>analogue</b> <b>computers</b> to digital computers, but {{by this time}} heavy anti-aircraft guns {{had been replaced by}} missiles, but electronics enabled smaller guns to adopt fully automated laying.|$|R
5000|$|The {{solution}} included {{was based}} on <b>analogue</b> <b>computers</b> with a newly developed hydraulically controlled director platform and a frequency agile Ku-band fire control radar, Ceros.

500|$|The main guns of the Admiral-class {{ships were}} {{controlled}} from {{either of the}} two fire-control directors. The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore-top on the foremast. 'B' turret could also control all the main gun turrets while 'X' turret could control the rear guns. Data from a [...] rangefinder in the armoured hood were input into a Mk V Dreyer Fire Control Table located in the Transmitting Station (TS) on the platform deck where they were converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data were also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The fore-top was equipped with a [...] rangefinder. Each turret was provided with a thirty-foot rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof and a Dumaresq <b>analogue</b> <b>computer</b> for local fire-control.|$|E
500|$|The {{self-propelled}} {{anti-aircraft gun}} began development in 1969 {{to provide this}} type of vehicle to the French Army and for export. Although ultimately none were ordered for France, in 1975 Saudi Arabia ordered an improved version, denominated the AMX-30SA. Developed to defend against low-altitude attacks, the system included two Hispano-Suiza [...] 831 A automatic guns, coupled to an Oeil-noir fire control system. This system had already been installed on the AMX-13, {{in lieu of a}} heavier chassis, using a turret designated the S 401 A. Although this particular vehicle began production in 1962, the appearance of the AMX-30 offered a larger chassis to which the S 401 A turret could be mounted on, providing superior mobility. The heavier AMX-30 also provided a more stable platform for the guns, and allowed the system to carry much more ammunition (1,200 rounds, as compared to the 600 carried by the AMX-13 version). The guns were designed to fire in 5-round or 15-round bursts, with a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. They were controlled by an <b>analogue</b> <b>computer,</b> receiving information from a Doppler radar, which could be folded into an armoured box when not in use to protect from damage. The fire control depended on visual tracking, and so could only work in daylight and clear weather.|$|E
