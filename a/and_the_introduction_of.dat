5|$|After the {{reconversion}} of Scandinavian Scotland in {{the tenth}} century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant {{religion of the}} kingdom.

5|$|Nearly 500 {{years of}} intense contact between {{speakers}} of Nahuatl and speakers of Spanish, {{combined with the}} minority status of Nahuatl and the higher prestige associated with Spanish has caused many changes in modern Nahuatl varieties, {{with large numbers of}} words borrowed from Spanish into Nahuatl, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> new syntactic constructions and grammatical categories.|$|E

5|$|The forests were {{dominated}} by birds, {{and the lack of}} mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi, kakapo, weka and takahē evolving flightlessness. The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> rats, ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle.|$|E

5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> exotic species.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, {{not only was the}} Napoleonic Code {{retained}} by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec.

5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona's Camp Nou is {{the largest}} stadium in Europe. The club's highest home {{attendance}} was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.

5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} the extinction of the dodo is 1662, but some possible sightings had been made as late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical analysis by Roberts and Solow found that the extinction of the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off later than the dodo. The IUCN uses an extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> mammals that ate the birds and their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was {{stimulated by the}} spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This {{led the way to}} a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{development}} for the game began with a small team in 2009. During this phase, the unique gameplay mechanic of Link merging onto walls was prototyped. However, development suffered several setbacks with production of the game ceasing entirely in late 2010, as core team members were reassigned to different projects. A year later, development restarted and after several failed pitches to series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, the game entered full production in 2012. Changing the established conventions of the series became a goal for the game's designers; {{this led to a}} change in the game's structure, allowing players to tackle and clear the majority of dungeons in any order they choose, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the item rental system.|$|E
