5|$|I find {{it quite}} nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you write}} songs, you don't really think about performing in a video. I think it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E

Like when he died, it was just weird to think <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> shows or recording without him around, {{even if he was}} no longer in the band. He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|U2 {{contacted}} the show <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> a guest spot, {{rather than the}} other way around. The writers immediately wrote them one, in case they changed their minds. The band's head of Principal Management Paul McGuinness and Susie Smith, an employee of Principal Management, also make brief appearances in the episode. U2's drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. appears in the episode, although he has no dialogue. Steve Martin guest stars as Ray Patterson.|$|E
5|$|Sales fell to {{just under}} 14,000 by issue 12, and {{continued}} to fall during the series' second year until the 24th issue sold just over 9,000 copies. In December 2015, the 35th issue sold an estimated 6,500 copies. According to Dave Carter, a writer for Comics Beat, this is a typical sales pattern for a modern comic. The series concluded with issue 47 in February 2017, which had estimated sales of about 6,300. Because {{of the decline in}} Revivals sales, Seeley expressed skepticism <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> another project of similar length in the future.|$|E

5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
5|$|In February 1905, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier introduced legislation to create two new provinces—Alberta and Saskatchewan—from the Northwest Territories. Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same non-partisan basis as the Territories had been, {{it was expected that}} the Liberal Laurier would recommend a Liberal to serve as Lieutenant-Governor, and it was further assumed that the Lieutenant-Governor would call on a Liberal to form the new province's first government. Oliver was the province's most prominent Liberal, but had just been named federal Minister of the Interior, and was not interested in leaving Ottawa. Talbot was Laurier's preferred candidate, but he expected to be appointed to the Senate and found the prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta. Both men supported Rutherford, though neither was enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> so. In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the Alberta Liberals selected Rutherford as their first leader. A final barrier was removed a few days later when Haultain, who was a Conservative federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a coalition government, announced that he would stay in Regina to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives. On September 2, Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta.|$|E

5|$|On {{his way to}} a meeting, Webber {{goes through}} a red light, and collides with another vehicle, {{resulting}} in him becoming T-boned. Webber is taken to the neighboring Mercy West Hospital, where he is treated by former colleague Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and subsequently discharged. Ferguson finally agrees to the surgery, after constant pleads from Lexie, and makes a start to physical therapy. Lexie returns home to see her sister Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her new husband Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) having sex in the kitchen. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is at home, begging her husband Karev to spend time with her, but he dismisses her. At Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s apartment, his girlfriend Lexie has moved in, and his bisexual ex-girlfriend Torres walks in on Sloan in the shower. Lexie expresses her concern to Torres <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> this, and she apologizes. Robbins confronts Shepherd, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery, and asks him to run an expensive test to see if Andy has Tethered spinal cord syndrome, which reveals that he has it, and it is reversed through surgery. Stevens notices the girl Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio), sitting outside the hospital, and tells her to go get a life, because O'Malley did not save her so she could be miserable. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens unites with Karev, and Webber announces that Seattle Grace will be merging with Mercy West.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th February 1915, the Third Squadron of the Japanese Navy {{received}} a telegram from the Military Attaché Araki Jiro via Ma-Kung in the Formosa Straits (the main {{base of the}} Squadron) requesting for Japanese help. The Otowa and Tsushima were sent immediately for Singapore. Although help was sent and well received by the British Navy in Singapore, the Japanese Navy was hesitant <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> so initially. Commanding Officer of the Third Squadron, Rear Admiral Tsuchiya Mitsukane had apparently expressed his displeasure in dispatching help as he believed that being a signatory of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan should not interfere {{in the internal affairs}} of another country without attaching collateral conditions. Also, Tsuchiya had recalled how a British ship once anchored at Chilung refused to help put down a Taiwanese revolt on Japan. Seeing that Tsuchiya had no choice but to follow orders from the Japanese Government and Naval Headquarters, Tsuchiya secretly advised his land force not to kill or wound any sepoy intentionally but to simply encourage them to surrender as the former had no enmity with the latter. According to The General Staff of the British Military Headquarters, “in reality the Japanese did not do much…and it was found desirable to disband them as early as possible”. However, from the point of view of Japanese politicians, Japan’s entry into the mutiny was also a form of projecting Japanese power and strength in the region.|$|E

25|$|However {{most people}} have little idea how to go <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> many of these things.

25|$|Nonetheless, {{there is}} some degree of {{empiricism}} and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes {{with the use of}} a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> the proof. For example, the Collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about 2.88×1018. The Riemann hypothesis has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the zeta function. Neither of these statements is considered proved.|$|E
25|$|Another {{spill-over}} {{from the}} gridiron, the Panthers' third-most frequently-played opponent is the Penn State Nittany Lions, {{whom they have}} played 147 times. Penn State leads the all-time series, 75-72, but has lost the past seven matchups. They played at least once every year from 1935–82 and briefly rekindled the rivalry {{at the turn of}} the century, playing annually from 2000-05. Since that time, they’ve gone against each other just twice, in 2013 as part of the Big Ten-ACC Challenge, and in the 2016 Never Forget Tribute Classic. They are not scheduled to renew the series in the foreseeable future, though there have been significant talks between the universities <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E
