5|$|While Australian artists embraced {{modernism and}} {{addressed}} the city, Rix Nicholas focussed on representing <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> ideal. In France in the 1920s, Rix Nicholas had entertained Roy de Maistre, {{one of the}} first Australians to experiment with abstractionism, and enthusiastically asked him to share more about his 'colour-music theory'; however when modernism confronted Australian art in the 1920s and 1930s, Rix Nicholas sided against it.|$|E
5|$|Whittle and Wysocki conclude, {{from the}} {{skeletal}} and dental analyses, that {{the lifestyles of}} the people who were to be interred in the cromlech either continued to be one of hunting and gathering or, more likely, <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> life of herding, rather than one of agrarian-based farming.|$|E
5|$|A shield {{in front}} of a mantle or cloak may be found among bishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches. However, some Eastern ecclesiastical {{variations}} omit the mantle but retain the mitre, cross and staff. Maronite bishops traditionally display <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> staff behind the shield, topped with a globe and cross or a cross within a globe. Eastern Catholic bishops may follow the Roman style with a low crowned, wide brimmed ecclesiastical hat, although the shield itself is often rendered in a Byzantine artistic style, and a mitre if present would be in the appropriate liturgical style.|$|E

Salary compensation for the paid local church pastor, if available, is determined by the local church.|$|R

5|$|Besides the Holy See, another Catholic see has {{the right}} to bear the triple tiara in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of Lisbon. The title of Patriarch of Lisbon was created in 1716 and is held by the {{archbishop}} of Lisbon since 1740. While the coat of arms of the Holy See combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a processional cross and <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> staff.|$|E
5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys {{has led to the}} introduction of crops such as rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E
5|$|In Eakins' oeuvre, The Swimming Hole was {{immediately}} {{preceded by a}} number of similar works on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from the Parthenon marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 Arcadia, a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> landscape.|$|E

Educated at Hale School, he studied to be an accountant and was practising on <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> property in the Kimberley when war broke out in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Corded Ware culture, in {{existence}} in central Europe between 3000 and 2000 BCE, originated most likely from Proto-Indo-European nomadic {{people of the}} Black Sea steppes. It was <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> culture at least in its early stages, {{for the most part}} lacking permanent settlements and known primarily from the burial grounds (a large one with many richly furnished graves was discovered in Złota near Sandomierz). They moved together with their herds of cattle, sheep, goats and horses along the river valleys of southern Poland, but also engaged in flint mining and manufacturing of tools and weapons for their own use and trade.|$|E
5|$|The historiography of Vithoba and his cult {{is an area}} of {{continuing}} debate, even regarding his name. Various Indologists have proposed a prehistory for Vithoba worship where he was previously: a hero stone, <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> deity, a manifestation of Shiva, a Jain saint, or even all of these at various times for various devotees. Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are likewise debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|Upon Carey's {{death in}} March 1889, Avondale was {{inherited}} by his 16-year-old grand nephew William Herbert deLisle. deLisle arrived {{and took up}} residence there in 1893, and assumed the land title in 1894. Avondale had been <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> property until deLisle's arrival, {{over the next ten}} years sections of the estate were sold off to fund its development. During this period, the house was expanded and the stable built, which included 20 horse stalls with hollow walls and an overhead loft. The hollow walls enable feed from the loft to gravitate directly to the feed bins in each stall.|$|E
5|$|A demon {{comes to}} steal the ring from Thalaba, but he is stopped by the young boy. This allows Thalaba to demand {{information}} about the sorcerers and why his family was killed. Time passes and Thalaba settles into <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> life at Irem and plans to marry Moath's daughter, Oneiza. However, Thalaba decides that his duty prohibits him from such actions, and he leaves to fulfill his destiny. However, the sorcerer Lobaba tricks Thalaba and tries {{to steal the}} ring. After many failed attempts, Lobaba tries to convince Thalaba to harness the ring's magic power, which would bring Thalaba harm. Instead, Thalaba argues {{against the use of}} magic in general and realises that Lobaba is evil. Although Thalaba attempts to kill Lobaba and fails by the sorcerer's magic, a storm comes and destroys the sorcerer.|$|E
5|$|According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, {{author of}} A Social History of the Deccan, Vithoba was first worshipped as <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> god {{as early as}} the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo {{iconography}} is similar to Bir Kuar, the cattle-god of the Ahirs of Bihar, who is now also associated with Krishna. Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva, like most other pastoral gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society.|$|E
5|$|During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, {{and after}} {{returning}} to civilian life he took some time before feeling ready to compose new works. He revised some earlier pieces, and {{turned his attention to}} other musical activities. In 1919 he accepted an invitation from Hugh Allen, who had succeeded Parry as director, to teach composition at the RCM; he remained on the faculty of the college for the next twenty years. In 1921 he succeeded Allen as conductor of the Bach Choir, London. It was not until 1922 that he produced a major new composition, <b>A</b> <b>Pastoral</b> Symphony; the work was given its first performance in London in May conducted by Adrian Boult and its American premiere in New York in December conducted by the composer.|$|E
5|$|Peggy Rockman {{had three}} older sisters, {{all of whom}} married Jampu Jakamarra, to whom Peggy herself would also later be married. Her family first settled {{alongside}} white Australians — a couple mining gold in the Tanami Desert — when she was aged between six and eight. While still a child herself, she worked caring for the mining family's children, during which time she became a proficient English speaker. After the mine was abandoned, Peggy Rockman's family returned to a nomadic existence in the region, before settling for a time at <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> station called Gordon Downs. Around 1952, the family {{was taken by the}} government's Native Affairs Branch to a new settlement called Lajamanu, in the central desert west of Tennant Creek, Northern Territory. There, Peggy Rockman was required to work full-time in the settlement's kitchens, being paid with meals, and occasionally also with rations. At the settlement, she had three children with Jampu Jakamarra.|$|E

The {{ceremony}} {{was attended by}} numerous political figures and sultans from Batavia, Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, as well as clergy from Malang and Lampung; Soegijapranata's first act as vicar was to issue <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> letter with Willekens that outlined the historical background {{that led to his}} appointment, including Pope BenedictXV's apolistic letter Maximum Illud, which called for more local clergy, and Pope PiusXI and Pope PiusXII's efforts to appoint more pastors and bishops from native ethnic groups worldwide. Soegijapranata began working on the Church hierarchy in the region, establishing new parishes.|$|E
5|$|The steppe {{societies}} of Inner Asia, whose climate favoured <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> economy, stood {{in stark contrast}} to the Chinese mode of development. As animal herds are migratory by nature, communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads. According to the influential Mongolist Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model. As the steppe population grew, pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population, and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards. For these needs, the nomads had to turn to the settled societies to get grains, metal tools, and luxury goods, which they could not produce by themselves. If denied trade by the settled peoples, the nomads would resort to raiding or even conquest.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In <b>a</b> <b>pastoral</b> interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
