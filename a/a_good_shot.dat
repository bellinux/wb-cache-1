5|$|Ernest learned cavalry {{drill and}} tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the Queen's Light Dragoons, and {{proved to be}} an {{excellent}} horseman as well as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> After only two months of training, Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} a runner, heavyweight boxer, rugby footballer, billiards player and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> A {{commission}} agent in business, he was an amateur musician and an exhibitor of roses. He died in Hull Infirmary, after falling from an express train near Brough, aged 48. He is buried in Hornsea Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|James Butler Hickok {{was born}} May 27, 1837, in Homer, Illinois (present-day Troy Grove, Illinois) to William Alonzo Hickok, a farmer and abolitionist, {{and his wife}} Polly Butler. His father {{was said to have}} used the family house, now demolished, as a station on the Underground Railroad. He was the fourth of six children. William Hickok died in 1852, when James was 15. Hickok was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> from a young age and was {{recognized}} locally as an outstanding marksman with a pistol. Photographs of Hickok appear to depict dark hair, but all contemporaneous descriptions affirm that it was red.|$|E

6000|$|... "May be not," [...] said Fred. [...] "Webb's <b>a</b> d----d <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> in <b>a</b> gallery; {{but may be}} he won't {{allow for}} the wind on the sod; but it'll be as well to have the sawbones." ...|$|R
6000|$|PICKERING: [...] Hooray! hooray! <b>A</b> grand <b>good</b> <b>shot,</b> and Teddy Colton's down: It {{burst in}} thunderbolts upon his crown! Larry O'Crocker drops his pick and flies, And {{deafening}} odors scream along the skies! Pelt 'em some more.|$|R
25|$|Likewise {{there are}} {{different}} versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods. Downes recounted that Homer took to sea in a boat, accompanied by {{a man with a}} double-barreled shotgun, and studied the movements of birds as they were shot. In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at Prouts Neck while his neighbor Will Googins, fired blank charges in his direction from a rowboat offshore. However, Homer was already familiar with this angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted Defiance, a Civil War subject of a soldier being shot at, and in 1892 <b>A</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Shot,</b> Adirondacks, which shows the puff of distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground; the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of Right and Left.|$|E
25|$|The Cougars {{opened the}} season at home, hosting the Northern Illinois Huskies, who played a very {{physical}} game, with the visitors from the Mid-American Conference racking up 14 fouls and 3 yellow cards. In the 17th minute, the normally stingy SIUE defense turned over the ball on a straight giveaway that NIU's Molina took and passed to Voss, who fired a booming shot from 25 yards out that left Dal Santo no chance for a save, and the Huskies took a 1–0 lead that held through halftime. The Cougars returned from the break fired up and working hard for a shot. When the Huskies were called for a handball inside the 18 yard box in the 57th minute, Ledbetter stepped up and fired in the penalty shot to tie the score. For the remainder of regulation time and through two extra time periods, the two offenses jockeyed to find <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot,</b> and the defenses turned away attack after attack. After 110 minutes, the game ended in a 1–1 draw.|$|E
25|$|Player {{and team}} {{strategy}} {{varies depending on}} the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents {{to reduce the number of}} directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's some {{of those}} confounded greasers!" [...] cried Frank Andrews, as he, too, arose and armed himself. He had a repeating rifle, and it was known to Dave and Roger that he was <b>an</b> {{exceptionally}} <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{fairly small}} winger and hard worker. A quick skater with sharp movement. Has <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and does well in playmaking. Useful as an {{offensive}} player, especially as a finisher. Sometimes criticized of embellishment when drawing penalties.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{chance of}} hitting him is not great," [...] Harry said. [...] "I am not <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> even on my feet; but {{sitting in my}} saddle I {{do not think it}} likely I should get {{anywhere}} near him." ...|$|R
500|$|Sweatt {{is known}} as an {{offensive}} defenseman, possessing <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and a tendency to join plays deep in the opposing zone. He has {{played the role of}} powerplay [...] "quarterback" [...] on teams throughout his career – controlling the play by either passing or shooting the puck. Defensively, he is known to play aggressively, hitting opposing players. Due to his offensive capabilities at a comparatively small size for a defenseman at 5 feet and 9inches, he has been compared to former NHL player Brian Rafalski.|$|E
500|$|After {{calling a}} number of minor {{witnesses}} (including the cab driver {{and the owner of}} the building Williams and Seymour lived in), the prosecution called Edgar Power. Power testified that Williams had bragged about shooting Walls in response to Powers' chaffing him about being a poor shot. According to Power, Williams responded to the chaff by saying, [...] "Well, that was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> anyhow," [...] referring to the shot that had killed Walls. Williams' barrister Hastings later described Power as [...] " [...] utterly contemptible human being I have ever met," [...] and during his cross-examination Hastings highlighted Power's betrayal of his close friends, Williams and Seymour.|$|E
500|$|Virgil Earp {{reported}} afterward, [...] "Two shots {{went off}} right together. Billy Clanton's {{was one of}} them." [...] Wyatt testified, [...] "Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me, but I did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had {{the reputation of being}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury." [...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know, but Mr. Edward Cossey," [...] and she shrank visibly as she {{uttered the}} name, [...] "is coming, {{and he is}} <b>a</b> /very/ <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and /very/ {{conceited}} about it. I want you to beat him if you can--will you try?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Grbović was a {{very strong}} and {{attractive}} player, temperamental also. His nickname was [...] "Tank". He was 2.02 m tall and played small forward. He had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> three-point <b>shot</b> and audiences liked his dunks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another {{advantage}} of being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> shot--I mean <b>a</b> really <b>good</b> shot--is that, if you get forced into an affair, and are desirous of giving a lesson, but no more, to an opponent, you have it in your power to wing him; whereas, if you are only <b>a</b> tolerably <b>good</b> <b>shot,</b> you can't pick your spot, and may--to your lasting regret--kill him.|$|R
500|$|... 21st-place {{qualifier}} Casey Mears had his car lose {{power on}} his second warm-up lap after exiting the fourth turn and stopped in turn two; he was allowed one attempt to record a timed lap as a result. Dario Franchitti and Moreno qualified in the 22nd and 23rd positions, while Castroneves took 24th. Carpentier, who qualified in 25th, was observed speeding after he exited pit road and was limited to one lap time. On his run, he went up onto the track's dirty side in turn two and removed his foot from the accelerator pedal. Fernández qualified {{at the back of}} the grid in 26th position and turned off his engine on the backstretch while {{on his second}} warm-up lap and stopped at the bottom of turn three. After qualifying,Tagliani said: [...] "The car is very fast, the team was very quick earlier this year at Michigan and we're looking good right now. We didn't expect to qualify that fast actually, but the car was free and it was great. I think we have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> to stay up front with that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Macaulay {{displayed}} a temper when matters went against him. Robertson-Glasgow {{described him as}} an unusual man, [...] "fiercely independent, witty, argumentative, swift to joy and anger. He had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy... A cricket-bag came {{between him and his}} blazer hanging on a peg; and he'd kick it and tell it a truth or two, then laugh." [...] Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be [...] "filled with a devilish energy". He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him. Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were never sure what to expect from him, even after playing with him for years. Herbert Sutcliffe said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp. Robertson-Glasgow nevertheless described him as [...] "a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand".|$|E
500|$|The move {{paid off}} as Phil Esposito scored for Canada after just 30 seconds of play, {{knocking}} a puck {{out of the}} air behind the Soviets' goaltender Vladislav Tretiak. But even after a few minutes, Sinden felt the Soviets were coming on and having no difficulty getting through Canada's defence. Henderson scored after six minutes to give Canada a two-goal lead on a face-off win by Clarke, the only advantage that Team Canada had, in Sinden's estimation. To Canadian spectators and the media, the second goal gave the appearance that the pre-series predictions of a rout had been proven correct. But the Soviets got over any awe of the NHLers and scored two goals to tie the score {{before the end of the}} first period. Yevgeni Zimin scored on a pass from behind the net, and Vladimir Petrov scored a short-handed goal on a Soviet two-on-one break, with Petrov potting the rebound. According to Sinden, the Canadian players had lost their poise, [...] "running all over the ice" [...] to establish their hitting game, while the Soviets used an unexpected tactic, that of the long pass, to break a man out of their defensive zone. The Canadian defence was also dropping to the ice to block shots, while the Soviets only skated around the defence to get <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> Although Tretiak had given up the two Canada goals on the first two shots, he recovered later in the period to make a couple of critical saves off Esposito at point-blank range. According to Esposito, [...] "at Christmas time, it would have been 4–0 for us." ...|$|E
5000|$|He is {{the sole}} officer {{in charge of the}} Queen Fuji's weapons systems, and is also <b>a</b> fairly <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> After Nagisa discovers Golem's weak point during her {{transformation}} into her [...] "Golem Jet" [...] mode, Yajin damages her with a beam cannon shot to the shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{can fight}} {{as well as}} some of the men," [...] said the youth, boldly. [...] "I am <b>a</b> pretty <b>good</b> <b>shot,</b> and I wouldn't be a coward and run," [...] he added, earnestly. [...] "I don't want to go back to the ranch alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{although}} I say it myself, I am <b>an</b> exceptionally <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> I have practised a {{great deal}} with the rifle, and have, I suppose, a natural aptitude for it; for when I fire I am morally certain of hitting my mark, though I am hardly conscious of taking aim." ...|$|R
2500|$|Another tactic on {{a corner}} is to let the best shooter stay in the back [...] "trash" [...] {{position}} and have the defence worried about those up front. The player taking the corner kick makes a small pass back to the trash shooter who has time and space to take <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Now {{one of the}} Huns who was {{fighting}} before the others was making more trouble for the Romans than all the rest. And some rustic made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and hit him on the right knee with a sling, and he immediately fell headlong from his horse to the ground, which thing heartened the Romans still more ...|$|E
2500|$|As a wing-three-quarter, he {{took part}} in the second ever rugby {{international}} between England and Scotland, in 1872. The match, which took part at The Oval, was won by England. Although at club level he always played three-quarter, he was picked as a fullback for England. He was described as a clever runner, who could [...] "drop with either foot, and was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> at goal." [...] At club level, Moberly turned out for the Ravenscourt Park Football Club.|$|E
6000|$|... "No but----No use {{running this}} {{democracy}} thing into the ground. Besides, I've known Nat for years, and besides, he's <b>a</b> mighty <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and----That's {{the way it}} is, see? Next to Nat is Chet Dashaway. Great fellow for chinning. He'll talk your arm off, about religion or politics or books or anything." ...|$|R
50|$|Anna resurfaced in the Markaam Islands in 2006, reuniting with Robert for {{the first}} time since 1992. She unceremoniously greeted him with <b>a</b> few <b>good</b> <b>shots</b> to the face. She {{returned}} to Port Charles in 2006 to reconnect with Robin and Robert. All the while, she is on assignment for her agency, investigating Lorenzo Alcazar.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{ought to}} be a warning. I didn't break it; it was meant to break on me. Ellice flung it at my head a day or two ago, and {{fortunately}} missed, though as a rule she's <b>a</b> pretty <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> I suppose it's significant that neither of us troubled to pick up the pieces." ...|$|R
2500|$|Khan {{took part}} in the 10 m Air rifle {{individual}} event in the 2002 Commonwealth Games at the age of 15. [...] He performed well and found himself fifth before the last shot. At that moment he thought <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> could earn him a fourth-place finish. [...] He said,"..if I could make a good I would probably end up fourth. The bronze was a possibility but slightly unlike". His final shot scored 9.9, with a total of 691.9, and he won the gold medal.|$|E
2500|$|Television {{coverage}} of the fireworks show which displayed the 29 firework [...] "footprints" [...] outside the stadium was simulated by computer animation. Twenty-nine sets of fireworks {{in the shape of}} a footprint did actually go off, but it was decided that it would be difficult and dangerous to get <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> from helicopters capturing all 29 of the footsteps (which went off every two seconds), so a CGI of 27 of the footprints was made for television broadcasts, and only the last two were filmed live. The 55 seconds of display took the BOCOG a year to choreograph. The substitution of CGI footage was mentioned during the time-delayed U.S. broadcast of the ceremony on NBC by announcers Matt Lauer and Bob Costas.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, she {{successfully}} defended her 10,000 metres {{title with}} a powerful performance over the final 600 metres, winning {{in a time of}} 30:20.75. This was the fastest of the year by any female athlete. This made her the first woman to win consecutive Olympic 10,000 meter titles. After the win, she said, [...] "I have never been happier than today – this is even better than in Beijing". In the 5000 metres, she finished third behind gold medalist Meseret Defar and silver medalist Vivian Cheruiyot, thus failing to repeat her 10,000/5000 double from the 2008 Summer Olympics. After the race, Dibaba said, [...] "I'm not very pleased today. I gave it <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>shot,</b> but I wasn't aiming for bronze. I'm a bit disappointed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Burton also {{commented that}} he was anxious about his role, because he feared that ST:TNG was going to flop: [...] "At the beginning, you know, {{there was a lot}} of {{conversation}} in the press at what a bad idea this was but I thought that since Gene was involved we had <b>a</b> real <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> of making <b>a</b> <b>good</b> show that would carry on in that tradition of Star Trek." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why shouldn't he {{get a job}} {{of sorts}} out in the Argentine? There ought to be heaps of sound jobs going there for a chap like Wyatt. He's <b>a</b> jolly <b>good</b> <b>shot,</b> to start with. I shouldn't wonder if it wasn't rather a score {{to be able to}} shoot out there. And he can ride, I know." ...|$|R
50|$|Mainly a right midfielder, {{he could}} also appear as an attacking midfielder, being {{best known for his}} {{dribbling}} skills and pace while also possessing <b>a</b> <b>good</b> long-distance <b>shot</b> and accurate passing. He played most of his injury-plagued career with Sporting Clube de Portugal, after starting it with Lokomotiv Moscow.|$|R
