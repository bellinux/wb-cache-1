5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors.

Despite this the summit does still receive <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> walkers, who use <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
