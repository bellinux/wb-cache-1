Adsorption technology is very efficient in treatment of textile effluent. In this paper comparison of adsorption phenomena of textile dye <b>Anthraquinone</b> <b>blue</b> onto two different adsorbents MgO nano powder and Fe 2 O 3 amorphous powder has been studied for removal of said dye from aqueous solutions. The adsorption of <b>Anthraquinone</b> <b>blue</b> on adsorbents occurs by studying the effects of adsorbent amount, dye concentration, contact time and pH of solution. All results found that MgO nano powder and Fe 2 O 3 provide a fairly high dye adsorption capacity, which combined with their fulfilment of pollution control board’s standards, lack of pollution, lower environmental hazard and low-cost makes them promising for future applications.

That is, an efficient electrochemical-based process assisted by subsequent photochemical reactions. As far as we know, the high degradation capacity shown by DSA electrodes used in the presence of reactive electrolytes, such us sodium chloride, is due to electrochemical generation of powerful oxidant agents, as molecular chlorine, followed by photochemical generation of active radicals, such chlorine radical.

The adsorption of RB 2 on catalysts follows the Langmuir model and adsorption capacity's influence on degradation performance has been established. Correlations between degradation kinetics and the amount of dye adsorbed (qads) were then determined. The expected correlation between specific surface and qmax was verified. The addition of sulphate ions in the case of catalysts Degussa P 25 and TiO 2 -Ishihara ST 01 was found to inhibit adsorption of RB 2 on the TiO 2 surfaces. The hindrance of adsorption in acidic conditions improved the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of ST 01.

The operating parameters, including initial solution pH, dye concentration and Fe- 0 dose, were also evaluated. The Fe- 0 /air process shows a higher decolorization rate compared to the Fe- 0 /N- 2 process. Both RB 4 and RB 5 solutions at 100 mg L- 1 were rapidly decolorized by Fe- 0 /air process within 9 and 3 min. respectively, at initial solution pH 3, Fe dose of 50 g L- 1 and air flow rate of 5 L min(- 1). The optimal initial solution pH was 3. The Fe- 0 /N- 2 process removed only < 17 % of COD. However, significant COD removals were achieved for RB 4 (87 %) and RB 5 (43 %) by the Fe- 0 /air process after 9 min of treatment. Spectra analysis {{results indicated that the}} Fe- 0 /N- 2 process destroyed only the anthraquinone group (A(594)) for the RB 4 solution and decreased the azo (A(596)) and naphthalene group (A(310)) for the RB 5 solution. However. the Fe- 0 /air process rapidly removed A(594), A(370), A(296) (anthraquinone group) and A(256) (aromatic and dichlorotriazine group) for RB 4, and A(597) and A(310) (naphthalene group) for RB 5.

40|$|Liquid {{crystalline}} {{side chain}} copolymers containing covalently attached dyes {{have been discussed}} recently. Due to the chemical bond of the dye to the polymer backbone the crystallization of the dye is efficiently suppressed so that high dye concentrations are achievable. The orientational order of the dyes can be frozen-in by cooling the sample below the glas transition temperature, resulting in a dichroic polymer film. Films of such a kind might be suitable candidates for optical data storage provided small defects can be created and annealed fast enough.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the {{development}} {{of a large number of}} electrochemical sandwich assays and reagentless biosensor architectures employing biomolecules modified via the attachment of a redox-active “reporter. ” Here we survey a large set of potential redox reporters in order to determine which exhibits the best long-duration stability in thiol-on-gold monolayer-based sensors and to identify reporter “sets” signaling at distinct, nonoverlapping redox potentials in support of multiplexing and error correcting ratiometric or differential measurement approaches. Specifically, we have characterized the performance of more than a dozen potential reporters that are, first, redox active within the potential window over which thiol-on-gold monolayers are reasonably stable and, second, are available commercially in forms that are readily conjugated to biomolecules or can be converted into such forms in one or two simple synthetic steps. To test each of these reporters we conjugated it to one terminus of a single-stranded DNA “probe” that was attached by its other terminus via a six-carbon thiol to a gold electrode to form an “E-DNA” sensor responsive to its complementary DNA target. We then measured the signaling properties of each sensor as well as its stability against repeated voltammetric scans and against deployment in and reuse from blood serum. Doing so we find that the performance of methylene blue-based, thiol-on-gold sensors is unmatched; the near-quantitative stability of such sensors against repeated scanning in even very complex sample matrices is unparalleled. While more modest, the stability of sensors employing a handful of other reporters, including <b>anthraquinone,</b> Nile <b>blue,</b> and ferrrocene, is reasonable. Our work thus serves as both to highlight the exceptional properties of methylene blue as a redox reporter in such applications and as a cautionary tale−we wish to help other researchers avoid fruitless efforts to employ the many, seemingly promising and yet ultimately inadequate reporters we have investigated. Finally, we hope that our work also serves as an illustration of the pressing need for the further development of useful redox reporters...|$|R

The high concentration of iron oxide, mostly hematite, present in pyrite ash, gives the basis for its application {{as a source of}} catalytic iron in a modified Fenton process for <b>anthraquinone</b> dye reactive <b>blue</b> 4 (RB 4) degradation. The effect of various operating variables such as catalyst and oxidant concentration, initial pH and RB 4 concentration on the abatement of total organic carbon, and dye has been assessed in this study. Here we show that degradation of RB 4 in the modified Fenton reaction was efficient under the following conditions: pH= 2. 5; [PA] 0 = 0. 2 [*]g[*]L− 1; [H 2 O 2] 0 = 5 [*]mM and initial RB 4 concentration up to 100 [*]mg[*]L− 1. The pyrite ash Fenton reaction can overcome limitations observed from the classic Fenton reaction, such as the early termination of the Fenton reaction. Metal (Pb, Zn, and Cu) content of the solution after the process suggests that an additional treatment step is necessary to remove the remaining metals from the water.

40|$|A biofilm hydrolytic-aerobic {{combination}} treatment process {{based on}} mixed culture {{was used to}} degrade <b>anthraquinone</b> dye Reactive <b>Blue</b> 19 (RB 19). The {{results indicated that the}} majority of color was removed in the hydrolytic stage. On the other hand, the majority of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed in the subsequent aerobic process. RB 19 was successfully and completely degraded in the hydrolytic-aerobic combination treatment process where the initial step was the reductive decolorization, and then a complete degradation was achieved. The effects of the initial dye concentration and glucose concentration on COD and color removal during the combination process were investigated. Meanwhile, the change tendency of volatile fatty acids (VFA), pH, and alkalinity were also evaluated during the combination process. The VFA concentration in the hydrolytic effluent reached 13. 5 mmol/L and sharply decreased down to 1. 4 mmol/L after the subsequent aerobic degradation. The experimental results show that the biofilm hydrolytic-aerobic combination process was a stable and an effective process for treating RB 19 waste-water for more than 3 months with 93 batches. In the presence of glucose 2, 000 mgL(- 1), COD and color removal efficiencies of RB 19 could be up to 99. 4 % and 94. 5 %, respectively, by the hydrolytic treatment for 10 h plus the aerobic treatment for 2 h at RB 19 600 mgL(- 1) ...|$|R

Additionally, the electron shuttling {{capacity of the}} redox mediator anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonic acid (AQS) and subsequent increase on decolourisation rates was investigated on anthraquinone dyes. Compared with incubations at 30 degreesC, serum bottles at 55 degreesC presented distinctly higher decolourisation rates not only with an industrial wastewater containing anthraquinone dyes, but also with model compounds. Compared with batch assays at 30 degreesC, the first-order rate constant "k" of the Reactive Blue 5 (RB 5) was enhanced 11 -fold and 6 -fold for bottles at 55 degreesC supplemented and free of AQS, respectively. However, the <b>anthraquinone</b> dye Reactive <b>Blue</b> 19 (RB 19) demonstrated a very strong toxic effect on volatile fatty acids (VFA) degradation and methanogenesis at both 30 degreesC and 55 degreesC. The apparent inhibitory concentrations of RB 19 exerting 50 % reduction in methanogenic activity (IC 50 -value) were 55 mgl(- 1) at 30 degreesC and 45 mgl(- 1) at 55 degreesC. Further experiments at both temperatures revealed that RB 19 was mainly toxic to methanogens, because the glucose oxidizers including acetogens, propionate-forming, butyrate-forming and ethanol-forming microorganisms were not affected by the dye toxicity.

In the present study, we studied the potential effects of using an aerobic biofilm reactor, a hydrolytic reactor, and a combined aerobic-hydrolytic reactor system for treating the <b>anthraquinone</b> dye Reactive <b>Blue</b> 19 (RB 19). Compared with the aerobic and hydrolytic reactors, the combined aerobic-hydrolytic reactor system achieved the highest removal efficiency regarding color and chemical oxygen demand, at 95. 6 % and 83. 7 %, respectively. Microbial communities in the reactors were analyzed with {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} based on bacterial 16 S rRNA genes. A statistical analysis of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles demonstrated that the structure of the RB 19 -degrading consortium changed between the different reactors. All band sequences recovered were assigned to two phyla, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. A clone corresponding to a Shewanella strain was assumed to be responsible for the RB 19 decomposition.

The main objective of our {{research work}} was to evaluate the potential of an Up-flow Column reactor (UFCR) (13 x 1. 7 //) containing the fungal strain, Aspergillus niger SA 1 (immobilized on support material Scotch-BriteTM) for the decolorization of a dye, Db K 2 RL, in simulated textile effluent. Different concentrations of dye in the effluent were treated in the reactor for 24 h, with a flow rate of 10 mL- 1 at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 h. Using anoxic UFCR, decolorization of the effluent was observed maximum, that is, 94. 26 % at 10 ppm of dye; however, it reduced to 58. 51 % at 300 ppm of dye. A trend towards increase (≤ 15 %) in decolorization of effluent was noted, when the effluent was aerated prior to treatment. Recycling of the effluent containing dye increased the decolorization (85 % at 130 ppm of dye; 66 % at 500 ppm of dye), however, further recycling decreased the rate of decolorization, which might be due to desorption by the immobilized fungus.

The COD (chemical oxygen demand) and RB 19 removal efficiency could {{be up to}} 91 % and 90 % in 24 h, respectively, with the recycling rate being 10 mL/min. When the recycling rates were 8 mL/min and 10 mL/min, the average COD and RB 19 removal rate reached the largest values of 109. 9 mg/L h and 23. 6 mg/L h, respectively. The results also showed that RB 19 removal rate in both the hydrolytic and aerobic reactor declined whereas COD removal rate in the aerobic reactor increased with increasing of recycling rate. With the recycling rate of 10 mL/min, VIA (volatile fatty acid) in the wastewater was of the lowest value and pH value was apparently higher than those with other recycling rates. The ratios of VFA/alkalinity were all less than 0. 6 when the recycling rate was more than 5 mL/min, which indicated that the activity of hydrolytic microorganisms had not been inhibited and the recycling process maintained a stable condition. Results in this work shown that hydrolytic-aerobic recycling process successfully dealt with the issues of over-acidification and inhibition in the hydrolysis process and effectively enhanced the removal efficiencies of RB 19 and COD.

40|$|Anthraquinone dyes {{constitute}} {{the second largest}} class of textile dyes, and are used extensively in the textile industry. A high fraction of the initial reactive dye mass used in the dyeing process remains in the spent dyebath. Reactive dyes are not readily removed by typical wastewater treatment processes and the high salt concentration typical of reactive dyeing further complicates the management of spent reactive dyebaths. Investigation of the reductive transformation of reactive anthraquinone dyes and their decolorization products has been very limited. Additionally, very limited {{research has been conducted}} on the decolorization of spent reactive dyebaths. Research was conducted to investigate the key operational parameters of batch and continuous-flow ZVI decolorization of a reactive <b>anthraquinone</b> dye, Reactive <b>Blue</b> 4 (RB 4), under anoxic conditions, as well as the potential for the biodegradation of its decolorization products in a halophilic culture under aerobic conditions. The effect of two operational parameters, such as mixing intensity and initial dye concentration, on the ZVI batch decolorization kinetics indicates that ZVI decolorization of RB 4 is a surface-catalyzed, mass transfer-limited process. The high salt and base concentrations enhanced the rate of RB 4 decolorization. Based on parameters such as porosity, hydraulic conductivity, pore water velocity, and dispersion coefficient, non-ideal transport characteristics were observed in a continuous-flow ZVI column. The results of a long-term continuous-flow ZVI decolorization kinetics demonstrated that continuous-flow ZVI decolorization is feasible. However, column porosity losses and a shift of reaction kinetics occur in long-term column operation. ZVI decolorization of RB 4 was successfully described with a pseudo first-order or a site saturation model. Lastly, the RB 4 decolorization products generated by ZVI treatment had no inhibitory effect on the halophilic culture. However, biodegradation and/or mineralization of RB 4 decolorization products was not observed after a long-term incubation of the culture.

Steady-state kinetic studies of these enzymes revealed that they have much lower peroxidase activities than C- and D-type DyPs. Nevertheless, DypA showed 6 -fold greater apparent specificity for the <b>anthraquinone</b> dye Reactive <b>Blue</b> 4 (kcat/Km = 12800 ± 600 M– 1 s– 1) than either ABTS or pyrogallol, consistent with previously characterized DyPs.

Further differences were detected using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy: while both DyPs contained high-spin (S = 5 / 2) FeIII in the resting state, DypA had a rhombic high-spin signal (gy = 6. 32, gx = 5. 45, and gz = 1. 97) while DypB had a predominantly axial signal (gy = 6. 09, gx = 5. 45, and gz = 1. 99). Moreover, DypA reacted with H 2 O 2 to generate an intermediate with features of compound II (FeIV═O). By contrast, DypB reacted with H 2 O 2 with a second-order rate constant of (1. 79 ± 0. 06) × 105 M– 1 s– 1 to generate a relatively stable green-colored intermediate (t 1 / 2 9 min). While the electron absorption spectrum of this intermediate {{was similar to that}} of compound I of plant-type peroxidases, its EPR spectrum was more consistent with a poorly coupled protein-based radical than with an [FeIV═O Por•]+ species. The X-ray crystal structure of DypB, determined to 1. 4 Å resolution, revealed a hexacoordinated heme iron with histidine and a solvent species occupying axial positions. A solvent channel potentially provides access to the distal face of the heme for H 2 O 2.

The results obtained in this study has demonstrated that the Basic Red 51 (BR 51), Basic Brown 17 (BB 17), Arianor Ebony and the capillary mixture of dyes induced genotoxic effects on the exposed cells, including the DNA fragmentation and the formation of the MN. The [...] . Segundo a Agência Internacional para Pesquisa do Câncer (IARC), estudos utilizando ensaios in vitro e in vivo (populações humanas expostas) demonstraram que algumas tinturas de cabelo e muitos produtos químicos utilizados no processo de tingimento capilar podem ser considerados mutagênicos e carcinogênicos. Estudos epidemiológicos em pessoas expostas ocupacionalmente a tinturas de cabelo indicaram uma associação com risco de câncer de bexiga e neoplasias linfoides. Da mesma forma, o uso pessoal de corantes capilares permanentes foi associado com câncer de bexiga. Cerca do 33 % das mulheres, com mais de 18 anos de idade e 10 % dos homens com mais de 40 anos, usam algum tipo de corante de cabelo. A tintura capilar preta é uma coloração semipermanente, que é composta por uma mistura de vários corantes, incluindo dois corantes puros (Basic red 51 e Basic brown 17), ambos azo corantes (- N=N-) e uma mistura, denominada Arianor Ebony, composta por cinco corantes, dentre eles azo corantes e antroquinonas (Basic blue 99, Basic brown 16, Acid violet 43, Basic red 76, and Basic yellow 57). Os azo corantes são considerados substâncias perigosas, pois a sua degradação gera produtos como aminas aromáticas que podem ser mais tóxicas que os compostos originais. Os corantes de antraquinona são amplamente utilizado para a coloração de plásticos e tintas industriais conhecidos por serem mutagênicos, carcinogênicos e tóxicos por via oral. Este projeto de pesquisa teve como objetivo geral avaliar a citotoxicidade (teste do Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide- MTT), genotoxicidade (ensaios de Cometa e Micronúcleos) de todos os corantes que compõem a tintura capilar preta, por meio de ensaios realizados com cultura de células de hepatoma humano (HepG 2), assim como também avaliar a mutagênicidade da mistura (teste de Ames), pelo teste com Salmonella typhimurium nas linagens TA 98 e TA 100. Também foi avaliada a expressão de 7 diferentes [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a {{significant}} cause of mortality and morbidity in immunocompromised patients and an important cause of birth defects if acquired in utero. The licensed CMV antivirals, ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet, all target the viral DNA polymerase. For each drug prolonged use is associated with significant toxicities and development of drug resistance. None are approved for use during pregnancy. Therefore, development of new anti-CMV drugs that target different pathways would be beneficial. All herpesviruses encode an alkaline nuclease. That genetic disruption of the CMV alkaline nuclease, UL 98, reduces CMV replication by 1, 000 -fold suggests that UL 98 may be a useful target for development of novel anti-CMV drugs. Moreover, using herpes simplex virus type 1 Hsiang and Ho found that the anthraquinone emodin inhibits activity of the viral alkaline nuclease, blocks viral replication in cell culture, and reduces viral pathogeneses in a mouse model (Brit. J. of Pharm., 2008). Earlier studies also showed that anthraquinone derivatives including emodin have anti-CMV activity (Barnard et al., Antiviral Research 1992 2 ̆ 6 1995), although the mechanism of CMV inhibition has not been further studied. We therefore sought to confirm the anti-CMV activities of emodin and related anthraquinone derivatives, to characterize their mechanisms of action, and to determine specifically if they act through inhibition of UL 98. Using a luciferase-based CMV yield reduction assay emodin inhibited CMV replication (IC 50 = 4. 9 μM); however, that the TD 50 for cytotoxicity (determined using an luciferase-based cell viability assay) was only 2 -fold higher suggested that emodin may act non-specifically. Two additional <b>anthraquinone</b> derivatives (acid <b>blue</b> 40 and alizarin violet R) inhibited CMV only at high concentrations (IC 50 = 238; 265 μM) that were also cytotoxic. Atanyl blue PRL, however, exhibited anti-CMV activity (IC 50 = 6. 3 μM) with low cytotoxicity (TD 50 = 216 μM). Thus, characterization of atanyl blue PRL (impact on gene expression, GFP expression, viral spread, infectivity, time of addition studies, and inhibition of UL 98 nuclease activity) should be informative. Atanyl blue PRL appears to block immediate-early gene expression and reduce early and late gene expression. Atanyl blue PRL also blocked GFP expression, reduced viral spread, and also lowered the infectivity of CMV. Finally, atanyl blue PRL inhibits UL 98 alkaline nuclease activity at an IC 50 of 5. 7 μM. This suggests that atanyl blue PRL may inhibit CMV through inhibition of UL 98. Thus, atanyl blue PRL represents a novel class of anti-herpesvirals and provides a lead structure for structure based drug discovery...|$|R
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 697 on 01. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) Dyestuffs {{are widely used}} industrial chemicals, yet surprisingly {{little is known about}} their fate in the environment. The potential modes of transformation and removal of reactive dyes in treatment and in the environment are principally through anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation and photodegradation. The research herein describes the use of LC-MS analysis with laboratory simulations to develop {{a better understanding of the}} occurrence and fate of reactive dyes and their degradation products in the aquatic environment. One reason for the lack of information on the environmental fate of reactive dyes has been the paucity of robust analytical methods suitable for the determination of dyes in aqueous samples. Robust analytical methods were optimised to provide LC-MS and MSMS identification of degradation products. Additionally, interpretation of the MSMS spectra of known reactive dyes provided novel characteristic fragment ions indicative of the triazine reactive group of reactive dyes. Fibre reactive dyes are designed to have a degree of photostability and therefore their photodegradation behaviour has not been widely investigated. Little is known of their stability to daylight over prolonged periods of irradiation in dilute aqueous solutions and in the presence of humic substances. The kinetics of photodegradation of an <b>anthraquinone</b> dye (Reactive <b>Blue</b> H 4 R) and azo dye (Reactive Yellow P 5 G) were evaluated. The former underwent rapid and extensive degradation 01 / 2 1. 5 h). The major products formed were identified using LC-MSMS and a photodegradation pathway proposed. By comparison, the photodegradation of the azo dye was significantly slower, 01 / 2 30 h). The addition of humic substancesa ppearedt o have little effect on the rate of photodegradationu nder the conditions used. The reduction of azo dyes under anaerobic treatment has been extensively studied, but the subsequent fate of the initial reduction products when exposed to air are not understood. Three relatively simple azo dyes, Amaranth, Sunset Yellow and Naphthol Blue-Black, were reduced and their autoxidation products identified by LC-MS. These were subsequently used to predict the autoxidation products of a more complex azo reactive dye: Reactive Red 3. 1. Additionally, a persistent degradation product from the anaerobicaerobic treatment of Reactive Red 3. 1 was identified from LC-MS data. Azo reactive dyes are generally regarded as being resistant to aerobic degradation and there are few published data regarding degradation pathways for reactive anthraquinone dyes. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas docunhae, A 9046 and A texaco and mixed bacterial consortia (semi-continuous activated sludge, SCAS) aerobic degradation of azo and anthraquinone reactive dyes was studied. Two azo dyes were degraded by pure cultures of A docunhae and A 9046, suggesting that azo dyes can be aerobically degraded given favourable conditions. The antraquinone dye was extensively degraded by SCAS and pure culture biodegradation. Metabolites were identified by LC-MS and a degradation pathway proposed.
