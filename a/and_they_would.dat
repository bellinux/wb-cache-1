5|$|Certain astronomical objects {{known as}} spiral nebulae such as M31 {{would later be}} {{recognized}} as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to these objects began to be discovered, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be deemed island universes. However, the word Universe was later understood to mean the entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the objects instead became known as galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Yasui {{was allowed}} to leave the {{internment}} camp {{in the summer and}} was employed in Chicago before moving to Denver, Colorado, in September 1944. There he passed the bar in June 1945, but was only admitted to practice law after an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court. The following year in November he married former internee True Shibata, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have three daughters together, Iris, Holly, and Laurel.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was composed}} of 20 warships, 21 frigates, and 32 transport ships, containing 800 cannons, 3,000 soldiers, and 10,000 marines. The expedition was to retake Louisbourg and then Annapolis Royal. However, after a three months crossing, and the dispersal of the fleet between Sable Island and the mainland, the expedition {{turned out to be}} a disaster for the French, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not try to recapture Port Royal again.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky's debut feature, Pi, {{also written}} as π, {{was shot in}} November 1997. The film was financed in part from $100 {{donations}} from friends and family. In return, he promised to pay each back $150 if the film made money, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> at least get screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself {{was nominated for a}} special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office. Pi was the first film to be made available for download on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Brucie's win in 1940 {{coincided with}} the American Cocker Spaniel {{becoming}} the most popular breed of dog in the United States, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> remain the most popular until 1952. The most recent victory was in 1954 with the victory going to Ch. Carmor's Rise and Shine. The popularity of the American Cocker increased {{once again in the}} 1980s with it becoming the most popular breed again from 1984 until 1990. In more recent years the popularity of the breed has decreased, with it ranked 15th most popular by the American Kennel Club in 2005.|$|E

5|$|By 1899, the {{sandstone}} shaft marker placed by Chandler Robbins in 1875 had been disturbed and broken, {{so it was}} replaced with a new stone by two U.S. Surveyors, Hubert D. Page and James M. Lentz. In 1912, a simple cement pad was poured around the marker.

5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father HenryIII – led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} hostility of Bede has {{obscured}} Penda's importance as ruler who wielded an imperium {{similar to that of}} other prominent 7th century 'overkings'. Penda's hegemony included lesser rulers of both Anglo-Saxon and British origins, non-Christian and Christian alike. The relationships between Penda, as hegemon, and his subordinate rulers would have been based on personal as well as political ties, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> often have been reinforced by dynastic marriages. It has been asserted that Penda's court would have been cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and tolerant. Though a pagan himself, there is evidence that the contemporary Mercian elite contained significant Christian and British elements. Penda must have been intimate with many Britons and may have been bilingual himself.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} on all British mainline journeys {{to change}} engines at convenient locations {{to avoid the}} lengthy process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed at key points between London and Glasgow <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be assigned to the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). It {{was only in the}} latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became more fluid.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E

5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant stature of the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, to sit in the cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin legs in the aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't mind if he took it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have to give chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians seem to {{have offered}} Philip Pydna in {{exchange}} for Amphipolis, perhaps during the later stages of the siege, {{but it is not}} clear whether Philip agreed to this. By this stage, the Social War of 357–355 BC had broken out between Athens and their erstwhile allies, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> now have been unable to intervene to help Amphipolis. Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and battering rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city. Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated the rest of the population considerately.|$|E
