50|$|On August 16, 2011, the CRTC {{granted the}} CBC {{permission}} to continue operating 22 <b>analogue</b> <b>repeaters</b> within mandatory markets, {{including those in}} London and Kitchener. These analogue transmitters were given an extension until August 31, 2012 to continue in operation, by which time the transmitters had to be converted to digital or shut down. CBC did not seek an extension for its Barrie transmitter, which it shut down on August 31, 2011, however the remaining satellite rebroadcast stations remained in operation.|$|R
50|$|Today, utility poles {{may hold}} {{much more than}} the {{uninsulated}} copper wire that they originally supported. Thicker cables holding many twisted pair, coaxial cable, or even fibre-optic, may be carried. Simple <b>analogue</b> <b>repeaters</b> or other outside plant equipment have long been mounted against poles, and often new digital equipment for multiplexing/demultiplexing or digital repeaters may now be seen. In many places, as seen in the illustration, providers of electricity, television, telephone, street light, traffic signal and other services share poles, either in joint ownership or by renting space to each other. In the United States, ANSI standard 05.1.2008 governs wood pole sizes and strength loading. Utilities that fall under the Rural Electrification Act must also follow the guidelines set forth in RUS Bulletin 1724E-150 (from the US Department of Agriculture) for pole strength and loading.|$|R
50|$|A radio {{transceiver}} for the radio-controlled train order signalling system is located here. An <b>analogue</b> radio <b>repeater</b> is {{located within the}} booking office {{which is used to}} overhear conversations between driver and the controller (located in the signal box at Ravenglass). The railway uses a type of semi-duplex private business radio system, similar to the marine VHF system.|$|R
50|$|TelevisionThe only {{television}} station local to Moose Jaw is CKMJ-TV channel 7, an <b>analogue</b> <b>repeater</b> of CTV station CKCK-DT Regina. Moose Jaw was previously served by CHAB-TV, a {{television station}} that existed from 1959 to 1969.|$|E
50|$|On July 31, 2013, the {{remaining}} over-the-air retransmitters of NTV in Corner Brook, Deer Lake, Norris Arm, Bonavista, Clarenville, Argentia and Marystown were discontinued. Coupled with {{the closure of}} the CBC's <b>analogue</b> <b>repeater</b> network in 2012, this left all of Newfoundland and Labrador outside of the St. John's area without aerial television, except for community-owned stations and transmitters in smaller, rural communities.|$|E
40|$|The VELO {{front-end}} {{control system}} and analogue link {{is based on}} commercial components where the radiation tolerance is assured by a radiation qualification procedure. This note reports on the radiation qualification of the components required for the VELO ECS mezzanine and <b>analogue</b> <b>repeater</b> mezzanines. They are located at the VELO vacuum vessel where the expected maximal dose is 73 kRad during 10 years of operation. The qualification was done by irradiating prototype circuits at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Villigen, Switzerland. The ECS mezzanine prototypes were irradiated to a dose of 780 kRad and the analogue driver test channels were irradiated to a dose of 600 kRad. All devices were fully functional after the irradiation and only a small increase in current consumption was observed...|$|E
50|$|By 2006, the {{programming}} from ICTV grew {{to encompass the}} channel 24 {{hours a day and}} the satellite channel was renamed to ICTV. Many remote indigenous communities in central and north eastern Australia had <b>analogue</b> terrestrial <b>repeaters</b> for this channel, which utilised community licences and later open-narrowcasting licences. In October 2006, ICTV was formally incorporated as a public company.|$|R
50|$|After a {{successful}} {{appeal to the}} Government of Western Australia, ICTV resumed broadcasting part-time on Westlink Network on 13 November 2009. Westlink Network was already carried on the existing Optus Aurora service as an open-narrowcast channel. Programming from ICTV was scheduled every weekend from Friday night to Monday morning. Remote communities with <b>analogue</b> terrestrial <b>repeaters</b> had begun to install equipment to automatically switch the NITV channel to Westlink Network every weekend.|$|R
50|$|Shoalhaven City Council {{constructed}} an <b>analogue</b> television <b>repeater</b> {{site with}} funding from the Australian Government {{as part of the}} Television Blackspot Program. Analog television broadcast transmissions from the site were to have been stopped 5 June 2012. The site has not and will not be upgraded to digital television. There is a Central Mapping Authority Trig at the top of Moeyan Hill. There is a walking track leading through Moeyan Hill Reserve however, the trail does not lead {{to the top of the}} hill, which is privately owned farmland. From the top of the hill the ocean is visible, 4 km to the east, as well as Coolangatta Mountain, Cambewarra Mountain, Gerroa and parts of Berry and its environs.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the coordinated transmission and processing of distributed radios employing OFDM signals {{similar to those}} employed in 802. 11 a. After showing that OFDM {{can be viewed as}} a set of parallel Gaussian channels with different frequency gain for each subcarrier, we design receiving schemes that exploit both the direct transmission between transmitter and receiver as well as the assisting relayed signal of a radio that overhears the communication between transmitter and receiver and acts as an <b>analogue</b> <b>repeater.</b> The special structure of 802. 11 a OFDM signals allow the coordination between transmitter, receiver and intermediate relay to happen on the same channels and the collaboration results in substantial energy savings compared to the traditional single transmitter-single receiver case, providing efficient resource (energy, bandwidth...|$|E
40|$|With the advancements in DSP, mobile {{terminals}} {{are becoming}} smaller and smarter every day. The more the mobile becoming data centric, the more {{is the number}} of users from indoors. From radio network planning point of view, these advancements introduced two major demands on mobile communication networks: faster and more spectral efficient networks, and better quality of service in indoors. This thesis studies the implementation of a dedicated indoor system and a WCDMA outdoor-to-indoor <b>analogue</b> <b>repeater</b> for a university building at the cell edge of an outdoor macrocell. The main emphasis is to compare the performance of the two systems in the cell change location when the user enters the indoor from outdoor coverage area. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the literature study part, the fundamental principles of wireless communication and basics of UMTS are resented. The architecture and basic concepts of HSDPA and guidelines to radio network planning are also discussed. In the measurement campaign part, the pico cell and repeater implementations for indoor coverage are studied, with focus on the HS-DSCH cell change region and the results are compared with the macrocell coverage scenario. The results of measurement rounds carried out under loaded scenario and with lower category mobiles than the one used for the study are also discussed. The study indicates that the HS-DSCH cell change introduces a momentary drop in throughput of pico cell scenario while the user movement from outdoor coverage to repeater coverage area is seamless. The study also highlights the importance of proper repeater donor antenna implementation. The effect of disoriented donor antenna on CQI value and hence the throughput of HSDPA systems is explicit from the results. It is shown from the study that the interference through repeaters also affects the region under the macrocell that is close to the repeater antenna. According to the results, dedicated indoor base stations are a good choice for indoors with high capacity requirements while repeater offers better coverage solution at lower cost. The conclusion is in accordance with the previous studies carried out with repeaters and dedicated indoor base stations. /Kir 1...|$|E
