5|$|Auriemma {{found himself}} in <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> {{following}} a decision he made during the 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury {{in one of the}} final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Paretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein {{announced}} plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, {{reducing the number of}} required courses from 21 to 15. When The New York Times, The Economist, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of crises and {{the severity of}} the 1907 panic added to concern about the outsized role of J.P. Morgan which led to renewed impetus toward <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> on reform. In May 1908, Congress passed the Aldrich–Vreeland Act that established the National Monetary Commission to investigate the panic and to propose legislation to regulate banking. Senator Nelson Aldrich (R–RI), the chairman of the National Monetary Commission, went to Europe for almost two years to study that continent's banking systems.|$|E

25|$|France is, per capita, the world's most nuclear-powered state.

Also Robert Mapplethorpe, whose most controversial work {{is that of the}} underground BDSM scene in the late 1960s and early 1970s of New York.

Roe v. Wade reshaped national politics, dividing much of the United States into pro-abortion and anti-abortion camps, while activating grassroots movements on both sides.|$|E

When JGSDF officials heard about this, they told press officials that they require the consent of the troopers and their relatives. Otherwise, they would not be deployed. The Iraq deployment had caused <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> in Japan, and a new public consensus was necessary for the military to develop a modern role and structure.|$|E

25|$|Filipescu still {{exercised}} intellectual {{influence over}} the political class with his stance on debt and, in 1933, sparked <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> over the need to restore the country risk to more manageable levels—in effect, for austerity. The PC formed a cartel with the PP during the December 1933 election, but registered dismal results. The race was won by the PNL, with Duca being confirmed as Prime Minister. By then, the PC was losing its support base on the right, with Cantacuzino and other cadres migrating toward the Iron Guard, an openly fascist movement, or trying to persuade General Ion Antonescu into reviving the Vlad Țepeș League. Filipescu also ran, unsuccessfully, for a deputy seat in Ilfov during the by-elections of 1934.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of Moray's early death in battle and his close association with Wallace, {{a man who}} has become a near mythical figure in Scottish history, has meant that his achievements were little known. Although there are many statues to Wallace scattered across Scotland, from Aberdeen in the northeast to Dryburgh in the Scottish borders, though these are all surpassed by the Gothic extravagance of the National Wallace Monument looming over the site of the battle of Stirling Bridge, there is no similar monument to Moray. This situation {{has been turned into a}} political issue. At the close of December 2009, Murdo Fraser, a Conservative List MSP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, called for <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> on an appropriate monument to Moray. He stated that it should raise awareness of his historical role.|$|E

50|$|Salvadoran American {{immigration}} {{has changed}} the face of foreign affairs in the United States.

500|$|In Germany, {{authorities}} and politicians {{expressed concern that}} if the film was successful, it would boost Scientology in the country.

An anonymous BfV official said, [...] "These Scientologists have two goals in Germany... to get their message to children, and make their organization respectable.

500|$|Croatia {{also started}} a Membership Action Plan at the 2002 summit, leading to <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> {{on whether a}} {{referendum}} on NATO membership needed to be held there. Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader ultimately agreed in January 2008, as part of forming a coalition government with the HSS and HSLS parties, not to officially propose one. Montenegro declared independence on 3 June 2006, and the new country subsequently joined the Partnership for Peace programme at the 2006 Riga summit. [...] Albania and Croatia were invited to join NATO at the 2008 Bucharest summit that April, though Slovenia threatened to hold up Croatian membership over their border dispute in the Bay of Piran. Slovenia did ratify Croatia's accession protocol in February 2009, and Croatia and Albania both officially joined NATO {{just prior to the}} 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit, with little opposition from Russia.|$|E
500|$|Following the battle, Vukovar {{became a}} symbol of Croatian {{resistance}} and suffering. The survivors, veterans and journalists wrote numerous memoirs, songs and testimonies about the battle and its symbolism, calling it variously [...] "the phenomenon", [...] "the pride", [...] "the hell" [...] and [...] "the Croatian knight". Writers appealed to the [...] "Vukovar principle", the [...] "spirituality of Vukovar" [...] and [...] "Vukovar ethics", the qualities said to have been exhibited by the defenders and townspeople. Croatian war veterans were presented with medals bearing the name of Vukovar. In 1994, when Croatia replaced the Croatian dinar with its new currency, the kuna, it used the destroyed Eltz Castle in Vukovar and the Vučedol Dove– an artefact from an ancient Neolithic culture centred on eastern Slavonia, which was discovered near Vukovar– on the new 20-kuna note. The imagery emphasises the Croatian nature of Vukovar, at the time under Serbian control. During 1993–94, there was <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> on how Vukovar should be rebuilt when it was recovered; some Croatians even proposed that it should be preserved as a monument.|$|E
