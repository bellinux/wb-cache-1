As part of a series of trials to assess the viability of civil aviation in France, a Farman F.60 Goliath flew a [...] test flight carrying [...] of cargo on 1 May. Three laps of a circuit Paris – Orléans – Rouen – Saint-Inglevert – Metz – Dijon – Paris were flown. Saint-Inglevert was one of the designated landing places for the 1921 Coupe Michelin, an <b>aerial</b> <b>circuit</b> of France with a ₣20,000 prize. In November, a Compagnie des Messageries Aériennes aircraft called at Saint-Inglevert to collect a cargo of six 18-pounder and three 4.5–inch live shells for onward transmission to Croydon Airport in Surrey, United Kingdom. In a paper read to the Royal Aeronautical Society on 17 November, Colonel Frank Searle, managing director of Daimler Airway, criticized the organization of Saint-Inglevert and Le Bourget.|$|E

50|$|On August 9, 1910, Moisant flew {{his third}} flight {{as a pilot}} in his first {{recently}} purchased Blériot XI from Étampes to Issy-les-Moulineaux over Paris, landing the aircraft at the starting line of the Le <b>Circuit</b> de l'Est <b>aerial</b> time trial <b>circuit.</b> Accompanying Moisant as a passenger on the flight was his mechanic, making the trip the first passenger flight over a city in the world. At the time Moisant was still considered a novice pilot and had been previously denied entry into Le Circuit de l'Est competition by the Aéro-Club de France. That same day, he followed this performance with an encore, flying over Paris again with Roland Garros, who would become a future member of the Moisant International Aviators flying circus, as his passenger.|$|R
