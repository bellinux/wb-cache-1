25|$|After {{about a year}} {{some trouble}} arose {{between them and the}} Indians, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> war path as a warrior, not as a chief. I had not been wronged, but some of my people had been, and I fought with my tribe; for the {{soldiers}} and not the Indians were at fault.|$|E
25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman {{taught that}} the Sages instituted the {{tradition}} that Jews drink four cups of wine at the Passover seder in {{allusion to the}} four cups mentioned in [...] which says: [...] "‘Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.' And Joseph said to him: ‘This is the interpretation of it: [...] [...] [...] within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head, and restore you to your office; and you shall give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his butler." ...|$|E

2500|$|The cover art {{painting}} {{is by the}} British artist Nic Dartnell. Although {{it has been said}} to be originally intended for the American group Spirit, and that the bald-headed man on the left of the cover is Spirit's drummer, Ed Cassidy, the artist denied this in an interview with Mike Goldstein of RockPoP: [...] "I'd like to take a moment and dispel a rumor that, according to Wikipedia, the image is somehow linked to the LA band Spirit. The fact is that, at the time I painted the ELP [...] "Bird", I also painted a portrait of Spirit which I sent to them in LA. A very similar bird was featured in the corner of that painting. I got a message from Spirit to say that if they had received their painting in time they would have put it on the back of Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus. I became friendly with Randy California over the years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> photograph that is on his 1982 12" [...] EP All Along the Watchtower. The bald image in [...] "Bird" [...] has no connection to Ed Cassidy of Spirit and doesn't look anything like him. Ed still has the Spirit portrait – so I'm told." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Kaine {{argued that}} the U.S. {{military}} intervention against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), undertaken by President Obama, was unconstitutional without a new congressional authorization {{for the use of}} military force against ISIL. In November 2014, at the Halifax International Security Forum, Kaine, together with Senator John McCain, emphasized the necessity of such a congressional authorization, saying: [...] "You just can't have a war without Congress. You can't ask people to risk their lives, risk getting killed, seeing other folks getting killed or injured if Congress isn't willing to do the job to put their thumbprint on this and say, this is a national mission and worth it." [...] After the April 2017 Shayrat missile strike in Syria, ordered by President Donald Trump, Kaine said: [...] "There is no legal justification for this. He should not have done this without coming to Congress." [...] On Meet the Press, Kaine stated: [...] "I'm a strong supporter that the U.S. should take action to protect humanitarian causes, like the ban on chemical weapons. Where I differ from this administration, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> same position with respect to President Obama, we are a nation that's not supposed to take military action, start war, without a plan that's presented to and approved by Congress." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{original}} {{job when}} the series starts is {{as a real}} estate agent; he ends up quitting and getting re-hired, but fired immediately afterward for drugging his boss. He {{always wanted to be}} an architect or least [...] "pretend to be an architect". [...] He first mentions this desire in [...] "The Stake Out", and claims in [...] "The Race" [...] that he'd designed [...] "the new addition to the Guggenheim". In [...] "The Van Buren Boys", he denies his young protégé a scholarship from the Susan Ross Foundation when the young man decides he no longer wants to be an architect and wants to become a city planner instead. In [...] "The Marine Biologist", Jerry tells a woman who George wanted to impress that George is a marine biologist. The plan backfires when George is called on to save a beached whale with a Titleist golf ball in its blowhole. He saves the whale, but the woman tells him off when he confesses that he's not, in fact, a marine biologist: [...] "She told me to go to hell, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> bus home." [...] He then gets a job working for the Yankees, where he frequently encounters a fictionalized version of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner (the voice of Steinbrenner is made by Larry David).|$|E

60|$|The {{expression}} in Apocrypha about Tobit {{and his dog}} following him I have often heard ridiculed, yet Homer has the same words of Telemachus more than once; and Virgil says something like it of Evander. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> book of Tobit to be partly poetical.|$|R
