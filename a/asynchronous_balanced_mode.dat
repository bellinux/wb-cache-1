40|$|International audienceThe {{control of}} {{separated}} fluid flow by reduced-order models is studied using the two-dimensional incompressible flow {{over an open}} square cavity at Reynolds numbers where instabilities are present. Actuation and measurement locations are taken on the upstream and downstream edge of the cavity. A bi-orthogonal projection is introduced to arrive at reduced-order models for the compensated problem. Global modes, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) <b>modes</b> and <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> are used as expansion bases for the model reduction. The open-loop behaviour of the full and the reduced systems is analysed by comparing the respective transfer functions. This analysis shows that global modes are inadequate to sufficiently represent the inputoutput behaviour whereas POD and <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> are capable of properly approximating the exact transfer function. <b>Balanced</b> <b>modes</b> are far more efficient in this process, but POD modes show superior robustness. The performance of the closed-loop system corroborates this finding: while reduced-order models based on POD are able to render the compensated system stable, <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> accomplish the same with far fewer degrees of freedom. © 2009 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel six-mode {{loop antenna}} {{covering}} 660 - 1100 MHz, 1710 - 3020 MHz, 3370 - 3900 MHz, and 5150 - 5850 MHz {{has been proposed}} {{for the application of}} Long Term Evolution (LTE) including the coming LTE in unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) and LTE-Licensed Assisted Access (LTE-LAA). Loop antennas offer better user experience than conventional Planar Inverted-F Antennas (PIFA), Inverted-F Antennas (IFA), and monopole antennas because of their unique <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> (1 λ, 2 λ, …). However, the bandwidth of loop antennas is usually narrower than that of PIFA/IFA and monopole antennas due to these <b>balanced</b> <b>modes.</b> To overcome this problem, a novel monopole/dipole parasitic element, which operates at an unbalanced monopole-like 0. 25 λ <b>mode</b> and a <b>balanced</b> dipole-like 0. 5 λ mode, is first proposed for loop antennas to cover more frequency bands.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{combustion}} instabilities {{arising from the}} thermoacoustic interactions in a ducted premixed flame model is considered. Contrary to the conventionally used low-order models to describe such systems, a high dimensional model governed {{by a set of}} the acoustic equations coupled to the equations for flame dynamics is employed. The flame front is discretized into finite flame elements to assign internal degrees of freedom to the front and track its evolution. Model reduction schemes, namely proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and balanced truncation, are used {{to reduce the size of}} this model. Compared to POD <b>modes,</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> show superior input–output characteristics, in agreement with the full model. POD modes on the other hand capture the transient growth in the model while the <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> do not. Performance of POD modes is highly dependent on the snapshots used for their computation. A linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) framework using the reduced-order model based on 16 <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> is formulated to control thermoacoustic instabilities in the linear model.

The MM-LINC decomposition improves the LINC transmitter efficiency because the outphasing angle is reduced compared to the standard LINC solution. The reverse mode is obtained by inverting the inequalities in (4), achieving a better linearization instead of an efficiency improvement. The threshold γ must be optimized for every desired transmitted waveform, and thus, the method performance depends on the signal probability density function. Authors propose a novel switching method (Markov mode-multiplexing) which allows to transmit any particular envelope value in certain time step as outphasing mode but as a <b>balanced</b> <b>mode</b> later.|$|R

Model reduction techniques and Linear-Quadratic- Gaussian (LQG) control have been combined to stabilize the flow. A blowing/suction actuator has been placed upstream of the cavity and a skin friction sensor downstream of it. Reduced-order models based on global <b>modes</b> and <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> have been tested. We show that a reduced-order model based on the unstable global modes (to represent the unstable dynamics) and a few <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> (to capture the input-output dynamics of the stable sub-space between the actuator and the sensor) is optimal to stabilize the compensated system.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple {{constrained}} proportional controller with gain scheduling for simultaneous thermal and state-of-charge (SOC) balancing of a multilevel converter based modular battery. The proposed balancing controller is devised by investigating structural properties of constrained linear quadratic (LQ) model predictive controller (MPC) introduced in our earlier study. This investigation reveals a particular factorization of time-varying control gain matrices, {{which leads to}} approximation of matrix gains as scalar gains under the assumption of small parametric variations among battery cells. The gains are scheduled in load current for nominal cells. This special structure enables the identification of two dominant operational <b>modes</b> of the <b>balancing</b> controller: SOC <b>balancing</b> <b>mode</b> in low to medium load current range and thermal <b>balancing</b> <b>mode</b> in high current range. This study also proposes a simple algorithm for control projection on constraint polytope. The proposed balancing controller is tested in simulations for a modular battery with four significantly mismatched cells. The performance is comparable to MPC, which uses true battery parameters. The performance and {{the simplicity of the}} controller make it attractive for real-time implementation in large battery packs...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the design of}} a sequence-based predictor named ProteDNA for identifying the sequence-specific binding residues in a transcription factor (TF). Concerning protein–DNA interactions, {{there are two types of}} binding mechanisms involved, namely sequence-specific binding and nonspecific binding. Sequence-specific bindings occur between protein sidechains and nucleotide bases and correspond to sequence-specific recognition of genes. Therefore, sequence-specific bindings are essential for correct gene regulation. In this respect, ProteDNA is distinctive since it has been designed to identify sequence-specific binding residues. In order to accommodate users with different application needs, ProteDNA has been designed to operate under two modes, namely, the high-precision <b>mode</b> and the <b>balanced</b> <b>mode.</b> According to the experiments reported in this article, under the high-precision mode, ProteDNA has been able to deliver precision of 82. 3 %, specificity of 99. 3 %, sensitivity of 49. 8 % and accuracy of 96. 5 %.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the distributed optimal frequency control of multi-area power system with operational constraints, including the regulation capacity of individual control {{area and the}} power limits on tie-lines. Both generators and controllable loads are utilized to recover nominal frequencies while minimizing regulation cost. We study two control modes: the per-node <b>balance</b> <b>mode</b> and the network <b>balance</b> <b>mode.</b> In Part I of the paper, we only consider the per-node balance case, where we derive a completely decentralized strategy {{without the need for}} communication between control areas. It can adapt to unknown load disturbance. The tie-line powers are restored after load disturbance, while the regulation capacity constraints are satisfied both at equilibrium and during transient. We show that the closed-loop systems with the proposed control strategies carry out primal-dual updates for solving the associated centralized frequency optimization problems. We further prove the closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable and converge to the unique optimal solution of the centralized frequency optimization problems and their duals. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. In Part II of the paper, we address the network power balance case, where transmission congestions are managed continuously...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a general analytic approach to constrained balancing {{that is consistent with}} past influence coefficient methods is described. The approach uses Lagrange multipliers to impose orbit and/or weight constraints; these constraints are combined with the least squares minimization process to provide a set of coupled equations that result in a single solution form for determining correction weights. Proper selection of constraints results in the capability to: (1) balance higher speeds without disturbing previously <b>balanced</b> <b>modes,</b> thru the use of modal trial weight sets; (2) balance off-critical speeds; and (3) <b>balance</b> decoupled <b>modes</b> by use of a single balance plane.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the brand “owner” is very {{influential}} in positioning the brand and when the brand “owner” ceases his or her active role the brand will be perceived differently by the consumers. Balance Theory (HBT), a cognitive psychological theory, studies the triadic relationships between two persons and an entity and predicts that when a person’s original perception of the relationship is disturbed, the person restructures to a new balanced perception. Consequently, this research was undertaken to: conceptualize the brand owner’s impact on consumer’s brand perception; test the applicability of both the static and dynamic predictions of the Heider’s Balance Theory in brand owner-consumer-brand relation (OCB); construct and test a model of brand owner-consumer-brand relation; and examine if personality has an influence on OCB. A discovery-oriented approach was taken to understand the selected market segment, the ready-to-wear and diffusion lines of international designer labels. Chinese Brand Personality Scale, fashion proneness and hedonic and utilitarian shopping scales were developed, and validated. 51 customers were surveyed. Both traditional and extended methods used in the Balance Theory were employed in this study. Responses to liked brand have been used to test and develop the model, while those for disliked brand were used for test and confirmation. A “what if’ experimental approach was employed to test the applicability of dynamic HBT theory in OCB Model. The hypothesized OCB Model has been tested and validated. Consumers have been found to have separate views on the brand and the brand owner; and their responses to contrasting ethical and non-ethical news of the brand owner are different. Personality has been found to have an influence and two personality adapted models have been tested and validated. The actual results go beyond the prediction of the Balance Theory. Dominant triple positive <b>balance</b> <b>mode,</b> dominant negative <b>balance</b> <b>mode,</b> and mode of extreme antipathy have been found. It has been found that not all <b>balanced</b> <b>modes</b> are good for the brand. Contrary to Heider’s findings, simply liking may not necessarily lead to unit relation in the OCB Model.
