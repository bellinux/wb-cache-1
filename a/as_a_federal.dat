5|$|For example, between 1985 and 1991, over 75 public {{officials}} {{were convicted of}} corruption offenses in the Southern District of West Virginia alone. By comparison, the only appellate court decision citing West Virginia's Bribery and Corrupt Practices Act, in 1991, was a federal court decision involving the state statute <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> RICO predicate.|$|E
5|$|From 1945, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was governed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> socialist state {{comprising}} six {{newly created}} republicsâ€“ Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The current border between Serbia and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas {{with a majority}} Serb population to the Socialist Republic of Serbia and those with a Croatian majority to the Socialist Republic of Croatia. This left a large Serb minority in Croatian territory.|$|E

Most of Hand's early cases concerned bankruptcy issues, which he found tiresome, and patent law, which fascinated him.|$|E

5|$|A {{hospital}} {{had originally been}} installed at Alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late 19th century. During its time <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital staff were U.S. Public Health Service employees assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs. Prisoners in ill health were often kept in the hospital, most famously, Stroud and Al Capone, who spent years in it.|$|E
5|$|After the 1982 Tylenol murders, new FDA {{regulations}} {{went into}} effect which made it a federal - rather than just a state or local - crime to tamper with consumer products. Local and state authorities are not, however, prevented from also filing charges in such cases. Under this law, Nickell's crime was prosecutable <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> product tampering case {{as well as a}} state murder case, and she was convicted not of murder, but of product tampering that caused death. The possibility of state charges for the actual murders of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell continues to exist.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported. He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement his small salary <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> judge. This allowed him to keep his personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1930s, the state of California had floated the idea of {{diverting}} water from the rainy north to support irrigation in the fertile, but dry San Joaquin Valley. A diversion of the Trinity River was contemplated in order to boost the available water supply for the Central Valley watershed, but planners eventually determined that the extra water was not yet needed. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation took over the Central Valley Project from the bankrupt state of California during the Great Depression in 1933 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> public works project, and in 1942 it began investigations to dam the Trinity River. However, the Trinity River plan was dropped in 1945, {{after the completion of}} nearby Shasta Dam.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, the libraries, combined, {{employed}} about 120 people (FTE), {{of which}} 23 were librarians. The three {{had a total}} of almost 1.6 million volumes in the collections, 16,992 serials, 2.1 million microform documents, and 3,849 e-books. The Valley Library alone contained 1.4 million volumes and 14,000 serials out of those totals. Valley also has over 500,000 government documents and maps, as it has served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Federal</b> Depository Library since 1907 and is a deposit library for the state government as well. The three libraries combined had a budget of $10.8 million and a circulation of 347,000 while servicing 24,000 inter-library loans and averaging about 34,000 people per week at the libraries.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E

5|$|Cordray has the {{distinction}} of being an undefeated five-time champion and Tournament of Champions semifinalist on Jeopardy! In 1987, he won $45,303 from the show, which he used to pay law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a used car. The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest streak and $5,000 for a first round win on the Tournament of Champions. His campaign for public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the Super Jeopardy! elimination tournament of champions. ABC, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding Celebrity Jeopardy!). He did, however, compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, but finished second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> employee, however, he turned down the $5,000 consolation money he won in the match.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San MartÃ­n offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in RÃ­o de Janeiro he was informed that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San MartÃ­n did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San MartÃ­n the government. San MartÃ­n declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law {{and let his}} party membership lapse.

New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 {{to see if he}} was interested in running <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E
