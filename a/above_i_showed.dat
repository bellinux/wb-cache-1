40|$|Geneticists {{have studied}} the tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum, for several decades and now {{obtained}} a saturated linkage map on which numerous genes controlling morphological traits and disease resistances, and molecular markers have been positioned. They also investigated the chromosomes of tomato, which are clearly distinguishable under the microscope and very appropriate for cytogenetic studies on their molecular organisation and behaviour during mitotic and meiotic divisions. Chromosomes can best be studied at pachytene, meiotic prophase stage in which the strongly condensed heterochromatin regions are most obvious. Heterochromatin consists to a greater part of repetitive sequences and constitutes about 75 % of the tomato genome. The less condensed parts of the chromosomes, the euchromatin, are the domains of low copy and coding sequences. In my PhD study I focused {{on a number of}} basic questions on the occurrence of repetitive and single copy sequences in the euchromatin and heterochromatin areas. To answer these questions 1 used both a normal diploid tomato cultivar and a full series of monosomic additions each with one of the twelve tomato chromosomes added to tetraploid potato. Monosomic additions are of great importance for plant breeding and have been produced by directed transfer and incorporation of chromosome tomato segments and genes into the potato genome. These aneuploids are also eminent for studying individual tomato chromosomes, positioning molecular markers on chromosome maps, characterization of alien chromosome material and heterologous expression of genes in the genetic background of a related species, In Chapter 2 we have given a review on the most significant properties of these aneuploids in a number of crop species. Strikingly, Wageningen geneticists have always been in the very top of this research field, working on several interspecific (interge-neric) hybridisation programmes aiming at producing and characterization of monosomic additions such as union Allium fistulosum xA. cepa), tomato in potato, potato in Lycopersi-con peruvianum, rye in wheat, and Beta procumbens /patellaris in beet. In my thesis I describe how monosomic additions can be characterised by "genome painting", a technique based on Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation (FISH), and RFLP markers with known positions on the genetic map. In Chapter 3 we showed how the molecular AFLP markers can be localised cytogenetically on the alien tomato chromosome. The assignment of such tomato specific AFLPs is based on polymorphic tomato bands in an AFLP fingerprint that occurs both in the tomato parent and one of the monosomic additions, but not in the potato parent. In this manner we succeeded to position seventy AFLP markers on the tomato chromosomes. For {{the other part of the}} cytogenetic investigation we used the diploid cherry tomato cultivar to elucidate where and how often specific repetitive and single copy sequences can be mapped using a number of molecular cytogenetic tools, which I explained in Chapter 4. Here I describe the renaissance of the long forgotten Cot technique, a method for isolating repetitive DNA fractions by reannealing of single stranded genomic tomato DNA under controlled conditions and for a specific time. The C 0 t- 1, Cot- 10 and Cot- 100 obtained ac- cordingly, consists of highly repetitive (HR), high and middle {HMR), and high, middle and low repetitive DNA (HLMR), respectively. FISH with these fractions as probes on mitotic chromosome and pachytene complements revealed that HR covers the rDNA and telomere domains, whereas HMR and especially HMLR also paint the other repeat classes. Cot [...] 100 hybridizes on all heterochromatin regions and was therefore chosen as general, anonymous indicator of the major repeats in tomato. We also applied the result of this analysis in a Southern hybridisation of Cot- 100 on 8 oo BAC clones of the Heinz 1706 tomato library spotted on a filter, showing that 30 % of the BAC clones are relatively rich in repetitive DNA sequences. These BACs will soon be annotated in the BAC library database so that the information can be used for avoiding BACs for physical mapping studies. In this study we also used FISH to map variousrepeats,including the tomato specificTGR 2, TGR 3 and TGR 4, three microsatellites, [GA] 8, [GACA] 4 and [GATA] 4, that were used in previous genetic studies, and the Tyi-Copia retrotransposon. Especially the new TGR 4 >a new satellite repeat from BAC 57 J 04 >is of great importance as FISH showed that the BAC paints exclusively the functional centromeres of all chromosomes. Based on morphology of the pachytene chromosomes and presence / absence of the repeats studied so far we now can distinguish six chromatin classes in tomato: 1) euchromatin, 2) chromomeres (small, condensed chromatin islands in euchromatin, 3) distal heterochromatin and interstitial heterochromatic knobs, 4) pericentromeric heterochromatin, 5) functional centromere heterochromatin and 6) chromatin of the satellite and the nucleolar organiser region (NOR). The 70 % non-repeat fraction of the tomato genome contains the gene sequences and various single copy and low copy sequences. A greater part is located in the euchromatin, but as we showed in Chapter 5, such sequences can also occur in the heterochromatin and centromere regions. For further localisation of these sequences we used a special technique known as BAC-FlSH in which one or several BACs as probes are used in a multicolour FISH experiment on the well-differentiated pachytene chromosomes as targets. The advantage of BACs as probes is that the sequences are always large enough to be visualised in the fluorescence microscope. However clones containing long stretches of repeats will generate excessive cross hybridisation on other chromosome regions, and so will produce too much FISH background for unequivocal interpretation of the results. Using unlabelled competitor Cot- 100 in a FISH experiment together with the labelled BAC probe can effectively suppress hybridisation of the repeat sequences, and so is helpful of positioning BACs even from repeat-rich heterochromatin areas of the chromosomes 6 and 12 (Chapters 5 and 6) and several other species. In the molecular cytogenetic study on chromosomal positions of BACs on chromosome 6 we also improved digital image techniques for producing multicolour FISH in several respects. We described how DAPI images of pachytene chromosomes can best be displayed in gray values and sharpened with a Hi-Gauss filter, and how FISH images of three labelling / detection combinations (FITC, Cy 3 and Cy 5) can be merged in a combinatorial labeling scheme, thus producing pseudocolours for up to seven different BACs simultaneously used in a single hybridisation experiment (Chapter 6). In our study on mapping J 0 intless- 2 in the centromere of chromosome 12 we selected five BACs on the basis of molecular markers that are genetically linked to the Jointless- 2 gene. BAC-FISH on pachytene chromosomes revealed that the region of interest was located in the centromere of the chromosome (Chapter 5). Sequence analysis of this 326 kb chromosome region will soon be finished and its components will be analysed by FISH. In the paragraphs <b>above</b> <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> the significance of molecular cytogenetic tools, and in particular BAC FISH for supporting "chromosome walking" and DNA sequencing as strategies for physical mapping of the tomato genome. At this moment part of this research is being carried out in the frame work of the Dutch CBSG (Centre for BioSystems and Genomics), which aims at the construction of a fuIl physical map of chromosome 6 euchroma-tin regions of tomato. In addition, my research will receive much attention by the tomato geneticists in the International Solanaceae Genome Project (SOL), a recently started global initiative in which tomato as model for all Solanaceae will be fully sequenced. Our recently acquired knowledge will undoubtedly play a key role on accurately and effectively mapping more than 1500 BACs distributed over all twelve tomato chromosomes planned for sequencing in this ambitious project...|$|E

It has become clear {{in the past few years}} that it also poses a multi-faceted challenge. In order to compute the tiny primordial baryonic excess, we probably must invoke physics beyond the standard model (an exciting prospect for most people), we must push perturbation theory to its ``limits'' (or beyond), and we must deal with nonequilibrium aspects of the phase transition. In this talk, I focus mainly on the latter issue, that of nonequilibrium aspects of first order transitions. In particular, I discuss the elusive question of ``weakness''. What does it mean to have a weak first order transition, and how can we distinguish between weak and strong? I argue that weak and strong transitions have very different dynamics; while strong transitions proceed by the usual bubble nucleation mechanism, weak transitions are characterized by a mixing of phases as the system reaches the critical temperature from <b>above.</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that it is possible to clearly distinguish between the two, and discuss consequences for studies of first order transitions in general.

The dissertation demonstrates that the IPE literature on SWF is divided between realists, mercantilists and financial economists. Through my research, I advance three related set of propositions.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the contribution that actor Edward G. Robinson brought to the American film industry, beginning with his iconic role as gangster Little Caesar in Mervyn Le Roy’s 1931 production, and continuing with widely-acclaimed parts in classic film noirs such as Double Indemnity, The Woman in the Window and Scarlet Street. Edward G. Robinson was actually a Romanian Jew, born Emmanuel Goldenberg in Bucharest, in 1893, a relatively little known fact nowadays. By examining his biography, filmography and his best-known, most successful films (mentioned <b>above),</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that Edward G. Robinson was one of classical Hollywood’s most influential actors; for instance, traits of his portrayal of Little Caesar (one {{of the very first}} American gangster films) can be found in almost all subsequent cinematic gangster figures, from Scarface to Vito Corleone. In the same vein, the doomed noir characters he played in Fritz Lang’s The Woman in the Window and Scarlet Street are still considered by film critics today to be some of the finest, most nuanced examples of noir heroes. Therefore, the main body of my article will be dedicated to a more detailed analysis of these films, while the introductory section will trace his biography and discuss some of his better-known films, such as Confessions of a Nazi Spy and Key Largo. The present study highlights Edward G.

40|$|While {{remaining}} {{rooted in}} a comparison {{of some of the}} primary texts of the thinkers under scrutiny, my thesis also discusses several issues which arise in the mutual consideration of Heidegger and Strauss, specifically the questions of the ontological and political status of nature, the problem of ‘first philosophy,’ and the method by which to interpret philosophical texts, as well as a continuous analysis of Strauss’s appellation of ‘modern,’ as opposed to ‘ancient,’ and ‘religious,’ as opposed to ‘philosophical,’ to Heidegger’s thought. I first consider every moment in Strauss’s corpus where he discusses Heidegger’s thought. From this discussion, I identify four main lines of critique which may be extracted from Strauss’s writings on Heidegger. Then, I turn to Heidegger’s texts themselves in order to determine if Strauss’s critique indeed finds purchase there, addressing each of the lines of critique in turn. Finally, I consider Strauss and Heidegger in tandem, in light of the three questions identified <b>above.</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that many of what Strauss determines to be Heidegger’s errors arose {{as a result of the}} way that Heidegger read ancient philosophical texts, and I suggest that Strauss’s approach, i. e., to consider the possible esoteric meaning of a text, in fact permits the reader to access an interpretation that is truer to the textual phenomena. This claim, however, is not intended to obscure the remarkable similarities between each thinker’s respective interpretive methods. I conclude that Strauss’s critique of Heidegger, vehement as it is, also indicates Strauss’s dependence on Heidegger’s thought for the inspiration of Strauss’s own philosophical project. The relation between Strauss and Heidegger, then, remains profoundly ambiguous...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 In this {{dissertation}} I {{study how}} economic activity outside of government control [...] informality [...] impacts policy-making {{in a small}} open economy. I also study the impact of labor mobility in a currency union on {{the welfare of the}} union. Chapter 1 is concerned with the impact of informality on the Ramsey optimal fiscal and monetary policy. In particular, I ask: how does economic activity outside of government control affect the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy? I study this question in a New Keynesian, small open economy model. The model is assumed to feature informality in both goods and labor markets. A non-traded sector produces a non-taxed informal good. The traded sector produces a formal good and is subject to taxation, but it can hire workers using both formal and informal contracts. <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that the presence of informality decreases the optimal tax rate and increases macroeconomic volatility. Moreover, when the country cannot credibly precommit to the optimal policy, informality significantly increases the incentive to peg the currency. This result can help explain why many sub-Saharan African countries have plans to either expand existing currency unions or to form new ones. In Chapter 1 I also investigate the impact of the informal sector on fiscal policy: the tax rate levied by the government in the formal sector and the amount of public debt. With the steady state of the theoretical model described <b>above,</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that the presence of informality decreases the optimal tax rate and increases the level of public debt. Using a panel data of developing countries, I empirically document the negative relationship between the size of the informal sector on the tax rate and its positive relationship with public debt. Chapter 2 is concerned with how migration within a currency union affects welfare across the union. In particular, I study this question in this paper with a New Keynesian currency union model. The union consists of two countries whose economies are characterized by labor market frictions. One country member has a higher job-finding rate and a lower unemployment rate compared to the other country, hence unemployed agents in the latter have an incentive to relocate to the former. <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that when firms have the ability to hire workers from abroad and when unemployed agents can relocate to a different country, the negative impact of asymmetric shocks is significantly reduced, improving welfare across the union on average...|$|R

Patron-clients relationships are the main theoretical object of the book. It is a classic theme of Mediterranean anthropology that I largely reappraise from {{a detailed account of}} intimate day-to-day ways to relate to the leader / others / objects representing others (etc.). I draw my observation from the palace of Walid bek Joumblatt in Mukhtara where he held audiences, followers and people from the Chouf and <b>above.</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that patron-clients relationships are manifolds: one doesn’t rely in the same manners be he the head of the household, a young student, a woman, an ex-militiaman, etc. I explore the richness of these relationships and the complexity of relatedness along different perspective, each offering a particular point of view about the Joumblatts and their people, self-branded “Sons of the Mountain”. The work also explores the construction of these “sons of the Mountain” and what it means. It offers an insight into the relation between local political entity (with deep rooted history and a fierce sense of space) and the recent not so legitimate State of Lebanon. I aim at an original political anthropology of Lebanon. The synthesis entitled “About relation” offer an encompassing appraisal of 20 year of researching the Druzes in Middle East. <b>I</b> <b>show</b> the major difference between my fieldwork in Israel (and the book issued from it Les Maîtres du secret) and the fieldwork in Lebanon.

La monographie originale qui en constitue le cœur porte sur les Druzes de la Montagne libanaise parmi lesquels j’ai réalisé une ethnographie sur le long terme (1999 - 2009). L’objet central de l’ouvrage porte sur la relation de patron-client, thème classique de l’anthropologie méditerranéenne, que je reconfigure largement à partir d’une observation de l’intime et des manières d’être entre le palais du « seigneur du Chouf », Walid bek Joumblatt et les habitants de la Montagne (druzes en majorité). Je déploie l’étude de cette relation entre montrant qu’elle n’est pas construite de la même manière selon que l’on est chef de famille, jeune, femme ou ancien milicien.

6000|$|I {{was filled}} with {{surprised}} regret when I learned from {{the conclusion of the}} article on [...] "Specialized Administration," [...] that this statement is held by Mr. Spencer to be a, misinterpretation of his views. Perhaps I ought to be still more sorry to be obliged to declare myself, even now, unable to discover where my misinterpretation lies, or in what respect my presentation of Mr. Spencer's views differs from his own most recent version of them. As the passage cited <b>above</b> <b>shows.</b> <b>I</b> have carefully defined the sense in which I use the terms which I employ, and, therefore, I am not greatly concerned to defend the abstract appropriateness of the terms themselves. And when Mr. Spencer maintains the only proper functions of Government to be those which are comprehensible under the description of [...] "Negatively regulative control," [...] I may suggest that the difference between such [...] "Negative Administration" [...] and [...] "Administrative Nihilism," [...] in the sense defined by me, is not easily discernible.|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{systemic}} inflammatory disease of large and medium sized arteries, developing slowly and silently over decades. The disease {{is usually not}} apparent until occurrence of a sudden clinical symptom, such as myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Several classical risk factors have been established {{to play a role}} in the progression of disease over a long period of time. However, markers recognizing vulnerable patients being at risk of having an event in the near future are lacking. Thus, more knowledge about the ongoing complex pathogenesis is needed for identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of atherosclerosis. Patients with carotid atherosclerosis experiencing cerebral symptoms within one month before undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are classified having vulnerable plaques. Based on the classification <b>above,</b> <b>I</b> <b>show</b> in this thesis that mRNA levels of enzymes in the leukotriene 5 -lipoxygenase pathway, 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) and leukotriene A 4 hydrolase (LTA 4 H), are associated with plaque vulnerability. Gene expression can be investigated on a single target level using real-time PCR or by analyzing thousands of genes simultaneously, using global transcription microarrays. Based on correlations to microarrays we argue for using total RNA mass in normalization of real-time PCR data, when analyzing heterogeneous human specimen. To identify new candidates of plaque vulnerability an unbiased approach was used - transcript profiles of symptomatic plaques were compared to asymptomatic plaques, demonstrating an increase of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP 4), which was associated with vulnerability, independent of age or gender. FABP 4 localize mainly to the numerous macrophages present in the atherosclerotic plaque. This study suggests FABP 4 {{to play a role in}} plaque vulnerability and to be a potential valuable biomarker within the carotid atherosclerotic plaque. To determine if any atherosclerosis-related changes can be detected in circulating cells the transcriptome of leukocytes in the circulation from an experimental atherosclerotic model Apoe-/-was analyzed. Surprisingly, we also here identify FABP 4 as a marker in neutrophils and monocytes reflecting atherosclerotic lesion progression. Moreover, I observe human monocytes and neutrophils from the circulation to be positive for FABP 4. Our findings make FABP 4 in circulating cells interesting for functional investigations, and an appealing and easy accessible biomarker target for potential future translation into clinical purposes. In conclusion, I have studied inflammatory genes being involved in the pathogenic process during atherosclerosis using human and experimental models. In brief, we demonstrate that human vulnerable plaques display increased mRNA levels of 5 -LO and LTA 4 H, and FABP 4. In addition, the latter is shown in an experimental model, to be a potential valuable biomarker in circulating leukocytes reflecting the extent of atherosclerotic lesion. Our discoveries in the human plaque may be of future clinical relevance to identify vulnerable plaques, whereas FABP 4 in leukocytes potentially could be useful for recognizing asymptomatic patients before onset of symptoms...|$|R
40|$|One {{focus in}} Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) {{has been the}} {{detection}} of absences from texts which mystify the social agents being described. This {{is the focus of}} this article, the text-data coming from a UK newspaper website campaign to allow parents access to information about child sex offenders. CDA is explicit about being politically committed in its text analysis. But this commitment becomes problematic when CD analysts are analysing texts to assess how texts are likely to mystify readers generally. To make such assessments valid, I argue that analysts need to try to reduce the intrusion of their own subjectivity especially if they are not members of the target readership. CDA is theoretically eclectic, but absent from its theoretical sources is biologically-based explanation. This article contributes to mystification analysis in CDA. Using the text-data mentioned <b>above</b> as illustration, <b>I</b> <b>show</b> the following: how evolutionary psychology, a biologically-grounded paradigm, {{can be used as a}} lens over potentially any text-data relating to child sex offenders to highlight social agent absences which are mystifying for readers generally, while simultaneously reducing analyst subjectivity. The article also contributes more generally to CDA methodology for the detection of mystifying absences from texts. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Characterization of an animal’s {{movement}} patterns and the motivations behind those movements can {{allow us to}} predict their response {{to changes in the}} environment or ecosystem. In my thesis, I use biotelemetry data and mechanistic models to investigate the movements of albacore tuna within the context of their thermal biology as they move through a dynamic and heterogeneous thermal environment. My results indicate that albacore have thermal habitat constraints dictated by their inability to maintain a functional body temperature in SST below 11 °C, and high behavioral and physiological costs at SST <b>above</b> 20 °C. <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that albacore migrations are longer and have more consistent phenology and direction when fish are migrating between habitats whose sea surface temperatures trend below 13 ºC and above 20 ºC. Albacore time their migrations with annual changes in the temperatures of their origins and destinations. <b>I</b> also <b>show</b> that thermal fronts serve as a dual resource to albacore. I characterize the movement of four tunas as they utilize sub-mesoscale features associated with a thermal front. For two weeks, the tunas swam between the warmest and coldest available waters, making on average 50 trips across the front per day, with 85 % of these occurring during daytime. The use of the warm side of the front resulted in an increase in body temperature, and the strength of the front was directly correlated with foraging success. This work provides the necessary parameters to model albacore movement and a mechanistic understanding of the limits to albacore distribution...|$|R
