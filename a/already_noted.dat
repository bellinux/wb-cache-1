5|$|In general, {{like with}} many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy {{prescriptions}} it generates are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions {{on the nature of the}} industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper part}} of the Syrian Euphrates valley has been intensively {{occupied}} at least since the Late Natufian period (10,800–9500 BC). Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European travellers had <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> the presence of numerous archaeological sites in the area that would be flooded by the new reservoir. In order to preserve or at least document as many of these remains as possible, an extensive archaeological rescue programme was initiated during which more than 25 sites were excavated.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's offense broke or tied 14school bowl records, either {{individually}} or as a team. In {{addition to the}} ones <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> the Hokies' 18first downs by passing, 398yards passing, 551yards of total offense, 24passes completed, 49points scored and four passing touchdowns were also new school bowl records. Tech's 26rushing plays were the fewest in a Virginia Tech bowl game. California's offense set school bowl records for most points (52), total yards (530), passing yards (394), completion percentage (77.1%, 27-of-35), touchdowns (seven), and rushing touchdowns (five).|$|E

5|$|Before {{and after}} the 1913 hiatus, with Bogdan-Pitești and Arghezi at its helm, Seara {{expanded}} its range, encouraging the development of modernist literature, and playing {{a part in the}} transition from Romanian Symbolism to 20th century avant-garde. Its art chronicles celebrated the international success of modern artists Constantin Brâncuși and Pascin, both of whom, Seara argued, were culturally tied to Romania. Revising its stance, the newspaper published Arghezi's account of the new Tinerimea Artistică modern art exhibit (April 1913), mentioning Bogdan-Pitești's role as an art patron and instigator of change. The two intellectuals also promoted the works by young artist Theodor Pallady, most notably with a series of articles in which Arghezi spoke about Pallady paintings in the Bogdan-Pitești collection. The magazine, <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> for publishing political cartoons by Nicolae Petrescu Găină, was also joined by Marcel Janco, known later for his work as a Dada and Constructivist artist.|$|E
5|$|The {{zygomatic}} {{plates are}} almost completely vertical. As Winge <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> the front {{margin of the}} zygomatic plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge, which connects the plate {{to the body of}} the skull. This feature distinguishes J.anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines, but the zygomatic plate of living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J.anoblepas. In addition, the connection between the zygomatic plate and the antorbital bridge is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly. More than in other Juliomys species, the front part of the zygomatic arches is bended forward and the zygomatic plates are bended outward. Furthermore, the zygomatic notch, the notch between the zygomatic plate and arch, is deep, not shallow as in J.ossitenuis and J.rimofrons.|$|E
5|$|The castles made a clear, {{imperial}} {{statement about}} Edward's intentions to rule North Wales {{on a permanent}} basis. As <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> they were typically located on sites that had {{been associated with the}} former Welsh princes. Caernarfon, in particular, stands out for its use of banded, coloured stone in the walls, statues of eagles and its polygonal, rather than round, towers. There has been extensive academic debate over the interpretation of these features. Historian Arnold Taylor argued that the design of the castle was a representation of the Walls of Constantinople. The conscious use of imagery from the Byzantine Roman Empire was therefore an assertion of authority by EdwardI. Recent work by historian Abigail Wheatley suggests that the design of Caernarfon was indeed an assertion of Edward's authority, but that it drew on imagery from Roman sites in Britain with the intent of creating an allusion of Arthurian legitimacy for the king.|$|E

At this point we <b>already</b> <b>note</b> that existing multistandard interleavers target a specific set of standards, whereas we aim at a truly programmable architecture.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the bayonet in the late 17th century led to the bayonet charge becoming the main infantry charge tactic through the 19th century and into the 20th. As early as the 19th century, tactical scholars were <b>already</b> <b>noting</b> that most bayonet charges {{did not result in}} close combat. Instead, one side usually fled before actual bayonet fighting ensued. The act of fixing bayonets has been held to be primarily connected to morale, the making of a clear signal to friend and foe of a willingness to kill at close quarters.|$|R

These names represent the principal families in each clan: Njo, Priso, Akwa, Ebele-Deido, and Bell, respectively. In addition, the Duala sometimes include the Bodiman, Pongo, and Wuri among their ranks, but not as sub-lineages.|$|E

Similar to the dramatic tides of Bay of Fundy, the Cook Inlet's waters prior to 1964 would rise or fall 26 feet every six hours during the peak tides. After the Good Friday earthquake on March 27, 1964, which registered 9.2 on the moment magnitude scale, the surrounding land mass dropped six feet.|$|E
25|$|His {{concern to}} provide music for children, <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> was pursued in Little Songs for Little Voices {{published}} in three volumes, including 76 short and simple songs. They were his earliest compositions and appeared in Aunt Judy's Magazine, edited first by his mother, then by his sister. Two of these songs, The Sneezing Song and Three Little Pigs were sung by Scott-Gatty {{himself in a}} concert at Doncaster Grammar School on 21 June 1870, long before they were published. He sang Three Little Pigs again in 1871 along with Camomile Tea, Tittle Tattle and The Yawning Song.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{primarily}} discusses subjectivity {{with regard}} to religious matters. As <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> he argues that doubt {{is an element of}} faith and {{that it is impossible to}} gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed likely to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.|$|E

25|$|Returning in the ships, Antón de Alaminos imposed {{slow and}} {{vigilant}} navigation, moving only by day, {{because he was}} certain that Yucatán was an island. The travellers' greatest hardship, a scarcity of potable water aboard, added to their woes. The stores of water, casks and jugs were not of the quality required for long voyages ("we were too poor to buy good ones", laments Bernal); the casks were constantly losing water and they also failed to keep it fresh, and so de Córdoba's ships needed to replenish their supplies ashore. The Spaniards had <b>already</b> <b>noted</b> that the region seemed to be devoid of freshwater rivers.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{writings}} of the Báb have been lost. The Báb himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qur'an, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of text. Nabíl-i-Zarandí, in The Dawn-breakers, mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qur'an, revealed during the Báb's imprisonment at Maku, which have been lost without a trace. Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, as <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the Báb's major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted secretaries.|$|E
25|$|Timesitheus {{served as}} Praetorian Prefect for some {{three years from}} 241 {{until his death in}} 243. The only {{narrative}} source on his term of office is the SHA and, as <b>already</b> <b>noted,</b> the author of the Vita Tres Gordiani could hardly have been more fulsome in singing his praises, both as the father-in-law of the young emperor and as the protector of the Empire. This generous assessment is supported by two citations of supposed correspondence between Timesitheus and Gordian (probably invented) and a number of topoi familiarly used in Latin historiography to define a worthy servant of the state - i.e. a crackdown on sale of offices by members of the palatini, care for the defence of the frontiers and exemplary behaviour in his capacity as commander of the Praetorian Guard. The favourable view of Timesitheus's term of office entertained by the SHA is not challenged by modern scholars - although the inadequacy of the data is acknowledged.|$|E
