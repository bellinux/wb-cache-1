50|$|The first {{recorded}} experiments in anti-magnetic watch-making are in 1846. Watchmakers from Vacheron Constantin {{were among the}} first to experiment with anti-magnetic features of a watch. However, they succeeded in assembling the first <b>antimagnetic</b> <b>watch</b> only several decades later. That watch was able to withstand magnetic fields because some of its parts were made of non-magnetic metals: the palladium-made balance wheel, balance spring and the lever shaft.|$|E
50|$|The Rolex Oyster Perpetual Milgauss is a {{wristwatch}} model {{introduced by}} Rolex in 1956 with model number 6541. The Milgauss {{was designed as}} an <b>antimagnetic</b> <b>watch</b> specifically for those who worked in power plants, medical facilities and research labs (like CERN in Geneva) where electromagnetic fields can cause havoc with the timing of a watch. The current (post-2007) model Milgauss {{is equipped with a}} magnetic alloy (Parachrom-Blu) hairspring and movement encased by a magnetic shield, most likely composed of a high magnetic permeability material (see Mu-metal or Permalloy). The name Milgauss is derived from the Latin mille, which means one-thousand, and gauss, the unit of a magnetic field. This model is so named because it can withstand a magnetic flux density of 1,000 gauss.|$|E

50|$|Invar is used where high {{dimensional}} stability is required, such as precision instruments, clocks, seismic creep gauges, television shadow-mask frames, valves in engines, and <b>antimagnetic</b> <b>watches.</b> In land surveying, when first-order (high-precision) elevation leveling {{is to be}} performed, the level staff (leveling rod) used is made of Invar, instead of wood, fiberglass, or other metals. Invar struts were used in some pistons to limit their thermal expansion inside their cylinders.|$|R
50|$|Guillaume {{is known}} for his {{discovery}} of nickel-steel alloys he named invar and elinvar. Invar has a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion, making it useful in constructing precision instruments whose dimensions need to remain constant in spite of varying temperature. Elinvar has a near-zero thermal coefficient of the modulus of elasticity, making it useful in constructing instruments with springs that need to be unaffected by varying temperature, such as the marine chronometer. Elinvar is also non-magnetic, which is a secondary useful property for <b>antimagnetic</b> <b>watches.</b>|$|R
