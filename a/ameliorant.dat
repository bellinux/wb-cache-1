The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse of the Indonesian Legumes and Tuber Crops Research Institute (ILETRI), Malang, East Java, and on a dry land of Rumbia district, Lampung Tengah, in the 2005 growing season. Four series of experiments were conducted in the greenhouse using four different ameliorants (dolomite, zeolite, limestone, and organic <b>ameliorant</b> Formula 1). The glasshouse trial was arranged in a completely randomized design with two factors and four replications. The first factor consisted of five <b>ameliorant</b> levels, namely 0, 150, 300, 450, and 600 kg/ha. The second factor consisted of four manure levels, namely 0, 500, 100, and 1500 kg/ha. In the field experiment, a randomized complete block design was used with four replications. Two ameliorants, dolomite and zeolite, were used and the treatment combinations {{were the same as}} those in the glasshouse trial. Results indicated that <b>ameliorant</b> zeolite, dolomite, limestone, and Formula 1 increased plant height, seed weight (yield/pot), and yield of soybean in the field. The effective dose of <b>ameliorant</b> application to achieve 2. 0 - 2. 5 t/ha soybean yield was a combination of 500 - 100 kg/ha manure and 150 - 450 kg/ha each one of the ameliorants dolomite, zeolite, lime or Formula 1. An effective way to apply the soil <b>ameliorant</b> was by placing it in the planting hole or by distributing it along the plant rows.

The use of mineral soil, enriched with electric furnace slag containing high level of cationic irons, as <b>ameliorant</b> is expected to give several benefits. Firstly, it can reduce {{the harmful effects of}} phenolic acids in the soils thereby increasing yield of rice. Secondly, it will form complex bonding that improves peat stability and reduces methane (CH 4) andcarbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. This study evaluated the impact of using <b>ameliorant</b> in three peat soils of Central Kalimantan, i. e. inland peat at Berengbengkel, transitional peat at Sampit, and coastal peat at Samuda. The <b>ameliorant</b> was a combination of Ferich mineral soil (Fe 2 O 3 = 22. 06 %) and electric furnace slag (Fe 2 O 3 = 42. 60 %). The amount of <b>ameliorant</b> was determined based on 5 % maximum adsorption of Fe 3 +. It was found thatinland peat soils emit more CH 4 and CO 2 than transitional and coastal peat soils. The use of <b>ameliorant</b> reduced the rate of the emission significantly. Without amelioration, total amount of carbon losses through CH 4 and CO 2 emission were about 2. 086, 1. 986, and 1. 967 t ha- 1 yr- 1 for inland, transitional, and coastal peats, respectively. <b>Ameliorant</b> application reduced total carbon losses in these three peat soils by about 0. 597, 0. 609, and 0. 628 t ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively, and also significantly the yield of rice.

Use of <b>ameliorants</b> from coastal sediment and salted fish waste was an alternative to improve peatlands productivity and maize yields. Objective {{of the study was}} to examine effects of coastal sediment and salted fish waste on growth and yield of maize at three kinds of soil of peatlands of Kubu Raya, West Kalimantan. This research was conducted in field using Inter-area analysis design. The first factor was combination of each <b>ameliorants</b> which consisted of 5 levels, namely: 1) treatment under farmer custom at the sites (control); 2) coastal sediment of 20 Mg ha- 1 + 0. 75 Mg of salted fish waste ha- 1; 3) coastal sediment of 40 Mg ha- 1 + 1. 5 Mg of salted fish waste ha- 1, 4) coastal sediment of 60 Mg ha- 1 + 2. 25 Mg of salted fish waste ha- 1. The second factor was soil types which consisted of three levels, namely: Typic Haplohemists, Typic Sulfisaprists and Typic Haplosaprists. Each treatment was repeated 5 times.

40|$|Revegetation of ore {{refining}} residue may {{be limited}} by the physical and chemical constraints of the material, necessitating the use of soil covers and <b>ameliorants</b> to improve conditions for plant growth. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the depth of soil cover needed to establish vegetation on saline, sodic, alkaline residue in a mediterranean climate, Western Australia. The effects of three soil covers (10 cm topsoil plus nil, 15 or 30 cm of gravel-rich subsoil (referred to as gravel), on the residue) compared to no cover, of residue <b>ameliorants</b> (broadcast gypsum or compost), and the influence of shrinkage-cracks on plant density, species richness, leaf stress symptoms and root abundance were examined in a 2 -year field experiment. Seedling density on topsoil covers, recruited from the topsoil seedbank and broadcast seeding, was 10 -fold higher than that on bare residue. Live canopy cover with topsoil-only over residue was consistently higher than with topsoil over gravel. Plant roots preferentially grew along the faces of the vertical shrinkage-cracks, as well as fine horizontal cracks and through coarser textured residue strata and had greatest abundance and depth in residue covered by topsoil-only. However, seedling density and species richness declined with topsoil-only cover compared to the thicker cover treatments in the second year. Leaf symptoms from salt damage developed in plants established with topsoil-only on residue. Increasing gypsum broadcast on residue from 30 to 60 tha- 1 increased root abundance and penetration, but had no effect on seedling density. We conclude that the 10 cm cover of topsoil-only, while potentially cheaper to establish, and providing greater initial vigour and vegetation cover, had diminished species diversity after 2 years relative to thicker covers. By contrast the thicker cover (10 cm topsoil plus 15 - 30 cm gravel) slowed initial growth, but combined with 60 tgypsumha- 1 broadcast on the residue, resulted in the most diverse plant community and most vigorous root growth on saline gold oxide processing residue...|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, in Ethiopia, {{large-scale}} {{availability of}} organic materials from traditional {{sources such as}} crop residues and animal manures is becoming a series challenge, because these sources of organic materials are under competing uses for livestock feed, fuel, thatching, temporary construction and others (IFPRI 2010). This scenario would, therefore, dictate the farming community to look for and effectively utilize alternative off-farm organic sources of soil <b>ameliorants.</b> In this regard, {{it is interesting that}} quite huge amount of solid wastes are generated from municipalities, a large part of which is organic and biodegradable. In addition to the municipal solid wastes, the human excreta also constitute a significant component of wastes generated from cities.

Chemical inactivation, an in situ remediation method that used inexpensive chemicals to reduce pollutant solubility in polluted soil, was examined on a Cd-spiked arable soil. The study was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of <b>ameliorants</b> and fertilizers normally recommended for crop cultivation, using tomato as the test plant, {{from the point of view}} to reduce soil Cd extractability and plant Cd concentration. A 100 -day greenhouse experiment in a completely randomized design consisting of three rates of rationale dosage of <b>ameliorants</b> and fertilizers (RDAF) [0, 50, 100 %] and four levels of soil Cd spike [0, 10, 20, 40 mg Cd kg- 1 soil, using 3 CdSO 4. 8 H 2 O] in triplicate was conducted. The 100 % rate of RDAF applied was: 4 ton dolomite ha- 1, 30 ton cow dung ha- 1, 150 kg N ha- 1 (½ Urea + ½ Ammonium Sulfate), 150 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 (SP- 36) and 100 kg K 2 O ha- 1 (KCl). Significant reductions in soil extractable Cd (CdNH 4 OAc-EDTA) [from 13. 35 to 8. 77 mg kg- 1, 34 %] and plant shoots-Cd (Cdps) [from 8. 66 to 5. 46 ìg g- 1, 37 %] were measured at 100 % RDAF treatment as compared to the control soil, indicating the occurrence of an in situ soil Cd inactivation and plant element selective-uptake phenomenon. Multiple regression analysis that incorporating all 36 data pairs resulted in the following equations: (1) soil CdNH 4 OAc-EDTA = – 0. 18 pHH 2 O + 0. 21 PBray# 1 + 0. 51 organic-C – 0. 57 exch. -Mg + 0. 65 Cdaqua regia (R 2 = 0. 76), and (2) Cdps = 0. 08 Nps – 0. 17 Kps – 0. 19 Mgps – 0. 24 Pps + 0. 27 Sps – 0. 41 Caps (R 2 = 0. 54, 3 outliers removed).
