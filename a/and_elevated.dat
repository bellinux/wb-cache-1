5|$|After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, State Street (anchored by Marshall Field's) in the {{downtown}} Loop, especially the Loop Retail Historic District, was the city's retailing center.

5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted <b>and</b> <b>elevated.</b> The result will be an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} that boron plays several {{essential}} roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E

Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad grade crossing). The project was completed in the summer of 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E

5|$|Following the Cincinnati loss, the Hokies had {{one week}} {{to prepare for}} a matchup against No. 17 Miami, the team {{predicted}} to win the Big East in preseason polls. The Hokies had not beaten Miami in 12 previous matchups, but they managed an upset 137 victory on September 23. At the time, the one-week turnaround from embarrassing defeat to unexpected triumph caused some commentators to declare the win the biggest in Virginia Tech football history. Following the Miami win, Virginia Tech started a winning streak that continued {{for the remainder of the}} regular season. In total, Tech won its final nine regular-season games, including two wins over ranked opponents: No. 20 Syracuse and at No. 13 Virginia. The 3629 defeat of Virginia was Tech's closest victory during the span <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> Tech to No. 13 in the nation.|$|E

He was initially signed to the practice squad but was released to make room for Rich Ranglin on September 3 before being resigned to replace Ranglin on September 8. On December 29 (the day before the last game of the 2012 NFL season), the Chiefs placed Terrance Copper on injured reserve <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> Hemingway from injured reserve.|$|E
5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what {{he regarded}} as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it {{had reached a}} new stage, state monopoly capitalism. He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E

5|$|In the Gupta period (3rd to 6th century A.D.), folk {{images of}} Matrikas became {{important}} in villages. The diverse folk goddesses {{of the soldiers}} like Matrikas were acknowledged by the Gupta rulers and their images were carved on royal monuments in order to strengthen the loyalty and adherence of the armed forces. The Gupta kings Skandagupta and Kumaragupta I (c. second half of fifth century) made Skanda (Kumara) their model <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> the position of Skanda's foster mothers, the Matrikas from a cluster of folk goddesses to court goddesses.

5|$|Lusitanos {{can be any}} solid color, {{although}} they are generally gray, bay or chestnut. Horses of the Alter Real strain are always bay. Members of the breed are of Baroque type, with convex facial profiles, heavy muscling, intelligent and willing natures, with agile <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> movement. Originally bred for war, dressage and bullfighting, Lusitanos are still used today in the latter two. They have competed in several Olympics and World Equestrian Games {{as part of the}} Portuguese and Spanish dressage teams. They have also made a showing in driving competitions, with a Belgian team of Lusitanos winning multiple international titles. Members of the breed are still used in bloodless bullfighting today, where it is expected that neither horse or bull will be injured.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° <b>and</b> <b>elevated</b> to +41°.|$|E
