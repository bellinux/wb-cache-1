Iodometric titration, <b>argentometric</b> <b>titration,</b> and potassium ferricyanide titration were chosen for the determination of sulphides in the solution. Anhydrous sodium sulphide and sodium sulphide hydrate were used as model samples. From the point of view to financial and time demands the most advantageous method was potassium ferricyanide titration and the least advantageous method was iodometric titration. The precision of used methods was dependent on type of used sample. Iodometry was the least precise determination of sulphides in the sample of anhydrous sodium sulphide; the precision of argentometry and potassium ferricyanide titration was comparable.

The emulsified nanosphere contained the cationic additive tridodecylmethyl ammonium chloride (TDMAC), the plasticizer, and the ionophore Mn(III) -salophen or Mn(III) -salen. This emulsion was used as titrating agent for thiocyanate complexation with ionophores, which could be transduced using an ion-selective electrode (ISE) as an indicator electrode for the end point detection. The method showed no need for pH control and reliable selectivity, as thiocyanate could be determined in presence of other interfering ions with high accuracy.

Film samples were characterised by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The surface morphology, texture, and uniformity of the silver sulphide layers were formed on PP surface dependent on the number of polymer immersions in the precursor solution.

The in vivo diuretic effects of cleistanthins A and B were determined according to the Lipschitz test. Prior to the experiment, the animals were fasted for 5 h and placed individually in metabolic cages. Cleistanthins A and B (12. 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) and furosemide (5 mg/kg) were suspended in 0. 5 % w/v carboxymethyl cellulose and administered orally. The urine was collected up to 5 h after administration and subsequently up to 24 h after administration. The acidity and urine volume were measured immediately. The urinary sodium and potassium levels were determined using a flame photometer, and the chloride level was determined by <b>argentometric</b> <b>titration.</b> The diuretic index and diuretic activity were calculated mathematically. While cleistanthins A and B showed a diuretic index of more than one, the diuretic activity of these compounds was less than one, indicating inferior activity compared with furosemide.
