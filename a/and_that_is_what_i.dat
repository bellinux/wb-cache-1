25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
500|$|The {{two sides}} to Poulenc's musical nature caused {{misunderstanding}} during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, [...] "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested {{in the works of}} younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, [...] "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today." [...] Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, [...] "There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [...] It was not progress." [...] Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: [...] "You are truly good, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> find again and again in your music".|$|E

[...] She also cited Beyoncé as an inspiration for performing, and Oprah Winfrey for [...] "her courage, talent and life lessons." [...] Paulini listed Beyoncé and Aretha Franklin as vocal inspirations for her album Superwoman (2006).|$|E
2500|$|After {{becoming}} head {{of government}} in 1933, Adolf Hitler ignored the Versailles Treaty provisions. A command for armored forces was created within the German Wehrmacht: the Panzerwaffe, as {{it came to be}} known later. The Luftwaffe (the German air force) was established, and development began on ground-attack aircraft and doctrines. Hitler was a strong supporter of this new strategy. He read Guderian's book Achtung – Panzer! and upon observing armoured field exercises at Kummersdorf he remarked, [...] "That is what I want – <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> will have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky's {{complicated}} {{attitude to}} MIT's military role was expressed in two letters {{published in the}} New York Review Books in 1967. In the first, he wrote that he had [...] "given {{a good bit of}} thought to ... resigning from MIT, which is, more than any other university associated with the activities of the Department of 'Defense'." [...] He also stated that MIT's [...] "involvement in the [...] war effort is tragic and indefensible." [...] Then, in the second letter written to clarify the first, Chomsky said that [...] "MIT as an institution has no involvement in the war effort. Individuals at MIT, as elsewhere, have direct involvement <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had in mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wright later {{claimed that}} his {{decision}} to join the YCV had {{been influenced by the}} Kingsmill massacre of January 1976, when ten local Protestant civilians were killed by republicans. Wright's cousin Jim Wright, future father-in-law Billy Corrigan, and brother-in-law Leslie Corrigan, were also killed by republicans in this period. Wright later said of the Kingsmill massacre, [...] "I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of that bus and shot dead. I was a Protestant and I realised that they had been killed simply because they were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately joined the youth wing of the UVF. I felt it was my duty to help my people <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have been doing ever since." ...|$|E

Sessions later said that the comment was not serious, but did {{apologize}} for it, saying that he considered the Klan to be [...] "a force for hatred and bigotry". Barry Kowalski, a prosecutor in the civil rights division, also heard the remark and testified that prosecutors working such a gruesome case sometimes [...] "resort to operating room humor <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> considered it to be". Another DOJ lawyer, Albert Glenn, said, [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was any seriousness to it." [...] Figures testified that on one occasion, when the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sent the office instructions to investigate a case that Sessions had tried to close, Figures and Sessions [...] "had a very spirited discussion regarding how the Hodge case should then be handled; in the course of that argument, Mr. Sessions threw the file on a table, and remarked, 'I wish I could decline on all of them, by which Figures said Sessions meant civil rights cases generally. Kowalski, however, testified that he believed [...] " [...] was eager to see that justice was done in the area of criminal civil rights prosecutions." ...|$|E
