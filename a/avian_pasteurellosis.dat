40|$|<b>Avian</b> <b>Pasteurellosis</b> is a {{contagious}} disease {{of domestic and}} wild birds caused by Pasteurella mutocida. A turkey farm with a flock size of 500 recorded an acute death of about 102 turkeys {{with the history of}} clinical symptoms such as respiratory distress, anorexia, mucoid discharge from mouth and the nostrils, diarrhea were presented to the Department of Veterinary Pathology, Veterinary College. On thorough postmortem examination, a salient finding of petechial haemorrhages with pinpoint necrotic spots though out the liver parenchyma was observed along with pneumonic changes in lungs and vascular changes in trachea, spleen and intestines. On histopathological examination, liver revealed multifocal areas of coagulative necrosis and haemorrhages. Heart showed separation, fragmentation and degeneration of fibers with extensive inter-muscular haemorrhages. Lungs were congested with haemorrhages and pneumonic changes. Based on history, gross & histopathological lesions and impression smear examination after staining with geimsa and methylene blue, the case was diagnosed as <b>Avian</b> <b>Pasteurellosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} develop washed cell fowl cholera (WCFC) vaccine with virulent avian Pasteurella multocida (PM 38) serotype 1 (X- 73). A total of 20 Fayoumi birds of either sex of 10 weeks aged {{were divided into two}} groups as group A (immunized with washed cell fowl cholera vaccine) and group B (unvaccinated control). Primary vaccination was given through IM route in each birds of group A and booster dose was given through SC route after 15 days of primary vaccination. The presence of antibody against P. multocida was determined by slide agglutination test (SAT) and growth inhibition test (GIT). The degree of antibody levels of prevaccination and post vaccination sera were determined by passive haemagglutination assay (PHA). Sera mean PHA titres at 15, 21, 28 and 42 days post-vaccination in group A were 30. 4 ± 4. 43, 46. 4 ± 6. 06, 67. 2 ± 11. 14 and 134. 4 ± 22. 28 respectively. The present results revealed that WCFC vaccine worked satisfactory in terms of protection rate against <b>Avian</b> <b>Pasteurellosis.</b> It was also demonstrated that experimental WCFC vaccine conferred 80 % protection against challenge infection when all chickens of control group failed to survive against challenge infection...|$|E
