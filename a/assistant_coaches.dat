5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year.

Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more <b>assistant</b> <b>coaches</b> are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.|$|E
