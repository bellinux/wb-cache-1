5000|$|Thomas Allan Abercrombie {{discusses}} the ayllu extensively {{as it exists}} today among the Aymara people in [...] "THE POLITICS OF SACRIFICE: AN AYMARA COSMOLOGY IN ACTION": [...] "The ranking of ayllus is (and was?) performed in an idiom derived from what is ... a central and divisive cleavage {{in the nature of}} the domestic group, birth order among siblings, who are contrasted not only by age but by their differing rights to leadership roles, fiesta-cargo offices, and property. ... Patrilines are not mere aggregates of patronym possessing men and their families, juxtaposed only because of rights in land. Rather, they are structured, internally hierarchical social units, in which collective action is both enabled by, and enables the creation of, formally recognized positions of authority.`... Within the [...] "patristem family" [...] -a group of brothers who have constructed houses around the patio of their father—authority is vested in the father until his death. Afterwards, however, it is the eldest brother, the jiliri or jiliri jilata, who is regarded as becoming the kamachiri. This works out at the level of the sibling group, but what about the group of patristem units, some with nearest linking ancestors beyond the reach of memory? There exists a notion of an informal collective body of jiliris within the hamlet and patriline which can act as a sole council of elders. On close inspection, however, it turns out that these jiliris are neither equal in status nor necessarily eldest brothers within their own patri-stem sibling groups! In fact, jiliri status outside the patristem unit (and this unit begins to fragment after the death of the father of the sibling group) depends on the combination of appropriate [...] "leaderly" [...] personal qualities and the individual's status in the [...] "elder brother and herder-making" [...] system of public ritual careers. Moreover, greatest authority, that accompanied by the power to impose sanctions by force, is said to reside in a body of officials known as the jach'a íilírís. the [...] "great eldest brothers," [...] that is, in ayllu level authorities also known as alcaldes, alguaciles, and íaías. It is almost certain that the name for this last office (the highest ranking of the three), is derived from the root jila, from which both jilata ("brother") and jiliri ("eldest" [...] or [...] "first born") are derived. The patrilineal hamlet as well as ayllu authority is also designated by terms related to herding roles. First, he is compared to the lead animal of the herd, the llantiru (from Sp.delantero, [...] "one who goes before"). Secondly, he is known as the patriline's or ayllu's awatiri (herder), in which capacity the group which recognizes his authority becomes his rama (herd).... Upon his death, the sullk'iri may inherit the house and herd, but it is to the eldest son, not the youngest, that the status of kamachiri falls. And his comnmand extends into serious matters such as the allocation of lands and pastures within the sibling group, control over fallowing cycles, decisions about the opening of new fields (which may lead to warfare with neighboring groups), and the timing/itinerary of collective caravan expeditions to the valleys. In addition, it is the kamachiri who controls important ritual matters (related to herd fertility) which take place at the very altars he does not inherit. ... Like the llama llantiru, the role of eldest brother and the authorities who are called iilírí encode a principle of reproduction. First, as authority at the level of hamnlet, patriline, ayllu, and moiety, the jiliri conjoins the particular domestic groups of a hamlet ando patriline, the patrilines of the ayllu, and the ayllus of a moiety, by standing to all in an equivalent transitive relationship. The sullk'iri, on the other hand, reaps the rewards of inheritance, but is thereby irrevocably identified with the continuity of a particular household-that of his father—rather than with its reproduction. Like the llama-llantiru, the jiliri-llantíru owes his dominant position to control over herds, but here we refer to both animal and human ones. Unlike the youngest brother in the sibling group, who remains essentially a social extension of the father and a permanent dependant, the eldest brother receives the father's [...] "command" [...] (kamachiri), though he is exiled from his father's house and (to a degree) disinherited from his herd. His authority is, in fact, closely connected to his outward-directedness. The eldest brother could be said to be autonomous and self-generating-by establíshing his own house and herd, he is the embodiment not of the continuity of a house and herd (like the sullk'iri), but of the principle of reproduction of the very unit he is excluded from. As such, within and outside the patrigroup the jiliri also embodies the fertility (that is, the expansion) and generativity of the patriline. Like the llama llantiru, the jiliri-llantiru is associated with the conjunction of disparate herds in a new, unified herd. The jiliri's actual leadership role within the sibling group and patronymic hamlet amplifies these associations. The jiliri's [...] "command" [...] extends from the role of arbiter in intra-sibling group disputes, to that of leader of the conjoined brothers in disputes with other sibling groups within the hamlet or patriline. In addition, it is the jiliri who, stereotypically, decides when and where to go on annual trading trips, and conjoins multiple herds to make up the large caravan needed for a successful trip. it is men who are (or are becoming) jiliris who are the most likely to be able to establish a conjoint herd, garner sufficient labor, and otherwise mount a successful trade expedition. Such expeditions are crucially important source of foodstuffs, and are refracted within the collective ritual sphere in an inverse type of caravan trade (carrying foodstuffs to the ayllu-and moiety level [...] "ladder" [...] of the town for the fiesta, and returning empty-handed to the hamlet) through which the status of jach'ajiliri is achieved. But it is not only in his capacity to circulate foodstuffs that the stature of the jiliri is achieved, but in an <b>attendant</b> <b>control</b> over the circulation of the generative substances blood (wila) and fat (as a kind of solidified muju) among the human and animal, and the earthly and otherworldly realms. The point is not that only jiliris establish independent, conjoint households and herds, but that the opposed attributes of youngest and eldest brothers make them appropriate vehicles for representing two opposed facets of the household and herd: the fírst (typified by the youngest brother in dependant filial roles) is its continuity per se, as a particular unit; the second (typified by the eldest brother in independent founding-pater role) the general model or generative principIe of the household and herd as a type of social arrangement produced by, and reproducing, the patriline. Once he has begun his career, or continued an inherited one, the sponsor-jiliri joins the ranks of patriline-hamlet [...] "fathers" [...] and [...] "elder brothers", and with it takes on, at the inter-domestic group level, what was, in the domestic group, the leadership roles of elder brother and father. This role is, of course, a function of the sponsor's [...] "outward directedness", expressed in his ritual duties but represented as well in the terms of the asymmetric relations among exogamous patrilines within the ayllu. Patriline jiliris, like jilaqatas, are made, not born. But they are made in the image of the [...] "self made man" [...] of K'ulta society, the eldest sons, who must build their households themselves through the control they achieve of herds and alliances. Marriage is but the fírst step towards becoming a collective elder brother, herd-leader, and herder of men. The asymmetrical nature of marriage alliances, however, does not make a man into a herder of men, but a subordinate member of the herds of his wife's brother and wife's father, and he will remain thus subordinated until he turns the relation on its head by becoming a herder of his own sisters' and daughters' husbands. Accomplishing this involves withholding one's children's inheritance and [...] "seniority" [...] as long as possible, just as it requires establishing oneself in the status of superior among equals among one's own sibling group".|$|E

40|$|This {{first chapter}} {{develops}} an economic {{model of the}} firm linking current financial and non-financial measures to future earnings for retail banks. The data support the associations among current financial and non-financial measures predicted by model, suggesting that the economic model is applicable to the firms in my sample. I use the model to specify the regression of future earnings on current financial and non-financial.

I then interpret the coefficients on individual financial and non-financial measures {{in the context of the}} economic model. The second chapter finds some empirical support for the two main predictions of Jensen and Meckling 2 ̆ 7 s (1992) theory on organizational design choices: (a) the allocation of decision rights to branch managers is associated with control systems that measure their performance and reward them based on these performance measures, and (b) the allocation of decision rights to branch managers and the <b>attendant</b> <b>control</b> systems are associated with the costs of transferring knowledge from branch managers to the top management. However, a simultaneous equation of these organizational design choices indicates that these choices, while correlated, are not made simultaneously. ...|$|E
40|$|The small, {{chemically}} primitive {{objects of}} the solar system, comets and asteroids, {{are one of the}} most important frontiers remaining for future planetary exploration. So stated the Solar System Exploration Committee of the NASA Advisory Council in its 1986 report 'Planetary Exploration Through the Year 2000. ' The Halley's comet flyby missions completed last spring raised more questions than were answered about the nature of comets. The next mission to a comet must be able to explore some of these questions. In the late 1990 's, a spacecraft might be built to explore the hazardous area surrounding a comet nucleus. Rigorous pointing requirements for remote sensing instruments will place a considerable burden on their <b>attendant</b> <b>control</b> systems. To meet these requirements we have pursued the initial design and analysis of a multi-bodied comet explorer spacecraft. Sized so as to be built on-orbit after the space station is operational, the spacecraft is comprised of Orbit Replaceable Unit (ORU) subsystems, packaged into two major components: a three-axis controlled instrument platform and a spinning, detached comet dust shield. Such a configuration decouples the dynamics of dust impaction from the stringent pointing out requirements of the imaging experiments. At the same time, it offers an abundance of simple analysis problems that may be carried out by undergraduates. These problems include the following: Selection of subsystem components, sizing trade studies, investigation of three-axis and simple spin dynamics, design of simple control systems, orbit determination, and intercept trajectory generation. Additionally, such topics as proposal writing project management, human interfacing, and costing have been covered. A new approach to design teaching has been taken, whereby students will 'learn by teaching.

Building upon previous projects, {{the goal of this}} project was to create an accessory, to be installed on a standard wheelchair, which would allow full control of the wheelchair with only one arm/hand while addressing areas lacking in commercial products and previous designs, such as manufacturability, <b>attendant</b> <b>control,</b> user comfort and ergonomics. After preliminary testing and analysis of three one-arm propulsion designs (Meyra lever-operated chair, Quickie dual-pushrim chair, and the 2005 - 06 MQP’s prototype), the project team developed a design for a removable, lever-operated accessory which could be adapted to fit a range of the most popular standard wheelchair models. The propulsion system, connected to the main lever by a coupler link, consists of a dual gear-pawl assembly in which the desired direction of motion is chosen by moving a shifter to engage one of the two gears press-fit around clutches, each of which allows motion in only one direction, either forward or reverse. By including a neutral pawl position in which neither clutch is engaged, this design allows an attendant to propel and control the chair. Disc brakes mounted to each of the two wheels are operated via a brake lever attached to the handle of the main propulsion lever. The steering design consists of a cable wrapped around two pulleys. One pulley, attached to the main lever handle, transmits the user’s input to the second pulley at the caster wheel, causing the caster to turn. Careful attention was paid to minimizing the number of specialized parts and hardware used in the design in order to improve its manufacturability and ease of installation, and to minimize the need for maintenance. During final testing, the team’s prototype was compared to the Meyra lever-operated wheelchair and the prototype from the 2005 - 06 MQP by Cassidy, et al. The 2008 - 09 wheelchair showed considerable improvement over the prior MQP in the areas of size, required propulsion force, and user comfort. The 2008 - 09 MQP was also successful in greatly reducing operational noise and safety hazards due to sharp edges and moving parts. Deficiencies in the 2008 - 09 design included mechanical disadvantage in the steering system, excessive weight, and failure due to stress concentrations in the accessory mounting spokes...|$|E

Several hel-minth species {{do not have}} an obligatory lung migratory phase but establish chronic infections in the host that include potent immune downregulatory effects, in part mediated through induction of a FoxP 3 T regulatory cell (Treg) response. Treg cells exhibit duality in their functions in host defense againstM. tuberculosis infection since their depletion leads to enhanced prim-ing of T cells in the lymph nodes and <b>attendant</b> improved <b>control</b> ofM. tuberculosis infection, while their presence in the lung granuloma protects against excessive inflammation.

Exposure to airborne benzene was measured using passive personal samplers, and internal doses were assayed through the biomarkers t,t-muconic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid and urinary benzene. DNA damage was evaluated using tail intensity (TI) determined by the comet assay in peripheral lymphocytes. Urinary 7 -hydro- 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodG) was measured as a biomarker of oxidative damage. DNA repair kinetics were assessed using the comet assay in lymphocytes sampled 20 and 60 min post H 2 O 2 exposure. Benzene exposure differed significantly between the drivers (median 246. 3 µg/m(3)), attendants (median 13. 8 µg/m(3)), and controls (median 4. 1 µg/m(3)). There were no differences in TI and 8 -oxodG among the three groups, or between smokers and non-smokers.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Petrol attendants {{are exposed}} to petrol {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) which may have genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. The single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) is a method highly sensitive to DNA damage induced by environmental and occupational exposure to carcinogenic and mutagenic agents. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the level of exposure of petrol attendants to petrol VOCs and also to determine their effect on DNA damage and repair in lymphocytes of African petrol attendants. The exposed group consisted of 20 subjects, randomly selected from three petrol stations. A control group of 20 unexposed subjects was also chosen and matched for age and smoking habits with the exposed group. Sorbent tubes were used to assess personal exposure of petrol attendants. The comet assay was used to investigate the basal DNA damage and repair capacity in isolated lymphocytes of petrol <b>attendants</b> and <b>control</b> subjects. Blood samples were taken from the petrol attendants at the end of their 8 hour working shift and also from the control subjects. The petrol attendants were found to be exposed to levels of petrol VOCs lower than the occupational exposure limit (OEL) for constituent chemicals. A significant relationship was found between the volume of petrol sold during the shift and the average concentrations of benzene, toluene and the total VOCs measured. However, relative humidity had a negative correlation with the average concentrations of benzene, toluene, xylene and the total VOCs. Significantly higher basal DNA damage was observed with the exposed group compared to the control group. The period of exposure influenced the level of DNA damage and the calculated repair capacity. Smoking and age had a significant influence on the level of DNA damage. DNA repair capacity was delayed in smokers of both exposed and non-exposed group. Master...|$|R

As such, an air damper has been designed and developed based on the Maxwell type model concept in the approach of Nishihara and Asami [1]. The cylinder-piston and air-tank type damper characteristics such as air damping ratio and air spring rate have been studied by changing the length and diameter of the capillary pipe between the air cylinder and the air tank, operating air pressure and the air tank volume. A SDOF quarter-car vehicle suspension system using the developed air enclosed cylinder-piston and air-tank type damper has been analyzed for its motion transmissibility characteristics. Optimal values of the air damping ratio at various values of air spring rate have been determined for minimum motion transmissibility of the sprung mass. An experimental setup has been developed for SDOF quarter-car suspension system model using the developed air enclosed cylinder-piston and air-tank type damper to determine the motion transmissibility characteristics of the sprung mass. An <b>attendant</b> air pressure <b>control</b> system has been designed to vary air damping in the developed air damper. The results of the theoretical analysis have been compared with the experimental analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Anticipating highly {{dynamic and}} {{reconfigurable}} future ships, the US Navy {{has sought to}} develop modeling and simulation capabilities for transient, electrical-mechanical-thermal, shipboard interactions at the system level. In support of this work, an object-oriented Dynamic Thermal Modeling and Simulation (DTMS) framework written in C++ has been in use for several years. As reported in this paper, DTMS has recently been augmented to model two-phase flow and heat transfer for simulation of a shipboard vapor-compression chiller and its <b>attendant</b> loads. A <b>controls</b> methodology has been implemented in the heat exchanger models to monitor their relevant states, chilled water enthalpy, and refrigerant liquid level. These heat exchangers have been integrated with a heavily-customizable, centrifugal compressor model focused on required power input rather than the detailed dynamics of fluid compression. The heat exchangers and centrifugal compressor, along with {{a model of a}} thermostatic expansion valve, have been used to assemble a simulation of a 200 -ton marine chiller predicated on baseline parameters for the Navy’s current destroyer. This chiller has been connected with thermal loads of varying magnitude to demonstrate controller response during full-load and part-load operation. The final simulation reported here consists of 22 thermal loads ranging from 8 to 256 kW with chilled water supplied by two chillers. Results are compared with both steady-state-predicted values and previous dynamic simulations using commercial software. I...|$|R
40|$|Indian {{policy towards}} foreign collaborations and foreign direct investment, which {{remained}} very restrictive during the 1970 s, was considerably liberalized during the 1980 s. Interestingly, this change was brought about without amending the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). The liberalization {{has led to}} a phenomenal {{increase in the number of}} foreign collaborations approvals, foreign investment involved in the foreign collaboration agreements and net inflow of FDI in India. The provisions of FDI policy have guided the bulk of FDI inflows to technologically advanced industries. As in the 1970 s, the USA followed by the FRG, the UK and Japan remained most dominant foreign investor in India during the 1980 s. Yet, the source of foreign investment in India got more diversified during the latter 1980 s. Although the initial attempt towards the liberalization of FDI policy in the 1980 s was aimed at improving the export performance and overall competitiveness of the economy, the recent efforts of the National Front government for further liberalisation is primarily guided by its apprehension that the additional borrowings in international financial market for financing current account deficits will lead India towards "debt-trap". The tempo of the liberal policy, the author feels, should be continued with a view to allowing the FDI due to its <b>attendant</b> advantages while <b>controlling</b> its adverse effects. ...|$|R
40|$|Strontium {{substituted}} hydroxyapatite (SrHA) coatings {{have received}} a lot of interest recently as strontium (Sr) has been shown to have the dual benefit of promoting bone formation and reducing bone resorption, in vivo. In this work, SrHA coatings were deposited onto polycrystalline titanium surfaces using radio frequency (RF) magnetron co-sputtering and compared to those deposited from HA alone. In particular, the influence of different levels of Sr-substitution of the sputtering targets (5 and 13 % Sr-substituted HA targets) on the properties of the deposited coatings produced at a low discharge power level (150 W) were investigated using FTIR, XPS, XRD, ToFSIMS and AFM techniques (both before and after annealing at 500 °C). The results show that Sr could be successfully incorporated into the HA lattice to form SrHA coatings and that they contained no other impurities. However, the coating produced from the 13 % Sr-substituted target had a higher Ca + Sr/P ratio (1. 95 ± 0. 14) and Sr content when compared to the coating produced from the 5 % Sr-substituted target (1. 58 ± 0. 20). The deposition rate also decreased with increasing Sr content of the sputtering targets. Furthermore, as the Sr content of the coatings increased, so did the preferred 002 orientation of the coating along with increased surface roughness and heterogeneity of the surface features. Therefore, this study has shown that RF magnetron sputtering offers a means to <b>control</b> <b>attendant</b> properties of Sr-substituted HA, such as the crystallinity, stoichiometry, phase purity and surface topography...|$|R

40|$|Environmental and {{occupational}} health concerns {{will have an}} effect on the developing oil shale technologies. The mining and crushing of large volumes of rock will be a characteristic of at least some of these technologies, and above ground disposal of processed shale will require adequate control measures. Exposure by inhalation to the dusts that may arise from shale oil technologies may present a hazard both in the work force and in the local population. Animal studies dealing with the effects of oil shale-related materials in the lung are in progress. Experiments involving Syrian hamsters exposed by inhalation and by intratracheal instillation are described. Full utilization, for energy production, of the extensive oil shale deposits of the intermountain west is dependent upon the development of economically competitive production technologies. Health and environmental concerns will play a major role in the development of these technologies because of the possible imposition of extensive pollution control measures {{and occupational}} health regulations. In general, the fuel extraction methods under current study include above-ground retorting, wherein mining, milling, and transport are major operations; in situ retorting wherein no mining or milling takes place; a combination of above ground and in situ, wherein mining and milling is less extensive but some of the shale is retorted above ground. With the exception of the true in situ method, all of the current technologies will produce large volumes of processed shale with the <b>attendant</b> problems of <b>controlled</b> disposal. No threshold limit values (TLV) have been established for oil shale and its process products except for the application of numbers based upon standard formulas for silica-bearing materials (1). Dust exposure becomes an important occupational health concern when the relatively high free silica content (8 - 12 %) is considered together with the organics present in oil shale and its byproducts (2) ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the section}} [...] "How to Read this Book," [...] L. Ron Hubbard {{suggests}} to read right on through. An [...] "Important Note" [...] appeared in later {{editions of the}} book advising the reader to understand every word read. In the book, Hubbard uses two different and contradictory definitions for the word engram. In Book One, the Goal of Man, chapter 5, summary, Hubbard states the Fundamental Axioms of Dianetics, among which is [...] "... The engram {{is a moment of}} 'unconsciousness' containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions and is not available to the analytical mind as experience." [...] Later in the text, Hubbard writes of the engram in a footnote on page 74 of Book Two, chapter two, of the 2007 edition of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. The footnote reads: [...] "... The word engram in Dianetics is used in its severely accurate sense as a 'definite and permanent trace left by a stimulus on the protoplasm of a tissue'. It is considered as a unit group of stimuli impinged solely on the cellular being." [...] In other words, Hubbard takes a definition previously debunked by biology and calls it a Dianetics definition. Dianetics, in and of itself, thus presents nothing that was not already known to science in that area, while adding phenomena and functional systems that have no basis in fact. The very manner of [...] "scientific method" [...] displayed by Hubbard in his works has indeed been called [...] "anti-science," [...] in that the claims made in the books are based not on peer-reviewed observation of phenomena, with its <b>attendant</b> blind testing, <b>control</b> groups etc., but rather on deciding a priori that a phenomenon exists-followed by an attempt to prove its validity.|$|R

40|$|Microearthquakes, {{defined as}} shocks having {{magnitudes}} less than 4, are commonly {{recorded in the}} vicinity of geothermal manifestations and volcanism. They have been mapped from producing geothermal fields as well as those not yet developed, in such places as Iceland, El Salvador, Japan, Kenya and the US. Microearthquakes have been recorded at several geothermal sites in the Imperial Valley and Coso Hot Springs, California; Kilbourne Hole, New Mexico; Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming; and The Geysers, California, where there is debate over whether or not the seismicity is induced by steam production. Seismicity occurs around active volcanoes, but appears reduced directly over zones of high temperature or magma, where the depth of the brittle fracture zone is shallow, as over Yellowstone caldera. In areas of active hydrothermalism, regional stress is likely to be relieved by low-level seismicity rather than occasional large ruptures, owing to the high temperatures, presence of fluids, and crustal weakening due to alteration and fracturing. Active faulting maintains the permeability of the system, which in its absence, might otherwise seal. on the microscopic scale, pore-fluid pressures rise as a result of heating, resulting in the decrease of effective pressure at the pore-mineral boundary. When this effective pressure becomes less than the rock's tensile strength, the pore ruptures; and if it intersects a through-going fracture under hydrostatic pressure can result in a shock detectable on seismographs at the surface. Such a mechanism might also account for the swarms of very small events seen in a number of geothermal areas. A microearthquake survey was conducted on Adak Island, Alaska for the purpose of identifying seismicity associated with a possible geothermal reservoir. During 30 days of recording in September and October 1982, 190 seismic events were recorded on two or more stations of a nine-station network. Of the total, 33 were of local origin, and of these 24 were locatable. Utilizing a 5 km/sec constant velocity earth model, the hypocenters define a structure dipping north-northwestward toward the Bering Sea, beneath Mt. Adagdak. many of the events took place beneath the Adagdak peninsula in an area in which hot springs discharge and where other geophysical evidences suggest a geothermal reservoir. A similar NNW-dipping fault plane was deduced from a 9 -day microearthquake survey conducted in 1974. At that time all of the activity occurred beneath the sea. the projected surface trace lies NNW of that deduced form the present survey. It is quite likely that the mapped structure and <b>attendant</b> fractures <b>control</b> a hydrothermal system by providing the necessary permeability for maintaining circulation of hot waters within the upper several kilometers of the surface. Only preliminary analysis of the records fell within the scope of the present project. The work should be supplemented with the application of a locally appropriate earth model, 3 D fault-mapping, first-motion studies leading to fault-plane solutions, and computations of event magnitudes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Adolescents with an {{intellectual}} disability have difficulties in maintaining social contacts {{and finding a}} way to spend their leisure time. The use of internet can be helpful, but also has risks. Hardly any research has been done into the risk factors of internet used by intellectual disabled adolescents. In addition, there is hardly any research available on parents of a mentally disabled child and how they manage the internet use of their child. The research question is: “What is the role of parents on the internet use of their intellectual disabled children?” The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the parenting roles concerning the internet use between children with and without {{an intellectual}} disability. Method: This research has been conducted on the basis of qualitative interviews. The total number of participants was thirteen. The processing and the analysis of data was done on the basis of NVivo 11. Results: From the interviews appeared that the internet use has a lot of advantages for the children, such as maintaining social contacts, how to spend their leisure time and the improvement of language skills. Disadvantages are –according to the parents– the compulsive use of internet, the influence images/movies have on the children and being susceptible of abuse. Three roles can be determined concerning the internet use of their child: the encouraging, the <b>attendant</b> and the <b>controlling</b> parent. Parents switch between these three roles. In general parents control the internet use of their mentally disordered children more than the internet use of their children without a disorder. Finally it has been found that the parents who participated in this survey have no need for information (sessions) about the use of internet of children with an intellectual disorder. Most parents do stress out that school lessons about this subject is important. Conclusion and discussion: The three parental roles from this study can be compared with the parenting styles from parents of children with a normal development. The difference is, however, that adolescents with an intellectual disorder are encouraged more than children without an disability to use the internet. Except they are in general more vulnerable, so parents control their internet use more compared to children with a normal development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: This study {{analyzes}} {{the validity of}} new, more sensitive and specific urinary biomarkers of internal dose, namely, urinary benzene for benzene and urinary toluene and S-benzylmercapturic acid (SBMA) for toluene, to assess their efficacy when compared to traditional biomarkers for biological monitoring of occupational exposure to low concentrations of these two toxic substances. METHODS: Assessment was made of 41 workers occupationally exposed to benzene and toluene, 18 fuel tanker drivers and 23 filling-station attendants, as well as 31 subjects with no occupational exposure to these toxic substances (controls). Exposure to airborne benzene and toluene was measured using passive Radiello personal samplers worn throughout the work shift. In urine samples collected from all subjects {{at the end of}} the workday, both the traditional and the new internal dose biomarkers of benzene and toluene were assessed, as well as creatinine so as to apply suitable adjustments. RESULTS: Occupational exposure to benzene and toluene resulted significantly higher in the fuel tanker drivers than the filling-station attendants, and higher in the latter than in controls. Significantly higher concentrations of t,t-muconic acid (t,t-MA), S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), urinary benzene, SBMA and urinary toluene were found in the drivers than the filling-station <b>attendants</b> or the <b>controls.</b> Instead, urinary phenol and hippuric acid were not different in the three groups. In the entire sample, airborne benzene and toluene values were significantly correlated, as were the respective urinary biomarkers, showing coefficients ranging from 0. 36 to 0. 98. Subdividing the subjects by smoking habit, higher coefficients were evident in non-smokers than in smokers; at multiple regression analysis t,t-MA, SPMA and urinary benzene and toluene were dependent on the number of cigarettes smoked daily and on airborne benzene and toluene, respectively. Instead, SBMA was dependent only on airborne toluene. CONCLUSIONS: Our research confirmed the validity of t,t-MA and SPMA for use in the biological monitoring of exposure to low concentrations of benzene. Urinary benzene showed comparable validity to SPMA; both parameters are affected by smoking cigarettes in the hours before urine collection, so it is best to ask subjects to refrain from smoking for 2 h before urine collection. Urinary toluene was found to be a more specific biomarker than SBMA...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many {{studies showed}} a {{connection}} between exposition {{to high levels of}} urban pollution (especially to particulate and traffic noise) and the onset of even deadly cardiovascular diseases. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of case-control design. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the association between cardiovascular effects and occupational exposition to atmospheric pollution in urban environment. Methods: DATA SOURCES: Biomedcentral, MEDLINE/ PubMed, MEDLINE/ National Library of Medicine (NLM), MEDLINE Plus, Nioshtic- 2, Scopus, TOXNET/Toxline, unpublished studies known by the authors and acts of national and internationl conferences between 1988 and May 2010 included. There has not been any kind of language or typological restriction. CRITERIA OF ELEGIBILITY: The research on cardiovascular effects includes control cases of workers exposed to urban pollution, compared with non-exposed subjects. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: The selected studies present outdoor workers exposed to urban pollution (drivers and petrol pump <b>attendants)</b> and a <b>control</b> group of indoor workers (managers, university students and other selected subjects). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The evidences (independently token from two different authors) have been grouped in two classes, the first one formed by continuous variables (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and the second one by discontinuous variables (electrocardiographic abnormalities prevalence, hypertension prevalence, hypercholesterolemia prevalence). The studies related to both classes and presenting more than one variable for each class have been included and used, in order to elaborate the results. We calculated heterogeneity in each variable (ES calculation for continuous variables and OR calculation for discontinuous variables). Results: On 378 publications, we have selected and included 16 articles. The variables show statistically irrelevant differences between exposed group and control group, except regarding the triglycerides. Limitations. The controlled studies are limited and characterized by a non-homogeneous evaluation of both expositional times of workers to urban pollution and of professional expositional values. Conclusions: Considering the heterogeneity and the lack of studies, it is impossible at the moment to document effects on the cardiovascular system in workers exposed to urban pollution. The results of this meta-analysis only suggest the association of urban pollution with alteration of triglycerides blood levels (referring to just three studies). As reported in scientific literature on this subject, it is necessary to conduct a future professional investigation on this subject with more qualified and homogeneous studies...|$|R
