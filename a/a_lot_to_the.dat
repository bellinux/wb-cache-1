25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus contributed <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{research}} of {{the memory of the}} brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E
25|$|The Norwegian Railway Museum has {{its origins}} from 1896. It {{gathered}} historical items from various railways and {{had from the}} opening of the third station until 1912 a display in the upper floor of the terminus building. At that time the station ran out of place and the museum had to relocate. It lacked a venue {{for more than a decade}} while its board searched for a proper site. This issue was settled in 1925, when the museum secured <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of Hamar Station. It could open as an open-air museum in 1930. NSB took formal ownership of the museum in 1946 and the lot on was it. A new and larger museum could was opened in 1956.|$|E

25|$|The title-winning team owed <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> midfield. The {{side had}} little {{international}} talent in attack or defence (although full backs Tony Dorigo and Mel Sterland were both full internationals) {{and so much}} of the onus was on Strachan, McAllister, Wales international Speed and England's Batty to provide that required class. The quality of the midfield was that any of the four could slot into whichever area they needed to be in, be it left, right or centre, though Batty tended to be the holding midfield player whilst McAllister, Strachan and Speed provided the creativity. McAllister's dead-ball skills were also utilised by top-scorer Lee Chapman, who scored the majority of his goals from headers and thrived off the service provided by McAllister and Strachan's free kicks.|$|E
25|$|In the novel, {{the battle}} is not seen until Aslan, Susan, Lucy and their {{reinforcements}} arrive. This was changed in the movie because Adamson said he could vividly remember a huge battle, {{an example of how}} Lewis left <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> readers' imagination. Other small changes include the reason all four children come to Narnia, in that an accident breaks a window and forces them to hide. Tumnus also never meets Edmund until the end in the novel. Minor details were added to the Pevensies, such as their mother's name, Helen, being the actual first name of Georgie Henley's mother. Finchley as the home of the Pevensies was inspired by Anna Popplewell, who actually is from Finchley. Adamson also changed the circumstances in which Lucy first comes into Narnia. He felt it was more natural that she first see the wardrobe while looking for a hide-and-seek hiding place, rather than just chance upon it exploring the house. The film also hints at Professor Kirke's role in The Magician's Nephew, such as the engravings on the wardrobe, when it is a simple one in the novel, and the Professor's surprise and intrigue when Peter and Susan mention Lucy's discovery in the wardrobe. When Lewis wrote the novel, {{it was the first of}} the series and the back-story later outlined by the subsequent books in the series did not exist. Additionally in the novel, the father of the Pevensie children is in London with their mother, but in the film, their father is fighting in the war as Lucy states to Mr. Tumnus when they first meet in Narnia.|$|E

500|$|Sigler, who {{was offered}} the role only days before filming commenced, {{said that she had}} always been a fan of Carey, and {{accepted}} the offer immediately. She described that the shoot was set in the 1960s, and that she played the singer's mother during and after her pregnancy. Sigler described the plot: [...] "With my character, she's basically going against her parent's wishes to be with this gentleman. She's pregnant with a baby, which is Mariah, and they run away together. So it's kind of an epic love story, it's nice." [...] Carey revealed that the video would incorporate a rainstorm scene in New York City. Carey jokingly explained how she originally did not intend to get wet, but felt it added <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> video.|$|E
500|$|In July 1980, Bill Lyon of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{wrote that}} many fans unfairly stereotyped McBride as a lazy player {{because of his}} bad knees and his low-key personality. McBride ran with a {{lopsided}} gait, which fans interpreted {{as a lack of}} effort. Lyon wrote that because McBride did not talk about his injuries <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public, most people did not realize that his knee joint had significantly eroded and that he was [...] "essentially, a one-legged player." [...] Lyon said that McBride's Afro hairstyle and his isolated nature furthered the stereotypes that many fans held. McBride said that he had never been a man who showed much emotion, and {{he thought it would be}} hypocritical if he tried to look more intense just to appease the fans.|$|E
500|$|In {{front of}} a large crowd, Small Heath {{suffered}} what was described as an [...] "unfortunate" [...] one-goal defeat at Grimsby Town. Hollis should have done better with Grimsby's opener, Frank Mobley was injured around the eye in collision with the goalkeeper when scoring Small Heath's only goal and showed some bravery in remaining on the field, and Wheldon had an apparently valid goal disallowed. Short, in a [...] "trifle risky" [...] style, and the solid Devey again did well in defence. Lost gate receipts because of Aston Villa's withdrawal from the United Counties League was decidedly unpopular with the other members, and the Small Heath committee arranged a smoking concert to raise funds. Those clubs {{at the bottom of the}} First Division and top of the Second were all recruiting new players: [...] "the test matches mean such <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clubs concerned that there is no wonder at this anxiety to secure new blood." [...] Small Heath acquired the services of full-backs Percy Watson and William Purves, from Rotherham Town and Irish club Glentoran respectively.|$|E

500|$|This {{production}} {{was met with}} negative attention by film critics. A reviewer in the The Moving Picture News wrote, [...] "There isn't <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story, but the acting is of the class which still finds favor with the public. The pictures taken in Chinatown do not go quite far enough in depicting East Side conditions; the photography of these particular scenes is not the ideal of Thanhouser productions..." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was more moderate in its criticism by identifying specific faults with the portrayal, but found that the story to be good and the parts well-acted. The Morning Telegraph offered similar criticism, [...] "The story of this picture is fairly good, but the details are wrong. In the first place, the producers evidently never were in a sweatshop, or else {{they would not have}} representing a sweatshop a store like a custom tailor shop, doing a thriving business. The people who are supposed to be Hebrews hardly resemble them. The next objection is when the settlement worker falls into a faint, the girl is very slow in picking him up. The story tells of a poor immigrant Hebrew girl who {{falls in love with a}} settlement worker, who returns her affection, which finally results in their marriage." [...] Some advertisements would bill the production as seeing the other side of New York City life.|$|E
500|$|A {{stoppage}} time penalty from Shane Long {{earned a}} crucial 2–1 win for Reading in Argyle's next match, but {{they came from}} a goal behind to claim a 3–1 victory at Barnsley four days later, which included a 35-yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon. Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. [...] "We played with intellect. We got the ball down, rather than panicking a little bit; we stroked it around; we retained position at vital times," [...] he said. [...] "The introduction of Bolasie was {{a breath of fresh}} air. I think even the Barnsley fans would probably say they liked to see what he was doing. He brought <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table for us." [...] A double-header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle, against Swansea City and Leicester City, and they both ended in 1–1 draws. New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea, and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester. An end-to-end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4–3 defeat, which included a number of defensive mistakes. Argyle went 3–0 before finally sparking into life, scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason. A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20-yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale. In the aftermath, Paul Mariner heaped praise on Mason, describing him as [...] "an incredible talent." ...|$|E
