5|$|Paul Schlesselman is of German {{descent and}} {{was a high school}} dropout raised by a single father in Helena–West Helena, Arkansas. He hated his small Delta region {{hometown}} because of its predominantly black population. He had never had <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the law prior to the alleged Obama plot. He had a strong affinity for drinking and smoking.|$|E
5|$|In October 1857, an {{expedition}} led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles, California. From Fort Smith, his journey continued through Fort Defiance, Arizona, before crossing the Colorado near Needles, California. This route {{became known as}} Beale's Wagon Road, and the location where Beale crossed the river as Beale's Crossing. Beale's journal and subsequent report to the United States Secretary of War did not mention <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> Irataba and the Mohave, but an assistant named Humphrey Stacy recorded that the Mohave had prevented Beale from traveling downriver.|$|E
5|$|In 1929–30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E

5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived that there was <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E
25|$|Capaldi {{kept his}} native Scottish accent for the role. Speaking on his decision, {{he said he}} did it so he could feel closer to the character. A handful of tweets were {{reported}} in September 2014 in which it was claimed that some viewers struggled to understand Capaldi. A speech coach and linguistics expert both suggested that <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> understanding Capaldi {{had more to do with}} delivery than accent.|$|E

25|$|The basic Mk V was a Mk I {{with the}} Merlin 45 series engine. This engine {{delivered}} 1,440hp (1,074kW) at take-off, and incorporated a new single-speed single-stage supercharger design. Improvements to the carburettor also allowed the Spitfire to use zero gravity manoeuvres without <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> fuel flow. Several Mk I and Mk II airframes {{were converted to}} Mk V standard by Supermarine and started equipping fighter units from early 1941. The majority of the Mk Vs were built at Castle Bromwich.|$|E
25|$|In January Eritrea {{reportedly}} {{requested to}} cross the border in order to get sand for a road, but instead occupied a hilltop in the region. On April 16, Eritrea is reported by Djibouti to have set up fortifications and dug trenches {{on both sides of the}} Djiboutian border near Ras Doumeira. Djibouti, in a letter to the UN calling for intervention, claimed new maps put out by Eritrea showed Ras Doumeira as Eritrean territory. Eritrea denied it had <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> Djibouti.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{occurred in}} October 2002, and involved a {{cast and crew}} of about 30 individuals. The shoot occurred without any major incidents. None of the main cast, {{all of whom were}} heterosexual, had <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> portraying gay characters, or engaging in same-sex kissing or sex-play. Actor Dylan Fergus ("Eddie") found it difficult to kiss co-star Bryan Kirkwood ("Joey") {{at the end of the}} day due to Kirkwood's five o'clock shadow, and actor Matt Phillips ("Tobey") fell several times while wearing high-heeled footwear.|$|E

25|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, LeRoy Cain {{stated that the}} image {{analysis}} team was still evaluating the ascent imagery, but that the vehicle looked very clean, and the only event that was seen on launch, the area under the left OMS pod, {{appeared to have been}} ice. The images taken during the flight day two survey showed that all of the thermal blankets in that area were intact, as were the tiles. Cain stated that the item did not strike the orbiter, it was the only event that the Mission Management Team was still evaluating, and that the orbiter was in good shape. Mike Sarafin confirmed that the Ku band antenna performed properly in radar mode, and docking was carried out without <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the antenna.|$|E
25|$|The {{area has}} been subject to {{flooding}} for centuries, both from the rivers and from the sea. While there is evidence for occupation of the region by Romans, Saxons, Danes and Normans, the first references to flood defences occur in the 11th and 12th centuries, when monks built a sea bank to hold back tides from their agricultural land. A sluice was constructed in 1142 on the River Witham to improve it for navigation, and Commissions of Sewers were appointed in the 13th century. They were empowered to investigate <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the drainage of the region, could appoint contractors to carry out work to rectify such problems, and had to assess how this work would be financed. Floods in 1394 resulted in a decision to rebuild a floodgate at Waynflete, with the villages affected paying the construction costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{convoluted}} {{tubes of}} early designs {{such as the}} du Temple and Normand {{were the first to}} go. A multi-row bank of tubes could provide adequate heating area, without this complexity. Tubes also became straighter, mostly to ease their cleaning. Yarrow had demonstrated that straight tubes did not cause <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> expansion, but circular drums and perpendicular tube entry were both valuable features for a long service life. Where tubes entered drums at an angle, heating and cooling tended to bend the tube back and forth, leading to leaks. A perpendicular entry was easier to expand the tubes for a reliable seal and to avoid these sideways stresses. It was worth the compromise of the Admiralty boiler's bent tube ends to keep these two features, and these tubes were still simple enough in shape to clean easily.|$|E

[...] The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003.|$|R
25|$|The Cimbri {{conveniently}} {{marched into}} Hispania and the Teutoni milled around in northern Gaul, leaving Marius to prepare his army. One of his legates was his old quaestor, Sulla, {{which shows that}} at this time there was no ill-will between them. In 104 BC, Marius was returned as consul again for 103 BC. Though he could have continued to operate as proconsul, it seems that the position as consul would make his position as commander unassailable and avoid <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the consuls if he was only a proconsul. Marius seems {{to have been able to}} get exactly what he wanted, and it even seems that his support determined whom the people would elect as his colleagues (his choice was apparently determined, on several occasions, on the basis of their malleability: only Catulus in 102 BC, and Flaccus in 100 BC, would have been serious candidates in their own right without his support, and even Flaccus was described as more servant than partner in the office.) In 103 BC, the Germans still did not emerge from Hispania, and conveniently Marius's colleague (L. Aurelius Orestes, son of C. Gracchus's commander in Sardinia in 126 BC–124 BC) died, so Marius had to return to Rome to oversee the elections, being re-elected for 102 BC.|$|E

Nicholas also defended Dworsky's work against Gehry's attacks, denying that there were <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the Dworsky drawings not attributable to fast-tracking. Nicholas said: [...] "They were not 'bad' drawings. It {{was a question of}} the subs not understanding them." ...|$|E

25|$|Within {{the late}} Roman military, many {{recruits}} and even officers had barbarian origins, and soldiers are recorded as using possibly-barbarian rituals such as elevating a claimant on shields.
