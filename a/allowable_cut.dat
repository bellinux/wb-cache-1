40|$|AbstractAppropriate cutting {{cycles and}} annual <b>allowable</b> <b>cuts</b> {{are crucial to}} ensure {{sustainability}} of tropical selective logging, {{but there have been}} limited field data to verify long-term effects of different cutting cycles. This study reveals some evidence of forest degradation in selectively logged production forests of Myanmar, which are subject to inappropriate cutting frequency. We compared stand structure, commercial species composition, and incidence of illegal logging between two compartments with low (LCF; 1 time) and high (HCF; 5 times) cutting frequency over a recent 18 years. Prior to the latest cutting, LCF had 176 trees ha− 1 with an inverted-J shape distribution of diameter at breast height (DBH), including a substantial amount of teak (Tectona grandis) and other commercially important species in each DBH class. HCF prior to the latest cut had only 41 trees ha− 1 without many commercially important species. At HCF, nearly half the standing trees of various species and size were illegally cut following legal operations; this was for charcoal making in nearby kilns. At LCF, two species, teak and Xylia xylocarpa, were cut illegally and sawn for timber on the spot. More extensive and systematic surveys are needed to generalize the findings of forest degradation and illegal logging. However, our study calls for urgent reconsideration of logging practices with high cutting frequency, which can greatly degrade forests with accompanying illegal logging, and for rehabilitating strongly degraded, bamboo-dominated forests. To reduce illegal logging, it would be important to pay more attention on a MSS regulation stating that logging roads should be destroyed after logging operations...|$|R
50|$|Over-crowded {{regeneration}} {{tends to}} stagnate. The problem is aggravated in species that have little self-pruning ability, such as white spruce. Spacing is a thinning (of natural regeneration), {{in which all}} trees other than those selected for retention at fixed intervals are cut. The term juvenile spacing is used when {{most or all of}} the cut trees are unmerchantable. Spacing can be used to obtain any {{of a wide range of}} forest management objectives, but it is especially undertaken to reduce density and control stocking in young stands and prevent stagnation, and to shorten the rotation, i.e., to speed the production of trees of a given size. Volume growth of individual trees and the merchantable growth of stands are increased. The primary rationale for spacing is that thinning is the projected decline in maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>cut.</b> And since wood will be concentrated on fewer, larger, and more uniform stems, operating and milling costs will be minimized.|$|E

40|$|Crisis in {{supplying}} {{regions and}} the country related to available forest resources and low profitability of forest sector, as a whole, is an indicator of failure of the existing model of forest management and forest use organization in Russia at the present time. Many Russian regions, which are traditionally considered as forest industrial territories, {{face the challenge of}} lack of economically accessible forests. The forests are decreasing against a background of under exploitation of the annual <b>allowable</b> <b>cut.</b> This situation occurs in Siberia as well. In many cases, using calculated <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> will result in unsustainable harvest levels and a future decrease of accessible forest resources. Thus, the statement that «a volume of wood resource utilization is determined by <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> represented the scientifically grounded norm of sustainable forest use» is considered as no more than the declarative proposition. Modeling the normal forest, and using a formula of <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> calculation estimated for some decades based on the modeling, is totally unreliable and unreal. The long-term forecast should use analog methods, but it will hardly be sufficiently accurate and adequate to set norms. In order to estimate ecological and economic accessibility of forest resources, an algorithm was made, and a method and model were developed. This model is based on GIS-database and makes it possible to estimate accessibility of forest resources and to map it as well. The conclusion on necessity to determine annual <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> in two varieties was drawn following the procedures for calculating annual <b>allowable</b> <b>cut.</b> The first variety is silvicultural (according the currently used methods) and the other one is economically accessible <b>allowable</b> <b>cut,</b> which could provide economic effective use of tradable mature wood, taking in to account ecological and economic accessibility of forest resources...|$|E
30|$|As {{complementary}} {{resource use}} {{is the main}} cause of additional production, the most promising approach for enhancing volume (biomass) production is the mixing of light-demanding with shade-tolerant species, shallow-rooting with deep-rooting species, fast-growing with slow-growin or deciduous with evergreen species. The benefit of mixing may change with site conditions, however, as it likely depends on the potential of the species assemblage to compensate for the respective growth limiting factor of a given site. Thus, on moist and fertile sites, where light is the limiting factor, combinations of light-demanding and shade-tolerant species may be most beneficial. On dry and nutrient poor sites, in contrast, combinations of deep- and shallow-rooting species may remedy the soil-based resource limitations. Although reported overyielding in volume growth of about 10 – 30 % for commercial tree species in temperate and boreal zones appear moderate in comparison to overyielding of up to 50 % found in the subtropics and tropics and for atmospheric nitrogen fixing tree species (Forrester et al. 2006, 2007, Kelty 1992), they are nevertheless highly relevant because they can be obtained simply by a smart mixing design. In contrast, the benefits derived from thinning are often lower and require repeated silvicultural entries (Assmann 1970). Overyielding represents a higher efficiency of space use in that a given area of mixed stands yields more stem wood volume and fixes and stores more carbon than equivalent areas of monospecific stands. Of special interest for forest practitioners are mixed-species stands achieving transgressive overyielding, which could result in gains of up to 30 % if the tree species mixture is complementary (Pretzsch and Forrester 2017). As a consequence, annual <b>allowable</b> <b>cuts,</b> and the volumes removed and remaining standing, may change compared with monocultures.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to describe the growth of individual Douglas-fir trees {{under a variety of}} stand conditions and management schedules. The model was developed using empirical data from open-grown trees and reducing growth capacities of height, stem, and crown as functions of intertree competition indices. Any initial pattern of spacing for up to 30 trees may be assumed. The user must supply the stem coordinates, estimate of site, and estimate of the number of years to reach a height of 4. 5 feet for each tree. Any intensity of thinning schedule may be requested up to an annual basis. The model simulates the form of the entire bole and crown for up to 80 years of growth. All calculations were performed on a CDC 3300 electronic computer. Individual tree and stand summaries can be listed for any periodic interval of interest:. A Cal-Comp plotter output is available for a complete stem analysis, output for one specified tree in the stand. All coefficients for regressions fitted in the model are listed in a separate file for easy access and modification. The {{mathematical model}} developed here satisfactorily describes the growth of Douglas-fir stands on an individual tree basis {{for a wide range of}} stand conditions and management schedules.

40|$|SummaryWhile around 20 % of the Amazonian forest {{has been}} cleared for {{pastures}} and agriculture, one fourth of the remaining forest is dedicated to wood production [1]. Most of these production forests have been or will be selectively harvested for commercial timber, but recent studies show that even soon after logging, harvested stands retain much of their tree-biomass carbon and biodiversity [2, 3]. Comparing species richness of various animal taxa among logged and unlogged forests across the tropics, Burivalova et al. [4] found that despite some variability among taxa, biodiversity loss was generally explained by logging intensity (the number of trees extracted). Here, we use a network of 79 permanent sample plots (376 ha total) located at 10 sites across the Amazon Basin [5] to assess the main drivers of time-to-recovery of post-logging tree carbon (Table S 1).

The proposed approach is based on the simulation model of the age structure dynamics of the stand – from initial age classes of ("sapling stands ") to older ones ("mature stands"). The advantage of the proposed approach is that the procedure and the results of simulation are independent of any predefined formulas for calculating the <b>allowable</b> <b>cut,</b> thus {{it can be used to}} calculate <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> for exploitable forests with a variable initial age structure and intensity of forest management.

In fact, the entire age structure of the stand is reconstructed in numerical form (virtually, within the computer) for any chosen period of time. Cuttings are considered as abrupt and territorially localized changes in the stand age structure, and the model aims to compute their consequences, as well as to solve the problem of calculating the optimal <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> under the restrictions in a given area.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 {{requires}} the U. S. Forest Service to periodically evaluate the U. S. timber situation. An {{important part of}} such studies is the determination of forest product imports from Canada through evaluation of Canadian log and product supply conditions. Other studies have projected these conditions for Canada as a whole, but have failed to directly consider either the impacts of forest resource characteristics on costs or the capability of Canadian forests to meet predicted harvests. 	This study develops procedures for projecting Canadian log and lumber production costs that explicitly consider resource characteristics and location through the identification of fifteen Timber Supply Regions expected to have relatively uniform logging conditions and the estimation of log and lumber production costs {{for each of these}} regions. Cost projections are linked to general economic conditions in Canada through estimation of labor costs as functions of gross national product. This study also evaluates the capability of the forest resource to meet predicted timber requirements. Achievable levels of production of four forest product groups are determined by comparing predicted harvest levels with estimates of economically accessible annual <b>allowable</b> <b>cuts</b> and reducing projected production levels when accessible timber supplies are limiting. 	A baseline simulation from 1980 to 2030 indicates that future log and lumber production costs in Canada may be less than previously projected and the predicted increases in production may no be attainable because of limited timber supplies. Gross sawmilling costs are projected to increase from 99. 88 /MBF in 1980 to 4123. 66 /MBF in 2030. These costs range from 15 /MBF to 65 /MBF lower than those used in TAMM, largely due to different estimates of delivered wood costs. Harvests increased from 50. 2 million cunits to 73. 6 million cunits but were unable to meet demands from 1984 to 2030 with shortfall reaching 13. 5 million cunits in 2030.

40|$|In the study, the {{potential}} <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> {{in the district}} of Pohjois-Savo - based on the non-industrial private forest landowners' (NIPF) choices of timber management strategies - was clarified. Alternative timber management strategies were generated, and the choices and factors affecting the choices of timber management strategies by NIPF landowners were studied. The choices of timber management strategies were solved by maximizing the utility functions of the NIPF landowners. The parameters of the utility functions were estimated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The level of {{the potential}} <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> was compared to the cutting budgets based on the 7 th and 8 th National Forest Inventories (NFI 7 and NFI 8), to the combining of private forestry plans, and to the realized drain from non-industrial private forests. The potential <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> was calculated using the same MELA system as has been used in the calculation of the national cutting budget. The data consisted of the NIPF holdings (from the TASO planning system) that had been inventoried compartmentwise and had forestry plans made during the years 1984 - 1992. The NIPF landowners' choices of timber management strategies were clarified by a two-phase mail inquiry. The most preferred strategy obtained was "sustainability" (chosen by 62 % of landowners). The second in order of preference was "finance" (17 %) and the third was "saving" (11 %). "No cuttings", and "maximum cuttings" were the least preferred (9 % and 1 %, resp.). The factors promoting the choices of strategies with intensive cuttings were a) "farmer as forest owner" and "owning fields", b) "increase {{in the size of the}} forest holding", c) agriculture and forestry orientation in production, d) "decreasing short term stumpage earning expectations", e) "increasing intensity of future cuttings", and f) "choice of forest taxation system based on site productivity". The potential <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> defined in the study was 20 % higher than the average of the realized drain during the years 1988 - 1993, which in turn, was at the same level as the cutting budget based on the combining of forestry plans in eastern Finland.

40|$|The paper debriefs {{the current}} debates {{on the forest}} {{management}} and forest policy where environmental NGOs and logging companies are fighting: one the one hand, NGOs intervene in many technical {{issues related to the}} forest management planning and applied forestry where their expertise is patchy and, on the other hand, the logging companies accuse the nature protection measures, some of them adopted in due time, like the ones related to Natura 2000 network, where the management plans have been approved and endorsed. Since the stakes are very high the unprofessional messages delivered by many NGOs do not receive technically correct replies from the forest managers either because they are not able to communicate in simple words or simply because they are afraid of being labeled timber thieves: this defenseless attitude is not appropriate at all because the media is still talking about illegal clearfellings in spite of the very tough preventive measures undertaken by the Forest guards. Most of the allegations of illegal cuttings rest on the volume estimated by the NFI (the difference between the total yield and the <b>allowable</b> <b>cut)</b> while the same NFI allegedly gives high hopes for even higher <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> due to the first estimation of the total growth. The fake news here is that the total growth refers to the whole forest area, while the <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> refers to commercial forests only: there is no hint in the total growth unless the aggregated figure is not split into the two types of forests: commercial and not commercial (i. e. strictly protected forest areas).

However, it is also explained that reducing the forest rotation with 20 or even 40 years will not skyrocket the <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> because the reference level of the normal age class goes up and the overplus of harvestable wood will be used to compensate larger deficits brought about by the un-even actual age structure and the higher normal age class.

40|$|The {{promising}} processing {{techniques of}} micro scale parts {{are very important}} in products miniaturization and functions enhancement. Combination {{of two or more}} processing techniques gives better processing performance especially when dealing with difficult-to-cut materials. For that reason, the combination of laser beam and micro milling process has been widely studied and proven efficient in reducing cutting force and tool life extension. However, this process needs a precise temperature control in order to eliminate heat effect generated by laser beam irradiation. In this study, temperature distributions are determined numerically to characterize the melted zone and heat affected zone geometry. From the results, the estimation of tool and micro milling cutter distance together with the <b>allowable</b> depth of <b>cut</b> are determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{trends in}} chatter {{prediction}} are to compute stability lobes showing the maximal {{depth of cut}} versus spindle speed, following the work of Tlusty, Tobias and, more recently, Altintas. For mass production such as the production of automotive parts, this kind of approach is not suitable because {{the goal is to}} find cutting conditions stable and independent of perturbations inherent to machining (clamping, rough part dimensions [...] .). Still, in this method, the greatest <b>allowable</b> depth of <b>cut</b> to avoid chatter at any spindle speed is considered. The model is based on Tlusty's theory and the local stiffness of the machined surface is computed through a static finite element analysis. The result is a chatter map of the machined surface showing the maximal depth of cut at each node. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{assisted}} micro milling (LAMM) {{is one of}} {{the methods}} that used to enhance the ability to manufacture the micro scale product. Laser is used to preheat the workpiece materials prior the machining process. Therefore,reducing the workpiece strength caused by the laser heating need to be controlled to avoid the melting and changing of materials properties. Determining the processing parameters and their effects to the processing characteristics, temperature measurement and the laser spot-to-cutting tool distance are crucially important. In this study, the finite element analysis using ANSYS software was used to predict the heat distribution to characterize the melting and heat affected zone formation. From the results, the estimations of laser spot-to-cutting tool distance together with the <b>allowable</b> depth of <b>cut</b> were determined and applied in the actual LAMM experiment. Meanwhile, the analyses of cutting force and tool wear as an evidence conjunction to the laser heating is applicable to reduce the materials strength was performed...|$|R
