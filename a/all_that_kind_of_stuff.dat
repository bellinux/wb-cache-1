25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E
500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like and I happen to like rock 'n' roll, and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Crawley, no," [...] {{said the}} lawyer. [...] "She's a little upset, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. We know what women are. Let her alone." ...|$|R
500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
2500|$|Danielson {{described}} himself in ranking {{in the bottom}} 1 percentile for ambition in a personality test WWE gave him. In response, he said, [...] "I have no ambition for what society says is important as far as things like money, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> What I am ambitious about is I {{want to be the}} best wrestler that I can possibly be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps she will, an' {{perhaps she}} won't. I s'pose you've been coddlin' {{the old woman}} up so she thinks there's nobody {{in the world but}} Joe Potter; an' I wouldn't want to bet {{a great deal of money}} that you haven't been tellin' her I'm a chump, an' <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> so she wouldn't look at me if I should go there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heard something, you know, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. Make {{my apologies}} to the Duchess. In {{point of fact}} I must be in Stamford at ten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shan't {{call her}} a lunatic, Brooke. She isn't so much a lunatic as you are, {{to run counter to}} her, and disobey her, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] {{admitted}} the Vicar. [...] "But {{he has to}} do it to get a living, you know. To get food to eat and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, that settles me again. Don't {{they call}} it an amoeba? But really I am abjectly ignorant of <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> We are ALL we are, and all in a sense we care to dream we are. And for that matter, {{anything}} outlandish, bizarre, is a godsend in this rather stodgy life. It is after all just what the old boy said--it's only the impossible that's credible; whatever credible may mean....' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I’m not a {{computer}} programmer. I couldn’t be fucked doing drum patterns, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> The songs were quite raw, and I didn’t want to overdo it. I just wrote it, {{put together a}} band and taught them the songs and we recorded it live."- Shayne Carter, September 2006 ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, their principles! I believe I {{have some}} vague idea as to {{supporting}} property and land and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. I don't know that anybody wants to attack anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{rests with}} you, Harve. You can take cover behind your mama, of course, {{and put her}} on to fussing about your nerves and your highstrungness and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> poppycock." ...|$|R
5000|$|And the {{governor}} {{came in and}} they cleaned out the hospital. I mean, they had hearings. We all had {{to appear in court}} and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> And within a month or so, the hospital was completely changed. The superintendent was fired and the new superintendent was put in, and not only did they do our hospital, they did all the hospitals, mental hospitals in Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|Jenner also {{immediately}} {{followed up}} her [...] "what women wear" [...] dilemma with: It's more than that. I'm kind of {{at this point}} in my life where I'm trying to figure this womanhood thing out. It is more than hair, makeup, clothes, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> There's an element here that I'm still kind of searching for. And I think that'll take a while. Because I think as far as gender, we're all on a journey. We're all learning and growing about ourselves. And I feel the same way.|$|E
5000|$|According to bassist Emma Anzai, [...] "(Robert Knight) was like, 'Hey I {{want to put}} you in my film.' So we were like, 'All right, cool.' So now it's {{two years}} later and he {{documented}} when we did the first album, the first show, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> It was really cool. He wanted a new band to [...] [...] [...] develop." [...] During the process, the band was filmed for a few days at a time, and said that they would forget the cameras were there and act accordingly, so this film captures the band and their true interactions out of the spotlight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I shall take advice. I shall go to a lawyer,--and to a doctor, {{and perhaps}} to the Lord Chancellor, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. We can't let things go on like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the most}} {{astonishing}} story. A miracle, you might almost call it. Makes {{you believe in}} Fate and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. A week ago I was on the Subway in New York...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought they}} had thrown <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing {{overboard}} long ago," [...] said Miss Fitzgibbon. [...] "It would be better {{that they should have}} no veil, than squabble about the thickness of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the album's release {{longtime}} collaborator and guitarist Adam Granduciel {{departed from}} The Violators {{to focus on}} his own musical project, The War on Drugs, with sometime studio collaborator Rob Laakso joining in his place. Vile stated, [...] "My newest steady bandmate is Rob Laakso, I’ve known him longer than I’ve known other members of my band. He joined the band right after Smoke Ring came out. He’s like a wiz-kid with synthesizers and engineering in general and guitar. He can sync things up with sequences and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> that I like, but am too ADD to figure it out." [...] At {{the close of the}} tour, drummer Mike Zanghi quietly departed from the band.|$|E
5000|$|Alan Parsons: She Torry {{had done}} a covers album; I can {{remember}} that she did a version of [...] "Light My Fire." [...] I just thought she had a great voice. When the situation came up, they started head-scratching, saying, [...] "Who {{are we going to}} get to sing on this?" [...] I said, [...] "I've got an idea - I know this girl." [...] She came, and in a couple of hours it was all done. She had to be told not to sing any words: when she first started, she was doing [...] "Oh yeah baby" [...] and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> so she had to be restrained on that. But there was no real direction - she just had to feel it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} book came to Hawke about a decade before its publication. It began as rules for his own children and house, {{and over the years}} grew into Rules for a Knight. When speaking on the subject in a New Yorker interview, Hawke said, [...] "So we started saying, well, what are the rules of our house? And you start with the really mundane, like eight-o’clock bedtime, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> And then, invariably, you start asking yourself, well, what do we really believe in?" [...] In the same interview, Hawke discussed the motif of knights and chivalry, saying, [...] ""I’ve just always loved the idea of knighthood. It makes being a good person cool. Or, aspiring to be a good person cool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I mean is your Papa doesn't {{approve of}} him. He goes to races, and bets, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. And then your Papa thinks that he's over head and ears in debt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. That's {{about the}} beginning. It's these damned novels. All this torrent of misleading, {{spurious}} stuff that pours from the press. These sham ideals and advanced notions. Women who Dids, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--Moggs. The Young Men's Reform Association is {{bringing}} him forward. He's a Trades' Union man, and a Reform Leaguer, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. I shouldn't {{be surprised if}} he got in. They say he's got money." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2008 interview, Hansen {{spoke about}} the {{importance}} of the Land of the Free album and what it represented: [...] "We made it exactly at a time point when this kind of metal was proclaimed to be dead as can be. Where it was almost like if a drummer came up with a double bass drum people would say ‘ ya dooga daga yourself out of here man.’ Everything was ruled by Kurt Cobain and the alternative to the alternative and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> So at that point we made an album like this and it went down very successful. That was cool, that was something special. I think it was the album that gave Gamma Ray the acceptance as being a band not only a Kai Hansen project." ...|$|E

5000|$|..... I {{left the}} Catholic Church when I was 13 years old after my Uncle Bobby was assassinated, saying I {{would never go}} back, and I didn't really have a need for God and I didn't really believe in God. He wasn't useful to me. But I had gotten an {{understanding}} that there were spiritual people. My grandmother, Rose Kennedy, was a devout Catholic, {{but she was also}} a very spiritual person. She walked and meditated every day of her life. Her faith and spirituality got her through enormous trauma. That was not lost on me. My grandmother was this beacon of equilibrium in a world that was crazy. ...That's Catholicism just not something that speaks to me. I have my own tradition. I go to an ashram. I meditate. I chant.

6000|$|... "Oh no, not at all; indeed, she is {{not exactly}} in my style; she is too,--too,--too--in point of fact, {{too much of a}} girl for me. She has lots of money, and is very clever, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R
