500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened. Jones said [...] "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band". Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> with an exclamation mark." [...] Jones said.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2002, Adam Gilchrist, {{speaking}} at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan's action does not comply with the laws of cricket. The Melbourne-based Age newspaper quoted Gilchrist as saying."Yeah, I think he does (chuck), <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> because, {{if you read the}} laws of the game, there's {{no doubt in my mind}} that he and many others, throughout cricket history have." [...] These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with [...] "detrimental public comment".|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of [...] "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> because there are other things to be worried about right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put so much time and effort and politics into it– unnecessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, remarking, [...] "...more than most adaptations, this is a film true to Shakespeare's practice of employing all means at hand to keep the crowd entertained". Tom Clift of Moviedex complimented the director's use of subtle visual humor, while Lou Lumenick of the New York Post commented that [...] "this is the funniest Shakespeare film I can recall seeing". The Guardian scored the film {{four out of five}} stars, calling it [...] "...the first great contemporary Shakespeare since Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet". Christopher Schobert of IndieWire wrote, [...] "The result is an utter joy, Whedon's most emotionally resonant and fully realized feature film to date. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> as one who is not a devoted member of the Whedon army". Sheila O'Malley of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, noting that [...] "Much Ado About Nothing {{is one of the best}} films of the year". BBC Radio 5 Live's Mark Kermode said of the film, [...] "One of the things that it manages to do is, firstly, make all the dialogue and the language completely comprehensible". He proceeded to note that [...] "it makes sense to its audience. I think that the comedy is funny, and I don't say that lightly. [...] And finally, I think in terms of the way in which it deals with that gender politics issue is really well done. [...] It's a very hard trick to pull off, and he did it in two weeks!" [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire believed that, while keeping a sense of noir to compensate the romance, it was [...] "in balancing these competing elements and characters that this version really shines". The Village Voices Chris Packham said that the director [...] "approaches the story with a tremendous amount of joy".|$|E

6000|$|... "Then you cannot {{judge the}} matter. I myself am Thoroughly Educated, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> puns display genius.

6000|$|... "Let the King know all," [...] she cried. [...] "What does {{it matter}} now?

6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, [...] "they {{may try to}} kill me, but I have a will, too, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I {{will not}} die till I have found a {{successor}} to carry on--to the end--what I have begun.

6000|$|Isabel {{walked on}} again; {{she was silent}} for some minutes. [...] "I'm very sure that, highly as I already think of you, my opinion of you, if I should know you well, would only rise.

60|$|But {{be that as}} it may, this I say, that, of all men, {{seafaring}} men are {{the most}} likely to solve this great puzzle about the limits of science and of religion, of law and of providence; for, of all callings, theirs needs at once most science and most religion; theirs is most subject to laws, and yet most at the mercy of Providence. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> many seafaring men have solved the puzzle for themselves in a very rational and sound way, though {{they may not be able}} to put thoughts into words; and that they do show, by their daily conduct, that a man may be at once thoroughly scientific and thoroughly religious. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this Ancient and Honourable Corporation of the Trinity House is a proof thereof unto this day; a proof that sound science need not make us neglect sound religion, nor sound religion make us neglect sound science.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To put him,' said Madame Mantalini, {{looking at}} Ralph, and prudently abstaining from the {{slightest}} {{glance at her}} husband, lest his many graces should induce her to falter in her resolution, 'to put him upon a fixed allowance; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{if he has a}} hundred and twenty pounds a year for his clothes and pocket-money, he may consider himself a very fortunate man.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't try and hoodwink me, Grosjean!" [...] Tournefort cried now in {{a sudden}} access of rage. [...] "I tell you that I saw the light. I heard the aristos talking.

6000|$|The old {{man looked}} up suspiciously from his {{mistress}} to the persons who were assisting him to support her. With a strange, sudden jealousy {{he shook his}} hand at them.
