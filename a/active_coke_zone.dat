The chemical reaction is generated by titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) reacting with saturated carbon in hot metal. The following calculations are done by using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package, FLUENT (version 6. 2), with a segregated model. As shown in the results, {{on the basis of}} the flow pattern of liquid iron, the inlet selection of adding TiO(2) may be far away from the taphole. The calculated temperature variation in the damaged hearth by reaction is significant, but that on the other side of the hearth without adding TiO(2) isn't influenced. Additionally, the numerical temperature data of different locations may be examined by the blast furnace operators to judge the effect of lowering temperature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the complicated in-furnace phenomena of pulverized coal injection in ironmaking blast furnaces, a three-dimensional CFD model has been developed to simulate the gas-particle behaviors in not only raceway cavity but also the surrounding coke packed bed under practical conditions. The model considers two different fuels, pulverized coal and coke bed. The model is validated against the measurements in terms of coal burnout and gas composition, respectively. The typical in-furnace phenomena are simulated. Then an array of parametric study is carried out to evaluate the effects of local porosities of different <b>coke</b> bed <b>zones.</b> The qualitative and quantitative analysis is conducted. The results indicate that the local porosities of different <b>coke</b> bed <b>zones</b> can affect the coal burnout and gas composition differently: significantly in the deadman zone but insensitive in the dripping zone. In addition, the present model is able to provide a more reliable indicator to describe coal burnout, i. e. burnout over raceway surface, rather than burnout only along the centerline. The model is expected to be useful for understanding the flow-thermo-chemical behaviors and then optimizing the PCI operation in full-scale blast furnaces. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to numerically simulate iron flow and heat transfer in the hearth of a blast furnace by solving the three-dimensional turbulent Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the transport equation of energy at steady state. Under the effects of conjugate heat transfer and natural convection, a computational fluid dynamic calculation was performed to generate flow field in the hearth and the temperature distribution in the refractories during the tapping process. The accuracy and computation of the model is validated using operation data from BHP Steel's No. 5 blast furnace. The shear stress and heat flux on the wall were then predicted for the different vertical movements, shapes of the <b>coke</b> <b>zone</b> (dead-man), and the lengths of the tap-hole. As shown in the results, it is worth noticing that an increase in the tap-hole length causes the peak values of shear stress to shift in the increasing azimuthal direction at a particular plane, and the location of the peak value of shear stress coincides with the location of higher temperature actually measured on the hearth wall, signifying enhanced heat transfer to the wall at location of peak stress.

To support a helpful insight information of mass transfer for the hearth of the No. 2 blast furnace at CSC (China Steel Corporation), a numerical model including the mass transfer of carbon in thermal convective flow from a blast furnace hearth has been developed during the steady tapping process (based on a uninterrupted tapping process assumption). The three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation combined with the transport equations of energy and species with conjugate heat transfer and physical dissolution source is solved by the finite control volume scheme subjected to the segregated iterate under propriety boundary conditions.

40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractories}} {{is the main}} limitation for a long campaign blast furnace life. An in-depth understanding of the flow and heat transfer is essential {{in order to identify}} the key mechanisms for the hearth erosion. In this study, a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model is described which predicts the flow and temperature distributions of liquid iron in blast furnace hearth, and the temperature distribution in the refractories. The model addresses conjugate heat transfer, natural convection and turbulent flow through porous media, with its main features including three-dimensional, high grid resolution and a wide range of geometrical and kinematic scales (from taphole diameter to hearth outside diameter). The melt flow was simulated using improved transport equations, including a modified k-&# 949; turbulence model and a thermal dispersion term. The predicted results show a well-organized flow pattern: two large scale recirculation zones are separated vertically at the taphole level. This flow pattern controls the temperature distribution in the liquid phase, so that the temperature remains nearly uniform in the upper zone, but changes mainly across the lower zone. The effects of several important factors are examined, such as the fluid buoyancy vs constant fluid density, and the shape and position of <b>coke</b> free <b>zone</b> (different shapes of <b>coke</b> free <b>zones</b> were assumed in connection with the reported dissection study).

40|$|A {{strategy}} {{to enhance the}} thermal stability of C/SiO 2 hybrids for the O 2 -based oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene (ST) by P addition is proposed. The preparation consists of the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) on a mesoporous precipitated SiO 2. The polymerization is catalyzed by oxalic acid (OA) at 160 °C (FA:OA = 250). Phosphorous was added as H 3 PO 4 after the polymerization and before the pyrolysis that was carried out at 700 °C and will extend the overall activation procedure. Estimation of the apparent activation energies reveals that P enhances the thermal stability under air oxidation, {{which is a good}} indication for the ODH tests. Catalytic tests show that the P/C/SiO 2 hybrids are readily active, selective and indeed stable in the applied reactions conditions for 60 h time on stream. Coke build-up during the reaction attributed to the P-based acidity is substantial, leading to a reduction of the surface area and pore volume. The comparison with a conventional MWCNT evidences that the P/C/SiO 2 hybrids are more active and selective at high temperatures (450 - 475 °C) while the difference becomes negligible at lower temperature. However, the comparison with reference P/SiO 2 counterparts shows a very similar yield than the hybrids but more selective to ST. The benefit of the P/C/SiO 2 hybrid is the lack of stabilization period, which is observed for the P/SiO 2 to create an <b>active</b> <b>coke</b> overlayer. For long term operation, P/SiO 2 appears to be a better choice in terms of selectivity, which is crucial for commercialization...|$|R

A deeper understanding of at what point exergy is lost in the furnace might yield valuable information for the further optimization of the ferromanganese smelting process. The model is split into two parts covering the <b>coke</b> bed <b>zone</b> and the pre-reduction <b>zone</b> respectively. The <b>coke</b> bed <b>zone</b> model uses the estimated electrode tip position, mass transfer from pre- reduction zone, electric energy input and energy transfer to heat and chemical reactions as parameters. Hot gas ascending from the coke bed will enter the pre-reduction zone and exchange heat and mass (reaction) with the solid particles in the pre reduction zone. In the pre reduction zone model, the shrinking core model is applied to cover the reduc- tion kinetics of the ore particles. Moreover the Boudouard reaction is included and also decomposition of carbonates. Heat is exchanged with the furnace walls and the gas exits the furnace at the top. Unfortunately the model did not get to start working before the time was up for the work on this thesis. Nevertheless a sound foundation with derivations is given for the time this work should be continued. Matlab&# 174;is used for the calculations of this model.

40|$|Coke {{formation}} {{during the}} methanol-to-olefin (MTO) conversion {{has been studied}} at the single-particle level with in situ UV/Vis and confocal fluorescence microscopy. For this purpose, large H-ZSM- 5 crystals differing in their Si/Al molar ratio have been investigated. During MTO, performed at 623 and 773  K, three major UV/Vis bands assigned to different carbonaceous deposits and their precursors are observed. The absorption at 420  nm, assigned to methyl-substituted aromatic compounds, initiates the buildup of the optically <b>active</b> <b>coke</b> species. With time-on-stream, these carbonaceous compounds expand in size, resulting in the gradual development of a second absorption band at around 500  nm. An additional broad absorption band in the 600  nm region indicates the enhanced formation of extended carbonaceous compounds that form as the reaction temperature is raised. Overall, the rate of coke formation decreases with decreasing aluminum content. Analysis of the reaction kinetics indicates that an increased Brønsted acid site density facilitates the formation of larger coke species and enhances their formation rate. The use of multiple excitation wavelengths in confocal fluorescence microscopy enables the localization of coke compounds with different molecular dimensions in an individual H-ZSM- 5 crystal. It demonstrates that small coke species evenly spread throughout the entire H-ZSM- 5 crystal, whereas extended coke deposits primarily form near the crystal edges and surfaces. Polarization-dependent UV/Vis spectroscopy measurements illustrate that extended coke species are predominantly formed in the straight channels of H-ZSM- 5.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed, simulating various aspects of an iron blast furnace, {{for the purpose of}} analysing its behaviour. This involved the simulation of a counter current compressible gas flow, through a packed bed, dealing with the momentum and thermal energy of both phases. Directional resistances were added to the gas momentum, so as to account for the interphase friction caused by the packed bed. This enabled the prediction of the cohesive zone geometry, together with the <b>active</b> <b>coke</b> and stack, thus providing an important step for a successful analysis. The availability of multi-phase codes to solve such a system was limited and those existing being inadequate to represent these kinds of problems. What resulted was, the development of an algorithm to solve for two phases (gas and solids) with interspersed counter current flow, where the solids behaved as a packed bed. The algorithm developed is an enhanced version of existing algorithms. As well as the numerical model, a physical model of the raceway was developed, using dry ice particles to simulate the packed bed. The sublimation properties of the ice give a more realistic simulation to coke combustion, compared to the use of inert particles. The results of the experiment brought to light the effects of particle-particle interaction as being most significant in enabling the solids bed to move freely, around and into the raceway. From numerical modelling results, it is concluded that the ore:coke charging profile plays a dominant role in furnace behaviour. More interestingly, the gas distribution was not affected by raceway geometries when the cohesive zone was not in the immediate vicinity. It was therefore concluded that, {{the size and shape of}} the raceway zone has little influence on the gas distribution in the iron blast furnace...|$|R

The {{evolution}} of {{physical and chemical properties}} of the centre-line coke samples were analysed by Light Optical Microscopy (LOM), BET N 2 absorption and SEM/XRF/XRD. Alkali distribution in the EBF cokes was examined by XRF/SEM and EDS. Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was used to measure isothermal and non-isothermal CO 2 reactivity of the cokes. The crystalline order of carbon and the concentration of alkalis were found to increase as the coke descended through thermal reserve zone to the cohesive zone of the EBF. The crystallite height (Lc) of EBF coke carbon displayed a linear correlation with the measured EBF temperatures demonstrating the strong effect of temperature on carbon structure of coke in the EBF. Alkali concentration of the coke was increased as it descended into the EBF, and was uniformly distributed throughout the coke matrix. The CO 2 reactivity of lower <b>zone</b> <b>cokes</b> was found to increase when compared to the reactivity of the upper <b>zones</b> <b>cokes,</b> and was related to the catalytic effect of increased alkalis concentration.

40|$|International audienceTranspiration cooling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{efficient}} cooling techniques, but one which generates complex phenomena that are difficult to model, and this all the more in that a reactive fluid such as an endothermic fuel is used. Above a certain temperature, such fuel is pyrolysed and, thanks to its endothermic behaviour, this ensures the active cooling of the hot walls of the combustion chamber. However, one of the consequences of this thermal decomposition is the unwanted formation of coke which blocks the porous material (both on the surface and in the interior). This gradual blocking reduces the material's permeability and thus the efficiency of the cooling system. Modelling the permeability distribution of porous materials is thus a key parameter in better understanding transpiration cooling. The present article shows several models intended to estimate the variation in time and space of the permeability of a material (stainless steel) during its coking. The fluid circulating in this porous material is n-dodecane that is maintained at a high temperature. Following a presentation of the measurement device and the measured experimental data of the mean permeability, two categories of model are studied, notably discontinuous mesh models (with 2 and 3 meshes) and continuous analytical models (linear and exponential). The results obtained show that discontinuous models with 2 and 3 meshes are very close in measuring the temporal evolution of the thickness of the <b>coked</b> <b>zone</b> of the porous material. They also revealed that the exponential model is more appropriate than the linear model in estimating the spatiotemporal evolution of the permeability. Additionally, the evolution of the coking rate in the porous material was determined as a function of time and the results show behaviour similar to that indicated in the literature. Lastly, the average Darcy permeability was linked to the mass of coke deposit in the porous material, the result of which reveals a quasi-linear decrease.

The detailed kinetic studies including influence of gas phase product species, effect of temperature and catalyst loading on the reaction rates have been investigated. For the reforming reaction, the rate of reaction is first order in CH 4 concentration and independent of CO and H 2 O concentration. This indicates that the adsorptive dissociation of CH 4 is the rate determining step. The catalyst also showed excellent coke resistance even under a stoichiometric steam/carbon ratio. A lack of CO methanation activity is an important finding of present study and this is attributed to the ionic nature of Ru species.

The catalyst was characterized using XRD, TEM, XPS, BET analyzer and TGA/DTA techniques. The TEM analysis showed that Ni nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on TiO 2 surface with a narrow size distribution. The catalyst prepared via this approach exhibited excellent activity and stability for both the reactions compared to the reference catalyst prepared from the conventional wet impregnation method. For dry reforming, 86 % CH 4 conversion and 84 % CO 2 conversion was obtained at 700 degrees C. Nearly 92 % CH 4 conversion and 77 % CO selectivity was observed under a H 2 O/CH 4 ratio of 1. 2 at 700 degrees C for the steam reforming reaction. In particular, the present catalyst is extremely active and resistant to coke formation for steam reforming at low steam/carbon ratios. There is no significant modification of Ni particles size and no coke deposition, even after a long term reaction, demonstrating its potential applicability as an industrial reformate for hydrogen production.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis was conducted over {{a total of three}} years during the period October 1990 to October 1994, and is the sole work of the author, unless indicated otherwise by reference. A series of mildly dealuminated Y zeolites has been prepared by hydrothermal treatment using a low partial pressure of water vapour. These materials, together with samples previously dealuminated under more severe conditions, were characterised by the temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and the catalytic activity for suitable test reactions. Advances in technique permitted simultaneous monitoring of both the deammoniation and dehydroxylation processes. Interesting features were observed in the dehydroxylation traces which were related to changes in the acid site strength and amount of extraframework aluminium. The activity for both n-hexane cracking and toluene disproportionation reaches a maximum, corresponding to a framework concentration of 25 - 30 structural aluminium atoms per unit cell, consistent with the maximum number of strong acid sites. Slight deviation from this behaviour was noted, with the mildly steamed catalysts having lower activities than would be expected {{on the basis of their}} framework compositions alone. An in-depth analysis of the cracking of n-hexane has revealed that the extent of reaction is also critically dependent on the density of the available acid sites, which is explained in terms of the reaction mechanism. The disproportionation of toluene has highlighted differences in the nature of the extrastructural aluminium. The catalytic activity of the materials is either decreased or enhanced on extraction depending on whether the catalysts have been prepared by mild or severe dealumination. Variations in product distribution with time on stream have been observed and accounted for by changes in the reaction. The lifetime and activity profile of the catalyst could be altered by exposure of the catalyst to small amounts of toluene prior to the main reaction. This supports the concept of <b>active</b> <b>coke</b> enhancing this reaction. Cumene dealkylation was found to proceed on weaker acid sites than the cracking of n-hexane and the disproportionation of toluene, although a maximum in activity was still observed. This indicates that the weakest sites are not capable of catalysing this reaction, and that some heterogeneity of site strength exists between strong and weak acid sites. The dehydration of propan- 2 - 01 was confirmed as a reaction which assesses the total number of acid sites, regardless of strength. However, changes in the selectivity of the products with the strength of the acid sites were found, implying that the formation of di-isopropylether is favoured by strong sites. Deliberate coking of the catalyst surface by exposure to propan- 2 - 01 at elevated temperatures was found to increase the measured activity, in addition to changing the selectivity almost entirely in favour of propene. Extraframework aluminium was found to play an important role in all of the reactions studied. This emphasises the view that although structural aluminium has the larger influence on the overall activity of a catalyst for a particular reaction, the nature of the extraframework aluminium cannot be overlooked...|$|R

40|$|Methanol {{dehydration}} {{to produce}} dimethyl ether (DME) {{is an interesting}} process for the chemical industry since DME is an important intermediate and a promising clean alternative fuel for diesel engines. Pure or modified γ-aluminas (γ-Al 2 O 3) and zeolites are often used as catalysts for this reaction. However, these materials usually yield non desirable hydrocarbons and undergo fast deactivation. In this work, we study the catalytic conversion of methanol over an acid carbon catalyst obtained by chemical activation of olive stone with H 3 PO 4. A significant amount of phosphorus remains over the catalyst surface after the activation process, mostly in form of C-O-PO 3 and C-PO 3 groups, which provide the carbon a relatively high surface acidity and oxidation resistance. Methanol decomposition on this catalyst yields selectivities to DME higher than 82 % at 623 K and methanol conversion of 34 %, under the operating conditions studied. The activated carbon catalytic activity and stability, under inert and oxidant atmospheres, as well as different regeneration procedures, were studied. In the absence of oxygen, the catalyst suffers a progressive deactivation by coke deposition on the active acid sites (Fig. 1). The presence of oxygen modifies the carbon surface chemistry, probably through oxygen spillover on the catalyst surface, where the availability of labile oxygen avoids catalyst deactivation.

40|$|The thermal {{activation}} of a silica-stabilized gamma-alumina impacts positively on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene (ST). A systematic thermal study {{reveals that the}} transition from gamma-alumina into transitional phases at 1050 degrees C leads to an optimal enhancement of both conversion and selectivity under pseudo-steady state conditions; where <b>active</b> and selective <b>coke</b> have been deposited. The effect is observed in the reaction temperature range of 450 - 475 degrees C at given operation conditions resulting in the highest ST yield, while at 425 degrees C this effect is lost due to incomplete O- 2 conversion. The conversion increase is ascribed to the ST selectivity improvement that makes more O- 2 available for the main ODH reaction. The fresh aluminas and catalytically active carbon deposits on the spent catalysts were characterized by gas adsorption (N- 2 and Ar), acidity evaluation by NH 3 -TPD and pyridine adsorption monitored by FTIR, thermal and elemental analyses, solubility in CH 2 Cl 2 and MALDI-TOF to correlate the properties of both phases with the ST selectivity enhancement. Such an increase in selectivity was interpreted by the lower reactivity of the carbon deposits that diminished the COx formation. The site requirements of the optimal catalyst to create the more selective coke {{is related to the}} higher density of Lewis sites per surface area, no mixed Si-Al Bronsted sites are formed while the acid strength of the formed Lewis sites is relatively weaker than those of the bare alumina.

40|$|Nowadays, {{transition}} metal oxide catalysts are employed {{to a large}} extent in many chemical processes for the selective production of chemicals and intermediates. Although metal oxides are mostly known as oxidation catalysts, they can successfully catalyze a wide range of reactions, such as dehydration. Two different processes have been studied in the present work: the selective oxidation of methanol over V-Mo-based catalysts and the dehydration of glycerol over supported Nb- and W-oxide catalysts. Since the iron molybdate catalyst commercially employed in the selective conversion of methanol to formaldehyde suffers from deactivation by Mo volatilization, alternative catalysts such as supported Fe-V-oxide and unsupported V-Mo-oxide spinel-type catalysts were studied. The supported catalysts were found to be less selective than the commercial one, their showing a far more severe volatilization due to the limited amount of active metal they contain. At the same time, a spinel-type structure containing V, Mo or both was found to be flexible and stable under both reducing and oxidizing conditions, enabling the cations to change valence while preserving the spinel-type structure. In addition, the spinel structure was found to be stable with regard to volatilization during methanol oxidation. Nevertheless, V-Mo-oxide spinel-type catalysts, despite their excellent structural and stability properties, were found to be less selective than the commercial one and to not be suitable for replacing it without further improvement. In the production of biodiesel large amounts of glycerol are formed as a major by-product. Because of its low market demand, glycerol can represent a sustainable feedstock for producing chemicals and intermediates, such as acrolein, which is presently a fossil derivative obtained commercially from propene. The gas-phase dehydration of glycerol to acrolein over Al 2 O 3 -, SiO 2 -, TiO 2 - and ZrO 2 -supported Nb- and W-oxide catalysts was investigated here, tests regarding it being carried out under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. ZrO 2 - and TiO 2 -supported W-oxides were found to be the catalysts that performed best under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively, in terms of both their activity and their acrolein selectivity. A clear dependence of the activity and acrolein selectivity on the total acid site and Brønsted acid site concentration, respectively, was also observed. All of the catalysts were found to undergo deactivation due to poisoning of the <b>active</b> sites by <b>coke</b> molecules and heavy compounds. The deactivation phenomenon was found to be reduced considerably in the presence of oxygen...|$|R
40|$|International @ RAFFINAGE+DSA:CGE:PAFInternational audienceHydrodesulfurization (HDS) {{is a major}} {{process of}} {{petroleum}} refining destined to the removal of sulphur compounds from fuels, {{in order to satisfy}} environmental concerns. At the present day, the legislation for gasoline and diesel admits 10 ppm of sulphur. HDS catalysts are composed by Ni or Co promoted molybdenum sulfide phases dispersed in an alumina support with high specific surface, preferentially {{in the form of the}} so-called CoMoS phase. In the industrial process, these catalysts can perform during an average of 2 years, depending on the type of feed used. During the cycle of a HDS process, deactivation of the catalyst is attributed to three main causes: coke deposition (inducing both pore plugging and catalytic site blocking), metals deposition and segregation of the active phase. In the industrial units, to keep necessary performance, the catalyst deactivation is compensated by an increase in temperature. The aim of our work is to study the effect of coking and active phase changes on the deactivation of the HDS catalyst (of CoMo/Al 2 O 3 type) applied to the HDS of a diesel feed. In order to understand these phenomena, the aging of the catalyst must be accelerated; in order to reproduce the characteristics observed in a 6 months to 2 years run on a much shorter time scale. The typical operating conditions of a HDS process on a straight-run gasoil (SRGO) are 340 °C, 40 bar and a ratio H 2 /GO of 250 Nl/l; the accelerated aging tests must be performed under more severe but still realistic conditions. Using a commercial CoMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, different series of aging tests have been performed by increasing the temperature (up to 390 °C), limiting the hydrogen supply (from 250 to 25 Nl/l), introducing nitrogen and aromatic inhibitors in the feedstock or using mixed feedstocks (SRGO and SRGO/LCO). After every aging test, the hydrotreated diesel samples and the aged catalysts have been recovered for further analysis of catalyst texture, <b>active</b> phase and <b>coke</b> structure. Aging tests were performed with durations between 90 and 250 hours, reaching a coke amount of 8 %wt and a total volume of pores loss up to 30 %. The ensemble of processes occurring during the deactivation as a function of accelerated aging conditions is discussed in this work...|$|R
40|$|This year {{marks the}} four {{hundredth}} {{anniversary of the}} Parol Evidence Rule, the rule that dictates that the interpretation of a written contract should be determined solely according to its text and not influenced by prior contradictory external information. This article uses the occasion to offer a fresh interdisciplinary view of the Rule. The analysis presents a unique contribution to the heated debate regarding the desired levels of formalism and textualism in present-day contract law, by using New-Historicist tools. Unexplored aspects of {{the roots of the}} Rule are illuminated through an in-depth investigation of the first case of the contractual Parol Evidence Rule, the Countess of Rutland’s Case (1604). To examine this Case, the article suggests the use of “Legal New Historicism” – researching both human and non-human “actors” who played a role in this Case, and re-narrating the story of Isabel, the Countess of Rutland. This method reveals, for example, rare maps and romantic stories which lead to a critical look at the Rule’s total exclusion of context and helps to expose its gendered nature. The article further presents a close reading of the most influential paragraph in Sir Edward Coke’s report of the Case. Coke’s words and phrasing, it is proposed, should not be read as incidental choice of language, but rather as carefully planned and, as such, reflective of the dominant values of the legal culture within which they were written. It is further argued that the choice to exclude the context is far from a mere omission. De facto it can be seen as actively creating and then taking into account a manufactured context – one that does not exist and is deeply patriarchal. An exploration of the political and cultural contexts of Coke’s report explains the possible motives for establishing the Rule and phrasing it in such manner. It is argued that the Case played an <b>active</b> role in <b>Coke’s</b> efforts to strengthen the diminishing status of the Common Law, in the face of increasing threats, as a component of a marketing project aimed at improving the Common Law’s image without significantly changing its content. Along the way the first Case is paired with an almost-twin contemporary case, which resulted from a Hollywood scandal, Clark v. Hannah-Clark (2003). Based upon the juxtaposition of this new legal narrative of Nicolette (Hannah-Clark) with the older story of Isabel (the Countess of Rutland), it is concluded that the flaws and biases underlying the Rule remain acute and call for a serious reconsideration of its justification. In this way the article offers an original and, hopefully, useful argument against excessive formalist textualism in present-day contract law...|$|R
40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{study has been}} carried out on the reduction, softening and melting behavior of olivine based pellets in the experimental blast furnace. The aim of the project was to develop a fundamental understanding of the reduction mechanisms of olivine based pellets and to develop a correlation between the reduction rate and the softening behavior in the cohesive zone of blast furnace. The carburization characteristics of reduced iron were also investigated by examining olivine pellet and coke samples excavated and probed from an experimental blast furnace as well as the experimental investigations of pure hematite and heat treated coke. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to successfully determine the reduction degree of olivine pellets {{in different parts of the}} experimental blast furnace. These results were found to be consistent with assessments of reduction degree based on a detailed chemical analysis. The average reduction degree of iron oxide was seen to increase as the pellets descended towards lower zones of the EBF. Up to 75 % reduction was completed before the pellet had reached the cohesive zone; remaining reduction was completed within the cohesive <b>zone.</b> <b>Coke</b> Lc showed a linear variation with experimental temperature above 11000 C; a correlation was established to estimate furnace temperature as a function of EBF depth. The reduction degree of iron ore pellet showed a linear correlation with distance from the stock line of the EBF to the upper part of cohesive zone. But an abrupt increase in reduction rate was observed in the cohesive zone, a result observed in both EBF and experimental studies. The presence of olivine did not have much influence on the reduction degree of iron ore pellets for temperatures below 1100 oC in the upper shaft zone of the EBF. However, olivine was found to increase the rate of reduction in the advanced stages of reduction in the cohesive zone for temperatures in excess of 1100 oC. This effect was attributed to the formation of increased amount of molten iron oxide within the pellet. The initial melt formation and acceleration of the reduction rate in the cohesive zone of the EBF were also investigated. From the comparison between the reduction degree of excavated olivine pellets in this study and previous studies of EBF, it was found that the excavated pellets were located in the cohesive zone and increase of reduction rate in this zone could be verified by not only the change of gas composition, but also initial melt formation containing FeO phase. The chemical composition of slag phases of excavated pellet samples were located on the line between 2 FeO·SiO 2 and 2 MgO·SiO 2 in the FeO-MgO-SiO 2 ternary phase diagram. This result is in good agreement with the assumption that the initial slag formation of the olivine pellets had proceeded from the fayalite and after reduction the FeO contents in the slag phase had decreased and eventually precipitated as slag with a higher melting point. From the analysis of carbon contents of the excavated pellets in cohesive zone, it was observed that the carburization of iron pellets began after the complete reduction. This study has established that the reduction rate of iron pellet is the rate controlling step for carburization irrespective of the carburization reaction by the solid carbon...|$|R
40|$|On-board {{reforming}} {{of liquid}} fuels into hydrogen is an enabling technology that could accelerate consumer usage of fuel cell powered vehicles. The technology would leverage {{the convenience of}} the existing gasoline fueling infrastructure while {{taking advantage of the}} fuel cell efficiency and low emissions. Commercial acceptance of on-board reforming faces several obstacles that include: (1) startup time, (2) transient response, and (3) system complexity (size, weight and cost). These obstacles are being addressed in a variety of projects through development, integration and optimization of existing fuel processing system designs. In this project, CESI investigated steam reforming (SR), water-gas-shift (WGS) and preferential oxidation (PrOx) catalysts while developing plate reactor designs and hardware where the catalytic function is integrated into a primary surface heat exchanger. The plate reactor approach has several advantages. The separation of the reforming and combustion streams permits the reforming reaction to be conducted at a higher pressure than the combustion reaction, thereby avoiding costly gas compression for combustion. The separation of the two streams also prevents the dilution of the reformate stream by the combustion air. The advantages of the plate reactor are not limited to steam reforming applications. In a WGS or PrOx reaction, the non-catalytic side of the plate would act as a heat exchanger to remove the heat generated by the exothermic WGS or PrOx reactions. This would maintain the catalyst under nearly isothermal conditions whereby the catalyst would operate at its optimal temperature. Furthermore, the plate design approach results in a low pressure drop, rapid transient capable and attrition-resistant reactor. These qualities are valued in any application, be it on-board or stationary fuel processing, since they reduce parasitic losses, increase over-all system efficiency and help perpetuate catalyst durability. In this program, CESI took the initial steam reforming plate-reactor concept and advanced it towards an integrated fuel processing system. A substantial amount of modeling was performed to guide the catalyst development and prototype hardware design and fabrication efforts. The plate-reactor mechanical design was studied in detail to establish design guidelines which would help the plate reactor survive the stresses of repeated thermal cycles (from start-ups and shut-downs). Integrated system performance modeling was performed to predict system efficiencies and determine the parameters with the most significant impact on efficiency. In conjunction with the modeling effort, a significant effort was directed towards catalyst development. CESI developed a highly <b>active,</b> sulfur tolerant, <b>coke</b> resistant, precious metal based reforming catalyst. CESI also developed its own non-precious metal based water-gas shift catalyst and demonstrated the catalysts durability over several thousands of hours of testing. CESI also developed a unique preferential oxidation catalyst capable of reducing 1 % CO to < 10 ppm CO over a 35 C operating window through a single pass plate-based reactor. Finally, CESI combined the modeling results and steam reforming catalyst development efforts into prototype hardware. The first generation 3 kW(e) prototype was fabricated from existing heat-exchanger plates to expedite the fabrication process. This prototype demonstrated steady state operation ranging from 5 to 100 % load conditions. The prototype also demonstrated a 20 : 1 turndown ratio, 10 : 1 load transient operation and rapid start-up capability...|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of samples}} {{gathered}} during delineation of a coal resource {{is becoming increasingly}} sophisticated as various organisations attempt to predict and understand the technological behaviour of the mined product. Analysis to determine the concentration of trace elements in coal is becoming more prevalent, and not just merely for academic curiosity. Increased environmental awareness has impelled the need to consider potential negative impacts on the ecosystem caused by liberation of trace elements from coal during utilisation. The aims of this thesis are to: 1) Determine the concentration of trace elements in coal seams mined to supply the Collinsville pulverised fuel combustion plant at the Collinsville open cut, Northern Bowen Basin, Australia; 2) Determine the mineralogy and, using graphical relationships, the likely mode of occurrence of trace elements in the sampled pits; 3) Determine the mode of occurrence of trace elements in the pulverised fuel of the Collinsville power plant using the USGS sequential leaching method, and contrast the results with the same analysis for an unrelated fuel from another coal fired power utility (Mitsui Mining’s Omutu City plant, Kyushu, Japan); 4) Examine the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in the Collinsville power utility, and contrast the results with the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in the Mitsui combustion utility to assess the influence of trace element mode of occurrence on partitioning behaviour; 5) Examine the mobility of trace elements from solid ash waste from the Collinsville power utility, and compare with the mobility of trace elements from the Mitsui power utility solid waste to assess the influence of mode of occurrence on the leachability of trace elements and; 6) Determine the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in carbonisation of Bowen seam coal at the Bowen coke works and compare with the partitioning behaviour of the same elements in combustion. Lithotype logging of coal exposed in the highwalls of the Blake Central, Blake West and Bowen No. 2 pits was undertaken. Of particular note was the presence of dull heat affected coal toward {{the roof of the}} Blake Central pit seam, toward the floor of the Bowen No. 2 pit seam, and the presence of bed-parallel intrusions within the seam in the Blake West pit. In the Blake West pit seam, the intrusion caused thermal alteration of the coal to coke over a 60 cm zone immediately adjacent to the intrusion with a further 1. 10 - 1. 25 m zone of dull heat altered coal beyond the <b>coked</b> <b>zone.</b> In the Blake Central, 4. 5 m of dull heat-affected coal occurred near the roof of the seam. In the Bowen No. 2 pit, 1. 2 m of heat-affected coal occurred near the floor of the seam. Beyond the heat affected zone, lithotype logging of the Blake seams noted a number of rock partings, but no convincing dulling upward cycles due to progressive drying of the mire, noted in other studies of Permian coal, were found. No partings were found in the Bowen seam and only one convincing dulling upward cycles was logged. In part the absence of dulling upward cycles is due to heat alteration of the coal, but the numerous influxes of sediment laden water into the Blake seam mire also acted to terminate any significant dulling upward cycles by raising both nutrient levels and the water table. Following lithotype logging, channel sampling of the pits resulted in a total of 76 samples, 25 from the Blake Central pit, 36 from the Blake West pit and 15 from the Bowen No. 2 pit. The channel sampling intervals were determined approximately by coal lithotype interval, with some amalgamations to restrict sample numbers. The channel samples were analysed for proximate analysis, coal petrography and vitrinite reflectance (selected samples) and for major and trace elements using XRF and INAA. The lithotype logs, proximate analysis data and coal petrography were integrated to infer the depositional environment of the Blake and Bowen seams. The generally high ash yield, common stone bands, low sulphur content of the coal and rare pyrite in the Blake seam suggests the depositional environment was a Class 3 topotelmitic peat with a variable water table. The moderate ash yield, the absence of common stone bands, sulphur contents of ~ 2 % and the moderate pyrite content of the coal in the Bowen seam suggests the depositional environment was a Class 2 topotelmitic peat with a high water table. The igneous intrusions have caused extensive alteration of vitrinite to semi-coke, a general decrease in the volatile matter content and an increase in the vitrinite reflectance [Ro(max) ] toward the intrusion. Mineralogy was calculated from major and trace elements using normative analysis, calibrated by XRD analysis of low temperature ash from selected samples. The mineralogy of the Blake seam samples is dominated by kaolinite, with subordinate quartz, illite, feldspar, and siderite, and minor concentrations of pyrite, gorceixite, goyazite and anatase. The mineralogy of the Bowen seam samples is dominated by kaolinite, with subordinate quartz, illite and pyrite, and minor concentrations of siderite, gorceixite, goyazite and anatase/ rutile/ iron oxides. The concentration of trace elements in the channel samples was determined by INAA and XRF. The INAA and XRF concentrations of iron and uranium show a reasonable statistical relationship suggesting the two analysis methods are consistent with each other. The concentration of trace elements in the Blake and Bowen seams is generally low compared to world average ranges for coal and to crustal averages. Only gold, copper, hafnium, thorium and ytterbium were found to be above the world coal average range in the Blake seam. Only gold and copper were found to be above world coal average range in the Bowen seam coal. Trace element mode of occurrence was inferred using graphical relationships between normative mineral and trace element concentrations. In the Blake seam, arsenic, possibly chromium, copper, mercury, nickel and lead were inferred to be associated with pyrite. Bromine, cobalt, selenium, and zinc appeared to be organically bound. Cerium, caesium, europium, lanthanum, rubidium, and scandium showed a graphical relationship with illite. However, cerium, europium, lanthanum and scandium, along with hafnium, lutetium, neodymium, samarium, terbium, thorium, uranium and vanadium also showed a graphical relationship with gorceixite or gorceixite plus goyazite. It was inferred the latter group of elements are associated with monazite or zircon. In addition to the REE phosphate mode of occurrence, some rare earth elements also showed an affinity for kaolinite. Thorium and uranium were also inferred to be associated with feldspars. Antimony, tantalum and ytterbium were found to be dominantly associated with kaolinite. In the Bowen seam, arsenic, cobalt, possibly chromium, copper, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium and zinc showed a graphical relationship with pyrite. The elements cerium, hafnium, neodymium, rubidium, samarium, tantalum, thorium, uranium and tungsten all showed significant graphical relationships with the anatase/ rutile/ FeO grouping of minerals. It is inferred that the relationship is due to the presence of monazite, zircon, xenotime, REE phosphates, tungstates or other trace minerals, the distribution of which mirrors the distribution of the anatase/ rutile/ FeO grouping. Uranium and thorium were inferred to be associated with REE phosphates and zircon respectively, plus illite. The elements bromine, europium, lanthanum, terbium and vanadium were inferred to be associated with illite. A mixed illite/ heavy mineral suite mode of occurrence is inferred for samarium, tantalum, thorium and uranium. The elements caesium, lutetium, scandium, and ytterbium were inferred to be associated with kaolinite. The effect of igneous intrusions on the concentration of a number of minerals and trace elements was also examined. The presence of semi-coke or an inferred distance of heat alteration was used to distinguish heat affected and unaffected samples. Depletion or enrichment of minerals and elements was inferred using ply thickness weighted average concentration figures for altered and unaltered samples and trends of concentration change toward the intrusion. Some consistent changes in the concentration of trace elements and minerals were found across all three pits sampled. The minerals siderite and pyrite are depleted in the heat affected zone, but goyazite is enriched, particularly toward the margins of the heat affected zone. The elements bromine and strontium (the latter mirroring the goyazite trend) are concentrated in the heat affected zone. The elements cobalt, mercury, manganese (mirroring the pyrite trend), nickel and possibly arsenic and zinc are depleted in heat affected samples from all three pits sampled. The inconsistent behaviour of some other trace elements (molybdenum, chromium and possibly selenium) in response to the igneous intrusion appears {{to be the result of}} different modes of occurrence of trace elements between pits. Samples of pulverised fuel were collected from the Collinsville and Japanese (Mitsui) pulverised fuel utilities. The concentration of major and trace elements was determined by INAA, XRF and (for the Collinsville sample) ICP-MS & ICP-AES. INAA analysis suggests gold, cerium, cobalt, europium, hafnium, lanthanum, lutetium, molybdenum, neodymium, scandium, selenium, samarium, strontium, tantalum, thorium, tungsten and ytterbium are at the upper end or above the world average concentration range in the Collinsville pulverized fuel. Only gold, hafnium and thorium are at the upper end or above the world coal concentration range in the Japanese pulverized fuel. Sequential leaching of the pulverised fuels was undertaken according to the USGS protocol. The sequential leach data was interpreted to infer trace element mode of occurrence in the pulverised|$|R
