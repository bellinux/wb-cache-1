5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus <b>and</b> <b>likely</b> other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal people, {{particularly}} the Nyoongar and Yamatji, placed the flower spike in a paperbark-lined hole {{filled with water}} to make a sweet drink. Both this species and B.aemula have been credited with the inspiration behind May Gibbs' Big Bad Banksia Men; this species was familiar to Gibbs in her childhood <b>and</b> <b>likely</b> gave her the initial inspiration, although the depictions resemble the latter species. Artist Marianne North produced a highly regarded painting of B.attenuata during her stay in Australia in 1880–1881.|$|E

5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and {{much of their time}} was taken with detailed word-for-word explication. Books were rare and very expensive <b>and</b> <b>likely</b> only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E
40|$|Homeownership {{is widely}} {{advocated}} and believed to contribute towards economic activity, employment, wealth creation, economic, political, and neighbourhood stability and financial independence. Despite government’s interventions to advance homeownership {{there is currently}} a declining trend in homeownership {{and an increase in}} renting experienced in South Africa. As the government does not have the resources to provide adequate housing to all South Africans, identifying the factors which attribute to non-subsidised homeownership will assist in implementing interventions and strategies to increase access to non-subsidised homeownership and reduce reliance on government subsidised housing. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the comparative odds of variables contributing to non-subsidised homeownership in South Africa from secondary data obtained from a South African household survey. Compared to the heuristic model, the following variables were found to align closely with the expectation created; non-subsidised homeownership attainment was most likely for households within high-income groups and least for households within the low-income groups, more likely for households who have access to credit than those without, more likely for households with no accounts in arrears than those with accounts in arrears, more likely for households with an ability to save than those without, most likely for households consisting of seven or more household members <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for single member households, most likely for households where FKP (Financially Knowledgeable Person) has completed a tertiary education level <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for households with primary not completed education levels, most likely for households where the FKP is older (aged 65 and older) <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for young FKP households (aged between 18 <b>and</b> 24), most <b>likely</b> for households residing in rural areas <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for households residing in metropolitan areas, most likely for female FKP households <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for male FKP households. Unexpectedly the regression model indicated that non-subsidised homeownership is most likely for households where the Financially Knowledgeable Person (FKP) is not economically active (for example pensioners) <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for employed households, most likely for households from the African population group <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for Indian households, most likely where the FKP is never married or single <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for separated or divorced FKP households (which is expected) <b>and</b> most <b>likely</b> for households residing in Limpopo (which is expected) <b>and</b> least <b>likely</b> for households residing Western Cape.
