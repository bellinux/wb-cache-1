50|$|<b>A</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> is a {{piece of}} {{cookware}} used for roasting meat in an oven, either with or without vegetables or other ingredients. <b>A</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> may be used with a rack that sits inside the pan and lets the meat sit above the fat and juice drippings.|$|E
50|$|However, once Hazel {{realizes that}} Bugs is a rabbit, {{she tries to}} cook him instead, using a carrot (hollowed out and filled with a {{sleeping}} potion) as a lure. Bugs eats the carrot and falls asleep and Witch Hazel puts him into <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> to make rabbit stew.|$|E
50|$|Sous-vide {{low-temperature}} {{cooking is}} carried out by vacuum-sealing food {{in a plastic bag}} placed in a water bath or combi steamer with precisely controlled temperature for a long time. The food may then be browned by heating the surfaces to a much higher temperature of perhaps 200 C, using <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> or a blow torch prior to serving. A dishwasher has been used to cook salmon.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> shallow <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> is {{normally}} used for roasting small cuts of meat, but large-size <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> {{are also used}} for cooking large poultry such as turkey or goose, or for larger cuts of meat. <b>A</b> deep <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> can hold vegetables and other ingredients that meat can sit on rather than a rack, letting the vegetables absorb the fat and juice from the meat while cooking. <b>A</b> deep <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> {{can also be used}} as a baking dish or basin, holding smaller baking dishes that must be surrounded by boiling water.|$|R

50|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> {{will depend}} upon the type of meat being roasted, or the recipe being followed. Generally, meat that is high in fat content, such as duck, has no need of being covered during roasting. A lean cut of meat, however, will benefit from being covered during a long roasting time, to retain juices and soften the meat (for example, in using a tajine for roasting meat).|$|E
50|$|Modern Icelandic {{bakeries}} offer a {{wide variety}} of breads and pastry. The first professional bakers in Iceland were Danish and this is still reflected in the professional traditions of Icelandic bakers. Long-time local favorites include snúður, a type of cinnamon roll, usually topped with glaze or melted chocolate, and skúffukaka, a single-layer chocolate cake baked in <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan,</b> covered with chocolate glaze and sprinkled with ground coconut.|$|E
50|$|For roasting, {{the food}} may {{be placed on}} a rack, in <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> or, to ensure even {{application}} of heat, may be rotated on a spit or rotisserie. If a pan is used, the juice can be retained for use in gravy, Yorkshire pudding, etc. During oven roasting, hot air circulates around the meat, cooking all sides evenly. There are several plans for roasting meat: low-temperature cooking, high-temperature cooking, and a combination of both. Each method can be suitable, depending on {{the food and the}} tastes of the people.|$|E
25|$|Soaking bath – <b>A</b> glass <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> {{is lined}} with {{aluminum}} foil with the dull side facing downwards. The silver is placed atop of the foil and a quart of boiling water is poured over the pieces with two tablespoons of baking soda. The silver soaks for five minutes and is dried with a clean cloth. NOTE: Jeffrey Herman claims this method damages silver – http://www.hermansilver.com/care.htm#Electrochemical.|$|R
50|$|To this {{a little}} pends (browned bits or drippings from meats or vegetables, found {{on the bottom of}} <b>a</b> sauté or <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> via the Maillard reaction) or stock may be added. It is used to flavor sauces such as tomato sauce, savory fruit sauces, and other sweet and sour sauces such as the classic orange sauce for duck à l'orange.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>roasting</b> rack {{may be an}} {{accessory}} part of the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan.</b> <b>A</b> rack may be horizontal and lay flat on the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan,</b> {{or it may be}} a standing rack that sits vertically in the pan. A standing rack is most commonly used for <b>roasting</b> poultry. <b>A</b> variation of the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> standing rack is the beer can chicken recipe.|$|R
50|$|The baby cries. Bosko tickles {{his charge}} and then leaps for the piano; he intersperses his {{performance}} with shadow puppetry. Bruno reenters, happily joining the musical act by donning a lampshade {{as though it}} were a hoop skirt. Finally, the baby seems happy. Bosko dances off, skating upon a rug up to his stove, popping open the oven-door briefly to reveal a live bird in <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan.</b> Our hero skips back, finally sliding into a decorative column, knocking over a small fish bowl, which flips over upon his head to the giggles of his audience.|$|E
5000|$|Custard may {{be cooked}} in a {{bain-marie}} {{to keep a}} crust from forming {{on the outside of}} the custard before the interior is fully cooked. In the case of the crème brûlée, placing the ramekins in <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> and filling the pan with hot water until it is 1/2 to 2/3 of the way up the sides of the ramekins transfers the heat to the custard gently, which prevents the custard from curdling. The humidity from the steam that rises as the water heats helps keep the top of the custard from becoming too dry.|$|E
50|$|Leo the Lion, on his tenth birthday, {{receives}} a {{book as a}} present, and after finding out that lions rarely live beyond ten years, a hungry Beaky Buzzard, who {{turns out to be}} the one who had sent the book to him in the first place, takes the chance to eat him for his meal. What follows is a series of attempts by Beaky to eat Leo, starting with making him slip off a cliff using a banana peel to try and kill him. After he lands, Beaky makes a sandwich out of Leo's tail, which he tricks Leo into biting so he will jump up in pain. Beaky proceeds to catch the lion in <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> and starts to prep him for dinner.|$|E
25|$|According to Frank Hamilton Cushing, Native American cooking baskets {{used by the}} Zuni (Zuñi) {{developed}} from mesh casings woven to stabilize gourd water vessels. He reported witnessing cooking basket use by Havasupai in 1881. Roasting baskets covered with clay would be filled with wood coals and the product to be roasted. When the thus fired clay separated from the basket, it would become <b>a</b> usable clay <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> in itself. This indicates a steady progression from use of woven gourd casings to waterproof cooking baskets to pottery. Other than in many other cultures, Native Americans used and still use the heat source inside the cookware. Cooking baskets are filled with hot stones and <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> with wood coals. Native Americans would form a basket from large leaves to boil water, according to historian and novelist Louis L'Amour. As long as the flames did not reach above the level {{of water in the}} basket, the leaves would not burn through.|$|R
5000|$|Jus is a rich, lightly reduced stock used as <b>a</b> {{sauce for}} <b>roasted</b> meats. Many {{of these are}} started by {{deglazing}} the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan,</b> then reducing to achieve the rich flavour desired.|$|R
50|$|When {{roasting}} any meat in an oven, trivet racks - {{which typically}} fit into <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> - {{are often used}} to enable the meat joint to be held above the direct heat of the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> and allow the juices of the joint to drip into the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> for the subsequent making of gravy.|$|R
5000|$|Unbeknownst to Fifer and Fiddler, {{however, the}} Big Bad Wolf {{and his three}} sons are {{stalking}} them. The Wolf dresses in drag, this time as Little Bo Peep and he/she sadly tells the pigs that he/she lost his/her sheep and doesn't {{know where to find}} them. Then the pigs discover the [...] "sheep" [...] (the Wolf's three sons in disguise) and the Wolf and his sons, still in disguise, run home to their cave, and the pigs follow. The Wolf then locks the door and swallows the key. At first, the pigs embarrassedly think that [...] "Bo Peep" [...] has romantic intentions (a rather unusual scene; [...] "Why, Bo Peep!"), but the wolves spring their trap and overwhelm the pigs. They try to blow the wolf alarm horn, but Practical doesn't come. Soon Fifer and Fiddler are soon put in <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> by the wolves and they tauntingly blow the horn repeatedly. Still hoping for Practical to come to their rescue, the pigs challenge the wolf cub blowing the horn to blow it real loud ("Uh, why don't you blow it loud?"). He tries to, but can't, and the pigs taunt him that it was [...] "a sissy blow." [...] So the Big Bad Wolf blows the horn to prove what the Wolf family is made of ("Sissy, huh? Gimme that horn. I'll show 'em!"). This time, it is so loud that Practical hears ("The Wolf!") and goes to the rescue, pulling the Wolf Pacifier mechanism along behind him.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Roasting</b> <b>pans</b> {{are made}} in several {{materials}} that offer their own unique benefits: ...|$|R
2500|$|Braising <b>pans</b> and <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> (also {{known as}} braisers and roasters) are large, wide and shallow, to provide space to cook <b>a</b> <b>roast</b> (chicken, beef or pork). They {{typically}} have two loop or tab handles, {{and may have}} a cover. Roasters are usually made of heavy gauge metal {{so that they may}} be used safely on <b>a</b> cooktop following <b>roasting</b> in <b>an</b> oven. Unlike most other cooking vessels, roasters are usually rectangular or oval. There is no sharp boundary between braisers and roasters – the same pan, with or without a cover, can be used for both functions. In Europe, a clay roaster [...] is still popular because it allows roasting without adding grease or liquids. This helps preserve flavor and nutrients. Having to soak the pot in water for 15 minutes before use is a notable drawback.|$|R
5000|$|Saucing roast lamb - pouring {{cider vinegar}} over the meat when {{roasting}} lamb, especially {{when combined with}} honey or when sliced onions {{have been added to}} the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan,</b> produces <b>a</b> sauce.|$|R
50|$|Suet {{should not}} be {{confused}} with beef dripping, which is the collected fat and juices from the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> when cooking <b>roast</b> beef. Suet should also not be confused with all beef or sheep fat. It is normally the fat found around the heart and kidneys of cattle and sheep, and nowhere else in the animals.|$|R
5000|$|Wall oven: Wall ovens make {{it easier}} to work with large <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> and Dutch ovens. A width is {{typically}} 24, 27, or 30 inches. Mounted at waist or eye level, a wall oven eliminates bending. However, it can be nested under a countertop to save space. A separate wall oven is expensive compared with a range.|$|R
50|$|The {{kitchen is}} {{supplied}} with dishes, cutlery, utensils, {{pots and pans}} and bake ware (including <b>roasting</b> <b>pans,</b> cookie sheets, bread pans and muffin pans). There is a full size propane oven, {{as well as some}} two-burner propane stoves for cooking. The hut is lit by several propane lights. Propane is supplied by the Alpine Club via a large outdoor tank.|$|R
50|$|PhIP {{has been}} found in cooked beef, pork, chicken, and fish products. Exposure to PhIP depends on the eating habits of the {{individual}} and can vary up to 5000-fold. Exposure is also related to the type of meat, doneness, cooking method, and quantity consumed. Individual exposures can differ due to various anti-carcinogens in the diet. Different cooking methods for meat (broiling, grilling, frying, <b>roasting,</b> <b>pan</b> drippings) all contribute to formation of PhIP.|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven {{is called}} a braadpan, which {{literally}} translates to frying <b>pan</b> or <b>roasting</b> <b>pan.</b> The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|R

Drinking water is available from a small stream fed by Kiwetinok lake (a day hike) running through the meadow 60 m south of the hut. It is advisable to boil or treat the water before drinking it. In the winter you can dig down to the creek or melt snow for water.|$|R
