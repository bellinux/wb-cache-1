This solution for the Green's function is a well-studied, generic result which applies to both fractional and usual Fokker-Planck equations alike.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs) for high resolution spectroscopy. MMCs are energy dispersive particle detectors based on the calorimetric principle which are typically operated at temperatures below 100 mK. The detectors make use of a paramagnetic temperature sensor to transform the temperature rise upon the <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particle</b> in the detector into a measurable magnetic flux change in a dc-SQUID. The application of MMCs for neutrino mass measurements and their advantages with respect to other approaches are discussed. In view of this application {{the development of an}} MMC optimized for β-endpoint spectroscopy on 187 -rhenium is presented. A fully micro-fabricated X-ray detector is characterized and performs close to design values. Furthermore, a new technique to more efficiently couple rhenium absorbers mechanically and thermally to the sensor was developed and successfully tested. By employing a metallic contact, signal rise times faster than 5 μs could be observed with superconducting rhenium absorbers. In addition to the single pixel detectors, an alternative approach of reading out multiple pixels was developed in this work, too. Here, the individual absorbers have a different thermal coupling to only one temperature sensor resulting in a distribution of different pulse shapes. Straightforward position discrimination by means of rise time analysis is demonstrated for a four pixel MMC and a thermal model of the detector is provided. Unprecedented so far, an energy resolution of less than ∆E_FWHM < 5 eV for 5. 9 keV X-rays was achieved across all absorbers...|$|E

Spatial and temporal changes in snow grain size can help us to characterize the thermal state of snow pack and to estimate the timing and spatial distribution of snowmelt. This paper discusses the methodology of Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data analysis for estimating snow grain size. In this investigation, we have used ENVISAT-ASAR image mode SLC data in HH-polarization with incidence angle range 39. 1 degrees - 42. 8 degrees of 31 (st) January 2006. Survey of India (SOI) topographical sheet (52 H 3) in 1 : 50, 000 scale is used for preparation of digital elevation model (DEM) and for the registration of satellite data.

Envisat-advanced synthetic aperture radar single polarized, single look complex (SLC) data have been processed for backscattering coefficient image generation.

40|$|Novel {{methods for}} {{producing}} ideal powders for fabricating Si 3 N ceramic parts have been investigated. The characteristics sought were principally uniformly small diameter, equiaxed, high purity particles which {{are free of}} agglomerates. Two laser processes were studied. In the first, a CO 2 laser source was used to heat the: reactant gases by coupling directly to them. Silicon (Si) and Si 3 N 4 powders have been synthesi- zed directly from SiH 4 and NH 3 /SiH 4 mixtures respectively. The spatially well- defined reaction zone and {{the combination of the}} rapid heating rates with the short times at reaction temperatures yielded very uniform and small diameter particles. Si N powders were produced with particle diameters entirely with- in the range o 00 - 200 <b>A.</b> The <b>particles</b> are equiaxed and nearly spherical. The Si powders had the same general characteristics, but exhibited a slightly larger range of diameters. An analytical model gives <b>an</b> approximate description <b>of</b> the process. The reaction proceeds as a thermal reaction at thresholds which agree with measured optical absorptivities. The absorptivities are high, which will permit good efficiencies to be achieved. We were not successful in inducing a multiphoton, unimolecular reaction. The second process uses selective heating {{to reduce the size of}} over- sized particles or agglomerates as well as modifying the shape of high aspect ratio particles. This process is based on the decreasing <b>absorption</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particle</b> to light when its diameter is less than the wavelength cf the incident light. Light induced comminution was demonstrated. The power required for comminution is higher than was originally anticipated, but it agrees with present analytical models. While the process was demonstrated with a 150 watt CO 2 laser, this power limitation precluded <b>an</b> orderly investigation <b>of</b> process variables. It appears that 750 - 1500 watts are required to operate continuously. These and higher power C 02 lasers are commercially available. We have successfully demonstrated both processes for producing superior Si ane Si 3 N 4 powders. The results of the direct synthesis approach are viewed as extremely important. Their uniform, small particle sizes make them unique with respect to all other powders. While demonstrated with Si and Si 3 N 4 powders, the process appears applicable to other materials. More work is required to determine the ultimate significance of the laser commi- ntion process. It appears that the process will work as anticipated and will induce the desired size and shape changes. It is apparent that it will be an energy intensive process. Prepared for U. S.

The calibration measurements validated that with the VH-TDMA one can obtain accurate volatility and hygroscopicity measurements for particles between 20 nm and 145 nm. The CalNex 2010 results showed that the instrument is capable in field measurements at varying measurement conditions; and valuable data about hygroscopicty, volatility and the mixing state of several types of aerosols were measured.

40|$|Uncertainties in the aerosol single {{scattering}} albedo {{have been}} identified to be <b>an</b> important source <b>of</b> errors in current large-scale model estimates of the direct aerosol radiative forcing <b>of</b> climate. <b>A</b> number <b>of</b> investigators have obtained estimates of the single scattering albedo from <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> remote sensing and in situ measurements during aerosol field experiments. During the Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment (TARFOX, 1996) for example, estimates of the aerosol single scattering albedo were obtained (1) as a best-fit parameter in comparing radiative flux changes measured by airborne pyranometer to those computed from independently measured aerosol properties; (2) from estimates of the aerosol complex index of refraction derived using <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> airborne sunphotometer, lidar backscatter and in situ size distribution measurements; and (3) from airborne measurements of aerosol scattering and absorption using nephelometers and absorption photometers. In this paper, we briefly compare {{the results of the}} latter two methods for two TARFOX case studies, since those techniques provide height-resolved information about the aerosol single scattering albedo. Estimates of the aerosol single scattering albedo from nephelometer and absorption photometer measurements require knowledge of the scattering and absorption humidification (i. e., the increase in these properties in response to an increase in ambient relative humidity), since both measurements are usually carried out at a relative humidity different from the ambient atmosphere. In principle, the scattering humidification factor can be measured, but there is currently no technique widely available to measure the <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aerosol sample as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> relative humidity. Frequently, for lack of better knowledge, the absorption humidification is assumed to be unity (meaning that there is no change in aerosol absorption due to an increase in ambient relative humidity). This assumption then enters the estimate of the single scattering albedo at ambient relative humidity. To investigate the validity of this assumption we have carried out modeling studies <b>of</b> the <b>absorption</b> humidification factor, assuming that the aerosols contain an insoluble soot core and a coating which determines its hygroscopic growth behavior. The aerosol optical properties are then computed {{on the basis of the}} shell/core <b>particle</b> morphology using <b>a</b> Mie-code for concentric shells.

In the 20th century, the trapping (confinement) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particle</b> in some region by its observation outside the region was considered as nonsensical, indicating some non-completeness of quantum mechanics. Even as late as 2001, confinement by absorption was considered as a paradox. Later, similar effects of the suppression of Raman scattering was considered an expected effect, not a paradox at all. The <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> photon at some wavelength, the release <b>of</b> <b>a</b> photon (for example one that has escaped from some mode <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fiber), or even the relaxation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particle</b> as it enters some region, are all processes that {{can be interpreted as}} measurement. Such a measurement suppresses the transition, and is called the Zeno effect in the scientific literature.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{theoretical}} {{foundation for the}} statistical approach for computing the <b>absorption</b> properties <b>of</b> particles in the Rayleigh domain. We present a general method based on the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to compute the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the Rayleigh domain. The method allows to separate the geometrical aspects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particle</b> from its material properties. Doing the computation of the optical properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particle</b> once, provides them for any set of refractive indices, wavelengths and orientations. This allows for fast computations <b>of</b> e. g. <b>absorption</b> spectra <b>of</b> arbitrarily shaped particles. Other practical applications of the method are {{in the interpretation of}} atmospheric and radar measurements as well as computations of the scattering matrix <b>of</b> small <b>particles</b> as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> the scattering angle. In the statistical approach, the optical properties of irregularly shaped particles are represented by the average properties <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ensemble <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> with simple shapes. We show that the <b>absorption</b> cross section <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ensemble <b>of</b> arbitrarily shaped particles with arbitrary orientations can always be uniquely represented by the average <b>absorption</b> cross section <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ensemble <b>of</b> spheroidal <b>particles</b> with the same composition and fixed orientation. This proves {{for the first time that}} the statistical approach is generally viable in the Rayleigh domain. Comment: Accepted for publication in JQSR...|$|R
