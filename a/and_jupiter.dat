5|$|Conjectures {{regarding}} extraterrestrial {{life have}} ensured a high-profile for Europa and {{have led to}} steady lobbying for future missions. The aims of these missions have ranged from examining Europa's chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized subsurface oceans. Robotic missions to Europa need to endure the high-radiation environment around itself <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> Europa receives about 5.40 Sv of radiation per day.|$|E
5|$|Most short-period comets {{belong to}} the Jupiter family—defined as comets with semi-major axes smaller than Jupiter's. Jupiter family comets are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune. During close {{encounters}} with Jupiter their orbits are perturbed into a smaller period and then circularized by regular gravitational interaction with the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1801, astronomers {{discovered}} Ceres {{and other}} bodies between Mars <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter</b> which were for decades {{considered to be}} planets. Between then and around 1851, {{when the number of}} planets had reached 23, astronomers started using the word asteroid for the smaller bodies and then stopped naming or classifying them as planets.|$|E

5|$|Vesta orbits the Sun between Mars <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter,</b> {{within the}} {{asteroid}} belt, with {{a period of}} 3.6 Earth years, specifically in the inner asteroid belt, interior to the Kirkwood gap at 2.50AU. Its orbit is moderately inclined (i = 7.1°, compared to 7° for Mercury and 17° for Pluto) and moderately eccentric (e = 0.09, {{about the same as}} for Mars).|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter</b> {{were sold}} in January 1920 and {{thereafter}} broken up in Italy and Britain, respectively. Illustrious followed her sisters to the breakers in June 1920, being scrapped at Barrow-in-Furness. Caesar was paid off in April 1920 and eventually sold for scrapping in Germany in July 1922. Magnificent and Mars were sold for scrap in May 1921 and broken up at Inverkeithing and Briton Ferry, respectively. Prince George was sold for scrapping in Germany in September, but while en route she ran aground off Camperduin. Victorious was renamed Indus II in 1920 and eventually sold for scrap in December 1922.|$|E

50|$|The Europa Jupiter System Mission - Laplace (EJSM/Laplace) was a {{proposed}} joint NASA/ESA unmanned space mission slated to launch around 2020 for the in-depth exploration of Jupiter's moons {{with a focus}} on Europa, Ganymede <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter's</b> magnetosphere. The mission would have comprised at least two independent elements, NASA's Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) <b>and</b> ESA's <b>Jupiter</b> Ganymede Orbiter (JGO), to perform coordinated studies of the Jovian system.|$|R
5|$|In {{the course}} of Romanization, the Celtic polytheism of the local tribes was merged – syncretized – with the Roman religion. The Celtic deities came to be worshiped under {{the names of their}} Roman counterparts. Thus Lugus was {{replaced}} by Mercury, Belenus by Apollo, Taranis by Jupiter and so forth, in a practice called interpretatio romana by Caesar, who pioneered it. Roman gods also acquired the names of local gods as epithets; thus Mars was venerated as Mars Caturix, Mercury as Mercurius Cissonius <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter</b> as Jupiter Poeninus after the god of the Pennine Alps.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter</b> can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
5|$|The IAU, the internationally {{recognized}} authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies, defines dwarf planets as bodies that are {{large enough to}} have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, but have not cleared their neighbourhoods of similar objects. Since 2008, there have been five dwarf planets recognized by the IAU. Ceres orbits in the asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> The others orbit beyond Neptune and are subclassified as plutoids.|$|E

50|$|The main {{spacecraft}} design {{drivers are}} related to the large distance to the Sun, the use of solar power, <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter's</b> harsh radiation environment. The orbit insertions at <b>Jupiter</b> <b>and</b> Ganymede and the large number of flyby manoeuvres (more than 25 gravity assists, and two Europa flybys) requires the spacecraft to carry about 3000 kg of chemical propellant.|$|R

5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt occupies the orbit between Mars <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter,</b> between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The {{asteroid belt}} contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely {{to be more than a}} thousandth of that of Earth. The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} much debate about the {{symbolic}} meaning of the helmet's design. The griffin was the companion of Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance and fate. They were both seen as agents of death and were often linked with gladiatorial combat. The meaning of the face and headpiece are less clearly identifiable. Suggestions have ranged from the Greek god Attis and the hero Perseus, to the Roman gods Mithras <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter</b> Dolichenus, to a more general Eastern Mediterranean appearance that could possibly have been meant to suggest a Trojan identity. The Phrygian cap was often used by the Romans as a visual motif representing the Trojans.|$|E
5|$|As {{the combat}} raged {{at the head}} of the line, the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. As they passed, Canopus, Donegal and Atlas all raked the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter</b> respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} game, {{the player}} {{controls}} four characters: Felix is an eighteen-year-old Venus Adept {{from the village of}} Vale, who was an anti-hero in Golden Sun but serves as the game's new protagonist. His younger sister, Jenna, a seventeen-year-old Mars Adept also from Vale, and a fourteen-year-old girl <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter</b> Adept named Sheba, as well as a sharp-witted elderly scholar named Kraden, are all hostages that Felix was forced to take with his now-deceased masters, the Mars Adept warriors Saturos and Menardi that served as the previous game's antagonists. In this game, the player takes the role of Felix as he strives to complete Saturos and Menardi's original objective to restore Alchemy to the world of Weyard, and joining them early on is a Mercury Adept named Piers, a mysterious young man whose ship Felix's party uses to explore the world throughout their journey.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, {{a team of}} Indian, British and American astronomers {{working in}} Java (Indonesia) and Kavalur (India) claimed that they had {{detected}} a thin atmosphere during an occultation, when it <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter</b> passed {{in front of a}} star. They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0.1 Pa. However, in 1979, Voyager 1 observed an occultation of the star κ Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results. The occultation measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the visible spectrum. No atmosphere was revealed by the Voyager data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be , which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 µPa. The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 an {{exoplanet}} (47 UMa b) {{was announced}} in orbit around 47 Ursae Majoris by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made by observing the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum corresponding {{to changes in the}} star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulled it around. The planet was the first long-period extrasolar planet discovered. Unlike the majority of known such planets, it has a low-eccentricity orbit. The planet is at least 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 1,078 days or 2.95 years to orbit its star. If it were to be located in the Solar System, it would lie between the orbits of Mars <b>and</b> <b>Jupiter.</b>|$|E
