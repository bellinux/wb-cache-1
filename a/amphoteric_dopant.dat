The 119 Sn substitutional atom is distinguished by being an isovalent impurity in Si, Ge and α-Sn, and by being an <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopant</b> in the III-V semiconductors.

Based on proposed crystalquasichemical formulae of antimony doped crystals PbTe:Sb <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopant</b> effect was explained. Mechanisms of solid solution formation for РbТе-Sb 2 Те 3 : replacement of antimony ions lead sites  with {{the formation of}} cation vacancies  (I) or neutral interstitial tellurium atoms  (II) were examined. Dominant point defects in doped crystals PbTe:Sb and РbТе-Sb 2 Те 3 solid solutions based on p-PbTe were defined.

40|$|The {{lead-free}} ferroelectric (K,Na) NbO 3 (KNN) is {{a potential}} future substitute for lead zirconate titanate (PZT) in piezoelectric actuators and sensors. Doping, e. g. by adding CuO as a sintering aid, modifies the material properties and can cause so called hard or soft ferroelectric behavior. Using ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory, the site selectivity of Cu dopants in the KNN lattice is investigated, and the stable defect complexes of Cu dopants and lattice vacancies are determined. Cu may act as an <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopant,</b> i. e. substitute on alkali sites as a donor or on Nb sites as an acceptor, depending on the processing conditions. On both alkali and Nb sites, defect complexes of Cu with vacancies, namely (CuK−V K), (CuNb−V O), and (V O−CuNb−V O), are stable {{with respect to the}} isolated defects. The first two defect complexes should exhibit a dipole moment and may therefore cause ferroelectric hardening...|$|E
40|$|BaTiO 3 -based {{multilayer}} ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) with Ni internal electrodes are co-fired in reducing atmospheres to avoid oxidation of the electrode. Although dielectric materials are doped by acceptor, donor and <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopants</b> {{to minimize the}} oxygen vacancy content, {{there is still a}} large concentration of oxygen vacancies that are accommodated in the BaTiO 3 active layers. In general, ABO 3 perovskites demonstrates a strong ability to accommodate the oxygen vacancies and maintain a regular pseudo-cubic structure. Oxygen deficient barium titanate can be transformed to a hexagonal polymorph (h-BT) at high temperatures 1, 2. In this paper, we report the new modulated and long range ordered structures of non-stoichiometric BaTiO 3 -δ that are observed in the electrically degraded Ni-BaTiO 3 MLCCs at low temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of dimeric (As 2) vs tetrameric (As 4) arsenic vapour {{species on the}} electrical and optical properties of undoped and of Ge-doped GaAs grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been studied by using Hall effect, photoluminescence (PL) and DLTS measurements. The arsenic molecular beam was obtained from separate As 2 and As 4 sources, resp., and from a single source providing adjustable As 4 /As 2 flux ratios. The occurrence of the defect related bound exciton lines in the 2 K PL spectra {{was found to be}} directly correlated with-the existence of three deep states (M 1, M 3, M 4) which are characteristic of MBE grown GaAs. The intensity of these extra PL lines and simultaneously the electron trap concentration could be reduced substantially by decreasing the As 4, vs As 2 flux ratio. In addition, a considerably lower autocompensation ratio in Ge-doped n-GaAs was achieved with As 2 molecular beam species which provide a much higher steady-state arsenic surface population. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of defect related centers as well as of <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopants</b> strongly depends on the surface chemistry involved in the film growth process...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus ions were {{implanted}} in ZnO single crystals with energies of 50 – 380 keV having total doses of 4. 231013 – 4. 231015 cm− 2. Positron annihilation measurements reveal {{the introduction of}} vacancy clusters after implantation. These vacancy clusters grow to a larger size after annealing at a temperature of 600 °C. Upon further annealing up to a temperature of 1100 °C, the vacancy clusters gradually disappear. Raman-scattering measurements reveal the enhancement of the phonon mode at approximately 575 cm− 1 after P+ implantation, which is induced by the production of oxygen vacancies sVOd. These oxygen vacancies are annealed out up to a temperature of 700 °C accompanying the agglomeration of vacancy clusters. The light emissions of ZnO are suppressed after implantation. This {{is due to the}} competing nonradiative recombination centers introduced by implantation. The recovery of the light emission occurs at temperatures above 600 °C. The vacancy-type defects detected by positrons might be part of the nonradiative recombination centers. The Hall measurement indicates an n-type conductivity for the P+-implanted ZnO layer, suggesting that phosphorus is an <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopant...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that Si is always incorporated in InP LPE layers as a shallow donor, i. e., {{it does not}} exhibit the amphoteric behavior known to LPE GaAs. Si-doped InP layers were grown with a concentration of ND [...] NA-" 1 9 101 ' 6 - 5 91019 cm- 8 on (111), (110) ', and (100) oriented InP substrates. The growth temperature was varied from 715 ~ to 550 ~ The segregation coeffi-cient for Si in InP LPE layers {{was estimated to be}} ksi ~ 30. The layers were characterized by photoluminescence m asurements at 1. 8 r and Hall data. No emission line (energy range 1. 42 - 1. 35 eV) due to a shallow Si acceptor was ob-served. The difference in amphoteric behavior of Si in InP and GaAs is dis-cussed {{on the basis of the}} atomic radii involved. Si is one of the most frequently used and most im-portant dopants in I I I-V compound semiconductors. In principle it behaves as an <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopant</b> depending on whether it substitutes the Group III or Group V ele...|$|E
40|$|Using first-principles method {{within the}} {{framework}} of the density functional theory, we study the influence of native point defect on the structural and electronic properties of Bi 2 Se 3. Se vacancy in Bi 2 Se 3 is a double donor, and Bi vacancy is a triple acceptor. Se antisite (SeBi) is always an active donor in the system because its donor level (ɛ(+ 1 / 0)) enters into the conduction band. Interestingly, Bi antisite (BiSe 1) in Bi 2 Se 3 is an <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopant,</b> acting as a donor when μe 0. 251  eV (the material is typical n-type). The formation energies under different growth environments (such as Bi-rich or Se-rich) indicate that under Se-rich condition, SeBi is the most stable native defect independent of electron chemical potential μe. Under Bi-rich condition, Se vacancy is the most stable native defect except for under the growth window as μe > 0. 262  eV (the material is typical n-type) and ΔμSe < − 0. 459 eV (Bi-rich), under such growth window BiSe 1 carrying one negative charge is the most stable one...|$|E
30|$|High index planes have {{attracted}} {{a great deal}} of attention for the production of high quality epitaxially grown semiconductor materials. In particular, the incorporation of silicon as an <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopant</b> in AlGaAs [1, 2] and GaAs [3] grown on high index GaAs substrates have been studied extensively using Hall, photoluminescence and photothermal ionisation measurements. Compared to silicon, beryllium (Be) can be incorporated only as p-type dopant in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) GaAs [4, 5] and liquid phase epitaxy grown AlGaAs [6]. Photoluminescence studies have been carried out by Galbiati et al. [7] to investigate the effect of Be incorporation and higher hole mobility in MBE grown p-type AlGaAs on (100) and (311)A GaAs orientations. Their results favour (311)A orientation to have more incorporation efficiency and carrier mobility than that of (100) plane. This is due to higher substitutional Be incorporation efficiency in (311)A. It was concluded that good quality p-AlGaAs material can be grown on (311)A substrate using Be dopant. Furthermore, it was also reported that the PL spectra of the samples grown on (100) are affected due to the presence of non-radiative centres compared to those grown on (311)A plane. In the light of the above experimental studies, it is important to study and characterise the electrically active deep level defects present in Be-doped AlGaAs grown on (100) and (311)A.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on the interaction between SAWs (surface acoustic wave) and low-dimensional systems studied using optical techniques. In particular SAW-driven luminescence from a lateral p-n junction is demonstrated. The lateral p-n junction is formed by molecular beam epitaxy regrowth on a patterned GaAs substrate. Silicon is used as an <b>amphoteric</b> <b>dopant</b> to create a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas on flat (100) planes and a two-dimensional hole gas on angled (311) A facets. A lateral p-n junction is formed at the interface between these planes. SAWs with a frequency of ~ 1 GHz are generated using an interdigitated transducer. When a continuous radio frequency (RF) signal is used to excite the transducer, SAW-driven light emission from the p-n junction is demonstrated by peaks in the current/light emission at the resonant frequency of the transducer. To investigate {{the nature of the}} luminescence further, short RF pulses are used to drive the transducer. The short pulses temporally isolate the SAW-driven light emission from any emission due unwanted pick-up of the free space electromagnetic wave. In the final section the modulation of the emission energies of a single self-assembled quantum dot by a SAW is investigated. The compression and expansion of the crystal due to the strain wave causes the energy of the dot lines to oscillate around their equilibrium values. The shape of the SAW broadened emission lines was seen to depend {{on the nature of the}} transition in the dot offering an alternative way of identifying charged and neutral species in this sample. The modulation of the dot energy levels by the SAW is used to control the time of photon emission from the system. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
