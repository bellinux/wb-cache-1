40|$|In {{a typical}} paving operation, several parties are {{involved}} in producing a quality asphalt pavement (e. g., design mix specifier, hot mix plant operator, QA/QC inspector, asphalt laying operator, and roller compactor operator). However, quite often it is the roller operator’s skill that ultimately determines {{the density of the}} compacted <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat</b> and therefore the final quality of the pavement. An under-compacted <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat</b> is permeable to air and water which shortens the pavement life. On the other hand, unnecessary roller passages will lead to over-compaction that is associated with insufficient air void content in the asphalt. An over-compacted pavement is susceptible to permanent deformation [1], leave alone the waste of time and equipment in the compaction process. Hence, it would be highly advantageous if the roller operator is able to continuously monitor the compaction level of asphalt during the paving operation...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, road {{construction}} with {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) has significantly increased. However, many issues have risen {{with respect to the}} durability of recently constructed asphalt concrete roads. Therefore, the importance of introducing new quality control measures is a current concern. Properties of the asphalt mixture and the construction practices are important criteria for quality and durability of asphalt pavements. Present Sri Lankan practice is to measure and control, (1) Thickness, (2) Density, (3) Bitumen content and aggregate gradation, and (4) Roughness index (IRI) of the laid <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat.</b> Objective of the present research is to find the importance of measuring air void of the laid <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat</b> and the need of a combined index of significant parameters to improve quality and durability of asphalt concrete roads. Core samples were tested at 12 locations with various initial compaction levels at two aging levels, as 100 days and 225 days. In addition, performance of road sections was evaluated with various levels of initial compaction after 5 years to check the long-term aging of asphalt concrete. It revealed that initial air void content decreased significantly under traffic in a short period and {{it is not possible to}} evaluate the long-term performance of HMA roads by initial air void content alone...|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{problems}} that are observed in Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements are related to insufficient compaction of longitudinal joints, segregation, or low material density. In particular, construction of quality longitudinal joints continues {{to be one of the}} most problematic areas for HMA pavement performance and this problem may have a special role in porous asphalt concretes; because of the difficulty in compacting the unconfined edges, lower density zones can occur at the joints and therefore the longitudinal joints between <b>asphalt</b> <b>mats</b> can deteriorate faster than other areas. This contributes to the ultimate performance, then to pavement life and life cycle cost. Therefore, road agencies are now setting more rigorous compliance standards for joint density, requiring best-practice construction and effective quality control in order to guarantee a 100 % pay factor. These issues influence maintenance and rehabilitation costs and scheduling and there are many consequences for performance-based planning, programming and management. In the light of above facts, a literature review on construction equipments and measurement methods has been performed. The main objective has been confined to the analysis of the reliability of high-speed devices in detecting density non-conformities especially in joints area. In order to pursue the objectives, in-lab and on-site experiments were designed and performed; different measurement methods (vacuum sealing method, portable non-nuclear devices, etc.) have been used. On the basis of the obtained results, specific recommendations have been made for practical applications...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to study {{influence}} of different flooring systems on several aspects of locomotion of dairy cows. To assess the gait on different floors, trackway analysis was used. Cows walking on a hard, slippery surface had shorter strides, wider posture and asymmetric steps. A hard, slippery surface resulted in stride shortening, wider posture and asymmetric gait. Using soft rubber mats made gait patterns more similar to those on a natural yielding surface such as sand. When cows with moderate lameness walked on yielding surfaces their gait parameters associated with lameness were less pronounced than on hard concrete surfaces. Preference studies showed {{that the majority of}} cows preferred to walk and stand on soft rubber flooring rather than on concrete flooring. However, lame cows within the group did not show a stronger preference to walk on soft flooring than non-lame cows, presumably due to lower social rank compared to healthy herd mates. In order to assess the effects of long-term exposure to flooring systems differing in hardness and abrasiveness installed in the walking and standing areas an experimental study was carried out. Claw conformation, claw horn growth and wear rates, as well as static weight and pressure distribution were evaluated. On a rougher flooring (mastic asphalt), exaggerated wear, highest growth rate and a loss of sole concavity was seen, and most weight was exerted to the sole area of the claws. When rubber-equipped feed-stalls were used together with mastic asphalt in alleys cows showed reduced wear, positive net growth and reduced loss of the concavity compared to cows housed on asphalt alley surfaces. In comparison with <b>asphalt</b> flooring, rubber <b>mats</b> on the alleys resulted in lower growth and wear rates, increased net growth, preserved sole concavity and the bulb and wall area of the claw carried the most weight. Rubber mats together with little exposure to an abrasive asphalt surface resulted in claw horn net growth rates similar to that observed on aged, low abrasive concrete slatted floor. It was concluded that soft flooring provides good locomotion comfort for dairy cows but a moderate abrasion is also required to prevent claw overgrowth...|$|R
30|$|Asphalt trackbeds {{have already}} been used internationally with great acceptance, while the asphalt layer in railway {{substructures}} is not placed in the same position. Momoya [1, 2] introduced a new performance-based design method and considered {{the effects of the}} number of passing trains on the fatigue of asphalt mixture layer. Teixeira et al. [3] presented bituminous track design and found that structural performance was good when a 12 -cm to 14 -cm conventional bituminous subballast layer was used in lieu of the usual granular layers. In Italy, more than 1, 200  km high-speed lines have been equipped with asphalt sub-ballast layer since 1970 s [3]. Huurman et al. [4] investigated the possibilities of embedded rail in asphalt (ERIA) and used cement-filled, porous asphalt as the bitumen-bound alternative for cement-bound concrete. In US, two methods have been used to incorporate hot mix asphalt (HMA) in railroad trackbeds [5]. One method is to place the HMA on the top of subgrade and the ties directly on the <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat,</b> which is called overlayment. Another method used more often is called underlayment referring to the <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat</b> placed under the ballast to serve as subballast. A program KENTRACK was developed for the asphalt trackbed design [6]. In China, because the Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) has been the fundamental material in high-speed rails since the 1990 s [7], very few related research were referred.|$|E
40|$|Segregation is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in hot mix asphalt (HMA) construction. The two types of segregation encountered are gradation segregation and thermal segregation. This investigation report involves mainly thermal segregation, which occurs when areas of the HMA mat are significantly colder than other areas. Various investigations have determined that cold areas within the <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat</b> during construction tend to show a corresponding decrease in finished pavement density, which could have a detrimental effect on pavement life. This investigation report outlines the effort to gain insight on the long term effects of thermal segregation {{on the life of}} a pavement surface. Instances of thermal segregation were identified during HMA construction using an infrared camera and the locations of these instances were noted using GPS coordinates. Then these locations were monitored every six months to develop a timeline for any temperature differential damage that occurred. The data and conclusions reached are outlined in this report. 17.

40|$|Poor {{compaction}} {{can lead}} to early deterioration of an asphalt pavement. It often happens when paving occurs during adverse weather conditions. Yet, in Minnesota, paving must often occur under adverse conditions. A new tool now simulates the cooling of an <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat</b> behind the paver {{under a variety of}} environmental conditions. The software, PaveCool Version 2. 0, offers users insights into how adverse climate conditions will affect their ability to produce a durable, quality road surface. Users input the type of existing surface, type of asphalt mix, and weather conditions. The output shows a cooling curve with recommended compaction starting and stopping times. Field tests confirm the value of this program as an aid to cold weather paving. A Windows program, PaveCoo 12. 0 runs on laptop computers (Windows 95, 98, or NT required). This report documents the study of thermal properties and compactibility of hot-mix asphalt, related laboratory tests on the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of hot-mix asphalt at typical compaction temperatures, a literature review, and testing results. It also includes a copy of the PaveCaol Version 2. 0 software. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{the desired}} density during field {{compaction}} of asphalt mixes {{is critical to}} meeting the design specifications of an asphalt pavement. Existing techniques measure the density of asphalt mixes at a discrete number of points. As such, the process is cumbersome, time consuming, and is not indicative of the overall compaction achieved unless large amounts of data is collected and analyzed. In this paper, {{the concept of a}} novel neural network-based asphalt compaction analyzer capable of predicting the density continuously, in real time, during the construction of the pavement is presented. The concept is verified using laboratory data from an asphalt vibratory compactor (AVC). The compaction analyzer is based on the hypothesis that a vibratory compactor and the hot mix asphalt (HMA) mat form a coupled system having unique vibration properties. The measured vibrations of the compactor along with the process parameters such as lift thickness, mix type, mix temperature, and compaction pressure can be used to predict the density of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat.</b> Vibration data obtained during compaction of asphalt mixes in the laboratory is used to design and train the neural network (NN). The trained neural network is then used to continuously predict the degree of compaction in real time. Th...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a field study of asphaltic pavement patching operations performed by three different contractors working {{in a total of}} ten sites. It forms part of an ongoing research programme towards improving the performance of pothole repairs. Thermal imaging technology was used to record temperatures of the patching material throughout the entire exercise, from the stage of material collection, through transportation to repair site, patch forming, and compaction. Practical complications occurring during patch repairs were also identified. It was found that depending on the weather conditions, duration of the travel and poor insulation of the transported hot asphalt mix, its temperature can drop as high as 116. 6  °C over the period that the reinstatement team travel to the site and prepare the patch. This impacting is on the durability and performance of the executed repairs. Cold spots on the <b>asphalt</b> <b>mat</b> and temperature differentials between the new hot-fill asphalt mix and existing pavement were also identified as poorly compacted areas that were prone to premature failure. For example, over the five-minute period, the temperature at one point reduced by 33 % whereas the temperatures of nearby areas decreased by 65 % and 71 %. A return visit to the repair sites, three months later, revealed that locations where thermal segregation was noted, during the patching operation, had failed prematurely...|$|E
