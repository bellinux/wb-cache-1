I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also {{went through a lot}} of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

500|$|Other {{critics have}} taken a more lenient view. Historian and {{television}} presenter Dan Snow described the show's modus operandi as [...] "one step above Blackadder, but that's fine... it plays to stereotypes, but it's fantastic as entry-level history." [...] Writing in The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe noted that [...] "As a grown-up you might quibble {{with the fact that}} they don't always distinguish between things that genuinely are true <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> people would like to be (sadly, there's no hard evidence that Aeschylus was brained by a tortoise dropped by an overflying eagle)", but added that [...] "children and adults alike should enjoy the gleefully anachronistic way in which the information is presented." [...] Dent in The Guardian, while conceding what she called the show's [...] "frankly slapdash, dumbed-down approach to history", also argued that [...] "in Horrible Histories there are always serious messages lurking amid the silliness." ...|$|E
500|$|Some People Change was {{the title}} of Montgomery Gentry's fifth album, which was {{released}} in 2006 under the production of Rutherford and Wright. Its title track, co-written by Neil Thrasher, Jason Sellers, and Michael Dulaney, was previously recorded by Kenny Chesney on his 2004 album When the Sun Goes Down. Gentry told the Edmonton Sun that Some People Change [...] "is based more on family issues, {{the love of the}} family, the love of neighbors, relationships", and said that the title track [...] "is about being able to challenge your inner demons <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can bring people down, alcoholism, or hatred or racism." [...] Montgomery Gentry's version of the song peaked at number 7, followed by the two-week number 1 hit [...] "Lucky Man" [...] and the number 3 [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". In 2008, [...] "Lucky Man" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, the duo's first Grammy nomination.|$|E

Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, I go in there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E

500|$|On March 26, 2002, {{recording}} for Poodle Hat officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. By mid-2002, six originals—"Hardware Store", [...] "Party At The Leper Colony", [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", [...] "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?", [...] "Bob", and [...] "Genius In France"—had been recorded. The album's first original song is [...] "Hardware Store", which, {{as the title}} suggests, is about a new neighborhood hardware store <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can be purchased therein. The song was originally {{supposed to be a}} style parody of another (unspecified) artist, but it eventually evolved into its own, original composition. [...] "Party At The Leper Colony" [...] describes a party at a leper colony. The song makes heavy use of wordplay, using common English idioms to describe events wherein people literally lose body parts (e.g. [...] "Dance all night to a rotten band/Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand"). [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", a pastiche of Midnite Vultures-era Beck, consists of pick-up lines which become steadily more ridiculous and suggestive. Because the spelling of the song's title recalls the manner in which Prince titled many of his records, Yankovic specified on his website that the [...] "song is actually intended to sound like me trying to sound like Beck trying to sound like Prince" [...]|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

2500|$|Ciara's fifth {{album was}} {{originally}} called One Woman Army after {{a song of}} the same name produced by The Underdogs. Speaking on the concept Ciara said [...] "It really {{is the best way to}} represent what the body of work is, On One Woman Army, I talk about where I am <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I want as a woman <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I need." [...] However, on April 15, 2013, Ciara confirmed the album's track listing and simultaneously revealed that her fifth album was now eponymously titled. According to Spin, the self-titled incarnation of Ciara's fifth studio album is [...] "more inventive enough to separate itself from her previous work" [...] compared to the album's previous direction, under the title One Woman Army.|$|E
2500|$|While doing {{press for}} Twin Peaks, he was again {{asked if he}} was retired from film and {{confirmed}} that he had made his last feature film, responding, [...] "Things changed a lot... So many films were not doing well at the box office even though they might have been great films <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were doing well at the box office weren't the things that I would want to do". Lynch later clarified that this statement had been misconstrued, and reiterated [...] "I did not say I quit cinema. Simply that nobody knows what the future holds." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show offers {{few details}} of the Sacred Scrolls. One {{important}} feature mentioned is the Book of Pythia, which chronicles an ancient prophetess (similar to the Oracle of Delphi named Pythia) who journeyed with the Thirteenth Tribe on their voyage to Earth. Pythia also described the exodus of the other Twelve Tribes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happened to them. She describes a dying leader who would guide the tribes to salvation. President Roslin sees herself as playing {{the part of the}} leader in the texts, as she has terminal breast cancer. Another important quotation from the scrolls is the recurring phrase [...] "this is not all that we are," [...] a phrase considered the foundational statement of faith.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi {{taught that}} when all Israel stood before Mount Sinai {{to receive the}} Torah, they decided {{unanimously}} to accept the reign of God joyfully. Furthermore, they pledged themselves responsible for one another. God was willing to make a covenant with the Israelites not only concerning overt acts that God revealed to Israel, but also concerning God’s secret acts, reading [...] to say, [...] "The secret things belong to the Lord our God <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are revealed." [...] But the Israelites told God that {{they were ready to}} make a covenant with God with regard to overt acts, but not with regard to secret acts, lest one Israelite commit a sin secretly and the entire community be held responsible for it.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{of the new}} poems have epigraphs from Walt Whitman, such as [...] "El desterrado". [...] He {{might have}} come across Whitman during his time in France but his {{interest}} {{seems to have been}} consolidated during his Oxford period. [...] There are overlaps between Whitman’s poetry and the thinking of Ortega as enshrined in his famous formula Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia from the Meditaciones, in other words I am the sum of my individual self <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> surround me/that I perceive. [...] This is perhaps explained most fully in [...] "Viento saltado", which he began in Oxford in 1931. [...] It is a clear example of one of Guillén’s stylistic characteristics, the use of exclamations. [...] Everything in the poem is an exclamation as he displays an almost childlike delight at being buffeted by a blustery wind.|$|E

60|$|But real literature, as {{distinguished}} from anecdote, does not concern itself with superficial appearances alone. Literature is revelation. Modern literature is indecorous revelation.
