5|$|Aberdeen {{joint station}} was congested, {{resulting}} in delayed trains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>low,</b> open platforms were frequently covered in oily slime {{due to the}} large quantities of fish that passed through. Agreement with the Caledonian Railway over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the goods station to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms {{on the western side}} opened and the adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. Foundations for the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920.|$|E

The unexpectedly swift defeat of France resulted in an upswing in Hitler's popularity and a strong upsurge in war fever.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{influence}} of the later Habsburg families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was crossbred with horses of Central Europe <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Low</b> Countries and thus was closely related to many breeds that developed, including the Neapolitan horse, Groningen, Lipizzaner and Kladruber. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German breeds, including the Hanoverian, Holstein, East Friesian and Oldenburg. Dutch breeds such as the Friesian and Gelderland also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish breeds such as the Fredericksborg and Knabstrupper.|$|E

5|$|During {{the morning}} of July 5, deep {{convection}} rapidly increased and banding features formed despite strong easterly wind shear.

Weak steering currents persisted as the depression moved towards the northwest at 4mph (6km/h) to 5mph (8km/h). Following the storm's upgrade, further development did not occur as the system tracked steadily towards the north-northwest. Early on July7, the depression made landfall near Lazaro Cardenas with winds of 35mph (55km/h). Rapid weakening followed shortly after landfall and the storm dissipated several hours later over the mountains of Mexico.|$|E

The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave.

Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas.

5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen.

To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection.
