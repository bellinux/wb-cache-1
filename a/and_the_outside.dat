Communication between them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world was prevented by the Japanese as much as possible.|$|E
30|$|Understory {{vegetation}} cover within <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> “US” <b>and</b> “MM” exclosures increased over time after thinning (Fig.  1 b). The cover within <b>the</b> “US” <b>and</b> “MM” exclosures {{tended to be}} greater than <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> exclosures <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cover <b>outside</b> needed more than 5  years to equal that within the exclosures. The cover both within <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> “LD” exclosure shifted from 60 to 100 % over time after thinning. No difference in the cover between within <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> exclosure was observed at 11  years after thinning in each plot.|$|R

5|$|Bungie had {{previously}} released soundtracks for their games due to fan request, but Microsoft was hesitant {{to commit to}} producing a soundtrack for Halo; at the time most video games {{did not get a}} commercial soundtrack release.

5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> was made from a mixture of new and old bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was the same color as the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; {{dehiscence}} (fruit body opening) {{is caused by}} the pressure exerted by swollen paraphyses—sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) cells that are interspersed between the ascospores. Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore puffing upon rupture is thought to be caused by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior chamber of the fruit body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> environment. Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the west}} range – the cellarer's range – are extant. It was entered from the west by an outer parlour, {{projecting}} from {{the north end of}} the range, where members of the community received visitors. The prior lived on the upper floor which comprised a hall, chamber and chapel dedicated to Saint Hilda. The prior's rooms were probably located above the outer parlour, as was the pattern at other monasteries, accessing the cloister <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world. The largest surviving fragment of the range comprises a cellarium or storehouse where supplies were kept. It is a vaulted undercroft of nine bays constructed from stone ashlar with its floor level below that of the cloister. It is relatively well-preserved and believed to have been divided by timber partitions which were later replaced in stone.|$|E

5|$|In {{a master}} plan from 2006, Avinor has {{identified}} several key development issues to increase {{the capacity of the}} airport. For Terminal A, the plans call to keep the existing structure, and gradually expand it westwards, eventually passing over the railway on a culvert. Along the area between the railway and the highway, a south pier is planned to be constructed, with the inside facing immediately towards the railway <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> having aircraft stands. In the short term, this is planned with six stands for regional aircraft, with a single-story building. The remaining stands currently used for regional aircraft will then be converted to international gates. While Avinor states that there is need for an expansion of Terminal B, no concrete solution has been found, {{in part because of the}} lack of space in the area, although this can partially be fixed by removing the general aviation from the area.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E
5|$|The Hanada {{family had}} {{generally}} received very positive press coverage while Takanohana and Wakanohana were active wrestlers, {{with the press}} holding them up as the ideal Japanese family and tending to ignore any splits between them. Their different attitudes towards both sumo philosophy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world had been noted, with Takanohana being regarded as somewhat aloof and reserved and Wakanahona having a warmer personality. However, upon their father's death from cancer in May 2005, a bitter rift between the brothers was widely reported in the Japanese media. Takanohana felt he should be the chief mourner at the funeral as he had remained in the Sumo Association whilst his brother had left to become a TV celebrity, but the role went to Wakanohana as the elder brother, as is traditional.|$|E

5|$|To {{the west}} of the nave is a small narthex, which is topped by an unusual {{rectangular}} tower. The tower was used either as a bell tower or watchtower, or possibly both. It was accessible via wooden ladders on the inside <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> It features four wide vaulted windows in its upper part and a rectangular dome covered with roof tiles. According to art historian Robert G. Ousterhout, the tower of the Church of the Holy Mother of God is the earliest example of a belfry integrated into a church building and arranged above the narthex in Balkan architecture. This design would later establish itself as standard in the Balkans. The construction of an integrated tower has been attributed to either Western European or oriental (Syriac or Armenian) influences.|$|E
