5|$|At first clients sent hole-punched <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> to a Reynolds {{processing}} center, {{which would}} print a complete accounting that is {{sent back to}} the client by mail. The development of modems and internet technology in the 1970s led to several advancements. Reynolds provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand minicomputers at 80 Reynolds locations, which provided computing power and printed forms. This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in tapes and allowed daily access to online services. By the end of the 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership. In the years 1978 and 1982, Reynolds introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships.|$|E
5|$|The club {{achieved}} mid-table league {{positions for}} two seasons, {{but they were}} relegated in 1934 as a penalty for breaking amateur regulations. The club had paid their players a small sum of money for each game. Although against the rules, this was common at the time; Malmö FF were the only club to show it in their <b>accounting</b> <b>records.</b> In addition to relegation to Division2, the club suffered bans for the entire {{board of directors and}} twenty-six players. The version of events told by Malmö FF and local press suggests that local rival IFK Malmö reported the violation to the Swedish Football Association. This belief has contributed to the longstanding competitive tensions between the clubs.|$|E
5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's <b>accounting</b> <b>records.</b> In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

He quit school in the eighth grade and worked for various firms until he finally found a job at Lomba & Cia, an importer of goods from the United States and Europe. When the owners of the firm became aware of Carrión's English-language proficiency, they put him charge of transactions made in that language.|$|E
25|$|According to romantic folk etymology, Charing {{derives from}} French chère reine (dear queen), {{but the name}} was {{certainly}} used in the contemporary royal <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> for the costs of constructing the cross and in earlier records of the Augustinian Priory nearby. The name Charing probably comes from the Anglo-Saxon word ċerring, a bend, as it stands {{on the outside of}} a 90-degree bend in the River Thames (see Charing in Kent). The original cross stood at the top of Whitehall {{on the south side of}} Trafalgar Square, but was destroyed on the orders of Parliament in 1647 during the Civil War, and was replaced by an equestrian statue of Charles I in 1675 following the Restoration. This point in Trafalgar Square is regarded as the official centre of London in legislation and when measuring distances from London.|$|E

500|$|In 1931, Hastings {{represented}} John Morland in the Royal Mail Case. The {{director of}} the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus {{with the aid of}} the company accountant, John Morland, to make it look as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. [...] At the same time, he had been falsifying <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> by drawing money from the reserves and having it appear on the records as profit.

500|$|The 1938 coins, {{again without}} a special name, were struck {{at all three}} mints, {{the first time that}} had been done for the Oregon Trail coins in one year. [...] Six {{thousand}} (plus pieces for the Assay Commission) were struck at each mint, and the issue was sold in sets of three, for $6.25. [...] The same practice was followed in 1939, but the price was raised to $7.50 a set and the mintage reduced to 3,000 coins, plus the assay pieces. [...] According to Swiatek and Breen, these sets were also bought up by speculators, and individual collectors often had to pay double or triple the issue price to secure a set. [...] The coins did not sell out instantly; the OTMA's <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> reveal that nine months after the 1938 coins were put on sale, the organization still had almost half the issue available. Similarly, by October 1939, the Association had sold only 8,283 half dollars dated that year, less than the 9,000 available for sale. Nevertheless, collectors sent letters of protest to congressmen and to the Treasury Department. On August 5, 1939, Congress acted, passing legislation that put an end to all commemorative issues authorized before March 1939. [...] Swiatek and Breen observed that if Congress had not intervened, [...] "there would probably be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980".|$|E

2500|$|The Early Dynastic Period {{began after}} a {{cultural}} {{break with the}} preceding Jemdet Nasr period that has been radio-carbon dated to about 2900 BC {{at the beginning of}} the Early Dynastic I Period. No inscriptions have yet been found verifying any names of kings that can be associated with the Early Dynastic I period. The ED I period is distinguished from the ED II period by the narrow cylinder seals of the ED I period and the broader wider ED II seals engraved with banquet scenes or animal-contest scenes. The Early Dynastic II period is when Gilgamesh, the famous king of Uruk, is believed to have reigned. [...] Texts from the ED II period are not yet understood. [...] Later inscriptions have been found bearing some Early Dynastic II names from the King List. The Early Dynastic IIIa period, also known as the Fara period (named for the site of the city of Shuruppak), is when syllabic writing began. <b>Accounting</b> <b>records</b> and an undeciphered logographic script existed before the Fara Period, but the full flow of human speech was first recorded around 2600 BC {{at the beginning of the}} Fara Period.

2500|$|The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (Ford Productions-Paramount, 1962) is {{frequently}} {{cited as the}} last great film of Ford's career. It co-starred John Wayne and James Stewart, with Vera Miles, Edmond O'Brien, Andy Devine as the inept marshal Appleyard, Denver Pyle, John Carradine, and Lee Marvin {{in one of his}} first major roles as the brutal Valance, with Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin as his henchmen. It is also notable as the film in which Wayne first used his trademark phrase [...] "Pilgrim" [...] (his nickname for James Stewart's character). It was very successful, grossing over $3million in its first year, although the lead casting stretched credibility—the characters played by Stewart (then 53) and Wayne (then 54) were meant to be in their early 20s, and Ford reportedly considered casting a younger actor in Stewart's role but feared it would highlight Wayne's age. Though it is often claimed that budget constraints necessitated shooting most of the film on soundstages on the Paramount lot, studio <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> show that this was part of the film's original artistic concept, according to Ford biographer Joseph McBride. According to Lee Marvin in a filmed interview, Ford had fought hard to shoot the film in black-and-white to accentuate his use of shadows. Still, it was one of Ford's most expensive films at US$3.2million.|$|E
