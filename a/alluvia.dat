25|$|Large-scale works {{began in}} the Danube Delta {{as early as the}} second half of the 19th century. First {{corrections}} of the Sulina arm began in 1862, and they continued throughout the 20th century. As a result, the length of the Sulina arm was reduced from 92 to 64km, and its flow more than doubled, thus making it suitable for large-vessel navigation. Correcting the six large meanders on its course thereby reduced the length of the Sfântu Gheorghe from 108 to 108km, and its flow also increased somewhat. Both these increases were made to the detriment of the Chilia arm, which at present remains the most unspoiled arm of the main three. These corrections, as well as the digging of various secondary channels throughout the body of the delta, have had a serious impact on the ecosystem. Natural environments have been altered, the breeding pattern of fish has been disrupted, and the flows in the main arms have increased, with serious consequences regarding the discharge of <b>alluvia</b> and the erosion of banks.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{presence}} of some Quaternary glaciation, Tasmania's soils are not more fertile than those of mainland Australia, largely because most are severely leached and the areas with driest climates (least leaching) were unaffected by glaciation or <b>alluvia</b> derived therefrom. Most soils on the Bass Strait Islands, the east coast and western Tasmania are very infertile spodosols or psamments, with some even less fertile [...] "lateritic podzolic soils" [...] in the latter region. Most of these lands are thus not used for agriculture, but there is much productive forestry—which {{remains one of the}} state's major industries.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{the evil}} Chancellor Dongalor (Matt Lucas) and his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) {{set off to}} steal back Dongalor's girlfriend (Remie Purtill-Clarke), a peasant girl he had {{previously}} kidnapped from a village, who has been taken by the emperor's nephew. Dongalor finds her and tells her he {{plans to use the}} Eye of Gulga Grymna, an ancient weapon, to kill Emperor Xanus and steal his crown, and he wants her by his side. He proposes and she agrees, but as the two ride off together in their carriage, she begins coughing blood. Dongalor realizes she has the plague, but insists he will get medical help for her. She dies a brief time later; her tombstone is marked simply, [...] "Cute Girl". Later, while Dongalor mourns in his castle, Barnabus cheers him up by bringing him the Bloodstone of <b>Alluvia.</b> Barnabus does not explain how he got it, but Dongalor recognizes it as the lens of the Eye of Gulga Grymna, a key to unleashing the weapon's power.|$|E
60|$|Any one who {{has been}} on the Rhine will have {{observed}} operations not unlike those to which we have just referred; and, indeed, most of the rivers of Europe flowing among their own <b>alluvia</b> have required similar treatment in the interest of navigation and agriculture.|$|E
6000|$|In {{their turn}} the English and the French, {{who had heard}} of the fabulous treasures of the Joliba valley and the Tinbukhtu mart, began to claim their share. As early as 1551 Captain Thomas Wyndham touched at the Gold Coast and brought home 150 lbs. of the {{precious}} dust. The first English company for exploring the Gambia River sent out (1618) their agent, Richard Thompson. This brave and unfortunate explorer was rancorously opposed by the Portuguese and eventually murdered by his own men. He was followed (1620) by Richard Jobson, to whom we owe the first account of the Gambia River. He landed at various points, armed with mercury, aqua regia (nitric acid), large crucibles, and a 'dowsing' or divining rod; [Footnote: A form of this old and almost universal magical instrument, worked by electricity, has, I am told, been lately invented and patented in the United States.] washed the sands and examined the rocks even beyond the Falls of Barraconda. After having often been deceived, as has occurred to many prospectors since his day, he determined that gold never occurs in low fertile wooded lands, but in naked and barren hills, which embed it in their reddish ferruginous soil. Hence it was long and erroneously determined that bare rocks in the neighbourhood of shallow <b>alluvia</b> characterise rich placers, and that the wealthiest mining-regions are poor and stunted in vegetation. California and Australia, the Gold Coast and South Africa, are instances of the contrary. Wásá, however, confirms the old opinion that the strata traversed by lodes determine the predominating metal; as quartz produces gold; hard blue slate, lead; limestone, green-stone and porphyry, copper; and granite, tin.

50|$|A wheel {{trencher}} or rockwheel {{is composed}} of a toothed metal wheel. It is cheaper to operate and maintain than chain-type trenchers. It can work in hard or soft soils, either homogeneous (compact rocks, silts, sands) or heterogeneous (split or broken rock, <b>alluvia,</b> moraines). This is particularly true because a cutting wheel works by clearing the soil as a bucket-wheel does, rather than like a rasp (chain trencher). Consequently, it will be less sensitive {{to the presence of}} blocks in the soil. They are also used to cut pavement for road maintenance and to gain access to utilities under roads.|$|E

The south-eastern part of Yilgarn Craton is gently undulating, with partially occluded drainage. Vegetation is mainly mallee over myrtaceous-proteaceous heaths on duplex (sand over clay) soils. Melaleuca shrublands characterise <b>alluvia,</b> and Halosarcia low shrublands occur on saline alluvium.

50|$|The town {{is located}} at the {{beginning}} of the North Carolina Piedmont, on the Roanoke River at the fall line, which marks the area where an upland region (continental bedrock) and a coastal plain (coastal <b>alluvia)</b> meet. The fall line is typically prominent where a river crosses it, for there will usually be rapids or waterfalls. Because of these features, river boats typically could not travel any further inland. Because settlements needed a port and a ready supply of water power, they often developed where the river crosses the fall line. The Roanoke River and its falls inspired the development of Roanoke Rapids; businessmen such as Sam Patterson and other textile manufacturers used the river to power their mills.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, a {{fragment}} of polished flint axe {{was found in the}} park of the current Saint-Adrien School. It is estimated to date from approximately 2000 BC. Other axes of this kind were discovered in the area of Lille, in particular in the <b>alluvia</b> of Deûle. The historians allot them to populations using cut stone tools, but already devoted to cattle breeding and agriculture. However, it is no proof that man was sedentary there; indeed archaeologists have now found traces of human occupation {{at the end of the}} independent Gallic era, in particular of sling stones, on the level of the Center Marc-Sautelet.

50|$|The {{development}} of the town was primarily influenced by mining. Ore deposits containing tin had already been found in late antiquity and their mining and processing brought about the Bronze Age. In Bohemia, tin was acquired through panning the <b>alluvia</b> of streams {{at the foot of}} the Krušné hory Mountains and in the Slavkov Forest. More concentrated exploitation of tin deposits, just secondary ones to begin with, took place in the 9th and 10th centuries. In the ioth-igth centuries, the Slavkov region assumed a significant role in the export of tin to markets in Western and Eastern Europe. In the 13th century the working of secondary tin deposits developed in the Slavkov Forest, panning gradually extended to Dalovice near Karlovy Vary and the interest of miners shifted more to the extraction of the primary deposits between Horní Slavkov and Krásno.|$|E

40|$|Komoé River {{represents}} {{the most important}} freshwater resource of Ivory Coast. This study aims at identifying the <b>alluvia</b> material and its dynamic at the mouth. The agricultural activity within the upper basin has determined a decrease in liquid discharge {{and an increase in}} <b>alluvia</b> transport. Most of the water is used in agriculture. The <b>alluvia</b> material comprises mainly sands and it is included in the middle-coarse category. Mixed sediments are composed of muddy sands and sandy muds. Most quartz grains transported by the river are flattened and glassy (91. 66 %), while the rest are round and opaque (8. 34 %). Minerals are angular, subangular, rounded and subrounded. Among heavy minerals, it is worth mentioning as follows: quartz, mica, feldspar, pyroxene, tourmaline, amphibole, gamet, epidote etc. The high degree of <b>alluvia</b> deposit has reduced the depth of the lower river course and it has closed the estuary completely. In this case, the wetland was extended and the vegetation tends to cover the entire surface. Navigation has been made difficult by the alluvial and organic clogging processes...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{anticipated}} {{changes in the}} seepage of a major river in Greece, towards the low-salinity ponds of its estuaries, through the deltaic <b>alluvia</b> and the underlying limestone. The study was triggered by the concern that changes in the salinity of the deltaic ponds due to the large scale river diversion would affect their rich ecosystems. It is shown that the contribution of river water seepage towards the deltaic ponds in the area is small compared to the discharge of excess irrigation water. Furthermore, the high salinity of the groundwater in the fine <b>alluvia</b> imposes a 'barrier' on the flow towards the external parts of the delta, where the biotope has developed. It is concluded that even the small anticipated changes in the salinity of the influx of seepage to the deltaic ponds, can be easily controlled by monitoring the direct freshwater discharge towards the ponds...|$|E
