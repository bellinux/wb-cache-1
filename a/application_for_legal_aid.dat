50|$|In S v Cordier, {{the court}} held that, where an accused has {{indicated}} that he desires legal aid, and is not given an opportunity, before the commencement of the trial, {{to deal with the}} outcome of his application, after having been advised of the outcome thereof, and to consider his position before pleading to the relevant charge, the trial will be unfair. The court noted that, when a layman applies for legal aid, and thereafter appears without being informed of the outcome of her or his application, he could easily {{come to the conclusion that}} the application has been refused. A fair trial requires that, where an accused has applied for legal aid, the situation is resolved before the accused is permitted or, in appropriate circumstances, compelled to plead. In addition, a fair trial requires that any <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> is carefully and completely noted in such a way that another court which is later burdened with the matter is properly apprised of that fact.|$|E
50|$|The {{granting}} of legal aid {{by the court}} requires that the applicant proves that the claimant is (a) economically not able to bear {{the costs of the}} procedures, and (b) that his lawsuit has reasonable prospects of success, and (c) that the cause of action is not frivolous. The <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> is typically lodged together with the draft of the complaint with the bench of the competent court. This has the advantage for the legal aid applicant that he is provisionally relieved of the payment of the court costs while the bench not only reviews his economic status but also determines the merits of the case, i.e. as to whether the lawsuit appears to have reasonable prospect of success, based merely on the facts and arguments as presented in the draft complaint. Thus, a summary review of the cause of action is carried out by the court. Only if all conditions are met and legal aid thus granted will the court communicate the complaint to the other party and the judicial dispute thereby commences with the costs borne by the court. However, the legal aid seeking litigant can also lodge effectively the complaint together with auxiliary legal aid request but without making the pendency of the case dependent on the court granting legal aid; or the litigant requests legal aid support at a later stage but before completion of case procedures. In the latter scenarios, if legal aid is rejected by the court the litigant, who sought legal aid, will bear the counsel and court fees if he loses the lawsuit (or bears the costs partially if he loses partially). Defence cases are treated equivalently.|$|E
40|$|The {{legal system}} in Indonesia is devided into four jurisdictions, namely {{the general court}} (civil), the {{administrative}} court, the religious courtsand military courts. General court/tribunal which is a civil settlement {{to the case of}} civilians. While the special tribunal consists of administrative courts, religious courts and military courts. The military court is a court case which resolve disputes military / army (TNI) related to the duties / position {{as a member of the}} war. I will discuss is the process of granting legal aid in military courts and the influence of rank in the process of granting legal aid in military courts. The process of providing legal aid comes from the unity of each defendant, the defendant filed an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>aid,</b> the legal officer, the contents of the defendant’s plea was accompanied from the case entered in the military police to court proceedings or remedy of appeal to reconsideration. While the influence of rank in the process of granting legal aid in military courts do not exist because the goal is the same, they both dig and enforce the law so that it can find its material law...|$|E

40|$|Aim: This article {{presents}} a theoretical model that enables achievement of macroeconomic {{efficiency of the}} <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> system by means of adjusting supply to the pre-determined demand. Results: Main deterministic components of aggregate demand <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> are defined using a shift-share type framework. The knowledge of its parameters {{makes it possible to}} estimate expected demand <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> in response to various formulae of possible reforms of the system. Motivation: Estimates of demand serve to compute <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> supply that minimizes social costs of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> provision. This task is accomplished by means of the so called assignment problem originating the field of operational research. Providers are divided in line with their average productivities in solving appropriate legal cases and the aggregate personal costs of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> provision are subject to minimization...|$|R

5000|$|The {{problem of}} chronic underfunding of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> traps the {{lower middle class}} in no-man's-land: too rich to qualify <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>aid,</b> too poor to pay an {{attorney}} in private practice. To remedy the ongoing shortage of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> services, some commentators have suggested that mandatory pro bono obligations ought to be required of all lawyers, just as physicians working in emergency rooms are required to treat all patients regardless of ability to pay. [...] However, most such proposals have been successfully fought off by bar associations. A notable exception is the Orange County Bar Association in Orlando, Florida, which requires all bar members to participate in its <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Society, by either serving in a pro bono capacity or donating a fee in lieu of service.
