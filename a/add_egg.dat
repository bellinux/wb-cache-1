40|$|A {{sample of}} 322 eggs were studied from the {{following}} breeds and varieties: 'Empordanesa' (White n= 23, White-blonde n= 39, Red n= 40 and Blond n= 27), 'Flor d'Ametller' (n= 40), 'Gallina Pairal' (n= 43) and 'Penedesenca' (Partridge n= 40, Crele n= 13, Black n= 30 and Wheaten n= 27). From individual digital pictures of the eggs, maximum length and width were obtained, and from them three indexes were deduced: area, shape and volume ratios. Weight was obtained by direct weighing. Multivariate analysis revealed statistically significant differences among most of the breeds and varieties. Non-differentiated phenotypes included various groups varieties: 'Penedesenca' (except Crele with Black), 'Wheaten Penedesenca' with 'White-blonde Empordanesa', 'Black Penedesenca' with 'Blond Empordanesa', and 'White-blonde Empordanesa' with 'Blond Empordanesa'. The two broody breeds, 'Flor d'Ametller' and 'Gallina Pairal', were differentiated, which corroborates the latter as its own breed. We propose to <b>add</b> <b>egg</b> morphometric descriptions to chicken breed studies. These are based on weight but also on indexes.

40|$|Egg {{numbers in}} Kestrel {{clutches}} decline from 6. 5 to 3. 2 with progressive laying date. Laying Kestrels {{did not respond}} to <b>eggs</b> <b>added</b> to the nest after the second egg. Egg removals starting on day 3, 5 or 7 of laying demonstrated that responsiveness (production of extra eggs) ceased ca 4 d before the normally final egg. Thus clutch fixation occurred sooner after the first egg in late than in early nests. Continuous records of nest temperature were used to establish incubation frequency of the female throughout laying in experimental and control nests. Incubation rose from 0 to 98 % of time {{in the course of the}} laying phase. This rise started sooner and was more rapid in late nests and in nests with <b>added</b> <b>eggs,</b> and delayed in response to egg removal. The higher level of incubation tendency in late breeders at the onset of laying may be instrumental in more rapid follicle resorption and hence in clutch size reduction. ...|$|R

When conspecific brood parasitism occurs in species with high parental investment, we expect hosts to suffer costs for raising an enlarged brood.

Hosts had lower average annual reproductive success than non-hosts, but CBP did not affect adult survival or nestling body condition and likelihood of recruitment.
