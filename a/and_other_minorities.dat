40|$|This is {{the first}} book to focus on how racism affects the housing choices {{available}} to black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> groups <b>and</b> how this contributes to social exclusion. Using a practical approach, the contributors analyse the implications of social exclusion, offering suggestions for good practice in the allocation of housing for black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> groups. 'Race', Housing and Social Exclusion shows how racism and the shortage of housing workers from black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minorities</b> constrain the choices available to these groups, thereby preventing them from having {{an active role in}} society. Each chapter investigates a different aspect of the situation that black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> groups face, including: their housing needs; the procedure of the allocation of housing; patterns of housing settlement of black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> groups; the employment of black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> staff in housing associations. This book also gives examples of the experiences and aspirations of black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> groups <b>and</b> relates them to subjects such as cultural differences within and among black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> groups, <b>and</b> the further social exclusion which arises from housing associations which help a specific ethnic minority group 'Race', Housing and Social Exclusion challenges existing views, which are based on broad generalisations of black <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> groups, <b>and</b> also points to future policy making and strategic planning...|$|R

There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E
