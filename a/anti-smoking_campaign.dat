40|$|Background: Among marginalised populations, such {{as people}} with {{psychotic}} disorders, smoking prevalence rates remain {{much higher than}} in the general population. <b>Anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> conducted in Australia {{have been found to be}} associated with change in smoking behaviour and attitudes in the general population. However, no previous research has examined the effectiveness of these campaigns among people with mental disorders, like psychotic disorders. Aims: This study aimed to gain an understanding of how people with psychotic disorders perceive <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> by examining knowledge of tobacco, exposure, acceptability and attitudes regarding <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns.</b> Method: A mixed method design was employed in which both quantitative and qualitative data were elicited. Eighty-nine participants with a diagnosed psychotic disorder completed a self-report assessment battery; eight of whom also completed semi-structured telephone interviews which were then analysed via interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: Participants reported high exposure to <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> and good knowledge regarding tobacco. They explained that even though they remembered, understood and were even scared by <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns,</b> these campaigns had little impact on their smoking. Participants also described a number of positive mental health effects of smoking. Conclusion: This study suggests that <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> are not impacting upon smokers with psychotic disorders, despite on smokers with high exposure and good knowledge of tobacco. In order to be more effective in the future, campaigns may need to specifically target marginalised populations, including people with psychotic disorders, and address barriers to cessation among this population...|$|R

5|$|The Nazis used several public {{relations}} tactics {{to convince the}} general population of Germany not to smoke. Well-known health magazines like the Gesundes Volk (Healthy People), Volksgesundheit (People's Health) and Gesundes Leben (Healthy Life) published warnings about the health consequences of smoking and posters showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed. Anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces, often {{with the help of the}} Hitler-Jugend (HJ) and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM). The <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaign</b> undertaken by the Nazis also included health education. In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the Reichsstelle für Rauschgiftbekämpfung (Reich Office for Drug Control) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines Die Genussgifte (The Recreational Stimulants), Auf der Wacht (On the Guard) and Reine Luft (Clean Air). Out of these magazines, Reine Luft was the main journal of the anti-tobacco movement. Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research at Jena University purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from Reine Luft.|$|E

25|$|Anti-smoking groups, {{particularly}} cancer charities, {{along with}} many government health departments have attempted to counter the advertising of tobacco by creating their own advertisements to highlight {{the negative effects of}} smoking. The earliest commercials mainly focused on aiding smoking cessation, the increased risk of lung cancer and the problems associated with passive smoking. However, they have become increasingly hard-hitting over the years, with some campaigns now centered around decreased physical attractiveness and the risk of erectile dysfunction. These are more targeted towards younger smokers than previous campaigns. The British government spent £31 million in 2003 as part of their <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
40|$|This essay studies how {{advertisements}} in various <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> can influence and persuade by using anti-logos as counter-arguments to the tobacco industry's logos. In contrast to tobacco advertising arguments such as freedom (logos), pleasure (pathos) and trademark (ethos) the <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> create anti-logos arguments with various connotations such as repulsive pictures and sexual implications to influence {{groups of people}} not to start smoking or to quit smoking. Advertisement of tobacco does not exist nowadays due to legal restrictions in the western world; however several decades of myths created in the consumer consciousness still exist. Thus one can speak of a tobacco advertising ideology that exists and the various <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> trying to change that ideology. The purpose of <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> is to conduct a kategoria of myth that tobacco advertisement has created over the years. Anti smoking organizations do this by creating a new ideology to affect consumer’s attitude toward smoking and the tobacco myth with an anti-myth. This becomes a counter-myth to the myth created by tobacco advertising and their logos and pathos arguments. The anti-smoke commercial logos become anti-logos and pathos to anti-pathos (antipathy) for the cigarette whose arguments are created from the viewer's connotations of anti-smoke commercials. The cigarette, {{as a product of}} connotations in commercials, shows how rhetorical persua-sion becomes public relations and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Our study {{documents}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> on various age groups and attempts to {{shed some light on}} the mechanism by which community interventions operate and affect smokers. We re-examine evidence from a large scale National Cancer Institute community-wide intervention study entitled `The Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation' (COMMIT). Our empirical results show that this intervention has differential effects on the quit rates of smokers. This variation has not been observed in the earlier literature on <b>anti-smoking</b> <b>campaigns</b> and was not noticed by previous studies using the COMMIT data. The quit rates in the intervention group are found to be significantly higher for individuals aged 30 to 37 and those aged 60 and up, but lower for those younger than 30. The various channels of the COMMIT study were developed to create an awareness and recognition that smoking is a public health problem, and to change the social acceptability of smoking. In light of the age variation uncovered, we argue that the public information channel may {{play a crucial role in}} affecting change. In particular, public awareness about the negative health consequences of smoking is likely to be responsible for the increased quits among older smokers in the treatment group. <b>Anti-Smoking</b> <b>Campaigns,</b> Smoking, Tobacco, Tobacco Control...|$|R
