However, new vehicle standards are only beneficial if effectively lead to emissions reduction; this implies assuring compliance with emissions limits not only for new registrations but also throughout vehiclesâ€™ useful life. With this aim, current legislation introduced emissions durability requirements; alternatively to actual in-use driving, the normative also proposes tailored accelerated aging procedures for PI and CI vehicles (Standard Bench Cycle and Standard Diesel Bench Cycle respectively) or the application of assigned deterioration factors. Whereas the fast aging protocol for vehicles with PI engine had already been successfully applied, the newly introduced approach for CI vehicles fast aging still has to prove its validity. The present report aims at contributing to a deeper understanding of aftertreatment system aging mechanisms and methods in order to assess Euro- 6 vehicles durability approach. An overview on the legislative background is given before introducing an investigation on deterioration mechanisms that could critically affect most commonly implemented aftertreatment devices. The current accelerated aging procedure is then presented in greater detail, with focus on differences between gasoline and diesel vehicles approach; differences between European and American fast aging strategies are also discussed. The Standard Diesel Bench Cycle is examined in detail and focus is brought on potential deficiencies to match real diesel aftertreatment system aging mechanisms; open issues are discussed and complemented with the proposal for suitable solutions which are being jointly developed by US Research Institutes and Industries.

However, issues such as low NOx conversion at low temperature conditions still exist due to various factors, including incomplete urea thermolysis, inhibition of SCR reactions by hydrocarbons and H 2 O. We have observed a noticeable reduction in the standard SCR reaction efficiency at low temperature with increasing water content. We observed a similar effect when hydrocarbons {{are present in the}} stream. This effect is absent under fast SCR conditions where NO ~ NO 2 in the feed gas. As a first step in understanding the effects of such inhibition on SCR reaction steps, kinetic models that predict the inhibition behavior of H 2 O and hydrocarbons on NO oxidation are presented in the paper.

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is a leading <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology</b> {{for the removal of}} nitrogen oxide (NOx) from exhaust gases (DeNOx). It presents an interesting control challenge, especially at high conversion, because both reagents (NOx and ammonia) are toxic, and therefore an excess of either is highly undesirable. Numerous system layouts and control methods have been developed for SCR systems, driven by the need to meet future emission standards. This paper summarizes the current state-of-the-art control methods for the SCR aftertreatment systems, and provides a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on SCR control. The existing control techniques fall into three main categories: traditional SCR control methods, model-based SCR control methods, and advanced SCR control methods. For each category, the basic control technique is defined. Further techniques in the same category are then explained and appreciated for their relative advantages and disadvantages. Thus this paper presents a snapshot of {{the current state of the}} art for the research area of SCR control. This is a very active field, and it is hoped that by providing a better understanding of the different control strategies already developed for SCR control, future areas of interest will be identified and developed with the ultimate aim of satisfying the increasingly stringent emissions legislation.

40|$|There is {{a global}} effort to expand the use of {{alternative}} fuels due to their several benefits such as improving air quality with reducing some criteria emissions, reducing dependency on fossil fuels, and reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. This dissertation is focused on investigating the impact of two popular alternative fuels, biodiesel and natural gas (NG), on emissions from heavy-duty engines. Biodiesel {{is one of the}} most popular renewable fuels with diesel applications. Although biodiesel blends are reported to reduce particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and total hydrocarbon emissions; there is uncertainty on their impact on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. This dissertation evaluated the effect of biodiesel feedstock, biodiesel blend level, engine technology, and driving conditions on NOx emissions. The results showed that NOx emissions increase with 20 % and higher biodiesel blends. Also, in this study some strategies were proposed and some fuel formulations were found for mitigating NOx emissions increases with biodiesel. The impact of 5 % biodiesel on criteria emissions specifically NOx was also fully studied in this thesis. As a part of the results of this study, 5 % animal-based biodiesel was certified for use in California based on California Air Resources Board emissions equivalent procedure. NG {{is one of the most}} prominent alternative fuels with larger reserves compared to crude oil. However, the quality of NG depends on both its source and the degree to which it is processed. The current study explored the impact of various NG fuels, ranging from low methane/high energy gases to high methane/low energy gases, on criteria and toxic emissions from NG engines with different combustion and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies.</b> The results showed stronger fuel effects for the lean-burn technology bus. Finally, this thesis investigated the impact of changing diesel fuel composition on the criteria emissions from a variety of heavy-duty engine technologies. Emissions from an average diesel fuel used throughout the U. S. were compared with a 10 % aromatic, ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel used in California with more stringent air quality regulations.

Biodiesel fuels also show interesting features in terms of PM-NOx emissions trade-off that appears more favorable toward an optimized control of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). In fact, the DPF, which is the assessed <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology</b> to reduce PM emissions below the limits, suffers from fuel consumption penalization or excessive exhaust system backpressure, {{as a function of the}} frequency of the regeneration process. On the other side, issues such as the impact of the higher ash content of biodiesel on the DPF performance have also to be better understood. In the given scenario, an experimental study on a DEUTZ 4 L off-road Diesel engine coupled to a DOC-DPF (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst-Diesel Particulate Filter) system is proposed in this paper. Experimental data have been gathered at the engine test bench of the University of Rome Tor Vergata to validate a model of the DPF, including ash related effects, and by adding a special sampling unit to collect particles. To that final aim, collected particulate has been examined via an experimental TGA (Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis) to measure ash content of particles emitted with B 30 distilled biodiesel blend from Waste Cooking Oil (WCO), and compare it with a commercially available fossil fuel (B 06). The multiple effects, in terms of lower regeneration activation energy, lower PM emissions and higher ash content, have been analyzed under repeated equivalent Non Road Transient Cycles (NRTCs), proving that the positive effects more than counterbalance the negative ones while using the B 30 fuel...|$|E

It is normal then to study individually every <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology</b> {{in order to create}} simulation models for these technologies such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) or Diesel Particle Filter (DPF). For helping the creation of these models, dedicated experiments are carried out. These kinetic experiments must be designed and well-defined such that they provide the necessary information in a reproducible way at minimal time and costs. In {{the first part of the}} work and in order to facilitate measurements with long SDPF specimens, a reactor with a new oven design has been characterized. Its thermal behaviour and the absence of unwanted reactions of the bare reactor (without catalyst) have been checked. In a previous work, dedicated kinetic measurement procedures for the SCR calibration process were determined and optimized on a synthetic gas test rig. The optimal settings and procedures were programed in the test rig control software. In the second part of this work, several measurements based on these optimal procedures have been carried out on the test rig with a state-of-the-art Cu-Ze SCR to investigate the influence of several types of HCs on the SCR behaviour. The alternative of the NO 2 /NOx ratio step concept was used for the NOx conversion study of the SCR catalyst. It has been seen that the presence during the experiment of different HC species such as C 3 H 6 and C 2 H 2 had an negative effect in the NOx reduction, and for other HC species as C 3 H 8 the effect was practically inexistent.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} to develop a {{one-dimensional}} (1 D) mathematical model to study in designing and improving emission control systems such as those in Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). This was achieved by capturing the fundamental reaction kinetics from the microreactor data within the careful choice of concentrations/ temperatures domain; together with good understanding of the physical phenomenaâ€™s occurring in these systems. When considering a DOC, {{it is important to have}} a good description of the catalyst activity as a function of Platinum Group Metal (PGM) loading, which in this case is Pt, this enables mathematical models to be used in the optimization of the PGM loading. The work presented here looks at the design of a DOC based aftertreatment system through development of kinetics from data obtained from the microreactor for a wide range of PGM loadings (2. 5 - 75 g ft- 3). The variation in catalyst activity with different PGM loadings for the key reactions was determined. The model developed in this study predicts well all the experimental data for the various loadings. 	DPF is another important <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology</b> that is used for the control of Particulate Matter (PM) emission from diesel engines. Under favourable conditions, the soot collected on the filter can be removed by oxidation with NO 2 from temperatures as low as 200 Â°C. The work presented in this thesis shows the fundamental modelling approach to develop kinetics for soot oxidation by NO 2. The selectivity to CO was found to differ only marginally with temperature, and is independent of NO 2 concentrations.

40|$|Hybridisation offers great {{potential}} for decreasing pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions of diesel cars. However, {{an assessment of the}} real-world emissions performance of modern diesel hybrids is yet missing. Here, we test three diesel-hybrid cars on the road and benchmark our findings with two cars against tests on the chassis dynamometer and model simulations. The pollutant emissions of the two cars tested on the chassis dynamometer were in compliance with the relevant Euro standards over the NEDC and WLTP. On the road, all three diesel-hybrids exceeded the regulatory NOX limits (average exceedance for all trips: + 150 % for the Volvo, + 510 % for the Peugeot and + 550 % for the Mercedes-Benz;) and they also showed elevated on-road CO 2 emissions (average exceedances of certification values: + 178 %, + 77 % and + 52 %, respectively). These findings point to a wide discrepancy between certified and on-road CO 2 and suggest that hybridisation alone is insufficient to achieve low NOX emissions of diesel powertrains.

40|$|Improvements in {{internal}} combustion engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> are needed to meet future environmental quality goals. Systems using recently developed compact plasmatron fuel converters in conjunction with state-of-the-art engines and aftertreatment catalysts could provide new opportunities for obtaining substantial emissions reductions. Plasmatron fuel converters provide a rapid response, compact means to transform {{a wide range of}} hydrocarbon fuels (including gasoline, natural gas and diesel fuel) into hydrogen rich gas. Hydrogen rich gas can be used as an additive to provide NOx reductions of more than 80 % in spark ignition gasoline engine vehicles by enabling very lean operation or heavy exhaust engine recirculation. It may also be employed for cold start hydrocarbon reduction. If certain requirements are met, it may also be possible to achieve higher spark ignition engine efficiencies (e. g., up to 95 % of those of diesel engines). These requirements include the attainment of ultra lean, high compression ratio, open throttle operation using only a modest amount of hydrogen addition. For diesel engines, use of compact plasmatron reformers to produce hydrogen-rich gas for the regeneration of NOx absorber/adsorbers and particulate traps for diesel engine exhaust aftertreatment could provide significant advantages. Recent tests of conversion of diesel fuel to hydrogen-rich gas using a low current plasmatron fuel converter with non-equilibrium plasma features are described...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the lower}} EURO 4 {{emission}} limits, exhaust aftertreatment systems for heavy- and light-duty vehicles will be necessary which are more efficient than the today 3 -way- or oxidation-type catalysts. Practicable exhaust aftertreatment systems are, for example, particle traps, SCR or NOx- adsorber catalysts, and combinations of these systems. Most of these exhaust control devices require fuels with sulphur contents below 10 ppm. Then the sulphate emissions from lubricants containing about 0. 5 % sulphur {{is in the same}} order of magnitude as sulphate emissions from low sulfur fuels. Measured data on the influence of sulphur from lubricating oils on future exhaust treatment systems are very limited. Conclusions have mostly been drawn from experimental results with low sulphur fuels. It cannot be ruled out, especially for NOx- adsorbers, that sulphur will adversely affect performance, thus making a reduction of sulphur levels in engine oils necessary. As far as diesel exhaust is concerned lubricants contribute approximately 20 - 26 % to total particulate matter and more than 50 % to the soluble organic fraction (SOF). Ash deposits derived from additives that contain zinc, calcium, sulphur, or phosphorous are likely to block the newly developed particle filter systems. Also for diesel technologies incorporating precious-metal catalysts (e. g. DOC, CDPF, CR-DPF, Urea- SCR) low sulphur levels are advantageous because the mass of sulphate particulate matter formed from fuel or lubricant sulphur is reduced. Conventional three-way catalysts are less sensitive, the light-off temperature being mainly affected. In summary, all available studies suggest that the lower the level of sulphur the lower emissions are. Furthermore phosphorous (associated with the antiwear additive ZDTP) was shown to limit catalyst life and, together with thermal degradation, is responsible for reduced catalyst efficiency over time. Although there is still a lack of quantitative technical information, it can be assumed that engine oil will make a significant contribution to EURO 4 limits of tail-pipe emissions, resulting mainly from secondary poisoning effects on catalyst and filter systems. Further research is thus necessary to make existing engine oil formulations and vehicle lubricant consumption compatible with the requirements of new exhaust <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology.</b> (orig.)

40|$|Modern diesel {{passenger}} vehicles employing common rail, high speed direct injection engines {{are capable of}} matching the drivability of gasoline powered vehicles with the additional benefit of providing high torque at low engine speed [1]. The diesel engine also offers considerable fuel economy and CO 2 emissions advantages. However, future emissions standards [2, 3] present a significant challenge for the diesel engine, as its lean exhaust precludes the use of aftertreatment strategies employing 3 - way catalytic converters, which operate under stoichiometric conditions. In recent years significant developments by diesel engine manufacturers have greatly reduced emissions of both particulates (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) [4, 5]. However to achieve compliance with future legislative limits {{it has been suggested}} that an integrated approach involving a combination of engine modifications and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology</b> [1] will be required. A relatively new approach to exhaust aftertreatment is the application of non-thermal plasma (NTP) or plasma catalyst hybrid systems. These have the potential for treatment of both NOx and PM emissions [6 - 8]. The primary focus of recent plasma aftertreatment studies [9 - 12] has concentrated on the removal of NOx. It has been shown that by combining plasmas with catalysts it is possible to chemically reduce NOx. The most common approach is to use a 2 - stage system relying upon the plasma oxidation of hydrocarbons to promote NO to NO 2 conversion as a precursor to NO 2 reduction over a catalyst. However, relatively little work has yet been published on the oxidation of PM by plasma [8, 13]. Previous investigations [8] have reported that a suitably designed NTP reactor containing a packing material designed to filter and retain PM can effect the oxidation of PM in diesel exhausts at low temperatures. It has been suggested that the retained PM competes with hydrocarbons for O, and possibly OH, radicals. This is an important consideration in plasma - catalyst hybrid schemes for the removal of NOx employing an NO 2 selective catalyst, as the oxidation of PM may deplete the key radicals necessary for NO to NO 2 conversion. It was also suggested that where simultaneous NOx and PM removal are required, alternative catalyst formulations may be needed which may be selective to NO rather than NO 2...|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} far more {{efficient}} than gasoline engines of comparable size, and emit less greenhouse gases that have been implicated in global warming. In 2000, the US EPA proposed very stringent emissions standards to be introduced in 2007 along with low sulfur (< 15 ppm) diesel fuel. The California Air Resource Board (CARB) has also established the principle that future diesel fueled vehicles should meet the same low emissions standards as gasoline fueled vehicles and the EPA followed suit with its Tier II emissions regulation. Achieving such low emissions cannot be done through engine development and fuel reformulation alone, and requires application of NOx and particulate matter (PM) aftertreatment control devices. There is a widespread consensus that NOx adsorbers and particulate filter are required in order for diesel engines to meet the 2007 emissions regulations for NOx and PM. In this paper, the key exhaust characteristics from an advanced diesel engine are reviewed. Development of the NOx adsorber technology is discussed. Spectroscopic techniques are applied to understand the underlying chemical reactions over the catalyst surface during NOx trapping and regeneration periods. In-situ surface probes are useful in providing not only thermodynamic and kinetics information required for model development but also a fundamental understanding of storage capacity and degradation mechanisms. The distribution of various nitration/sulfation species is related to surface basicity. Surface displacement reactions of carbonates also play roles in affecting the trapping capability of NOx adsorbers. When ultralow-S fuel {{is used as a}} reductant during the regeneration, sulfur induced performance degradation is still observed in an aged catalyst. Other possible sources related to catalyst deactivation include incomplete reduction of surface nitration, coke formation derived from incomplete hydrocarbon burning, and lubricant formulations. Sulfur management and the direction of future work for the successful implementation of such integrated engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology</b> are discussed.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} exhaust <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies,</b> {{and the costs}} thereof, {{required}} to achieve future emissions legislation. Firstly, a brief summary {{of the types of}} systems is addressed with a cost of implementation implicitly attached to each system of choice. The three major routes considered to meet the various legislated limits are: a diesel particulate filter coupled with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation), a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system based on urea, and a combination of both a filter and SCR. The systems are reviewed with an emphasis on emissions reduction potential as well as possible diesel fuel savings where applicable. Secondly, the cost implications of using a secondary, water-based fuel (urea) on board diesel vehicles as a basis for NOx reduction via a simple discounted cash flow methodology are explored. By utilising the methodology described, various parameters such as fuel costs (both diesel and urea), annual mileage, fuel economy, and system cost can be varied and examined in detail. The â€˜systemâ€™ costs are calculated throughout the vehicle life, within a practical framework, in order to assess the feasibility of implementing these advanced aftertreatment systems in the future. Other issues that are briefly considered include quantities of urea predicted {{to meet the needs of}} the systems, urea fuel storage and delivery aspects, and potential increase in urea production...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this program was to develop generic <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> applicable for LDV and LDT engines ranging from 55 kW to 200 kW, to develop an optimized and integrated aftertreatment system for a LDT (Light Duty Truck) type vehicle, and to demonstrate the technology which will enable light duty diesel engines to meet Federal Tier II regulation with minimum impact on fuel economy. Specifically, the development targets for emissions reduction and fuel injection penalty are given below: (1) NOx conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (2) PM conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (3) Fuel penalty over FTP- 75 Less than 5 %; and (4) Fuel penalty at Cruise condition Less than 3 %. Development of cost-effective, highly efficient diesel exhaust aftertreatment systems in combination with very low engine out emission combustion development are essential elements for realization of Federal Tier II emission standards for Light Duty Trucks and Vehicles. Evaluation of several <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> was completed {{as part of this}} program. A combination of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, NOx Adsorbing Catalyst and Catalyzed Soot Filter was found to provide the levels of conversion efficiency required to achieve the emission targets. While early systems required relatively large catalyst volumes, external dosing, sulfur traps, full bypass configurations and high levels of Platinum metals; the final system is a compact, scalable, flow-through, fully-integrated and engine-managed aftertreatment system capable of commercial application for Light Duty Vehicles and Trucks. NOx adsorber/particulate filter technology is particularly attractive for Light Duty applications due to the lower exhaust flow and temperature requirements as compared to Heavy Duty engines. Despite these strong positive aspects, NOx Adsorbers are challenged by their regeneration requirements and susceptibility to sulfur poisoning and thermal degradation. Capability was developed to regenerate the NOx Adsorber for NOx and SOx as well as the Particulate Filter for soot. This system was fully integrated into a truck and evaluated over the chassis dynamometer for emissions capability and in real-world winter field testing. Durability of the system was evaluated over a variety of accelerated and real-time dynamometer tests. Excellent NOx and PM conversion efficiency was demonstrated, even following 3000 hrs of endurance testing. Unregulated emissions emitted by the system were evaluated as was the fuel penalty associated with the DeNOx and DeSOx regeneration processes. In the final evaluation, the system demonstrated 90 % NOx conversion and 99 % PM conversion at a 6 % fuel penalty over the FTP- 75 test cycle. While target fuel penalty levels were demonstrated using full-bypass configuration systems, the cost associated with those systems was prohibitively high and would preclude successful commercialization of the technology. Although the flow-through configuration fell 1 % short of the 5 % fuel penalty target, the cost of this configuration is such that commercial application is feasible. Cost drivers for the final system configuration were identified and demonstrate areas where future development areas could focus...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet strict {{emissions}} regulations, engine manufacturers have implemented <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> which reduce the tailpipe emissions from diesel engines. The effectiveness of most of these systems is limited when exhaust temperatures are low (usually below 200 Â°C to 250 Â°C). This {{is a problem for}} extended low load operation, such as idling and during cold start. Use of variable valve actuation, including early exhaust valve opening (EEVO) and cylinder deactivation (CDA), has been proposed as a means to elevate exhaust temperatures. This thesis discusses a research effort focused on EEVO and CDA as potential enablers of exhaust gas temperature increase for aftertreatment thermal management. ^ EEVO results in hotter exhaust gas, however, more fueling is needed to maintain brake power output. The first study outlines an analysis of the impact of EEVO on exhaust temperature (measured at the turbine outlet) and required fueling. An experimentally validated model is developed which relates fueling increase with EVO timing. This model is used to generate expressions for brake thermal efficiency and turbine out temperature as a function of EVO. Using these expressions the impact of EEVO is evaluated over the entire low-load operating space of the engine. Considering the earliest EVO studied, the model predicts an approximate 30 Â°C to 100 Â°C increase in turbine out temperature, which is sufficient to raise many low-load operating conditions to exhaust temperatures above 250 Â°C. However, the analysis also predicts penalties in brake thermal efficiency as large as 5...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} demand for heavy- and {{light-duty}} diesel vehicles on expansive markets while complying with current and future emission standards, {{it is necessary to}} reinsure the long-livety of the applied exhaust <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology.</b> Loss of catalytic performance may be associated with environmental as well as economical consequences. To aid the development of improved exhaust control components, such as the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), and optimise the use of raw materials, methods for accelerating the deactivation process are used. Catalysts can be aged in an engine-bench setup to simulate conditions in the field and thereby shorten the test procedure. The most resource efficient approach relies on using synthetic aging procedures to achieve such effect, which is the main focus of this thesis. 	To confirm a relevant effect of thermal and chemical deactivation, model DOCs were prepared and exposed to a variety of conditions, including atmospheres containing SO 2 and H 2 O, prior to characterisation of activity for CO oxidation, Pt dispersion, BET surface area, C 3 H 6 adsorption capacity (TPD) and surface composition (XPS). Hydrothermal treatment affected the HC trap function, critical for cold-start performance, and catalytic activity. Sulfur, adsorbed during low-temperature exposure, was the main cause for loss of Pt dispersion and activity for CO oxidation despite removal of the major part of SO 2 in succeeding heat treatment. A fresh commercial DOC (0 km) was subjected to different aging procedures and compared to samples dismantled from vehicles with different driving distance and sulfur content in the fuel. The deactivation of the vehicle-aged catalysts was confirmed by measuring emission levels in dynamometer tests and in lab reactor measurements. A similar degree of deactivation was observed, from flow reactor experiments and TEM analysis of Pt sintering, by using a 15 - 30 h rapid aging procedure combining poisoning at low temperature with (hydro) thermal treatment. The different sources of catalyst poisoning were studied with XPS. While S and Zn could be removed in reducing atmosphere at 700 ÂºC, results confirmed that P and Ca cause irreversible chemical deactivation of the vehicle-aged catalysts. The strong interaction of the sulfates with the washcoat, shown for both aging methods, highlights the importance of using low-sulfur diesel fuel. The described methods for rapid aging can be used for simulating catalyst poisoning in general terms, where accumulation of poisons during long-term exposure to diesel exhaust of low temperature is of concern. Hydrothermal treatment mimic periods of higher engine load and exotherms from regeneration processes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to collect and {{evaluate}} environmentally relevant data on exhaust emissions from the combustion products of engine oils and their effects on the function of (next-generation) emission control systems. Due to the lower EURO 4 emission limits, exhaust aftertreatment systems for heavy- and light-duty vehicles will be necessary which are more efficient than the 3 -way- or oxidation-type catalysts common today. Practicable exhaust aftertreatment systems are, for example, particle traps, improved catalysts (including selective catalytic reduction, or fuel-borne catalysts), NOÃ—-adsorbers, and combinations of these systems. Most of these exhaust control devices require fuels with sulphur contents below 10 ppm. In Germany, gasoline that meets this specification has recently been introduced on a small scale. However, the emissions generated by these low sulphur levels are almost in the same order of magnitude as the emissions of sulphur compounds derived from the consumption of lubricants that contain about 0. 5 % sulphur. As measurement data in this area is very limited, conclusions have mostly been drawn from experimental results with low sulphur fuels. It cannot be ruled out, expecially for NOÃ—-adsorbers, that sulphur will adversely affect performance all the way down to concentrations of O ppm, thus making a reduction of sulphur levels in engine oils sem necessary. Diesel technologies incorporating precious-metal catalysts (e. g. DOC, CDPF, CR-DPF, UreaSCR) perform better with sulphur levels below 10 ppm because this reduces the mass of sulphate particulate matter formed from fuel or lubricant sulphur. Conventional three-way catalysts are less sensitive, which mainly affects the light-off temperature. In summary, all available studies suggest that the lower the level of sulphur the lower emissions are after passing over the catalyst. Enough evidence is now available to show that phosphorous (associated with the antiwear additive ZDTP) limits catalyst life and, together with thermal degradation, is responsible for reduced catalyst efficiency over time. Lubricants contribute approximately 20 - 26 % to total particulate matter from diesel exhaust (passenger cars) and often more than 50 % to the soluble organic fraction (SOF). Ash deposits derived from additives that contain zinc, calcium, magnesium, or phosphorous are likely to block the newly developed particle filter systems and cannot be removed through thermal regeneration processes. Although there is still a critical lack of available technical information, it can be assumed that engine oil will make a significant contribution to EURO 4 limits of tail-pipe emissions, resulting mainly from secondary poisoning effects on catalyst and filter systems. Further research is thus necessary to make existing engine oil formulations and the important factor vehicle lubricant consumption compatible with the requirements of new exhaust <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology...</b>|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{excellent}} fuel efficiency, reliability, and durability, compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) engines {{have been used}} extensively to power almost all highway trucks, urban buses, off-road vehicles, marine carriers, and industrial equipment. CIDI engines burn 35 to 50 % less fuel than gasoline engines of comparable size, and they emit far less greenhouse gases (Carbon Dioxides), which have been implicated in global warming. Although the emissions of CIDI engines have been reduced significantly over the last decade, there remains concern with the Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) and Particulate Matter (PM) emission levels. In 2000, the US EPA proposed very stringent emissions standards to be introduced in 2007 along with low sulfur (< 15 ppm) diesel fuel. The California Air Resource Board (CARB) has also established the principle that future diesel fueled vehicles should meet the same emissions standards as gasoline fueled vehicles and the EPA followed suit with its Tier II emissions regulations. Meeting the Tier II standards requires NOX and PM emissions to be reduced dramatically. Achieving such low emissions while minimizing fuel economy penalty cannot be done through engine development and fuel reformulation alone, and requires application of NOX and PM aftertreatment control devices. A joint effort was made between Cummins Inc. and the Department of Energy to develop the generic aftertreatment subsystem technologies applicable for Light-Duty Vehicle (LDV) and Light-Duty Truck (LDT) engines. This paper provides {{an update on the}} progress of this joint development program. Three NOX reduction technologies including plasmaassisted catalytic NOX reduction (PACR), active lean NOX catalyst (LNC), and adsorber catalyst (AC) technology using intermittent rich conditions for NOX reduction were investigated in parallel in an attempt to select the best NOX control approach for light-duty aftertreatment subsystem integration and development. Investigations included system design and analysis, critical lab/engine experiments, and ranking then selection of NOX control technologies against reliability, up-front cost, fuel economy, service interval/serviceability, and size/weight. The results of the investigations indicate that the best NOX control approach for LDV and LDT applications is a NOX adsorber system. A greater than 83 % NOX reduction efficiency is required to achieve 0. 07 g/mile NOX Tier II vehicle-out emissions. Both active lean NOX and PACR technology are currently not capable of achieving the high conversion efficiency required for Tier II, Bin 5 emissions standards. In this paper, the NOX technology assessment and selection is first reviewed and discussed. Development of the selected NOX technology (NOX adsorber) and PM control are then discussed in more detail. Discussion includes exhaust sulfur management, further adsorber formulation development, reductant screening, diesel particulate filter development & active regeneration, and preliminary test results on the selected integrated SOX trap, NOX adsorber, and diesel particulate filter system over an FTP- 75 emissions cycle, and its impact on fuel economy. Finally, the direction of future work for continued advanced <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technology</b> development is discussed. (SAE Paper SAE- 2002 - 01 - 1867 Â© 2002 SAE International.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is currently struggling {{because of the}} increasingly stricter emissions standards that will take effect in the near future. Diesel engine emissions are of particular interest because they are still less understood than gasoline powered internal combustion engines. On the solid side of the exhaust emissions picture, particulates, or Soot and Ash, play the most important part. It {{has been found that}} ash is mostly a product of the fuel and oil composition. An oil consumption measuring system is then necessary if the relationship between oil consumption and ash increase in the sump oil and exhaust system is to be properly determined. This Thesis project consisted of experimentally measuring the variation of oil sump composition of a single-cylinder diesel generator set during a continuous running, steady state test. This was measured using ICP-AES (ICP-OES) elemental analysis technique, and the Total Base Number for the oil was also determined. An effective and reduced cost oil consumption and replenishing system was developed with this purpose. (cont.) The oil composition analysis demonstrated that the concentration of inorganic/metallic compounds (Ca, P, Zn, Mg) that contribute to ash increased throughout the test, jointly with oil consumption. The oil consumption measuring system developed was also found to be fairly accurate; with an approximate 2. 2 % error, probably due to oil hold-up. These results were then used to determine the possible effects of oil composition and oil consumption on Ash emissions and exhaust <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies.</b> by Elliott Ortiz-Soto.

40|$|Although {{implementing}} Diesel particulate filters (DPF) {{and other}} novel <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies</b> {{makes it possible}} to achieve significant reductions in particle mass emissions, it may induce the release of ultrafine particles and emissions of many other unregulated compounds. This paper focuses on (i) ultrafine particles, black carbon, BTEX, PAH, carbonyl compounds, and NO 2 emissions from Euro 4 and Euro 5 Diesel and gasoline passenger cars, (ii) the influence of driving conditions (e. g., cold start, urban, rural and motorway conditions), and (iii) the impact of additive and catalysed DPF devices on vehicleemissions. Chassis dynamometer tests were conducted on four Euro 5 vehicles and two Euro 4 vehicles: gasoline vehicles with and without direct injection system and Diesel vehicles equipped with additive and catalysed particulate filters. The results showed that compared to hot-start cycles, cold-start urban cycles increased all pollutant emissions by a factor of two. The sole exception was NO 2, which was reduced by a factor of 1. 3 e 6. Particulate and black carbon emissions from the gasoline engines were significantly higher than those from the Diesel engines equipped with DPF. Moreover, the catalysed DPF emitted about 3 e 10 times more carbonyl compounds and particles than additive DPF, respectively, during urban driving cycles, while the additive DPF vehicles emitted 2 and 5 times more BTEX and carbonyl compounds during motorway driving cycles. Regarding particle number distribution, the motorway driving cycle induced the emission of particles smaller in diameter (mode at 15 nm) than the urban cold-start cycle (mode at 80 e 100 nm). The results showed a clear positive correlation between particle, black carbon, and BTEX emissions, and a negative correlation between particles and NO 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of three Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS) for Particulate Matter (PM) was assessed in our laboratory against reference instrumentation in engine dynamometer testing of five Heavy Duty Engines (HDEs) of different <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>technologies.</b> The candidate systems were designed around the minimum requirements of allowing a gravimetric {{determination of the}} total emitted PM mass and incorporating a real time particle sensor. All PEMS-PM systems were found to reproduce within Â± 30 % the gravimetric PM results determined with reference measurement systems under non-regenerative operating conditions, at emission levels lying at and above the Euro VI limit of 10 mg/kWh. The use of prolonged sampling times envisaged in In Service Conformity (ISC) testing (> 120 min) {{was found to be}} beneficial, as it reduced the limit of detection of the PEMS-PM instrumentation to 1 - 3 mg/kWh (120 min) from 3 to 9 mg/kWh (30 min). The real time aerosol instrumentation exhibited a much higher sensitivity, being capable of quantifying emission levels below the EURO VI particle number limit of 6 Ã— 1011 #/kWh. Some modifications were required though in two particle sensors that were based on diffusion charging, in order to avoid a disproportional increase in their responses in the presence of homogeneously nucleated particles. Passive regeneration of the particulate filter resulted in excessive emission of volatile PM but also large discrepancies between the PEMS-PM and reference systems. The accurate quantification of absolute emission levels of non-volatile PM from the real time sensors can assist in the identification of such excessive volatile PM fractions, to avoid properly working DPF systems to fail an ISC test.
