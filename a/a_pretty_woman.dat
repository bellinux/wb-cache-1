5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>woman.</b> Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|A {{singular}} enchantment {{was employed}} to kill off a husband of <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>woman</b> desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a Gardenia was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>woman,</b> though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque {{as if they had}} been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1913, Golanchikova {{was offered}} a job by Fokker to work as his chief pilot, flying to European cities to promote his aircraft. Fokker was {{reported}} to be in love with Golanchikova, considering her to be the perfect woman. When she started flying his planes, he thought that having <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>woman</b> involved would be [...] "great publicity". Though she was homesick, she was determined to stay in Germany, because she {{would not be able to}} find professional work as a pilot in Russia. But, in July 1913, the French aircraft firm Morane-Saulnier produced a two-seater plane and hired Léon Letort to test it. He flew the leg from Paris to Berlin, and then offered Golanchikova the opportunity to fly with him on the return trip as navigator. After she obtained Fokker's agreement to make the flight with Letort, they took off for Paris. Bad weather conditions plagued the flight and after much difficulty, four days later they crashed in a field near the town of Bray-sur-Seine, about 100 km southeast of Paris. The plane was not damaged and the following day the duo was feted with a large reception.|$|E

6000|$|And, ere {{the youth}} could reply, {{he read the}} answer in his {{surprise}} at the question, and said, [...] "What! no--I would have sworn that Allan Durward was no man to live without a wife.
