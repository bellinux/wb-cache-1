5|$|In November 1943, Landis agreed {{after some}} persuasion that black sportswriter Sam Lacy {{should make a}} case for {{integration}} of organized baseball before the owners' annual meeting. Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor and advocate of civil rights, was a controversial figure due to his affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson out, but at Landis's suggestion, did not ask him any questions or begin <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> with him.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E

25|$|The {{exclusion}} of Chinese governments (both ROC and PRC) in the negotiation {{process of the}} San Francisco Peace Treaty (SFPT) nullified any legal binding power of the SFPT on China, including any act of renouncing or disposing of sovereignty. In addition, the fact that neither ROC nor PRC government ever ratified SFPT terms, prescribes that the SFPT is irrelevant to <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> of Chinese sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|There is {{circularity}} in Everett's measurement theory. Under {{the assumptions}} made by Everett, {{there are no}} 'good observations' as defined by him, and since {{his analysis of the}} observational process depends on the latter, it is void of any meaning. The concept of a 'good observation' is the projection postulate in disguise and Everett's analysis simply derives this postulate by having assumed it, without <b>any</b> <b>discussion.</b>|$|E

25|$|As a result, the CPC and CPC (ML) are {{not moving}} towards forming a united party. The CPC has also cited lack of self-critical {{historical}} {{evaluation of the}} CPC (ML)'s past (i.e., admitting to mistakes) and what it calls the political inconsistency of CPC (ML) activists, as barriers to prioritizing <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> about unity.

25|$|Drum {{returned}} to Washington in 1933 {{to serve as}} deputy to the Army's Chief of Staff, Douglas MacArthur.

In 1934 {{all the members of}} the Drum Board also sat on the presidential-initiated Baker Board, again setting its agenda to preclude <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> of air force independence.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Sassoon's conflict, the opening {{chapters of the}} novel describe the suffering of other soldiers in the hospital. Anderson, a former surgeon, now cannot stand the sight of blood. Haunted by terrible hallucinations after being thrown into the air by an explosion and landing head first in the ruptured stomach of a rotting dead soldier, Burns experiences a revulsion to eating. Another patient, Billy Prior, suffers from mutism and will only write communications with Rivers on a notepad. Prior eventually regains his voice, but remains a difficult patient for Rivers avoiding <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> of his war memories.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the goals}} of <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> will change {{depending}} upon what's under discussion, some goals {{will always be the}} same: to illuminate the subject, to unravel its mysteries, to interpret and share and learn from other points of view, to piece together the puzzle using everyone's contribution. Discussion skills are important. Everyone must be aware of how to get this discussion rolling and keep it rolling and interesting. Just as in any sport, a number of skills are necessary to work on and use at appropriate times. Everyone is expected to contribute by using these skills.|$|E
25|$|This {{may have}} been {{ameliorated}} by the winter of 1939, at which point a number of articles about the Norden appeared in the US popular press with reasonably accurate descriptions of its basic workings. But when these were {{traced back to the}} press corps at the Army Air Corps, the Navy was apoplectic. Instead of accepting it was now in the public domain, <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> about the Norden was immediately shut down. This drove both the Air Ministry and Royal Navy to increasingly anti-American attitudes when they considered sharing their own developments, notably newer ASDIC systems. By 1940 the situation on scientific exchange was entirely deadlocked as a result.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} degree of inter-provincial {{variation in the}} Canadian Paramedic practice. Although a national consensus (by way of the National Occupational Competency Profile) identifies certain knowledge, skills, and abilities as being most synonymous with a given level of Paramedic practice, each province retains ultimate authority in legislating the actual administration and delivery of emergency medical services within its own borders. For this reason, <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> of Paramedic Practice in Canada is necessarily broad, and general. Specific regulatory frameworks and questions related to Paramedic practice can only definitively be answered by consulting relevant provincial legislation, although provincial Paramedic Associations may often offer a simpler overview of this topic when it is restricted to a province-by-province basis.|$|E
25|$|On the Union side, Rosecrans held {{a council}} {{of war with}} most of his corps and {{division}} commanders to determine {{a course of action}} for September 20. The Army of the Cumberland had been significantly hurt in the first day's battle and had only five fresh brigades available, whereas the Confederate army had been receiving reinforcements and now outnumbered the Federals. Both of these facts ruled out a Union offensive. The presence of Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana at the meeting made <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> of retreating difficult. Rosecrans decided that his army had to remain in place, on the defensive. He recalled that Bragg had retreated after Perryville and Stones River and could conceivably repeat that behavior.|$|E
25|$|White abolitionists did {{not always}} face {{agreeable}} communities in the North. Garrison was almost lynched in Boston while newspaper publisher Elijah Lovejoy was killed in Alton, Illinois. The anger over abolition even spilled over into Congress where a gag rule was instituted to prevent <b>any</b> <b>discussion</b> of slavery {{on the floor of}} either chamber. Most whites viewed African-Americans as an inferior race and had little taste for abolitionists, often assuming that all were like Garrison. African-Americans had little freedom even in states where slavery was not permitted, being shunned by whites, subjected to discriminatory laws, and often forced to compete with Irish immigrants for menial, low-wage jobs. In the South meanwhile, planters argued that slavery was necessary to operate their plantations profitably and that emancipated slaves would attempt to Africanize the country as they had done in Haiti.|$|E
