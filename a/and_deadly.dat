5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, <b>and</b> <b>deadly</b> in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites {{were thought to be}} responsible for about half the losses.|$|E

With few options left, the group {{goes to the}} facility's wet entry, where they plan to take a submersible to escape. Upon being confronted, Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this has the side effect of making them smarter <b>and</b> <b>deadly.</b> When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged. While delivering a monologue emphasizing the need for group unity, Russell is dragged into the submersible pool by the shark and killed.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{there was}} a total of seven {{depressions}} and four cyclonic storms. The most intense <b>and</b> <b>deadly</b> tropical cyclone of the season, the West Bengal cyclone, lashed that province of India and Bangladesh {{in the month of}} November. Rough seas offshore caused at least 173drownings offshore Bangladesh and India, while over 100people were left missing. In West Bengal alone, 124fatalities were reported, with over one hundred people still missing. Flooding occurred there and some areas of Bangladesh, particularly the capital city of Dhaka. Another notable storm was the Oman cyclone in May. It made a rare landfall in the Omani region of Dhofar. The storm brought historic rainfall to Oman, which in turn brought flooding to the region. Nine people drowned and damage to property, crops, and transportation reached $25million (2002USD).|$|E
