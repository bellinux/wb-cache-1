5|$|First-millennium Indian scholars, such as Sureshvara (Suresvaracharya, c. 750 CE), {{have viewed}} this male-female {{dialogue}} as profound on both sides; Maitreyi refuses wealth, wishing {{to share her}} husband's spiritual knowledge, and in the four known versions of the Upanishadic story she challenges Yajnavalkya's theory of Atman. Yajnavalkya acknowledges her motivations, and that her questions are evidence she is a seeker of ultimate knowledge and <b>a</b> <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> the Atman.|$|E

5|$|Callisto (Jupiter IV) is {{the fourth}} and last Galilean moon, and is the second largest of the four, and at 4820.6 {{kilometers}} in diameter, it is the third largest moon in the Solar System, and barely smaller than Mercury, though {{only a third of}} the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, <b>a</b> <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating. Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons. It {{is one of the most}} heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System, and one major feature is a basin around 3000km wide called Valhalla.|$|E
5|$|Henry Gerber and the Society for Human Rights {{serve as}} direct {{links between the}} LGBT-related {{activism}} of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, {{a young man named}} Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, {{a man who had been}} <b>a</b> <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Sarah became {{close to}} the young Princess Anne in about 1675, and the {{friendship}} grew stronger as the two grew older. In late 1675, {{when she was still}} only fifteen, she met John Churchill, 10 years her senior, who fell in love with her. Churchill, who had previously been <b>a</b> <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> Charles II’s mistress, Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland, had little to offer financially, as his estates were deeply in debt. Sarah had a rival for Churchill in Catherine Sedley, a wealthy mistress of James II and the choice of Churchill's father, Sir Winston Churchill, who was anxious to restore the family's fortune. John may have hoped to take Sarah as a mistress in place of the Duchess of Cleveland, who had recently departed for France, but surviving letters from Sarah to John show her unwillingness to assume that role.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Clairmont became <b>a</b> <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had {{a second}} child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate. Godwin's debts {{continued}} to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with {{the tension in the}} Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E
5|$|Washington was <b>a</b> <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> exotic animals, {{as well as}} gardening. He {{maintained}} extensive menageries on {{his country}} properties, first at Bellport, and later at Mendham. On Long Island, it is reported that he was often seen with a bird or monkey on his shoulder.

Socially, he was {{an active member of the}} Lotos Club, a literary gentlemen's club in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Indira Parthasarathy's Nandan Kathai (1978) {{builds the}} tale of Nandanar (referred in the work as Nandan) further, {{introducing}} two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, who are as ruthless as Bharati's Vediyar. Nandanar is portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> art, rather than God. He {{wants to see the}} cosmic dance of Nataraja. A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives. Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar. Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike. Unlike earlier narratives, Indira's tale is devoid of miracles and is a story of how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy. The Vediyar-priest, the Vediyar-landlord and the two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, hatch a plot to end Nandan. They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field, an allusion to the miracle of Vediyar's impossible task in Bharati's work. Then, they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam, the high-caste elites' dance and the folk dance of the Dalits. Finally, in the climax, Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire-trial, reassured by the earlier miracle, but he and Abhirami burn in the flames. The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code, longing for salvation, would be punished.|$|E
