5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others described it <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> but good. Some hunted dodos {{only for their}} gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters {{had to be careful}} not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E
5|$|A 1754 {{enactment}} introduced up to {{one year}} imprisponment for carrying of daggers and pocket pistols ("tercerols") as well <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> sentencing for cases of attacking or resisting law enforcement with use of these weapons. Mere brandishing of a weapon against a state official was to be punished by life imprisonment. Wounding a state official would be punished by decapitation, killing of state official by cutting of hand followed by decapitation. Another 1754 enactment limited possibility of shooting within limits of certain cities to licensed shooting ranges, showing early development of sport shooting in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him <b>as</b> <b>tough,</b> but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E

English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens.

In all, Scotland conceded 49 extras in 50 overs, of which 30 were wides – only Bermudian wicket-keeper Dean Minors out-scoring the extras. Bermuda reached a total of 219 for 9, having been 88 for 7, and a fiery opening burst from 42-year-old Dennis Archer had the Scots worried.

25|$|In late January 1910, {{following}} {{months of}} high rainfall, the River Seine in Paris flooded the French capital, reaching a maximum height of 8.62 metres. The Great Flood of Paris {{as it is}} colloquially known caused extensive damage and forced thousands out of their homes. The infrastructure within Paris came close to destruction and there were major concerns for public health. France mobilised to save its capital. Lépine whose office included public health proved <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> and authoritarian {{as he had been}} on policing matters. In the flood's aftermath he established new procedures to address the problems of flooding. The instructions explained the importance of chemical cleansing and institutionalized the growing medical consensus about the causes of water borne diseases that had been controversial just a few years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Often {{the making}} of conserves can be trickier than making a {{standard}} jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for {{just enough time to}} allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify. This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only to bring to the setting point. As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking for longer periods to avoid issues such <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> skins. Currants and gooseberries, and a number of plums are among these fruits.|$|E

25|$|Davis {{was signed}} by Kerry Packer for World Series Cricket in 1977. As one of the {{brightest}} talents in Australia his signature was considered vital for the marketing and success of the brand. In the first year of WSC (1977/78) Davis played 3 Supertests scoring a best of 84 against the World XI. He would play 2 more Supertests in the 1978/79 season scoring just 48 runs (ave. 12). Davis found breaking into the WSC Australian XI just <b>as</b> <b>tough</b> as the official side his path being blocked by McCosker and Bruce Laird. The fact that Davis averaged roughly half as many runs in Supertests as he did in official tests highlights the high level of competition in WSC. It was during the second Supertest that Australian batsman David Hookes suffered a broken jaw from an Andy Roberts bouncer. Packer was said to encourage his bowlers to be aggressive. Traditional cricket followers became shocked by the posteuring and bad-language broadcast via pitch microphones. The highly charged atmosphere and Packer's preference for fast bowling led to many of the WSC stars, including Davis, to wear protective helmets. A piece of cricket equipment Davis would later help develop after retirement.|$|E
