5|$|The {{capture of}} Flambeau brought further acclaim to Shaw, {{who had already}} {{defeated}} several other French privateers and taken them as prizes. Enterprise continued her cruise, next chasing down and capturing Pauline and later Guadaloupeenne. Shortly afterward, chronic illness forced Shaw to transfer command of the vessel to Lieutenant Andrew Sterett. Sterret continued to cruise the Caribbean, taking several more prizes before returning home. Upon Shaw's return home the president <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> officials personally thanked him for his service. Shaw later continued his naval career, serving with distinction during the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} by {{nearly half a million}} people. They protested a variety of issues such as those of the previous demonstration, as well as the growing rate of inflation and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of the demonstrations. Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E
5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> {{universities}} in Brazil, {{is the high}} dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1859, PedroII {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} provinces {{north of}} the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraíba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained. Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by PedroII. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.|$|E

5|$|Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's {{chairman}} and {{former chief executive}} officer, first conceived the concept of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. {{bureau chief of the}} cable industry trade magazine Cablevision. It was a time of rapid {{growth in the number of}} cable television channels available in the United States, and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E
5|$|Bryant and Milam {{were indicted}} for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} {{that he could get}} a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E

5|$|International {{distribution}} {{rights were}} bought by Portman Film and Television, which sold the series to 14 international networks by February 2007. Seven regional European Hallmark Channels broadcast it, with other showings on NRK in Norway, RÚV in Iceland, YLE in Finland, Rai Tre in Italy and één in Flanders. The Australian rights {{were picked up}} by the Seven Network, although the ABC aired seasons 1 and 2 in 2011 and season 3 late in 2012, with TVNZ buying it for New Zealand. The programme aired in the United States on some PBS affiliates in early 2008. A wider syndication deal was struck with American Public Television later that year for the first two series to be available to all affiliates, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> stations; the third season begins distribution on 1 December 2009. In Canada, the first and second series are being broadcast this year, (April–June, 2010), on the Vision TV network. The third series premièred on the Flemish channel één on 10 April 2009.|$|E
5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{horses are}} often used to reenact many of their {{historical}} work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>public</b> settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon {{similar to that used}} before the invention of the modern motorized truck.|$|E
