5|$|Cockroaches use pheromones {{to attract}} mates, and the males {{practice}} courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate {{facing away from}} each other with their genitalia in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species <b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> parthenogenetic, reproducing without the need for males.|$|E
5|$|Nests <b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> predated by green tree ants, which {{attack the}} newly hatched nestlings, and the pied currawong, which takes young from the nest. Nests are parasitized by the brush cuckoo, pallid cuckoo, and Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo.|$|E

5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries {{about the quality of}} the cartridges and piracy.

5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations <b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of several dromaeosaurids (Microraptor, Sinornithosaurus, and Velociraptor) and modern birds and {{reptiles}} indicate that some dromaeosaurids (including Microraptor and Velociraptor) {{may have been}} nocturnal predators, while Sinornithosaurus is inferred to be cathemeral (active throughout the day at short intervals). However, the discovery of iridescent plumage in Microraptor has {{cast doubt on the}} inference of nocturnality in this genus, as no modern birds that have iridescent plumage <b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nocturnal.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the photosphere, six other components of Betelgeuse's atmosphere have now been identified. They are a molecular environment otherwise known as the MOLsphere, a gaseous envelope, a chromosphere, a dust environment and two outer shells (S1 and S2) composed of carbon monoxide (CO). Some of these elements <b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> asymmetric while others overlap.|$|E

5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur <b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seed predators (granivores), {{but this may}} be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{historical}} and current population levels of the Southern fin whale. The IWC officially estimates that the Southern Hemisphere pre-whaling population was 400,000 whales and that the population in 1979 (at the cessation of Antarctic large scale whaling) was 85,200. Both the current and historical estimates should be considered as poor estimates because the methodology and data used in the study <b>are</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flawed. Other estimates cite current size to be between 15,000 (1983) and 38,000 (1997). As of 2006, there is no scientifically accepted estimate of current population or trends in abundance.|$|E
