5|$|A bill {{proposed}} by Labour peers to abolish by-elections (<b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> phase out hereditary peers) was filibustered in 2016 by Conservative hereditary peer Lord Trefgarne.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo <b>and</b> <b>therefore,</b> increasing global temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Soft drinks, candy, cookies, snack crackers, and {{ice cream}} are food items <b>and</b> are <b>therefore</b> {{eligible}} items. Seafood, steak, and bakery cakes are also food items <b>and</b> are <b>therefore</b> eligible items.|$|R

5|$|After all the {{remainders}} r0, r1, etc. {{have been}} substituted, the final equation expresses g as a linear sum of a and b: g = sa + tb. Bézout's identity, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> the previous algorithm, can both {{be generalized to}} the context of Euclidean domains.|$|E
5|$|Although both Pi Vell and Pi Jove are officially protected, {{they are}} easily {{accessible}} {{in an isolated}} wooded area, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> vulnerable to vandalism as well as natural hazards such as lightning and wildfire. Several proposals have been made {{over the years to}} improve the site.|$|E
5|$|Among other things, {{the party}} {{supports}} {{the unification of}} South Tyrol (Italy) with Tyrol (Austria), <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> the South Tyrolean secessionist movement, which notably includes its South Tyrolean sister party Die Freiheitlichen.|$|E
60|$|All entirely bad {{works of}} art may be divided into those which, professing to be imaginative, bear no stamp of imagination, <b>and</b> are <b>therefore</b> false, <b>and</b> those which, professing to be {{representative}} of matter, miss of the representation <b>and</b> are <b>therefore</b> nugatory.|$|R
5000|$|WS Brussels {{finished}} in the relegation zone (15th) in the 2016-17 Belgian First Amateur Division <b>and</b> was <b>therefore</b> relegated. On top of that, the team was refused a Belgian remunerated football license by the Belgian FA for outstanding debts <b>and</b> would <b>therefore</b> have relegated automatically.|$|R
3000|$|... cause {{artifacts}} in the extracted TF features. NMF {{is the only}} MD techniques that guarantees the non-negativity of the decomposed factors <b>and</b> it <b>therefore</b> is a better MD technique to extract meaningful features compared to ICA <b>and</b> PCA. <b>Therefore,</b> NMF is chosen as the MD technique in TFM decomposition.|$|R
5|$|Andrew D. White, {{its first}} president, and Ezra Cornell, {{who gave it}} his name, {{turned out to be}} the {{developers}} of the first American university <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> the agents of revolutionary curricular reform.|$|E
5|$|As cases {{cannot be}} stacked in Wagiman, these number suffixes cannot be called case suffixes, whereas the nominal suffixes {{discussed}} above (such as -binyju 'only'), {{show the same}} syntactic distribution - they occur {{in the same place}} - <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> may be analysed as cases themselves.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{have started}} to {{discover}} extrasolar Earth analogs – planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> could possibly host {{life as we know}} it.|$|E
50|$|Italian is a Romance language, <b>and</b> is <b>therefore</b> a {{descendant}} of Vulgar Latin (the spoken form of non-classical Latin). Standard Italian is based on Tuscan, especially its Florentine dialect, <b>and</b> is <b>therefore</b> an Italo-Dalmatian language, to which Sicilian and the extinct Dalmatian also belong, among a few others.|$|R
30|$|The {{identified}} {{structural changes}} have important policy implications. Cyclical problems {{in an economy}} are usually caused {{by a lack of}} labor demand <b>and</b> are <b>therefore</b> transitory, but a rise in structural unemployment is typically caused by a mismatch in the labor market and/or job separation <b>and</b> is <b>therefore</b> often persistent.|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{ethoxide}} is {{a strong}} base, <b>and</b> is <b>therefore</b> corrosive.|$|R
5|$|Because the {{military}} commission {{does not meet}} the requirements of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or of the Geneva Convention, it violates the laws of war <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> cannot be used to try Hamdan.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines work by {{increasing}} the efficiency of a natural brain chemical, GABA, to decrease the excitability of neurons. This reduces the communication between neurons <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> has a calming effect {{on many of the}} functions of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Bernadeth Prentice, Bernice Morton, Elricia Francis, and Valma Bass {{competed in}} the 4 × 100 m relay. The team {{received}} a DNF (did not finish), <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> did not advance to {{the next round of}} competition.|$|E

5|$|Espejo {{published}} Quito's first newspaper, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> he {{is regarded}} as the founder of Ecuadorian journalism. He is considered Ecuador's first literary critic; according to Spanish scholar Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo, Espejo's Nuevo Luciano is the oldest critical work written in South America.|$|E
5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, {{studies have}} shown that reactive oxidative species lead to the formation of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> to quit smoking should be considered.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing may be helpful.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Am(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Am3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with americium <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides.|$|E
5|$|Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie. Henley {{acknowledged}} Lucy represents {{faith in}} the story, being the youngest <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> most open-minded of the Pevensies. During filming, Henley's baby teeth were falling out, so she wore fake teeth {{to fill in the}} gaps.|$|E
