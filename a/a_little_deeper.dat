Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. I thought he was so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E
500|$|The Boston Globe {{music critic}} Joan Anderman criticized the album saying [...] "Jackson's {{decision}} to recycle the nympho routine {{one more time}} is just boring [...] A quarter-century into her career, it was Jackson's moment to take a breath, dig <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper,</b> and make a bold - {{or at least a}} different - statement. Instead, she has trussed herself up in vinyl to coo another batch of digitized porn." [...] On a better note, she called the tracks [...] "Rollercoaster" [...] and [...] "Luv" [...] "engaging tracks", describing them as a [...] "sassy-sweet side" [...] and [...] "a plump, crackling confection", respectively.|$|E

Her father, Joseph Smith, worked for United Press International in Paris and moved to Washington, D.C., in 1966, where he became The Washington Posts first {{official}} obituary editor. Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a paper conservator for the Freer and Sackler Galleries at the Smithsonian Institution. Smith's parents later divorced. Smith labeled her family [...] "upper crust and reserved". As a child, Smith was often teased because of her unusual voice. Smith has stated: [...] "I've sounded {{pretty much the same}} way since I was six. Maybe [...] <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> now." [...] She made her acting debut in a sixth-grade play.|$|E

500|$|Zara Golden of VH1 {{regarding}} the video commented that, although Usher {{had a lot}} of troubles in his life [...] "he gives the kid a hug, enjoys a dance at the strip club (why not?) and sings out all the rest in a recording booth." [...] Billboards David Greenwald praised the choreography and noted that Usher shows no signs of sickness as he performs the compound choreography, [...] "which ends with a forceful escape". Sam Lansky of Idolator was divided on the video and wrote that the singer [...] "could have dug <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> to tap into some of that very real personal pain to bring something more emotionally charged to this video; as it stands, it’s a little too polished to feel anything but contrived." ...|$|E
500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are. When {{asked about the}} {{background}} of lead single [...] "First Time", Wade said, [...] "It just felt urgent, like a first kiss, a first love. [...] Like {{the first time you}} realize there's more to that relationship than you thought. I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself at a place where I can write stuff that's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E
500|$|Günther and Newton {{noted that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} was shaped somewhat differently and longer {{than that of the}} hoopoe starling, being about [...] long from the occipital condyle; it was also narrower, being [...] wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the eye sockets were about [...] apart. The interorbital septum was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about [...] long, less curved and proportionally <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger nostrils, with the nostril openings in the bone being [...] in length. The mandible was about [...] long and [...] deep proximally. The skull had an attachment scar above the temporal fossa. The supraoccipital ridge on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a biventer muscle attachment in the parietal region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{decided to}} change its name to Revocation in 2006; Davidson commented: [...] "I think, looking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> into it, we {{made a lot of}} {{mistakes}} with Cryptic Warning. We were younger and didn't really know what we were doing, so Revocation was us starting fresh with a clean slate and revoking our past mistakes." [...] With a direction change, Revocation promptly recorded a three-song demo titled Summon the Spawn, and in 2008 they went back into the studio to record their first full-length album, Empire of the Obscene. The full length was self-released, and the band financed its own tour, attracting the interest of several record labels. Revocation subsequently signed to Relapse Records.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Kelis {{said that}} her sixth studio album would be {{finished}} [...] "in the next few weeks". According to Kelis's management firm at the time, Three Six Zero Group, the album was to feature production from Skream, BURNS, Tom Neville, Dan Black, and Caspa. She said of the album, [...] "I've been on a real 1990s vibe with this record, it's kind of trip-hoppish [...] it's more electro, it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> and darker". The Skream-produced single [...] "Distance" [...] received its UK radio premiere in mid 2012, although {{the rest of the}} material from these recording sessions remains unreleased. Kelis was featured on Dan Black's single [...] "Hearts" [...] and Skream's [...] "Copy Cat" [...] (both 2013), the latter of which led to a dispute after Kelis alleged that Skream refused to have her appear in the music video.|$|E

2500|$|Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle {{believed}} {{the film to}} be [...] "an odd picture, a rumination on depression and self-discovery that's couched as an office comedy." [...] Although Meyer said that the film is [...] "never truly funny or insightful," [...] she did give the picture some credit, stating that [...] "the movie works intermittently by digging <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> than you might expect." [...] Meyer also approved of the performances of Allen, Belushi, and Warburton. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times likened the film to [...] "an afterschool special, with grownups cast in the kids' roles." [...] Ebert also called the film [...] "crashingly obvious," [...] later remarking that the audience is [...] "faced with the dismal prospect of being denied a climax, which, if it occurred, {{would be just as}} predictable as its substitute." ...|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{reflected}} {{that the success}} of Laid [...] "in the pop realm meant that when Wah Wah eventually did come out in 1994, it felt like a bizarre detour and attempt at career sabotage rather than a bookend to a wonderful recording experience." [...] Even the Stars commented that [...] "the James faithful are split down the middle on Wah Wah. Those with a predilection for the big hit singles turn their nose up at it, but those who dig <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> know that it is the real James baring their artistic soul, opening up their creative process to outside scrutiny - raw, real and putting everything out on the line. It's a fascinating insight into the workings of the band egged on by one of the most inventive writers and producers of the generation - a completely unique record and typical of James' contrary approach at times." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a comedy rueful but tidy and safe," [...] which sparked not much interest in him, and added that it is [...] "a placid tale of impulses running wild." [...] He, however, deemed the ensemble [...] "excellent." [...] The Star-Ledger writer Stephen Witty said that the film [...] "has a few good lines, and a fine cast." [...] He thought that Laurie was [...] "particularly good," [...] Keener amusing and Platt charming, but expected more of the film: [...] "You want something that plays a little sharper, and cuts <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>deeper.</b> You want something that demands more of its performers, and delivers more to its audience." [...] Similarly, New York Post Lou Lumenick wrote: [...] "While there are laughs, the farcical elements of The Oranges are not presented with sufficient discipline {{to live up to}} the full potential of its cast." [...] The Hollywood Reporter critic David Rooney praised members of the cast [...] "who manage to hit a sweet spot even in this mediocre material," [...] noting that the film [...] "runs out of juice" [...] when it becomes serious and that the film's [...] "cathartic moments feel fabricated" [...] and concluded that the cast [...] "deserves better." ...|$|E
