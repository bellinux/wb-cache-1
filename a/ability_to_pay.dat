5|$|Keynes's {{experience}} at Versailles was influential in shaping his future outlook, {{yet it was}} not a successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{allocation}} of property rights to individuals who may differ in their valuations of those rights and in their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Agents’ limited <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> prevent them from achieving allocative efficiency through voluntary negotiation, so initial allocation of property rights matters. We show that non-market assignment of the rights, as simple as random rationing at below-market price, yields more efficient allocation than a competitive market if the rights are fully transferable. Further, need-based assignment schemes that favor the poor and merit-based schemes that favor those with high valuations are socially desirable. Conversely, if speculation is prevalent, it may be beneficial to render rights inalienable (i. e., prohibit transferability). Our result provides a potential rationale for government intervention of competitive markets and some implications for limitations of market oriented assignment rules, {{in the presence of}} financing costs...|$|R

This report provides estimates of the maximum <b>ability</b> of ranchers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for Forest Service grazing. <b>Abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> vary greatly depending on the region of the country and assumptions about costs. Based on current cash costs, the value of Forest Service grazing is greater than the grazing fee. Based on longrun economic costs, the value of grazing is less than the grazing fee. In some regions of the United States, the longrun value of grazing is zero. These low longrun values reflect the low returns to cow/calf producers in the period on which this study was based...|$|R

Kesselring's legal team was headed by Hans Laternser, a skilful German lawyer who specialised in Anglo-Saxon law, had represented several defendants at the Nuremberg Trials, and would later go on to represent Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein. Kesselring's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his legal team was hampered because his assets had been frozen by the Allies, but his legal costs were eventually met by friends in South America and relatives in Franconia.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b>|$|E

5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E
5|$|The nearly {{continuous}} wars of {{the first}} three decades of the new century resulted in modernization, if not (because of the treasury limitations) enlargement, of the Commonwealth's army. The total military forces available ranged from a few thousands at the Battle of Kircholm, to the over fifty thousands plus pospolite ruszenie mobilized for the Khotyn (Chocim) campaign of 1621. The remarkable {{during the first half of}} the 17th century development of artillery resulted in the 1650 publication in Amsterdam of the Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima book by Kazimierz Siemienowicz, a pioneer also in the science of rocketry. Despite the superior quality of the Commonwealth's heavy (hussar) and light (Cossack) cavalry, the increasing proportions of the infantry (peasant, mercenary and Cossack formations) and of the contingent of foreign troops resulted in an army, in which these respective components were heavily represented. During the reigns of the first two Vasas a war fleet was developed and fought successful naval battles (1609 against Sweden). As usual, fiscal difficulties impaired the effectiveness of the military, and the treasury's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the ability}} to raise funds through the sale of land {{hampered}} the Company's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> dividends to its shareholders, and caused its development of Southern Rhodesia to slow. Believing that membership in the union could help solve both problems, the Company now backed Southern Rhodesia's incorporation as South Africa's fifth province. However, this prospect proved largely unpopular among Southern Rhodesian settlers, most of whom wanted self-government, and came to vote for the RGA in large numbers. In the 1920 Legislative Council election, the RGA won ten of the 13 seats contested. A referendum on the colony's future was held on 27 October 1922—at the suggestion of Winston Churchill, then Britain's Colonial Secretary, continuing the initiative of his preprocessor Viscount Milner—and responsible government won the day by 59%. Southern Rhodesia was duly annexed by the Empire on 12 September 1923, and granted full self-government on 1 October the same year. The new Southern Rhodesian government immediately purchased the land from the British Treasury for £2million, and ten years later paid the same sum to the British South Africa Company for the country's mineral rights.|$|E

5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} mass ("serial") {{production of the}} model at the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant (later renamed as Antonov Serial Production Plant), which was associated with but separate from the Antonov Design Bureau, and at the Samara Aircraft Production Plant (later reorganised as Aviakor) in Samara, Russia. At one stage during early development, Russia was showing reluctance at supporting {{the development of the}} An-70, and so Uzbekistan sought, unsuccessfully, to establish a final assembly plant in the capital at the Tashkent Aircraft Production Plant, where the production of the An-70's wings and the Il-76 were taking place. Construction of the first prototype had started in Kiev in 1991. The maiden flight of the aircraft had originally been scheduled for late 1992. However, due to financing and design issues, this was pushed back until 1994. In particular, the weakened national currency diminished the firm's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the aircraft's components, especially those sourced from Russia, and workers' salaries. In addition, engineers discovered numerous design and manufacturing deficiencies during the final ground checks, the majority of which were non-critical yet necessitated lengthy corrections. In the end, the aircraft made its maiden flight on 16 December 1994.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{equilibrium}} dynamics {{of an economy}} facing an aggregate collateral constraint on external debt to the dynamics of an economy facing a collateral constraint imposed {{at the level of}} each individual agent. The aggregate collateral constraint is intended to capture an environment in which foreign investors base their lending decisions predominantly upon macro indicators as opposed <b>to</b> individual <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Individual agents do not internalize the aggregate borrowing constraint. Instead, in this economy a country interest-rate premium emerges to clear the financial market. The central finding of the paper is that the economy with the aggregate borrowing limit does not generate higher levels of debt than the economy with the individual borrowing limit. That is, there is no overborrowing in equilibrium. ...|$|R

25|$|New credit {{scores have}} been {{developed}} {{in the last decade}} by companies such as Scorelogix, PRBC, L2C, Innovis etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> It is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> New credit scores that focus more on future <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.|$|E

40|$|Tax {{measures}} {{announced in}} the latest Quebec budget {{strike a balance between}} good economic outcomes and attention to fairness in how tax burdens are shared. The author assesses Quebec’s budget measures according to their impacts on the tax burden and how well provincial taxes match citizens’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Despite the fact that the new tax measures are imperfectly geared to income, the alternative of confining the burden of required tax increases to fewer, higher income individuals would carry a high economic cost. Quebecers are already among the highest taxed in the country while Quebec’s tax system is the most progressive. The budget proposals will raise taxes, widening the gap with the rest of Canada, yet the tax system will remain more “progressive” than that of most other provinces.
