For instance, in the United States, the FBI reported that 15.6% of hate crimes reported to police in 2004 were [...] "because of a sexual-orientation bias". Under the UK Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, as explained by Advisory, Conciliation and <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Service,</b> [...] "workers or job applicants must not be treated less favourably because of their {{sexual orientation}}, their perceived sexual orientation or because they associate with someone of a particular sexual orientation".|$|E
2500|$|Consultation is {{the process}} by which {{management}} and employees (or their representatives) jointly examine and discuss issues of mutual concern. It involves seeking acceptable solutions to problems through an exchange of views and information. Consultation does not remove the right of managers to manage, but it does impose an obligation that the views of employees be sought and considered before decisions are taken. [...] The Advisory, Conciliation and <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Service</b> (ACAS), is the UK government's independent agency for advice and conciliation. [...] Although the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and their member unions oppose the use of consultancies during recognition campaigns, calling it a union busting tactic, ACAS takes a different stance, [...] "Employee communications and consultation are the lifeblood of any business. which [...] "aims to improve organizations and working life through better employment relations".|$|E

2500|$|While some {{courts have}} chosen to be more deferential to the employer's {{substantive}} reasons for dismissal, they emphasise more strongly the importance of employers having a fair process. The Advisory, Conciliation and <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Service</b> Code of Practice (2009) explains that good industry practice for disciplinaries requires, among other things, written warnings, a fair hearing {{by people who have}} no reason to side against the employee, or with any manager involved in the dispute, and the opportunity for union representation. Often a company handbook will include its own system, which if not followed will likely mean the dismissal was unfair. Nevertheless, in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd the House of Lords held that, in a case where a van driver was told he was redundant on the spot, if an employer can show the dismissal would be made regardless of whether a procedure was followed, damages can be reduced to zero. In the Employment Act 2002, Parliament made an abortive attempt to instil some kind of mandatory minimum procedure for everybody, but after complaints from employers and unions alike that it was merely encouraging a [...] "tick-box" [...] culture, it was repealed in the Employment Act 2008. Now if the ACAS Code is not followed, and this is unreasonable, an unfair dismissal award can be increased by 25 per cent. Generally, under ERA 1996 sections 119 and 227, the principle for a [...] "basic" [...] unfair dismissal award is that, with a cap of £350 per week and a maximum of 20 weeks, an employee should receive one week's pay for each year employed if aged between 22 and 40, 1½ weeks if over 40 and ½ a week if under 22. By ERA 1996 section 123, the employee may also be entitled to the more significant, but discretionary [...] "compensatory" [...] award. This should take into account the actual losses of the employee as just and equitable, based on loss of immediate and future wages, the manner of the dismissal and loss of future unfair dismissal protection and redundancy rights. This is capped, but usually increased in line with RPI inflation. It was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award of a successful claimant was merely £4,560. Very few claimants are successful in securing reinstatement, although if they are suspended from their workplace and colleagues, the evidence suggests that the experience of litigation sours the relationship so that the employee will no longer wish to return. It is therefore important that in 2011 the Supreme Court emphasised in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital that in principle an employee may secure an injunction to continue working while internal disciplinary procedures are followed. Particularly given the difficulty of finding alternative employment while removed from work, it is not clear why a staff member who retains the support of his or her colleagues (as opposed to a manager who potentially has a conflict of interest) should not also be able to continue working until a dismissal is confirmed by a court.|$|E
