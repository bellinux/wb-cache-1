2500|$|Ali was mourned globally, and {{a family}} {{spokesman}} said the family [...] "certainly believes that Muhammad was {{a citizen of the}} world â€¦ <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the world grieves with him." [...] Politicians such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Cameron and more paid tribute to Ali. Ali also received numerous tributes from the world of sports including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Floyd Mayweather, Mike Tyson, the Miami Marlins, LeBron James, Steph Curry and more. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer stated, [...] "Muhammad Ali belongs to the world. But he only has one hometown." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{are only}} {{resolute}} they shall eat [...] That {{they and their}} mates may thrive, [...] <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the dead are safer meat [...] Than the weakest thing alive.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They never do. They have {{probably}} {{a house full}} of guests, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my accommodation is limited. I've no doubt they'll ask us on Tuesday or Wednesday, and if you like we will go.' ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>they</b> {{knelt down}} <b>and</b> prayed till the tumult died away, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> all was done.|$|R
60|$|Presently a {{small stone}} fell among them--another--and another, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> some one had noticed the smoke.|$|R
5000|$|Then the eies of {{them both}} were opened, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were naked, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> sewed figge tree leaves together, and made {{themselves}} breeches.|$|R
6000|$|He is with her, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I know Where they are, {{what they}} do: they believe my tears flow While they laugh, laugh at me, at me {{fled to the}} drear Empty church, to pray God in, for them!--I am here! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They will be friendly," [...] Luka said confidently. [...] "Why not? They are peaceable people, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{did they}} touch strangers {{they would be}} punished. There are Russian {{soldiers}} at Turukhansk. The Ostjaks are very poor. You have things to give them, and you want nothing of them." ...|$|E
60|$|The Brigands {{disperse}} {{into groups}} lazily. Some {{go into the}} cave. Others sit down or lie down {{to sleep in the}} open. A few produce a pack of cards and move off towards the road; for it is now starlight; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> motor cars have lamps which can be turned to account for lighting a card party.|$|E
6000|$|Ver. 7. [...] "And {{the eyes}} of them both were opened, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were naked; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> sewed fig-leaves together, and made {{themselves}} aprons." ...|$|R
60|$|All of {{the boys}} listened with interest, {{for many of them}} had {{inspected}} the collection, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> stamp-gathering was one of the kind doctor's hobbies.|$|R
60|$|Small {{though the}} {{aperture}} was, it effected a sensible relief. The feeling of oppression ceased; {{half an hour}} later the hole was closed up, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the snow was still falling.|$|R
6000|$|... "The murderers are abroad," [...] {{whispered the}} girl. [...] "Thus will another become the tongue of Luata. It is well for us, since it keeps them {{too busy to}} give the time for searching for us. They think that we cannot escape the city, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we cannot leave the island--and so do I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not liable}} to," [...] said the tall man. [...] "They know the motorman's all right, {{and that he}} wouldn't even run over a stray dog if he could help it. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> not a man among 'em would tie the knot to hang even a Thomas cat that had been tried and {{condemned}} and sentenced according to law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The men {{know you}} have plenty of pluck, Bob; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it was entirely due to your {{swimming}} off to that Spanish ship that we escaped being captured, before; and they will obey you willingly, {{as far as you can}} give them orders. Still, of course, you do want somebody with you, to give orders as to the setting and taking in of the sails." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this the}} faces of the two keepers fell. The brown bear had been in their keeping, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the {{proprietor}} of the circus would hold them responsible for any damage done.|$|R
60|$|It was a skillfully-prepared bait, as he {{intended}} it should be, for he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{the two friends}} were fond of fishing, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he was an authority {{on the subject of}} trout streams.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{previous}} adventures, {{this novel}} was {{unique in that}} Stephen Lane's parents was not away from their New York home during the story, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Stephen <b>and</b> his uncle Richard Duffy would be away.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{not as far}} as THIS HOUSE and {{the lands}} I {{actually}} OCCUPY AND CULTIVATE are concerned; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I am safe {{to fight to the}} last, and carry the case to the Supreme Court in that case, until the swindle is exposed, or they drop it; but I may have to pay them something to keep the squatters off my UNOCCUPIED land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{far short}} of that, I think, but I feel sure our men will do it. They know of the treachery of the Nana, they know of the {{massacre}} by the river, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{the women and children}} are prisoners in his hands, {{and do you think that}} men who know these things can be beaten? The Sepoys met them in superior force and in a strong position at Futtehpore, and they drove them before them like chaff. They will have harder work next time, but I have no shadow of fear of the result." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{you see the}} Genoese {{have got}} a footing in the island, {{and of course they}} {{represent}} us to the natives as being robbers, who would take their island if we got the chance. All round these coasts and islands the people are partisans either of Venice or Genoa. They care very little for Constantinople, although they form part of the empire. Constantinople taxes them heavily, and is too weak to afford them protection. Of course they are Greeks, but the Greeks of the islands have very little in common, beyond their language, with the Greeks of Constantinople. They see, too, that the Turks are increasing in power, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> {{if they are to be}} saved from falling into the hands of the Moslem, it is Venice or Genoa who will protect them, and not Constantinople, who will have enough to do to defend herself.|$|E
60|$|The Saulteaux, of course, {{might have}} also taken {{advantage}} of this circumstance, but {{they could have done}} so only on foot, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> without canoes <b>they</b> could not arrest the progress of the fugitives.|$|R
6000|$|Then a scream, shrill and high, {{rent the}} shuddering sky, [...] <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> some danger was near: [...] The Beaver turned pale {{to the tip}} of its tail, [...] And even the Butcher felt queer.|$|R
5000|$|Voice actor Young Maylay {{stated that}} he was {{influenced}} by his own life when portraying CJ. [...] "development team wanted authentic L.A., that's where I'm from <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> so that's what I gave 'em," [...] he added. [...] "I put Maylay on CJ. I make him as much me as I can, without to [...] much changing of the script." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is why I dream {{dreams and}} talk with spirits, as one day I hope that I shall teach you to do, you whose soul is sister to my soul," [...] replied Noie, her large eyes shining strangely in her {{delicate}} face. [...] "And this of it--the Ghost-people are diviners, they can read the future and see the hearts of men; there are no diviners like them. Therefore chiefs and peoples who dwell far away send to them with great gifts, and pray them come read their fate, but they will seldom listen or obey. Now Dingaan and his councillors are troubled about this matter of the Boers, {{and the meaning of}} the words you spoke as to their waging war on them, and of the omen of the falling star. The council of the doctors can interpret none of these things, nor dare they ask you to do so, since you bade them speak no more to you of that matter, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> if they did, either you would not answer, or, worse still, say words that would displease them." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{reader will}} {{understand}} that it is to the illiberal strictures of a profligate press I now allude; among the London journalists, none (luckily for themselves) have dared to question the veracity of my statements: they know me, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I am IN LONDON. If I can use the pen, I can also wield a more manly and terrible weapon, and would answer their contradictions with my sword! No gold or gems adorn the hilt of that war-worn scimitar; but there is blood upon the blade--the blood of the enemies of my country, and the maligners of my honest fame. There are others, however--the disgrace of a disgraceful trade--who, borrowing from distance a despicable courage, have ventured to assail me. The infamous editors of the Kelso Champion, the Bungay Beacon, the Tipperary Argus, and the Stoke Pogis Sentinel, and other dastardly organs of the provincial press, have, although differing in politics, agreed upon this one point, and with a scoundrelly unanimity, vented a flood of abuse upon the revelations made by me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{keep the}} cordon, {{and watch for}} any signal from the Silent Tower. The Turks will tire before we shall. I {{undertake}} to watch the Turkish warship. During the night I shall run down south, without lights, {{and have a look}} at her, even if I have to wait till the grey of the dawn to do so. She may see us; but if she does I shall crawl away at such pace that she shall not get any idea of our speed. She will certainly come nearer before a day is over, for be sure the bureau of spies is kept advised, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> when the country is awake each day increases the hazard of them and their plans being discovered. From their caution I gather that they do not court discovery; and from that that they do not wish for an open declaration of war. If this be so, why should we not come out to them and force an issue if need be?" ...|$|E
60|$|Utterly worn out, {{the boys}} {{remained}} {{where they were}} until noon of the day which was now dawning. At a great distance, <b>they</b> heard pistol <b>and</b> gun shots, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{some sort of a}} fight must be going on.|$|R
60|$|This {{information}} was received in deep silence--perhaps {{it was the}} silence of despair, for the quantity hitherto served out had been barely sufficient to moisten their parched throats, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not exist long on the reduced allowance.|$|R
60|$|Thus those miserable days went by, and {{the third}} morning came, that dreaded Wednesday. Before it was dawn Benita and her father, neither of whom had closed their eyes that night, talked over their strait long <b>and</b> earnestly, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> its crisis was approaching.|$|R
6000|$|... "They know {{perfectly}} well the case against what they teach, they know it's neither madness nor wickedness nor any great harm, to others not to believe, they know {{perfectly well}} that a man may be as honest as the day, and right--right and decent in every way--and not believe in what they teach. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it only wants the edge off a man's honour, for him to profess anything {{in the way of}} belief. Just anything. And they won't say so. I suppose they want the edge off every man's honour. If a man is well off they will truckle to him no end, though he laughs at all their teaching. They'll take gold plate from company promoters and rent from insanitary houses. But if a man is poor and doesn't profess to believe in what some of them scarcely believe themselves, they wouldn't lift a finger to help him against the ignorance of their followers. Your stepfather was right enough there. They know what's going on. They know that it means lying and humbug for any number of people, and they don't care. Why should they? They've got it down all right. They're spoilt, and why shouldn't we be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The mystery is," [...] {{the elder}} continued, [...] "why they {{should want to}} do it in the way they do it. Are they merely going somewhere and must get there in the {{shortest}} time possible, or are they arriving on a wager? If they are taking a pleasure drive, what a droll idea of pleasure they must have! Maybe they are trying to escape Black Care, but they must know he sits beside the chauffeur as he used to sit behind the horseman, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he has a mortgage in his pocket, and can foreclose it any time on the house they have hypothecated to buy their car. Ah!" [...] The old man started forward with the involuntary impulse of rescue. But it was not one of the people who singly, or in terrorized groups, had been waiting at the roadside to find their way across; it was only a hapless squirrel of those which used to make their way safely among the hoofs and wheels of the kind old cabs and carriages, and it lay instantly crushed under the tire of a motor. [...] "He's done for, poor little wretch! They can't get used to the change. Some day a policeman will pick me up from under a second-hand motor. I wonder what the great Daniel from his pedestal up there would say if he came to judgment." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{engaging}} gentry a Police-constable stands contemplating. His Station, with a Reserve of assistance, is {{very near}} at hand. They cannot pretend to any trade, {{not even to}} be porters or messengers. It would be idle if they did, for he knows them, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he knows them, to be nothing but professed Thieves and Ruffians. He knows where they resort, knows by what slang names they call one another, knows how often {{they have been in}} prison, and how long, and for what. All this is known at his Station, too, and is (or ought to be) known at Scotland Yard, too. But does he know, or does his Station know, or does Scotland Yard know, or does anybody know, why these fellows should be here at liberty, when, as reputed Thieves to whom a whole Division of Police could swear, they might all be under lock and key at hard labour? Not he; truly he would be a wise man if he did! He only knows that these are members of the 'notorious gang,' which, according to the newspaper Police- office reports of this last past September, 'have so long infested' the awful solitudes of the Waterloo Road, and out of which almost impregnable fastnesses the Police have at length dragged Two, to the unspeakable admiration of all good civilians.|$|E
60|$|The king stood {{staring at}} it, {{as if he}} were turned into stone, but the queen {{snatched}} the egg from the otter and crushed it between her two hands. And after that the shadow suddenly shrank and was still, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the giant was dead, because they had found his soul.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a row of}} {{brushwood}} to {{the south}} of the split hickory tree, and in the shelter of this the Morrises moved forward as rapidly as possible. The keen wind cut like a knife, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it was this which had exhausted the old frontiersman they were trying to succor.|$|R
60|$|They were {{in favour}} of peace, for {{two of them were}} his tenants, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the time could not be very far off when Jabez would take the old man's place, {{and it would be a}} serious matter, indeed, to the chapel, were he to be driven from its fold.|$|R
