5|$|The <b>accentors</b> are {{a family}} of small ground-living insectivorous birds, {{most of which are}} found in mountainous {{habitats}} in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All <b>accentors</b> are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian <b>accentors.</b> These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor.|$|E
5|$|Seeds may be {{consumed}} in winter, and the <b>accentors</b> may also then feed near human habitation. Food plants include crowberry, bistort {{and members of}} the aramanth and birch families.|$|E
5|$|Siberian <b>accentors</b> are {{typically}} skulking birds, readily disappearing into cover. They have an above average {{ability to maintain}} their body temperature in cold conditions, an adaptation to their sometimes cold environment.|$|E
50|$|The Altai <b>accentor</b> (Prunella himalayana) is {{a species}} of bird in the Prunellidae family. It {{is also known as}} the rufous-streaked <b>accentor</b> or Himalayan <b>accentor.</b> It breeds in the Altai Mountains of western mongolia; it winters in the {{southern}} Tian Shan and Himalayan ranges.|$|R

5|$|The <b>accentors</b> are in {{the only}} bird family, Prunellidae, which is {{completely}} endemic to the Palearctic. They are small, fairly drab species superficially similar to sparrows.|$|E
5|$|October {{and early}} November 2016 saw an {{unprecedented}} influx of Siberian <b>accentors</b> into western Europe, including provisional first records for Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, {{in some cases}} attracting national attention and hundreds of twitchers.|$|E
50|$|The Arabian <b>accentor</b> or Yemen <b>accentor</b> (Prunella fagani) is {{a species}} of bird in the Prunellidae family. It is endemic to Yemen.|$|R
50|$|The Kozlov's <b>accentor</b> or Mongolian <b>accentor</b> (Prunella koslowi) is {{a species}} of bird in the Prunellidae family. It is found in Mongolia and {{northern}} China.|$|R
5|$|The only {{species that}} can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} the Siberian <b>accentor</b> is the related black-throated <b>accentor,</b> since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian <b>accentor</b> is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.|$|R
5|$|The Siberian accentor {{was first}} {{described}} by Russian-based German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1776 as Motacilla montanella. The <b>accentors</b> {{were moved to}} their current genus by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816.|$|E
5|$|Siberian <b>accentors</b> {{leave the}} north of their {{breeding}} range from mid-September onwards, but may stay for a further month {{or two in the}} south. In spring, returning birds pass through Mongolia from the end of March and south easternmost Russia in April and May, reaching their breeding grounds in May, perhaps as late as June in the far north.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2015, only 32 {{individuals}} {{had been}} recorded in western Europe, {{the majority in}} Finland and Sweden, but in October and early November 2016 at least 232 were reported. Records were from the Czech Republic (1), Denmark (12), Estonia (8), Finland (74), Germany (10), Latvia (9), Lithuania (4), Norway (10), Poland (11), Sweden (74) and the UK (13). The UK Met Office suggested that the influx of <b>accentors</b> was driven by strong and persistent easterly winds from Siberia, partially driven by a high-pressure area centred over Scandinavia. Another weather system produced easterlies in western Asia during the same period.|$|E

5|$|The {{call of the}} Siberian <b>accentor</b> is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese <b>accentor,</b> the dunnock or the black-throated <b>accentor.</b> Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|R
50|$|The Rumbak Valley offers good {{opportunities}} for birdwatching, including several Tibetan species not common {{in other parts}} of India. Birds present here include brown <b>accentor,</b> robin <b>accentor,</b> Tickell's leaf warbler, streaked rosefinch, black-winged snowfinch, chukar, Blyth's swift, red-billed chough, Himalayan snowcock, and the fire-fronted serin.|$|R
5|$|The Siberian accentor has brown upperparts and wings, {{with bright}} {{chestnut}} streaking {{on its back}} and a greyish-brown rump and tail. The head has a dark brown crown and a long, wide pale yellow supercilium ("eyebrow"). All plumages are quite similar. The nest is an open cup in dense shrub or a tree into which the female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. In winter, the <b>accentors</b> may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation.|$|E
60|$|In birds {{there are}} {{a large number of}} {{peculiar}} genera of which we need mention {{only a few of the}} more important, as the grass-hopper warblers (Locustella) with seven species, the <b>Accentors</b> with twelve species, and about a dozen other genera of warblers, including the robins; the bearded titmouse and several allied genera; the long-tailed titmice forming the genus Acredula; the magpies, choughs, and nut-crackers; a host of finches, among which the bullfinches (Pyrrhula) and the buntings (Emberiza) are the {42} most important. The true pheasants (Phasianus) are wholly Palæarctic, except one species in Formosa, as are several genera of wading birds. Though the reptiles of cold countries are few as compared with those of the tropics, the Palæarctic region in its warmer portions has a considerable number, and among these are many which are peculiar to it. Such are four genera of snakes, seven of lizards, five of frogs and toads, and twelve of newts and salamanders; while of fresh-water fishes {{there are a}}bout twenty peculiar genera.[7] Among insects we may mention the elegant Apollo butterflies of the Alps as forming a peculiar genus (Parnassius), only found elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains of North America, while the beautiful genus Thais of the south of Europe and Sericinus of North China are equally remarkable. Among other insects we can only now refer to the great family of Carabidæ, or predaceous ground-beetles, which are immensely numerous in this region, there being about fifty peculiar genera; while the large and handsome genus Carabus, with its allies Procerus and Procrustes, containing nearly 300 species, is almost wholly confined to this region, and would alone serve to distinguish it zoologically from all other parts of the globe.|$|E
50|$|The site {{qualifies as}} an IBA because it {{supports}} {{significant numbers of}} the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include Himalayan snowcocks, common mergansers, saker falcons, Pallas's fish-eagles, cinereous vultures, ibisbills, pale-backed pigeons, yellow-billed choughs, Hume's larks, sulphur-bellied warblers, wallcreepers, white-winged redstarts, alpine <b>accentors,</b> rufous-streaked <b>accentors,</b> brown <b>accentors,</b> water pipits, crimson-winged finches and red-mantled rosefinches.|$|E

50|$|Adults {{undergo a}} {{complete}} moult between July and September after breeding has finished.

The Siberian <b>accentor</b> is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.|$|R
5000|$|Harrison [...] {{used the}} group name dunnock {{for all of}} the species, not just Prunella modularis (thus e.g. Japanese dunnock for P. rubida); this usage is based on the oldest known name for any of the species (old English dun-, brown, + -ock, small: [...] "little brown bird"). <b>Accentor</b> derives from the old {{scientific}} name for the Alpine <b>accentor</b> (<b>Accentor</b> collaris).
