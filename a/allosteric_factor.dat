40|$|Sensing {{extracellular}} changes initiates {{signal transduction}} {{and is the}} first stage of cellular decision-making. Yet relatively little is known about why one form of sensing biochemistry has been selected over another. To gain insight into this question, we studied the sensing characteristics of one of the biochemically simplest of sensors: the <b>allosteric</b> transcription <b>factor.</b> Such proteins, common in microbes, directly transduce the detection of a sensed molecule to changes in gene regulation. Using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model, we determined six sensing characteristics – the dynamic range, the Hill number, the intrinsic noise, the information transfer capacity, the static gain, and the mean response time – {{as a function of the}} biochemical parameters of individual sensors and of the number of sensors. We found that specifying one characteristic strongly constrains others. For example, a high dynamic range implies a high Hill number and a high capacity, and vice versa. Perhaps surprisingly, these constraints are so strong that most of the space of characteristics is inaccessible given biophysically plausible ranges of parameter values. Within our approximations, we can calculate the probability distribution of the numbers of input molecules that maximizes information transfer and show that a population of one hundred <b>allosteric</b> transcription <b>factors</b> can in principle distinguish between more than four bands of input concentrations. Our results imply that allosteric sensors are unlikely to have been selected for high performance in one sensing characteristic but for a compromise in the performance of many...|$|R

The variety of effectors has contributed in making aTFs the most used input system in synthetic biological circuits. Considering their enabling role in biotechnology, an important question concerns the size of the chemical space that can potentially be detected by these biosensors. From digging into the ever changing repertoire of natural regulatory circuits, to advances in aTF engineering, we review here different strategies that are pushing the boundaries of this chemical space. We also review natural and synthetic cases of indirect sensing, where aTFs work in combination with metabolism to enable detection of new molecules...|$|R
40|$|Lipidated Rho and Rab GTP-binding {{proteins}} are transported between membranes {{in complex}} with solubilizing factors called ‘guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors’ (GDIs). Unloading from GDIs using GDI displacement factors (GDFs) {{has been proposed}} but remains mechanistically elusive. PDEd is a putative solubilizing factor for several prenylated Ras-subfamily proteins. Here we report the structure of fully modified farnesylated Rheb-GDP in complex with PDEd. The structure explains the nucleotide-independent binding of Rheb to PDEd and the relaxed specificity of PDEd. We demonstrate that the G proteins Arl 2 and Arl 3 act in a GTP-dependent manner as <b>allosteric</b> release <b>factors</b> for farnesylated cargo. We thus describe a new transport system for farnesylated G proteins involving a GDI-like molecule and an unequivocal GDF. Considering the importance of PDEd for proper Ras and Rheb signaling, this study is instrumental in developing a new target for anticancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|Allosteric {{molecules}} {{serve as}} regulators of cellular activity across all domains of life. We present a {{general theory of}} allosteric transcriptional regulation that permits quantitative predictions for how physiological responses are tuned to environmental stimuli. To test the model's predictive power, we apply it to the specific case of the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria. We measure the fold-change in gene expression at different inducer concentrations {{in a collection of}} strains that span a range of repressor copy numbers and operator binding strengths. After inferring the inducer dissociation constants using data from one of these strains, we show the broad reach of the model by predicting the induction profiles of all other strains. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of <b>allosteric</b> transcription <b>factors</b> which enables us to collapse the data from all of our experiments onto a single master curve, capturing the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles...|$|R
40|$|Ataxin- 3, {{the protein}} {{responsible}} for spinocerebellar ataxia type- 3, is a cysteine protease that specifically cleaves poly-ubiquitin chains and {{participates in the}} ubiquitin proteasome pathway. The enzymatic activity resides in the N-terminal Josephin domain. An unusual feature of ataxin- 3 is its low enzymatic activity especially for mono-ubiquitinated substrates and short ubiquitin chains. However, specific ubiquitination at lysine 117 in the Josephin domain activates ataxin- 3 through an unknown mechanism. Here, we investigate the effects of K 117 ubiquitination on the structure and enzymatic activity of the protein. We show that covalently linked ubiquitin rests on the Josephin domain, forming a compact globular moiety and occupying a ubiquitin binding site previously thought to be essential for substrate recognition. In doing so, ubiquitination enhances enzymatic activity by locking the enzyme in an activated state. Our results indicate that ubiquitin functions both as a substrate and as an <b>allosteric</b> regulatory <b>factor.</b> We provide a novel example in which a conformational switch controls the activity of an enzyme that mediates deubiquitination...|$|R
40|$|Genetically-encoded biosensors offer a {{wide range}} of {{opportunities}} to develop advanced synthetic biology applications. Circuits with the ability of detecting and quantifying intracellular amounts of a compound of interest are central to whole-cell biosensors design formedical and environmental applications, and they also constitute essential parts for the selection and regulation of high-producer strains in metabolic engineering. However, the number of compounds that can be detected through natural mechanisms, like <b>allosteric</b> transcription <b>factors,</b> is limited; expanding the set of detectable compounds is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present the SensiPath web server, accessible at [URL] implements a strategy to enlarge the set of detectable compounds by screening for multi-step enzymatic transformations converting non-detectable compounds into detectable ones. The SensiPath approach is based on the encoding of reactions through signature descriptors to explore sensing-enabling metabolic pathways, which are putative biochemical transformations of the target compound leading to known effectors of transcription factors. In that way, SensiPath enlarges the design space by broadening the potential use of biosensors in synthetic biology applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} duality {{concerning the}} role of intracellular Ca 2 + ions is observed. At one side Ca 2 + is a universal secondary messenger, and {{at the other side}} a prolonged increase of the Ca 2 + concentration will lead to pathological conditions. This is the reason that Ca 2 + signals occur in complex spatio-temporal patterns such as waves and oscillations. This behaviour reflects the existence of a fundamental heterogeneity {{at the level of the}} molecular and functional parameters that regulate the Ca 2 + fluctuations. The molecular basis of the complex Ca 2 + signals is the regenerative character of the inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP 3 R) responsible for the release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. In this work, we describe the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the expression of the InsP 3 R isoforms in various cell types. It appeared that there exist at least 5 different isoforms and that the isoforms of type II, IV and the newly described receptor of type V form a sub-family. The type I receptors are ubiquitous, but most cell types express in addition one or more isoforms. In the second part of this work, we describe the functional heterogeneity that results from the interaction of the InsP 3 R with InsP 3 as well as with <b>allosteric</b> <b>factors.</b> In this study we demonstrate that the InsP 3 R isoforms show remarkable differences with respect to their sensitivity for InsP 3. An extremely important modulator of the InsP 3 R is the Ca 2 + ion itself. Cytosolic Ca 2 + has a stimulatory as well as an inhibitory role. The Ca 2 + present in the lumen of the store is also an important regulator of the InsP 3 R. In the third part of this work we have made a correlation between the observed molecular and functional heterogeneity and the fundamental physiological properties of complex Ca 2 + signals, like quantal release, Ca 2 + oscillations and Ca 2 + waves. Both the isoform diversity and the regulation of the InsP 3 R by cytosolic and luminal Ca 2 + are necessary for the fine-tuning of the Ca 2 + signals. The isoform diversity may also play a role in the origin of asymmetrical signals present in polarised cells and in the InsP 3 -dependent signals through the plasma membrane and through the perinuclear membrane. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{notion of}} {{allostery}} introduced for proteins about {{fifty years ago}} has been extended since then to DNA allostery, where a locally triggered DNA structural transition remotely controls other DNA-binding events. We further extend this notion and propose that chromatin fiber allosteric transitions, induced by histone-tail covalent modifications, may {{play a key role}} in transcriptional regulation. We present an integrated scenario articulating allosteric mechanisms at different scales: allosteric transitions of the condensed chromatin fiber induced by histone-tail acetylation modify the mechanical constraints experienced by the embedded DNA, thus possibly controlling DNA-binding of <b>allosteric</b> transcription <b>factors</b> or further <b>allosteric</b> mechanisms at the linker DNA level. At a higher scale, different epigenetic constraints delineate different statistically dominant subsets of accessible chromatin fiber conformations, which each favors the assembly of dedicated regulatory complexes, as detailed on the emblematic example of the mouse Igf 2 -H 19 gene locus and its parental imprinting. This physical view offers a mechanistic and spatially structured explanation of the observed correlation between transcriptional activity and histone modifications. The evolutionary origin of allosteric control supports to speak of an 'epigenetic code', by which events involved in transcriptional regulation are encoded in histone modifications in a context-dependent way...|$|R
40|$|Two new {{conjugated}} porphyrin-based systems (dimers 3 and 4) {{endowed with}} suitable crown ethers have been synthesized as receptors for a fullerene-ammonium salt derivative (1). Association constants in solution have been determined by UVvis titration experiments in CH 2 Cl 2 at room temperature. The designed hosts {{are able to}} associate up to two fullerene-based guest molecules and present association constants as high as  5 × 108 M‒ 1. Calculation of the <b>allosteric</b> cooperative <b>factor</b>  for supramolecular complexes [3 · 12] and [4 · 12] showed a negative cooperative effect in both cases. The interactions accounting {{for the formation of}} the associates are based, firstly, on the complementary ammonium-crown ether interaction and, secondly, on the π−π interactions between the porphyrin rings and the C 60 moieties. Theoretical calculations have evidenced a significant decrease of the electron density in the porphyrin dimers 3 and 4 upon complexation of the first C 60 molecule, in good agreement with the negative cooperativity found in these systems. This negative effect is partially compensated by the stabilizing C 60 -C 60 interactions that take place in the more stable syn-disposition of [4 · 12]...|$|R
40|$|The biotin {{regulatory}} system of Escherichia coli {{serves as a}} model for investigating the regulatory mechanism of a non-classical <b>allosteric</b> transcription <b>factor.</b> The central protein, BirA, functions as both an essential metabolic enzyme in biotin retention and as a repressor of transcription initiation. In its repressor function, two BirA monomers bind a 40 -base pair palindromic DNA sequence thereby blocking transcription initiation at the two divergent overlapping promoters of the biotin biosynthetic operon. Binding of the small molecule corepressor, biotinyl- 5 ’-AMP, promotes the assembly of the transcription repression complex by driving the self-association of the repressor. Here, the effects of binding of four corepressors on the self-association and DNA binding properties of BirA have been measured utilizing sedimentation equilibrium and DNaseI footprinting analyses. The results {{of this study indicate that}} biotinyl- 5 ’-AMP and an ester analog, biotinol-AMP, are strong allosteric activators of BirA dimerization. The enhancement observed in the energetics of DNA binding closely matches with the enhancement of self-assembly of the repressor. Biotin and a sulfamoyl corepressor analog are weak allosteric effectors of BirA dimerization. Binding of the weak effectors, results in an uncoupling o...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPlectin is {{a widely}} {{expressed}} cytoskeletal linker. Here we report the crystal structure of the actin binding domain of plectin and show that this region is sufficient for interaction with F-actin or the cytoplasmic region of integrin α 6 β 4. The structure is formed by two calponin homology domains arranged in a closed conformation. We show that binding to F-actin induces a conformational change in plectin that is inhibited by an engineered interdomain disulfide bridge. A two-step induced fit mechanism involving binding and subsequent domain rearrangement is proposed. In contrast, interaction with integrin α 6 β 4 occurs in a closed conformation. Competitive binding of plectin to F-actin and integrin α 6 β 4 may rely on the observed alternative binding mechanisms and involve both <b>allosteric</b> and steric <b>factors...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{recently}} introduced sulfated pentagalloylglucopyr-anoside (SPGG) as an <b>allosteric</b> inhibitor of <b>factor</b> XIa (FXIa) (Al-Horani et al., J. Med Chem. 2013, 56, 867 − 878). To {{better understand the}} SPGG−FXIa interaction, we utilized eight SPGG variants {{and a range of}} biochemical techniques. The results reveal that SPGG’s sulfation level moderately affected FXIa inhibition potency and selectivity over thrombin and factor Xa. Variation in the anomeric configuration did not affect potency. Interestingly, zymogen factor XI bound SPGG with high affinity, suggesting its possible use as an antidote. Acrylamide quenching experiments suggested that SPGG induced significant conformational changes in the active site of FXIa. Inhibition studies in the presence of heparin showed marginal competition with highly sulfated SPGG variants but robust competition with less sulfated variants. Resolution of energetic contributions revealed that nonionic forces contribute nearly 87 % of binding energy suggesting a strong possibility of specific interaction. Overall, the results indicate that SPGG may recognize more than on...|$|R

40|$|The cyclic AMP {{receptor}} protein (CRP, {{also called}} {{catabolite gene activator protein}} or CAP) {{plays a key}} role in metabolic regulation in bacteria and has become a widely studied model <b>allosteric</b> transcription <b>factor.</b> On binding its effector cAMP in the N-terminal domain, CRP undergoes a structural transition to a conformation capable of specific DNA binding in the C-terminal domain and transcription initiation. The crystal structures of Escherichia coli CRP (EcCRP) in the cAMP-bound state, both with and without DNA, are known, although its structure in the off state (cAMP-free, apoCRP) remains unknown. We describe the crystal structure at 2. 0 Å resolution of the cAMP-free CRP homodimer from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv (MtbCRP), whose sequence is 30 % identical with EcCRP, as the first reported structure of an off-state CRP. The overall structure is similar to that seen for the cAMP-bound EcCRP, but the apo MtbCRP homodimer displays a unique level of asymmetry, with a root mean square deviation of 3. 5 Å between all Cα positions in the two subunits. Unlike structures of on-state EcCRP and other homologs in which the C-domains are asymmetrically positioned but possess the same internal conformation, the two C-domains of apo MtbCRP differ both in hinge structure and in internal arrangement, with numerous residues that have completely different local environments and hydrogen bond interactions, especially in the hinge and DNA-binding regions. Comparison of the structures of apo MtbCRP and DNA-bound EcCRP shows how DNA binding would be inhibited in the absence of cAMP and supports a mechanism involving functional asymmetry in apoCRP...|$|R
40|$|<b>Allosteric</b> {{transcription}} <b>factors</b> undergo binding events both {{at their}} inducer binding sites {{as well as}} at distinct DNA binding domains, and {{it is often difficult to}} disentangle the structural and functional consequences of these two classes of interactions. In this work, we compare the ability of two statistical mechanical models - the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) and the Koshland-Némethy-Filmer (KNF) models of protein conformational change - to characterize the multi-step activation mechanism of the broadly acting cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP). We first consider the allosteric transition resulting from cyclic-AMP binding to CRP, then analyze how CRP binds to its operator, and finally investigate the ability of CRP to activate gene expression. In light of these models, we examine data from a beautiful recent experiment that created a single-chain version of the CRP homodimer, thereby enabling each subunit to be mutated separately. Using this construct, six mutants were created using all possible combinations of the wild type subunit, a D 53 H mutant subunit, and an S 62 F mutant subunit. We demonstrate that both the MWC and KNF models can explain the behavior of all six mutants using a small, self-consistent set of parameters. In comparing the results, we find that the MWC model slightly outperforms the KNF model in the quality of its fits, but more importantly the parameters inferred by the MWC model are more in line with structural knowledge of CRP. In addition, we discuss how the conceptual framework developed here for CRP enables us to not merely analyze data retrospectively, but has the predictive power to determine how combinations of mutations will interact, how double mutants will behave, and how each construct would regulate gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{topology}} {{defined by}} the matrix of residue contacts {{has proved to be}} a fruitful basis for the study of protein dynamics. The widely implemented coarse-grained elastic network model of backbone fluctuations has been used to describe crystallographic temperature <b>factors,</b> <b>allosteric</b> couplings, and some aspects of the folding pathway. In the present study, we develop a model of protein dynamics based on the classical equations of motion of a damped network model (DNM) that describes the folding path from a completely unfolded state to the native conformation through a single-well potential derived purely from the native conformation. The kinetic energy gained through the collapse of the protein chain is dissipated through a friction term in the equations of motion that models the water bath. This approach is completely general and sufficiently fast that it can be applied to large proteins. Folding pathways for various proteins of different classes are described and shown to correlate with experimental observations and molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. Allosteric transitions between alternative protein structures are also modeled within the DNM through an asymmetric double-well potential...|$|R
40|$|High conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated {{potassium}} (BK) {{channels are}} widely expressed in mammals. In some tissues, the biophysical properties of BK channels are highly affected by coexpression of regulatory (beta) subunits. beta 1 and beta 2 subunits increase apparent channel calcium sensitivity. The beta 1 subunit also decreases the voltage {{sensitivity of the}} channel and the beta 2 subunit produces an N-type inactivation of BK currents. We further characterized {{the effects of the}} beta 1 and beta 2 subunits on the calcium and voltage sensitivity of the channel, analyzing the data {{in the context of an}} allosteric model for BK channel activation by calcium and voltage (Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002). In this study, we used a beta 2 subunit without its N-type inactivation domain (beta 2 IR). The results indicate that the beta 2 IR subunit, like the beta 1 subunit, has a small effect on the calcium binding affinity of the channel. Unlike the beta 1 subunit, the beta 2 IR subunit also has no effect on the voltage sensitivity of the channel. The limiting voltage dependence for steady-state channel activation, unrelated to voltage sensor movements, is unaffected by any of the studied beta subunits. The same is observed for the limiting voltage dependence of the deactivation time constant. Thus, the beta 1 subunit must affect the voltage sensitivity by altering the function of the voltage sensors of the channel. Both beta subunits reduce the intrinsic equilibrium constant for channel opening (L- 0). In the allosteric activation model, the reduction of the voltage dependence for the activation of the voltage sensors accounts for most of the macroscopic steady-state effects of the beta 1 subunit, including the increase of the apparent calcium sensitivity of the BK channel. All <b>allosteric</b> coupling <b>factors</b> need to be increased in order to explain the observed effects when the alpha subunit is coexpressed with the beta 2 IR subunit...|$|R

Shifts in the ligand affinity of deoxy Hb and the values for 50 % ligand saturation (p 50) were obtained from oxygen equilibrium data. Because the high-affinity parameters (liganded conformation) are poorly determined from the equilibrium curves, they were determined from kinetic measurements of the association and dissociation rates with CO as ligand. The CO on-rates were obtained by flash photolysis measurements. The off-rates were determined from the rate of oxidation of HbCO by ferricyanide, or by replacement of CO with NO. The partition function of fully liganded hemoglobin for oxygen and CO is only slightly changed by the effectors. Measurements were made {{in the presence of the}} effectors 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate (DPG), inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP), bezafibrate (Bzf), and two recently synthesized derivatives of Bzf (LR 16 and L 35). Values of p 50 change by over a factor of 60; the on-rates decrease by nearly a factor of 8, with little change in the off-rates for the liganded conformation.

On injury, factor VIIa forms a complex with its <b>allosteric</b> regulator, tissue <b>factor,</b> and initiates blood clotting. Although the structure of the binary complex has already been determined [Banner, D. W., D’Arcy, A., Chène, C., Winkler, F. K., Guha, A., Konigsberg, W. H., Nemerson, Y. & Kirchhofer, D. (1996) Nature (London) 380, 41 – 46], the conformational effects of cofactor binding to factor VIIa are not known in detail because of a lack of structural information on free factor VIIa. Here we report the structure of γ-carboxyglutamic acid-domainless human coagulation factor VIIa at a resolution of 2. 8 Å. The molecule adopts an extended conformation within the crystal similar to that previously observed for the full-length protein in complex with tissue factor. Detailed comparison of free and tissue factor-bound factor VIIa reveals several structural differences. The binding mode of the active-site inhibitor d-Phe-Phe-Arg methyl ketone differs in the two structures, suggesting a role for the cofactor in substrate recognition. More importantly, a surface-exposed α-helix in the protease domain (residues 307 – 312), which is located at the cofactor recognition site, is distorted in the free form of factor VIIa. This subtle structural difference sheds light on the mechanism of the dramatic tissue factor-induced enhancement of factor VIIa activity...|$|R

Binding of the small molecule corepressor, biotinyl- 5 '-AMP, promotes the assembly of the transcription repression complex by driving the self-association of the repressor. Here, the effects of binding of four corepressors on the self-association and DNA binding properties of BirA have been measured utilizing sedimentation equilibrium and DNaseI footprinting analyses. The results {{of this study indicate that}} biotinyl- 5 '-AMP and an ester analog, biotinol-AMP, are strong allosteric activators of BirA dimerization. The enhancement observed in the energetics of DNA binding closely matches with the enhancement of self-assembly of the repressor. Biotin and a sulfamoyl corepressor analog are weak allosteric effectors of BirA dimerization. Binding of the weak effectors, results in an uncoupling of the self-association and DNA binding processes. A detailed thermodynamic investigation of the effector binding process was performed utilizing isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding of all four corepressors to BirA is an enthalpically driven process. However, the higher affinities for binding of the strong effectors are characterized by a relatively moderate binding enthalpy and a favorable entropic term. Whereas binding of the weak effectors is comprised of a much larger enthalpic contribution and is entropically opposed. Heat capacity changes for binding of the four effectors to BirA were determined by measuring the temperature dependence of the binding enthalpy. Results of the analysis indicate that a negative heat capacity change is associated with binding of each effector. No correlation is observed between the magnitude of the heat capacity change and the magnitude of the effect the corepressor has on the self-assembly of BirA. Finally, conditions were identified and utilized for the crystaliztion of BirAbiotinol-AMP. The crystals obtained are currently being analyzed by X-ray diffraction in a collaborative effort...|$|R

Our approach aims at an antibody-mediated induction of coagulation in tumour nodules to cut off their blood supply. As a target structure the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is used, which is specifically and abundantly expressed on the activated fibroblasts of the tumour stroma. We constructed a fusion protein comprising a single-chain module of a FAP-specific humanized antibody [single-chain fragment variable (scFv) OS 4] and the extracellular domain of human tissue factor. The fusion protein, designated TFOS 4, was produced in the Proteus mirabilis protoplast expression system with a yield of 15 microg/ml. Biochemical characterization of TFOS 4 revealed high-affinity binding to cellular FAP. Further, TFOS 4 bound to factor VIIa and also exerted <b>allosteric</b> activation of <b>factor</b> VIIa. A complex of TFOS 4 and factor VIIa bound to FAP-expressing cells efficiently generated activated factor X. Finally, cell-bound TFOS 4 selectively induced plasma coagulation, implying its activity under physiological conditions, notably with relevant concentrations of coagulation factors and their natural inhibitors. These findings suggest that TFOS 4 has the potential to increase the procoagulant state in a cell-type-specific fashion.

The mutation of IP 7 was shown to be of the nonsense type by the following data: (1) reversion to isoleucine prototrophy involves the formation of external suppression at a high frequency, as shown by transduction experiments; and (ii) the isoleucine requirement is suppressed by lysogenization with a phage carrying the amber suppressor su- 3. Cell extracts of the mutant strain contain a low activity of threonine deaminase. The possibility that this activity is biodegradative was ruled out by kinetic experiments. The mutant threonine deaminase was purified to homogeneity by conventional procedures. The enzyme is a dimer of identical subunits of an approximate molecular weight of 43, 000 (Grimminger and Feldner, 1974), whereas the wild-type enzyme is a tetramer of 50, 000 -dalton subunits (Calhoun et al., 1973; Grimminger et al., 1973). The mutant enzyme is not inhibited by isoleucine and does not bind isoleucine, as shown by equilibrium dialysis experiments. Pyridoxal phosphate enhances the maximum catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme by a factor of five, whereas the wild-type enzyme is not affected. In wild-type and mutant threonine deaminase the ratio of protein subunits and bound pyridoxal phosphate is 2 : 1. The activation of threonine deaminase from strain IP 7 is due to a second coenzyme binding site, as shown by (i) spectrophotometric titration of the enzyme with pyridoxal phosphate and by (ii) measurement the pyridoxal phosphate content of the enzyme after sodium borohydride reduction of the protein. The observation of one pyridoxal phosphate binding site per peptide dimer in the wild-type enzyme and of two binding sites per dimer in the mutant strongly suggests that one of the potential sites in the wild-type enzyme is masked by <b>allosteric</b> effects.
