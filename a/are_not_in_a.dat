The density of this interstitial packing depends sensitively on the radius ratio, but in the limit of extreme size ratios, the smaller spheres can fill the gaps with the same density as the larger spheres filled space. Even if the large spheres <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> close-packed arrangement, it is always possible to insert some smaller spheres of up to 0.29099 of the radius of the larger sphere.|$|E

He looks for a gift with George but is unable to think of anything, though he vaguely remembers her saying [...] "something about a bench". Elaine is unhappy with the eventual gift: $182 cash. When Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) gives Elaine the bench she was looking for, for which she is much more grateful, she and Jerry talk over their agreement. They decide to start dating. When Kramer sees them again and asks what they are up to, Jerry notes that they now do [...] "this, that and the other," [...] "the other" [...] being their romantic relationship as a couple.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to public concerns that their diamond purchases were contributing {{to war and}} human rights abuses in central and western Africa, the United Nations, the diamond industry and diamond-trading nations introduced the Kimberley Process in 2002. The Kimberley Process aims to ensure that conflict diamonds do not become intermixed with the diamonds not controlled by such rebel groups. This is done by requiring diamond-producing countries to provide proof that the money they make from selling the diamonds is not used to fund criminal or revolutionary activities. Although the Kimberley Process has been moderately successful in {{limiting the number of}} conflict diamonds entering the market, some still find their way in. According to the International Diamond Manufacturers Association, conflict diamonds constitute 2–3% of all diamonds traded. Two major flaws still hinder the effectiveness of the Kimberley Process: (1) the relative ease of smuggling diamonds across African borders, and (2) the violent nature of diamond mining in nations that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> technical state of war and whose diamonds are therefore considered [...] "clean".|$|E
500|$|Most of Bolliger & Mabillard's {{roller coaster}} trains use four-abreast seating. Each car has one row of four seats, while the train length can vary between coasters. All of the company's coaster models, except the Dive Coaster and Wing Coaster use this configuration. The Dive Coaster uses six, eight or ten-abreast seating, {{with two or}} three rows of seats. For example, Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, uses ten seats in three rows, while Krake at Heide Park uses six-across seating in three rows. On recent hyper coaster projects, B has used a new car design that has two rows of two seats; the two seats {{in the rear of the}} car pushed out from the {{centerline}} so that the four seats resemble a V formation. This formation has only been used on Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, Diamondback at Kings Island, Intimidator at Carowinds and [...] at PortAventura. In 2013, B introduced a new car design that has two rows of two seats, however, they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> V formation.|$|E
