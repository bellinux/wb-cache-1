40|$|This {{addendum}} updates Fox and Tracy’s (1980) {{summary of}} work on the randomized response technique (RRT). It notes the recent development of an <b>additive</b> <b>constants</b> model for sensitive questions that require a numerical response. It further calls the reader’s attention {{to the possibility of}} correlational research using RRT models by presenting the derivation of the correlation and correction for attentuation between two variables measured by the <b>additive</b> <b>constants</b> model and by noting a paper that does the same for several other RRT models. G and Tracy (1980) recently provided readers of this journal-A with an excellent introductory summary of the randomized response technique (RRT) with particular emphasis on its applicability to criminal justice research. The purpose of this note is to call the attention of readers to more recent developments in the randomized response technique not covered in the Fox and Tracy review. Himmelfarb and Edgell (1980) independently developed an <b>additive</b> <b>constants</b> RRT model for use on questions requiring a numerical response. While the <b>additive</b> <b>constants</b> model was anticipated earlier by Warner (1971) and by Pollock and Bek (1976), the model receives its most extensive development together with suggestions on the applicability and implementation of special cases in Himmelfarb an...|$|R

25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary <b>additive</b> <b>constant</b> with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E
2500|$|For an {{analytic}} function in upper half-plane, the Hilbert transform describes {{the relationship between}} the real part and the imaginary part of the boundary values. [...] That is, if f(z) is analytic in the plane Im z>0 and u(t) = Ref(t+0·i) then [...] Imf(t+0·i) = H(u)(t) up to an <b>additive</b> <b>constant,</b> provided this Hilbert transform exists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{absolute}} entropy ( [...] {{rather than}} [...] ) was defined later, using either statistical mechanics or the third law of thermodynamics, an otherwise arbitrary <b>additive</b> <b>constant</b> is fixed {{such that the}} entropy of a pure substance at absolute zero is zero.

A class of rules for choosing the <b>additive</b> <b>constants</b> is given sufficient to guarantee the convergence of the PIA, as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for a policy to have the property that the PIA can converge to it for any relative value vector.

2500|$|The {{operator}} [...] {{enters the}} theory as the Hamiltonian, modulo an <b>additive</b> <b>constant.</b> Moreover, the Virasoro operators {{enter into the}} definition of the Lorentz generators of the theory. It is perhaps the most important algebra in string theory. The consistency of the Lorentz generators, by the way, fixes the spacetime dimensionality to 26. While this theory presented here (for relative simplicity of exposition) is unphysical, {{or at the very least}} incomplete (it has, for instance, no fermions) the Virasoro algebra arises in the same way in the more viable superstring theory and M-theory.|$|E
2500|$|The theorem says that, among {{algorithms}} that decode strings {{from their}} descriptions (codes), there exists an optimal one. This algorithm, for all strings, allows codes {{as short as}} allowed by any other algorithm up to an <b>additive</b> <b>constant</b> {{that depends on the}} algorithms, but not on the strings themselves. Solomonoff used this algorithm, and the code lengths it allows, to define a [...] "universal probability" [...] of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based. Kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings, including complexity, randomness, and information.|$|E
2500|$|In {{classical}} statistical mechanics, {{the number}} of microstates is actually uncountably infinite, since the properties of classical systems are continuous. For example, a microstate of a classical ideal gas is specified by the positions and momenta of all the atoms, which range continuously over the real numbers. If we want to define Ω, {{we have to come}} up with a method of grouping the microstates together to obtain a countable set. This procedure is known as coarse graining. In the case of the ideal gas, we count two states of an atom as the [...] "same" [...] state if their positions and momenta are within δx and δp of each other. Since the values of δx and δp can be chosen arbitrarily, the entropy is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an <b>additive</b> <b>constant.</b> (As we will see, the thermodynamic definition of entropy is also defined only up to a constant.) ...|$|E
