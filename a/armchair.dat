5|$|Longfellow often {{wrote in}} his first-floor study, {{formerly}} Washington's office, surrounded by portraits of his friends, including charcoal portraits by Eastman Johnson of Charles Sumner, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Cornelius Conway Felton.

50|$|In {{the dining}} room, the {{elliptical}} table, matching {{the shape of}} the room, is made of mahogany; it has four animal-paw feet and six leaves. The other pieces commissioned included, among others, 14 <b>armchairs</b> in the French Restoration style. It was uncommon to have <b>armchairs</b> at a dining table—usually there were <b>armchairs</b> only at the head and foot of the table, the others being side chairs.|$|R
50|$|Surprisingly, Italian <b>armchairs</b> {{during the}} Neoclassical period made {{a return to}} the Baroque style, with heavy and bulky {{straight}} legs and sculptural carvings. They were usually quite bold, and Venetian and Genoese ones were often gilded, whilst Milanese <b>armchairs</b> were mainly left untouched.|$|R

5|$|Written by Robert Banks Stewart as a six-part story, {{the story}} was {{commissioned}} in May 1976. This story was replaced by The Talons of Weng-Chiang, which used the same basic premise of a villain traveling back in time, when Stewart took up the post of script editor on the series <b>Armchair</b> Thriller {{and was unable to}} deliver the scripts. It was later adapted by John Dorney for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in January 2012.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the <b>armchair.</b> As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 he and Kenneth Adam {{initiated}} the new anthology series The Wednesday Play, a BBC equivalent of <b>Armchair</b> Theatre, which had great success and critical acclaim with plays {{written and directed}} by the likes of Dennis Potter, Jeremy Sandford and Ken Loach. The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions, such as Cathy Come Home, a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script, which dealt with the issue of homelessness. There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his <b>armchair,</b> if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E
5|$|The Flood {{have been}} {{featured}} in four series of Halo action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle. Halo2s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of <b>Armchair</b> Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail of the Flood. The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E

5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the <b>armchair,</b> she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

Returning to London, she joined ABC Television {{as a story}} editor on the anthology series <b>Armchair</b> Theatre, under producer Sydney Newman in 1960.
