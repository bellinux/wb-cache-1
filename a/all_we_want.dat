25|$|On 1 January Derby told Haig that {{he saved}} Robertson from the sack by {{threatening}} resignation. He also hinted to Haig {{that the government}} wanted the removal of Launcelot Kiggell (“a tired man”) as BEF Chief of Staff, and that General Butler, Haig’s preferred choice, was not acceptable. Haig had {{an interview with the}} King (2 January) to pick up his Field Marshal’s baton. Haig appears to have been placing too much faith in recent German peace feelers ("Germany is now ready, we are told, to give <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> in these respects"), now known not have been seriously intended. He told the King that British soldiers (who, in a large conscript army, now included men from “all classes in the nation, and many are most intelligent”) needed to be told what they were fighting for. In Haig’s view, Britain should keep to her original war aims - the defence of France and liberation of Belgium - not try to gain Alsace-Lorraine for France or Trieste for Italy. In Haig's view the “democratising of Germany”, about to be publicly reiterated by Lloyd George as a British aspiration in his Caxton Hall speech (5 January), was likely to destabilise Germany, as the fall of the Tsar in March 1917 had destabilised Russia, and was not “worth the loss of an Englishman” (like many Scots of his era, Haig often referred to Britain or even the British Empire as “England”).|$|E

Commenting about her style, she told biographer Gerald Nachman, [...] "Maybe I started it. We're a very gossipy culture. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to know now is private lives." ...|$|E

We were very surprised to find that it was seen as a deliberate attempt to scare away newly created fans. That would have been an extremely foolish thing to do." ...|$|R
