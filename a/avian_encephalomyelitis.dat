We now provide evidence that the 494 -nucleotide-long 5 ' untranslated region of the AEV genome contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element that functions efficiently in vitro and in mammalian cells.

Furthermore, mutational analysis of the predicted pseudoknot structure at the 3 ' end of the AEV IRES lends support to the secondary structure we present.

The mechanism of translation initiation on hepacivirus/pestivirus (HP) IRESs, which involves factor-independent binding to ribosomal 40 S subunits, also differs fundamentally from initiation on these picornavirus IRESs. Ribosomal binding to HP IRESs requires conserved sequences that form a pseudoknot and the adjacent IIId and IIIe domains; analogous elements do not occur in the two principal groups of picornavirus IRESs.

40|$|AbstractMitochondrial {{membrane}} permeabilization (MMP) is {{a critical}} step regulating apoptosis. Viruses have evolved multiple strategies to modulate apoptosis for their own benefit. Thus, many viruses code for proteins that act on mitochondria and control apoptosis of infected cells. Viral proapoptotic proteins translocate to mitochondrial membranes and induce MMP, which is often accompanied by mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation. From a structural point of view, all the viral proapoptotic proteins discovered so far contain amphipathic α-helices that are necessary for the proapoptotic effects and seem to have pore-forming properties, {{as it has been}} shown for Vpr from human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) and HBx from hepatitis B virus (HBV). In contrast, antiapoptotic viral proteins (e. g., M 11 L from myxoma virus, F 1 L from vaccinia virus and BHRF 1 from Epstein–Barr virus) contain mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) in their C-terminus that are homologous to tail-anchoring domains. These domains are similar to those present in many proteins of the Bcl- 2 family and are responsible for inserting the protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane leaving the N-terminus of the protein facing the cytosol. The antiapoptotic proteins K 7 and K 15 from <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus (AEV) and viral mitochondria inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA) from cytomegalovirus are capable of binding host-specific apoptosis-modulatory proteins such as Bax, Bcl- 2, activated caspase 3, CAML, CIDE-B and HAX.

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{disease with}} severe {{neurologic}} symptoms caused 100 % mortality {{in a small}} broiler operation in the Gauteng Province, South Africa in late March 2013. Routine diagnostic PCR testing failed to identify a possible cause of the outbreak; thus, samples were submitted for virus isolation, serology, and bacteriology. An avirulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain isolated {{was identified as a}} V 4 -like genotype 1 strain, by DNA sequencing, with a cleavage site of 112 GKQGRQL 117. Real-time reverse transcription PCR identified NDV in the brain but not in cecal tonsils or pooled tracheas, spleens, lungs, and livers. A random amplification deep sequencing of a transcriptome library generated from pooled tissues produced 927, 966 paired-end reads. A contig of 2, 309 nucleotides was identified as a near-complete avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV 2) genome. This is the first report on the African continent of AGV 2, which has been reported in southern Brazil, the Netherlands, and Hong Kong thus far. A real-time PCR for AGV 2 only detected the virus in the brain but not in cecal tonsils or pooled tracheas, spleens, lungs, and livers. Sequence reads also mapped to the genomes of mycoplasma, Escherichia coli, avian leukosis virus subtype J, and Marek’s disease virus but excluded influenza A virus, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, avian rhinotracheitis virus, <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus, and West Nile virus.

The percentage identity of the polyprotein amino acid sequence of DHV- 1 to all other picornavirus was less than 30 %. The percentage identity of the amino acid sequence at 3 D region of DHV- 1 with LV and HPeV- 1 is only 38. 6 % and 36. 6 %, respectively, and less than 30 % with all other picornaviruses. Like parechoviruses and kobuviruses, the DHV- 1 capsid polypeptide VP 0 is not proteolytically cleaved into VP 4 and VP 2. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of DHV- 1 reveals it to form a new branch of the Picornaviridae. It is therefore proposed that DHV- 1 should be assigned to a new picornavirus genus...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} of March-April-May 2008 first time a sudden and {{unexpected}} jump in mortality in Broiler of 8 to 16 days of age was reported from broiler farms from Chitwan and Kathmandu valley in Nepal. Affected birds become recumbent, depressed and often go into a star-gazing spasm. Those signs included, huddling of the birds, trembling, blindness, loud chirping, litter eating, ataxia, comatose, birds dead with breast down and feet and legs straight out behind birds. Death within two to six hours after {{the onset of the}} symptoms Postmortem Lesions found with this syndrome include hemorrhages in the liver with necrosis of liver cells, regressed thymus, regression of the bursa of Fabricius, dehydration with the accumulation of kidney urates, fluid in the crop, fluid in the lower gut and watery contents of the ceca. Yellow elastic shanks swollen joints. Molted appearance of brain.. The mortality lasted for three to five days, after which, the mortality patterns return to a relatively normal level. When treated with liquid toxin binders like toxol,toxolivum,livertonic like hepatocare,naturaliv, immunomodulaters like immunocare,promin,pentasol and antibiotics there was check in mortality but the body weight recovery was not satisfactory only half as in comparison of in other illness. During this period laboratory culture of total 298 tissue specimen from dead bird was conducted which revealed growth of fungus spp like Aspergillus and Penicillium in 182 specimen while mixed E. coli and Staphylococcus were recovered in 68 specimen 24 specimen revealed the growth of Salmonella spp of bacteria and 24 samples were turn out to be negative while the attempt to isolate the <b>Avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus as it might be the cause suspected also turnout negative. On the basis of all laboratory findings and response to the treatment attempted finding of this preliminary investigation work is suggestive that the above syndrome indicates that mycosis emerging as one of new challenge for the early age broiler health management need to be thoroughly further investigated.

40|$|Ljungan virus (LV) is a {{suspected}} human pathogen recently isolated from bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus). In the present study, it is revealed through comparative sequence analysis that three newly determined Swedish LV genomes {{are closely related}} and possess a deviant picornavirus-like organization: 5 ′ untranslated region-VP 0 -VP 3 -VP 1 - 2 A 1 - 2 A 2 - 2 B- 2 C- 3 A- 3 B- 3 C- 3 D- 3 ′ untranslated region. The LV genomes and the polyproteins encoded by them exhibit several exceptional features, such as {{the absence of a}} predicted maturation cleavage of VP 0, a conserved sequence determinant in VP 0 that is typically found in VP 1 of other picornaviruses, and a cluster of two unrelated 2 A proteins. The 2 A 1 protein is related to the 2 A protein of cardio-, erbo-, tescho-, and aphthoviruses, and the 2 A 2 protein is related to the 2 A protein of parechoviruses, kobuviruses, and <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus. The unprecedented association of two structurally different 2 A proteins is a feature never previously observed among picornaviruses and implies that their functions are not mutually exclusive. Secondary polyprotein processing of the LV polyprotein is mediated by proteinase 3 C (3 Cpro) possessing canonical affinity to Glu and Gln at the P 1 position and small amino acid residues at the P 1 ′ position. In addition, LV 3 Cpro appears to have unique substrate specificity to Asn, Gln, and Asp and to bulky hydrophobic residues at the P 2 and P 4 positions, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that LVs form a separate division, which, together with the Parechovirus genus, has branched off the picornavirus tree most closely to its root. The presence of two 2 A proteins indicates that some contemporary picornaviruses with a single 2 A may have evolved from the ancestral multi- 2 A picornavirus...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe nonstructural protein 2 C {{is highly}} conserved among picornaviruses and plays an {{important}} role in the assembly of mature virions, membrane association, and viral RNA synthesis. The investigation of other potential functions of nonstructural protein 2 C from <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus (AEV) resulted in identifying for the first time that the protein 2 C is involved in apoptosis. Expression of the protein 2 C on chick embryo brain (CEB) and Cos- 7 cells produced TUNEL-positive cells characterized by a cleavage of cellular DNA and the formation of membrane-enclosed apoptotic bodies. Analysis of the protein 2 C showed that the N-terminal domain containing 35 amino acid (aa) residues (between 46 and 80 aa) is associated with apoptotic function. Transfection of the deletion mutant lacking this 35 aa's into CEB and Cos- 7 cells failed to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, the protein 2 C induced apoptosis in the transfected CEB and Cos- 7 cells through activation of caspase- 9 rather than caspase- 8 followed by activation of caspase- 3 pathway. Analysis of the Western blots of caspase- 3 and caspase- 9 showed the characteristics of active caspase- 3 and - 9 in the 2 C-transfected CEB and Cos- 7 cells as seen in the AEV-infected CEB cells while they were in the form of procaspase- 3 and procaspase- 9 in the 2 C mutant-transfected cells. To further elucidate the mechanism of the 2 C-induced apoptosis, the 2 C-transfected CEB and Cos- 7 cells were fractionated into mitochondria and cytosol and subjected for Western blotting, located cytochrome c in the mitochondria as well as the cytosol fractions, while it was only sequestered in the mitochondrial fraction in the mutant 2 C-transfected cells. The protein 2 C was located in the mitochondria and cytosol of the transfected/infected CEB and transfected Cos- 7 cells, but the mutant lost its ability to localize to the mitochondria. Altogether, the results demonstrate that the protein 2 C localized to the mitochondria of the transfected cells triggered the efflux of cytochrome c into the cytosol in turn activating the upstream caspase- 9 and then the downstream caspase- 3, thus leading to apoptosis in the cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} thus far {{carried out on}} experimental <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> indicate that the virus of this newly described disease conforms {{to the group of}} definitely established viruses. It was essential to determine its taxonomy since the only prior record of its study (1) defines the infective agent as a virus because the usual cultural attempts failed to reveal a visible microorganism to be identified with it, and because the transmissible agent passed through Seitz and Berkefeld N filters. At the present time such determinants fail completely to satisfy the criteria for defining a virus and their acceptance would lead to the inclusion of certain filtrable microbic agents, difficult to reveal except by special cultural procedures, as viruses (10). The virus of <b>avian</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> is distinct from that of equine encephalomyelitis and is clearly a virus sui generis. The striking feature of its properties is its narrow range of host susceptibility—only the avian species are responsive to inoculation; ordinary laboratory animals are apparently resistant, even to large numbers of chicken cerebral infective doses. In addition, it is probable that its size is in the range of that of the equine virus. Studies also reveal that the virus is not easily sedimented by centrifugation (that is, at 5400 R. P. M. for one hour in the angle centrifuge and at 12, 000 R. P. M. for one hour in the open air centrifuge) and is resistant to the action of glycerol and to drying. It is readily filtrable through Seitz one and two disc filters, through Berkefeld V and N candles, and is active in dilutions in broth up to 10 – 6. It passes through gradocol membranes of 73 mµ average pore diameter at least (the end-point has not as yet been definitely determined). An attack of the experimental disease leads to development of resistance to reinoculation and of antibodies in the serum. Old birds are reported as being refractory to infection, both in nature and in the laboratory (1, 2). Whether this resistance in mature animals is due to earlier exposure to infection, or to the development of structural or physiological barriers to invasion by the virus, remains still to be determined. Under experimental conditions, the route by which the virus acts uniformly to induce disease is the intracerebral. Yet in certain instances other peripheral ways of inoculation such as the intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intradermal, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasciatic, may also be effective. Thus far, in limited experiments, feeding, or instilling nasally, or injecting into the vitreous body the infective agent has been ineffective. Whether the viral progression is axonal from peripheral sites is still to be determined; as should be also the question whether it multiplies in any of the organs other than the central nervous tissues. The virus was not detected in the blood during the period of incubation or during the acute phases of the experimental disease. So that unless it is found that other animals harbor the virus, or that still other sources of it exist as yet not disclosed, it is not likely that the disease is disseminated by a blood-sucking insect. The actual portal of entry and the factor in the spread of the disease in nature is still obscure, since the evidence here presented is still too incomplete to elucidate these problems. The pathological lesions induced are of interest. The neuronal reaction resembles that brought about by axonal disturbance (axon reaction, Nissl's or retrograde degeneration). The question may well be asked whether there may not be here an initial injury by the virus to the axonal process of the neuron, which in turn induces the retrograde changes in the cell body. This has as yet to be studied, as well as the possibility of viral progression along an axonal route with or without concurrent multiplication. The significance of the second major lesion in the central nervous system, namely, the generally marked perivascular reaction, is also still to be determined. Finally, the only observable and histopathological change in organs other than the central nervous tissues (in which we have not as yet noted the change) is in the hyperplasia of the normally present lymphoid islands. One is impressed by the prodigious numbers of lymphoid elements surrounding the vessels of the central nervous system and the question here is whether these hyperplastic areas serve as depots to supply the cells for this perivascular reaction...|$|E
