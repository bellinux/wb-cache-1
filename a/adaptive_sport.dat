50|$|From its {{earliest}} beginnings {{to the present}} day, <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Sports</b> USA, has been directed and developed by wheelchair athletes and wheelchair sports enthusiasts themselves, individuals with a first-hand understanding {{to the values of}} participation. By and large, the needs of the athlete with a disability are not addressed by the vast network of athletic programs available to able-bodied persons through our educational system and community recreation agencies. Instead, the athlete with a disability has, with rare exceptions, developed his or her own resources and sports opportunities, from rules and governing structure (i.e., <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Sports</b> USA) to funding travel, equipment and other expenses of competition. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>sports</b> enthusiasts are involved at all levels of decision-making in the <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Sports</b> USA, and its constituent associations. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Sports</b> USA, has remained essentially an all-volunteer organization, drawing on the energy and commitment of the people who also benefit from its programs. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>sports</b> have also been described as the most authentic of sports enterprises because the athletes compete and develop their own opportunities for the intrinsic values of participation - and not for the promise of professional contracts or financial reward. The dreams of individual athletes have been made possible through the efforts and dedication of pioneers such as Dr. Guttman and Lipton, and the countless other organizers, volunteers, friends, and supporters of <b>adaptive</b> <b>sports</b> throughout the United States {{and the rest of the}} world. With the continuing increase in public awareness, the future of adaptive athletic competition is indeed bright.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the potentially restorative power of <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport,</b> {{based upon the}} experiences of traumatically injured British military personnel. It investigates how participation in <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> may contribute to personnel’s adaptation of identity and the re-establishment of their meaning of life post-traumatic injury. Through a series of in-depth interviews, I attempted to gain {{a greater understanding of}} the experience of and recovery from life-changing injuries, seeking to comprehend the impact of <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> in this process. In line with current research in the field of disability studies, this research adopted a social construction approach. The results of the analysis are set within the social model of disability {{in order to try to}} highlight the impacts of the perceptions of disability, embedded in the dominant medical model discourse, on the participant’s lives. Key findings highlighted by this research are i; the influence that the medical model discourse has on the British military mentality and their approach to injury, ii; the process of identity adaptation and the importance of adaptive-sport-participation to provide focus and help individuals realise their potential, iii; the experience of <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> as a tool to bring back meaning of life and iv; the process of ‘normalisation’ and the way individuals are self-determined to restore some sense of normality by participating in <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> and positive adaptation to trauma, whereby <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> acts as a tool to set the right conditions for individuals to experience positive phenomena. Throughout this thesis, I have attempted to provide an open and reflexive account of the whole research process in order to make the reader aware of the possible effects of my own background on the research outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Reintegration {{to normal}} living after a {{traumatic}} event or injury {{is difficult for}} anyone, but can be especially challenging for military veterans. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand the potential impact <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> participation and motives for participation have on reintegration to normal living in veterans with acquired disabilities. The study population included 28 veterans who participated in seven different <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> programs. Data were collected using two different scales, the Motives for Physical Activities Measure - Revised (MPAM-R) and the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI), to examine frequency of adaptive sports participation, motives for participation and community reintegration among veterans. Results indicated multiple significant relationships between motivational factors (interest/enjoyment, competence, fitness and social motives) and community reintegration. Furthermore, results demonstrated that the motivational factor of interest/enjoyment was a significant predictor of community reintegration in veterans with acquired disabilities. This research study suggests that veterans who are motivated by interest/enjoyment to participate in adaptive sports have higher self-perceived levels of community reintegration than those who are motivated by other factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the contrihution of {{community}} integration to quality of life (QOL) for people with disahilities who were the participants of community-based <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> programs. Specifically, it was hypothesized that community integration contributes to physical, psychological, social, and environmental QOL. Out of 240 individuals from the mail-ing list of the Adaptive Sports Center (ASC) in Crested Butte, Colorado, a total of 93 individuals responded to the questionnaire that measured community integration and quality of life. TTie multiple regression analysis controlling for age, gender, and marital status was conducted to assess the predictors for QOL domains. Community integration was the only factor that significantly predicted psychological domain, social relationships, and environment domain. However, com-munity integration did not predict to an overall QOL. This study showed connections between community integration and QOL for participants of community-based <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> programs. Further investigation on the relationships between community integration and the specific do-mains of QOL is necessary in the future for a better understanding of the phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was into whether or not {{mindfulness}} training, based on the mindfulness-acceptance-commitment approach (MAC), can improve beginners' skill acquisition of dart throwing. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Methods: A total of 43 first-year college students who had not played darts professionally prior to the study {{were randomly assigned to}} either an attention control group (n = 21) or a mindfulness training group (n = 22) during an eight-week dart training program. Dart throwing and psychological variables were assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and two-week follow-up. Results: Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the mindfulness group, but not the attention control group had significant improvements in mindfulness, experiential acceptance, and flow at post-intervention and follow-up. Although both groups improved dart throwing performance after the intervention, the improvement of the mindfulness group was statistically higher in comparison to that of the attention control group. Conclusions: It was concluded that the MAC approach could improve the performance and <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> experience of beginners in dart throwing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Investigation of the Effects of Sport, Exercise and Recreation(SER) on Psychosocial Outcomes in Individuals with Disabilities Justin Zebulon Laferrier, PhD(c), MSPT,OCS,SCS,ATP,CSCS University of Pittsburgh 2012 Sport, {{exercise}} and recreation {{continues to be}} an important tool for health, fitness and social change as well as for individual rehabilitation. The concept that someone with a disability can be athletic and compete at high levels of sport has helped remove the stigma of being sick that was long been associated with a physical or cognitive impairment. Despite a surprising lack of scientific evidence, sport and recreation has been used to augment and enhance rehabilitation programs for well over 50 years. Clinical experience and anecdotal accounts report that people that participate in sport, {{exercise and}} recreation (SER) have fuller and healthier lives, with increased psychosocial well-being and improved quality of life. While there have been countless stories of positive life changing experiences related to involvement in <b>adaptive</b> <b>sport</b> and recreation there is a paucity of scientific evidence to support these claims. 	As disability rates continue to rise throughout the population funding for rehabilitation programs is steadily decreasing and patient stays are getting shorter and shorter. Due to these issues treatment plans my not be as comprehensive as would be considered optimal and patient outcomes can suffer. Medical providers are continually looking for {{the most effective way to}} provide the best possible care and maximize patient outcomes. 	Developing an evidence base to support the benefits of (SER) will serve multiple purposes. First it would help to educate medical providers and assist them in developing the most effective treatment plans and rehabilitation programs, allowing them to make the best use of available time and resources. Second, it would provide a knowledge base to train outside programs, trainers, and coaches as to what is most effective as the majority of these individuals are generally not medical providers. Third, it would serve to educate third party payers and possibly lead to reimbursement for equipment and services. Most importantly it would provide an avenue for Veterans with disabilities to return to a fuller, healthier life...|$|E
