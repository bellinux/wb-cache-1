40|$|Organisms often shown {{enhanced}} growth during {{recovery from}} starvation, {{and can even}} overtake continuously fed conspecifics (overcompensation). In an earlier paper (Ecology 84, 2777 - 2787), we studied the relative role played by hyperphagia and resource allocation in producing overcompensation in juvenile (non-reproductive) animals. We found that, although hyperphagia always produces growth compensation, overcompensation additionally requires protein allocation control which routes assimilate preferentially to structure during recovery. In this paper we extend our model to cover reproductively active individuals and demonstrate that growth rate overcompensation requires a similar combination of hyperphagia and allocation control which routes the part of enhanced assimilation not used for reproduction preferentially towards structural growth. We compare the properties of our dynamic energy budget model with an earlier proposal, due to Kooijman, which we extend to include hyperphagia. This formulation assumes {{that the rate of}} <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> <b>reserves</b> is controlled by instantaneous feeding rate, and one would thus expect that an extension to include hyperphagia would not predict growth overcompensation. However, we show that a self-consistent representation of the hyperphagic response in Kooijman's model overrides its fundamental dynamics, leading to preferential allocation to structural growth during recovery and hence to growth overcompensation...|$|E

We predicted that <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> carbohydrate <b>reserves</b> would vary {{as a function of}} the phenology of shoot growth, because of a hypothesized tradeoff between aboveground growth and carbohydrate storage. Intraspecific variation in levels of carbohydrate reserves was induced through experimental defoliation of naturally occurring, 2 -year-old seedlings of four northeastern tree species - Acer rubrum, A. saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Prunus serotina - with shoot growth strategies that ranged from highly determinate <b>to</b> indeterminate. <b>Allocation</b> <b>to</b> root structural biomass varied among species and as a function of light, but did not respond to the defoliation treatments. <b>Allocation</b> <b>to</b> carbohydrate <b>reserves</b> varied among species, and the two species with the most determinate shoot growth patterns had the highest total mass of carbohydrate reserves, but not the highest concentrations. Both the total mass and concentrations of carbohydrate reserves were significantly reduced by defoliation. Seedling survival during the year following the defoliation treatments did not vary among species, but did vary dramatically in response to defoliation. In general, there was an approximately linear relationship between carbohydrate reserves and subsequent survival, but no clear relationship between <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> root structural biomass and subsequent survival. Because of the disproportionate amounts of reserves stored in roots, we would have erroneously concluded that <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> roots was significantly and positively related to seedling survival if we had failed <b>to</b> distinguish between <b>reserves</b> and structural biomass in roots...|$|R

We apply GT 3 to manufacturing by developing a MG Quality of Service (MG-QoS) management system. The main focus of this framework {{is to provide a}} means for the users to search for services based on QoS criteria in Manufacturing Grid, to provide QoS guarantees for service execution and to enforce these guarantees by establishing Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

40|$|When {{reproduction}} is costly, life history theory suggests an energetic trade-off between physiological cost of maintenance and reproduction. In long-lived species in temperate climates, this trade-off could be measured as energy <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> fat <b>reserve</b> and body condition versus <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> lactation and offspring growth. When resource availability is variable, {{instead of a}} fixed energy <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> reproduction based on average conditions, natural selection should favor an adjustment of effort based on individual body condition and on resource availability at each reproductive event. The main goal of this thesis is to study variation in energy <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> reproduction, i. e. reproductive strategies, of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) ewes. Bighorn sheep are long-lived mountain ungulates with a strong sexual dimorphism. Ewes can reproduce at two years and give birth to one young every year until they die. My research {{is based on a}} long-term project that has involved tagging and weighing individual sheep at Ram Mountain, Alberta, since 1972. The first chapter briefly presents the methods used and includes two methodological articles with a broad appeal in ecology. The second chapter tests for environmental and previous reproduction effects on reproductive effort. Using summer mass changes of mother-lamb pairs to estimate reprodutive effort, I show a conservative reproductive strategy of bighorn ewes, which allocate energy to their own maintenance and not to reproduction when environmental conditions are severe. In chapter three, different hypotheses of adaptive sex-ratio manipulation are evaluated. Resuls support the cost of reproduction hypothesis. Ewes manipulate both sex and size of their lambs to minimize the cost of reproduction. The fourth chapter assesses both the determinants and the consequences of variation in age of primiparity. Despite a strong somatic cost associated with first parturition, it is better for ewes to begin to reproduce at an early age. However, ewes delay primiparity when conditions are poor and if they are small as yearling, to allow compensatory growth. That delay again indicates a conservative strategy of reproduction. Finally, in the fifth chapter, I compare two hypotheses about variation of reproductive effort at the end of life. Terminal investment was not supported and a strong longevity-independent effet of senescence was detected. The different sections of this research test several important hypotheses in ecology and evolution. Two major points arise from all analyses: a strong and ubiquitous inter-individual variation and a conservative strategy of reproduction of ewes, which favour their own maintenance and survival over the growth of their lambs...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{resource}} allocation for future integrated broadband communication networks (IBCNs) is addressed. It mainly involves resource allocation at the connection level. The resource allocation problem is decomposed {{into the following}} interdependent tasks: (i) given that a network can accommodate the bandwidth demand of a call request, determine a route for the corresponding asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) virtual connection, and (ii) allocate bandwidth, i. e., links inside the trunks of the chosen route, to this connection according to predefined limits on bandwidth use by various service calls. Hence, (i) is mainly {{the responsibility of the}} routing algorithm used by the network operator, while (ii) depends on the link <b>allocation</b> scheme used <b>to</b> <b>reserve</b> trunk bandwidth, i. e., links, for each service. Various link allocation schemes combined with routing algorithms are examined. Their performance in terms of service call blocking is evaluated using a software package developed for that purpose. It is shown that the traditional complete sharing (CS) and complete partitioning (CP) policies are not adequate for IBCNs. Movable boundary (MB) policies are more flexible and present near-optimal performance when access of broadband service to narrowband service resources is allowed and suitable routing algorithms are dynamically applied...|$|R
40|$|Pre-release {{evaluation}} of the efficacy of biological control agents is often not possible {{in the case of}} many invasive species targeted for biocontrol. In such circumstances simulating herbivory could yield significant insights into plant response to damage, thereby improving the efficiency of agent prioritisation, increasing the chances of regulating the performance of invasive plants through herbivory and minimising potential risks posed by release of multiple herbivores. We adopted this approach to understand the weaknesses herbivores could exploit, to manage the invasive liana, Macfadyena unguis-cati. We simulated herbivory by damaging the leaves, stem, root and tuber of the plant, in isolation and in combination. We also applied these treatments at multiple frequencies. Plant response in terms of biomass allocation showed that at least two severe defoliation treatments were required to diminish this liana's climbing habit and reduce its <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> belowground tuber <b>reserves.</b> Belowground damage appears to have negligible effect on the plant's biomass production and tuber damage appears to trigger a compensatory response. Plant response to combinations of different types of damage did not differ significantly to that from leaf damage. This suggests that specialist herbivores in the leaf-feeding guild capable of removing over 50 % of the leaf tissue may be desirable in the biological control of this invasive species...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the regeneration ecology of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) in mesic forests, we compared its seedling growth and physiology with those of two other hardwoods, differing in successional status, along a gradient in light availability ranging from forest understories (2. 6 % of full light) to small clearings (69 % of full light). Oak's relative growth rate (RGR) closely resembled that of shade-tolerant sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and the positive response of both to increasing light was modest, especially beyond a relative light availability of 15 %. Intolerant trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) outgrew the others when relative light availability exceeded 5 %, and its RGR increased more or less linearly with increasing light. However, there was a rank reversal of RGR in deep shade, where maple and oak had a higher RGR than aspen. This reversal was mirrored by seedling demography, as aspen survival was comparatively high in small clearings but negligible in deep shade. Aspen's low RGR and poor survival in low light were associated with {{a high rate of}} shoot dark respiration and minimal <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> starch <b>reserves.</b> Aspen's high RGR in openings was attributed primarily to a high photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf mass. Thus, differential growth and survival among species could be explained in part by trade-offs in attributes that promoted rapid growth in high light at the expense of a favorable carbon balance in low light, or vice versa. Oak's suite of traits facilitated a positive carbon balance in perhaps all but the darkest understories. We suggest that the lack of persistence of oak seedlings in many understory environments may center around factors (e. g., vulnerability to biotic stresses) not directly related to carbon gain...|$|R

40|$|Although most of {{the genetic}} {{progress}} in production efficiency is achieved through selection at a global scale, locally, farm managers can also influence the selection process to better match genotypes and their varying herd environment. This study focused {{on the influence of}} a particular management decision-the use of extended lactation (EL) in dairy goat production systems- as it affects the survival and reproduction rates at the herd level, which may then shape different long-term selection responses. The objective was to understand and quantify the influences of EL and variability in achieved intake level on the responses to selection for production, reproduction, and longevity. An animal model of resource allocation between life functions was applied to the dairy goat. It predicts the trajectory of change in the herd genetic composition as affected by the feeding level and the selection pressure applied by the manager. During 40 yr, goats were selected for milk yield, reproduction, and, with a different selection weight for age (W-AGE), for longevity. Under varying achieved intake levels, increasing W-AGE improved the survival rate but a nonlinear effect was observed for the average milk yield and BCS. When moderately increasing W-AGE from 0, resources were reallocated from lactation towards body reserves and survival, which led to a trade-off at the herd level between improving survival and BCS and increasing milk yield. When further increasing W-AGE, old females became systematically preferred regardless of their reproductive status and the proportion of EL in the herd increased. Females undergoing EL had reduced energetic costs of reproduction, which improved their probability of survival. Across generations, an increased herd incidence of EL led to a relaxation of the selection pressure on the resource <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> body <b>reserves,</b> which is normally imposed by the manager's priority to achieve successful reproduction at each mating. As selection for longevity progressed, the incidence of high-producing females increased within the herd, driving a long-term trend in increased milk production. Thus, the use of EL as a management tool led to an alleviation of the trade-off between milk yield progress and survival improvement. Although the model simplifies the underlying physiology of nutrient allocation, it provides insights into how farm manager strategies can influence the development of genotype x environment interactions and promote herd robustness...|$|R

We found a significant delay in drought-induced leaf senescence in nodulated relative to non-nodulated plants, independent of rhizobial strain and uncoupled from initial leaf N content. The major mechanisms involved are increased concentrations of potassium and shifts in the carbon partitioning between starch and sugars under well-watered conditions, as well as the enhanced <b>allocation</b> of <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> osmolytes during drought. Consequently, nodulated plants recovered more effectively from drought, relative to non-nodulated M. truncatula.

Here, we compared the development trajectories of cotton plants (Gossypium herbaceum L.), which were grown in two contrasting soil textures during a 60 -d period. Those results distinguished the biomass allocation pattern resulting from ontogenetic drift and the response to soil texture. The soil texture significantly changed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> leaves and roots, but not to stems. Soil texture also significantly changed the development trajectories of leaf and root traits, but did not change the scaling relationship between basal stem diameter and plant height. Results of nested ANOVAs of consecutive plant-size categories in both soil textures showed that soil gradients explained an average of 63. 64 - 70. 49 % of the variation of biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> leaves and roots.

40|$|The {{distribution}} planning {{problem with}} consolidation center(s) addresses {{the coordination of}} distribution activities between a set of suppliers {{and a set of}} customers, through the use of intermediate facilities in order to achieve savings in transportation cost. We study the problem {{from the perspective of a}} third-party logistics provider (3 PL) that is coordinating shipments between suppliers and customers. Given customer demand of products from different suppliers, the goal is to consolidate the shipments in fewer high volume loads, from suppliers to the consolidation center(s) and from the consolidation center(s) to customer. We assume that suppliers have a finite set of transportation options, each with a given capacity and time of arrival at the consolidation center(s). Similarly, customers have a set of transportation options, each with a given capacity and dispatch time from the consolidation center(s). The 3 PL wants to determine the optimal transportation options, or shipment schedule, and the <b>allocation</b> of shipments <b>to</b> transportation options from suppliers to consolidation center(s), and from consolidation center(s) to customers, that minimize the total transportation cost and holding cost at the consolidation center. The literature studies many variations of this problem, which assume deterministic demand. This thesis extends the problem for stochastic demand and formulates it as a two-stage stochastic programming model. We model the case where the choice of transportation options is a contractual decision, and a 3 PL needs to decide on which options <b>to</b> <b>reserve</b> for a given planning period subject to stochastic customer demand. Therefore, the choices of transportation options are the stage one variables in the two-stage stochastic program. The second stage variables, which are decisions that are made after the uncertainty conditions become known, represent the <b>allocation</b> of orders <b>to</b> <b>reserved</b> transportation options as well as shipping orders through a spot-market carrier, at a greater transportation cost. Because of the high computational demand of the model, the integer L-shaped method is applied to decompose the problem. To increase the efficiency of the algorithm, we experiment with three valid cuts with the goal of generating stronger cuts than the L-cut. We also apply three algorithm enhancement techniques to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical results show that the performance of our proposed methodology and valid cuts is comparable to that of CPLEX. We suggest promising areas for future work to further improve the computational efficiency of our decomposition algorithm...|$|R
