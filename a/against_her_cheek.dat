25|$|Mary is {{described}} by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender {{manner in which the}} child is nestled <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child. Her head is tilted towards her son and embraces his forehead and cheek almost as if in a kiss, while her arms warmly cradle him. He has one leg bent and another extended towards her, while his right arm is held upright and intimately holds her chin from below. This closeness and engagement of mother and child is a departure from Byzantine tradition, where they were often shown almost at arms length, and was in tune with the ideals of the Italian Quattrocento.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{accounts}} of the descent of Christ's body from the Cross, the evangelists relate the story only {{in connection with the}} Entombment of Christ. According to the canonical gospels, Joseph of Arimathea took Christ's body and prepared it for burial. John (19:38â€“42) adds one assistant, Nicodemus. None of these accounts mention Mary. During the Middle Ages, the narrative of the Passion became more elaborate, and more attention was paid to the role of Christ's mother. One example is the anonymous 14th-century text, Meditationes de Vita Christi, perhaps by Ludolph of Saxony. Barbara Lane suggests this passage from the Vita Christi might lie behind many paintings of the Deposition, including Rogier's: [...] "Then the lady reverently receives the hanging right hand and places it <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> gazes upon it, and kisses it with heavy tears and sorrowful sighs." ...|$|E
60|$|Romola {{seized the}} hand that was <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> {{and put it to}} her lips in silence.|$|E
60|$|Deronda {{could not}} sit still. He rose, {{and went to}} prop himself against {{the corner of the}} mantel-piece, at a {{different}} angle from her face. But when she had pressed <b>her</b> handkerchief <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> she turned and looked up at him, awaiting an answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, wait, wait!" [...] she begged, <b>her</b> hands pressed <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> He stood impassible--hatefully impassible. [...] "....... if I were {{to consent}} to... this... how... how soon...?" [...] He {{understood}} the unfinished question. Interest warmed his face again. He {{took a step}} towards her, but by a gesture she seemed to beg him come no nearer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nice Nina, dear Nina, good Nina," [...] {{said the}} girl, rubbing <b>her</b> glossy curls <b>against</b> <b>her</b> friend's <b>cheeks.</b> [...] "Ah, dear, how I wish you lived here!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{laid the}} back of his hand <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> snuggled near him. She was ready for her new home.|$|E
60|$|She {{took his}} hand in hers and pressed it <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> and as he stood beside her came closer {{to him with a}} {{nestling}} movement.|$|E
60|$|Marion, trifling {{with her}} teacup, {{seemed to say}} - but she didn't say it - that he was welcome to forget, if he could. Grace pressed the {{blooming}} face <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> and smiled.|$|E
6000|$|Kitty laid <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> fondly <b>against</b> <b>her</b> uncle's <b>cheek.</b> [...] "Everything is changed," [...] she whispered. [...] "We travel about; papa {{has left}} us, and Syd has left {{us, and we}} have got a new name. We are Norman now. I wish I was grown up, and old enough to {{understand}} it." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{the small}} details that make these stories so heartbreaking. A child's nursery rhyme that runs {{endlessly}} through the mind of one prisoner while being tortured. A friend's jacket that shields the guard's blows once that friend {{is removed from the}} school, possibly killed. A broken tooth kept in a matchbox that reminds one prisoner she is still [...] "whole." [...] The glimpses of life another prisoner catches through the bottom of the blindfold, where it doesn't quite lay flat <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> The sheer delight in catching raindrops in the palm of a hand where the window leaks during a storm.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the matter, then, Minny?" [...] she said, stooping {{in answer}} to some whimpering of that small quadruped, and lifting his glossy head <b>against</b> <b>her</b> pink <b>cheek.</b> [...] "Did you think I was going without you? Come, then, let us go and see Sinbad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see it," [...] he repeated, {{the back}} of his head <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> [...] "But I can, perhaps, {{standing}} up." [...] He stood accordingly, placing himself in the direct line of her gaze.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a dear, {{but you are}} very, very stupid," [...] she said, and as {{she spoke}} she caught my hand and pressed the palm of it <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> [...] "What do you feel?" [...] she asked.|$|E
60|$|Miss Lydia sat immovable, not {{daring to}} glance toward her father. Sometimes her hand {{next to him}} would be laid <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> as if to conceal the smile which, {{in spite of her}} disapproval, she could not entirely suppress.|$|E
6000|$|I {{plucked a}} few bunches of guelder-rose fruits, transparent, ruby berries. She stroked them softly <b>against</b> <b>her</b> lips and <b>cheek,</b> caressing them. Then she murmured to herself: ...|$|R
6000|$|Still {{holding my}} hand, she {{played with the}} fingers unconsciously, dressed them, now in her own rings, and now circled them with a twine of her {{beautiful}} hair; she patted the palm <b>against</b> <b>her</b> hot <b>cheek,</b> and at last, having cleared a voice that was naturally liquid as a lark's, she said:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Madame {{entered the}} room, {{and took her}} place {{at the other end}} of the breakfast table. She leaned upon her stick as she walked, and her face seemed more than ever lined in the early morning sunlight. She wore a dress of some soft black material, unrelieved by any patch of color, <b>against</b> which <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> were almost ghastly in their pallor.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{says that}} time is nothing, and thought is everything," [...] Greta murmured, rubbing a rose <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> [...] "but I think you cannot have a thought unless {{you have the time}} to think it in. There are the others! Look!" ...|$|E
60|$|Seeing no scorn or repugnance in her face, {{the object}} of her charity bent over her as she asked the question, and pressed her lips <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> Once more she caught her arm, and covered her eyes with it; and then was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Aunt Mary is very anxious. Oh, I {{would have}} done {{anything}} that you had not vexed them now and killed this poor dear pretty thing!' said Constance, stroking down the glossy feathers of the still warm victim, and laying them <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> almost tearfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm--I'm praying about it," [...] said Cecily {{in a low}} voice, her tear-wet lashes {{trembling}} <b>against</b> <b>her</b> pale, round <b>cheeks.</b> [...] "Do {{you suppose}} it will do any good, Bev?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned out}} for air. What a night!--whose stars were {{hiding in the}} sheer heavy warmth; whose small, round, golden moon had no transparency! A night like a black pansy with a little gold heart. And silent! For, of the trees, that whispered so much at night, not even the aspens had voice. The unstirring air had a dream-solidity <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> But in all the stillness, what sentiency, what passion--as in her heart! Could she not draw HIM to her from those woods, from that dark gleaming river, draw him from the flowers and trees and the passion-mood of the sky--draw him up to her waiting here, so that she was no more this craving creature, but one with him and the night! And she let her head droop down on her hands.|$|R
60|$|The {{impression}} that Mary Clibborn gave was of absolute healthiness, moral and physical. Her appearance was not distinguished, {{but she was}} well set up, with strong hands and solid feet; you knew at once that a ten-mile walk invigorated rather than tired her; her arms were muscular and energetic. She {{was in no way}} striking; a typical, country-bred girl, with a fine digestion and an excellent conscience; if not very pretty, obviously good. Her face showed a happy mingling of strength and cheerfulness; her blue eyes were guileless and frank; her hair even was rather pretty, arranged in the simplest manner; her skin was tanned by wind and weather. The elements were friendly, and she enjoyed a long walk in a gale, with the rain beating <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> She was dressed simply and without adornment, as befitted her character.|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed over}} and patted her shoulder. Outside the window, beyond the fly-screen that was opaque with dust and cottonwood lint, Main Street was hushed {{except for the}} {{impatient}} throb of a standing motor car. She took his firm hand, pressed his knuckles <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|E
60|$|Like elfin music--tender, fitful, dreamy!--an {{exquisite}} languor stole into Crystal's limbs. She was not asleep, {{yet she was}} in dreamland--all {{alone in}} semi-darkness, that was restful and soothing, and with the fragrance of crimson roses in her nostrils and their velvety petals brushing <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|E
60|$|Poor Bottles! One {{look was}} enough. There {{was no chance}} of his {{attaining}} the blessed haven of disillusionment. In five seconds he was farther out to sea than ever. When {{she knew that he}} had seen her she dropped her eyes a little--he saw the long curved lashes appear <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> and moved forward.|$|E
60|$|He had {{a glimpse}} of her, {{twisting}} up a strand of naturally wavy brown hair, a silver-backed hair-brush bright <b>against</b> it, <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> flushed to an even crimson, her blue corduroy jacket off, and, warmly intimate in its stead, a blouse of blue satin, opening in a shallow triangle at her throat. With a tender big-brotherliness he sought the room that was his, not Jack's. No longer was this the house of Other People, but {{one in which he}} belonged.|$|R
6000|$|He kissed her--he didn't quite kiss her--he laid unmoving lips <b>against</b> <b>her</b> unflushing <b>cheek.</b> He {{hurried out}} to the garage, muttering: [...] "Lord, what a family! And now Myra {{is going to get}} pathetic on me because we don't train with this millionaire outfit. Oh, Lord, {{sometimes}} I'd like to quit the whole game. And the office worry and detail just as bad. And I act cranky and--I don't mean to, but I get--So darn tired!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was still}} holding her mother's arms while she spoke. Now she held her very close and nestled in <b>against</b> <b>her</b> bosom, and {{gradually}} got <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>cheek,</b> and <b>her</b> lips <b>against</b> <b>her</b> mother's neck. How could any mother refuse such a caress as that, or remain hard and stern against such signs of love? Mrs. Ray, at any rate, was not possessed of strength to do so. She was vanquished, and put her arm round her girl and embraced her. She spoke soft words, and told Rachel that she was her dear, dear, dearest darling. She was still awed and dismayed by the tidings which she {{had heard of the}} young man; she still thought there was some terrible danger against which it behoved them all to be on their guard. But she no longer felt herself divided from her child, and had ceased to believe in the necessity of those terrible words which Mrs. Prime had used.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} into her face {{wondering}} and troubled at her words, and she smiled down so sweetly on his upturned face, looking very beautiful and tender, that it almost made him cry to think how wilful and passionate he had been, and climbing on to her knees he put his little face <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Gulliver saw it, and, {{pushing up}} the door, flew from his prison with a glad cry; and, hopping into Moppet's hand, {{looked into the}} little dark face with such {{grateful}} confidence that it cleared at once, and the brightest smile it had worn for months broke over it as the bird nestled its soft head <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> saying gently: ...|$|E
60|$|His arms quickly closed round her, {{she felt}} his hot breath <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> For one moment did she close her eyes, for she felt sick and faint, but the staunch valour of that same Dutch blood which had striven and fought and endured and conquered {{throughout}} the ages past gave her just that courage, just that presence of mind which she needed.|$|E
6000|$|A {{wise and}} tender {{mother would have}} divined her nameless needs, {{answered}} her vague desires, and {{through the medium of}} the most omnipotent affection given to humanity, have made her what she might have been. But Sylvia had never known mother-love, for her life came through death; and the only legacy bequeathed her was a slight hold upon existence, a ceaseless craving for affection, and the shadow of a tragedy that wrung from the pale lips, that grew cold <b>against</b> <b>her</b> baby <b>cheek,</b> the cry, [...] "Free at last, thank God for that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I scarce {{knew what}} I did, but as I lay beside her {{it came to}} me that I did not wish to rise again--that already I had lived overlong. It came to me that, seeing me fallen, haply those cowards would seize the chance to make an end of me as I lay. I wished it so in that moment's frenzy, for I made no attempt to rise or to defend myself; instead I set my arms about my poor murdered love, and <b>against</b> <b>her</b> cold <b>cheek</b> I set my face that was well-nigh as cold.|$|R
6000|$|In the evening, putting <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> brother's {{shoulder}} {{as she was}} sitting by him, while he sat propped up in bed under a new difficulty of breathing, she said-- ...|$|R
