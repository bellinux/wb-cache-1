5|$|Using these {{metal frames}} for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to {{increased}} wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing {{had to be}} introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the loads <b>and</b> <b>moments</b> on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s.|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamic force}} sensing method is {{proposed}} for a robot manipulator. A 6 -axis wrist force sensor which {{is commonly used}} for robot force sensing does not take the direct measurement of the force <b>and</b> <b>moment</b> applied to an end effector externally from {{the environment of the}} manipulator, but takes the resultant of the gravity, the inertial force <b>and</b> <b>moment</b> on the end effector, and the external force <b>and</b> <b>moment.</b> The separation of gravitational and inertial force <b>and</b> <b>moment</b> from the measurement of the force sensor is crucial to achieving dynamically accurate force sensing and fast manipulator motion under force feedback control. A mathematical model is derived for the force sensing process and the separation of the force <b>and</b> <b>moment</b> as a nonlinear optimal state estimation problem formulated. Then an approximate solution is given using extended Kalman filtering techniques...|$|R

The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her. In the club, it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall.

40|$|Abstract:Based on body {{inertial}} force <b>and</b> <b>moment</b> theoretical calculation method and finite element (FE) method principle, {{a kind of}} calculation method for complicated system static or dynamic {{inertial force}} <b>and</b> <b>moment</b> based on MATLAB code was put forward. The traditional mass concentration method has more error in some conditions compare with FE method. At last the data dependency was evaluated between method accuracy and element size. During course of high speed running, the machine motion mechanism could produce large inertial force <b>and</b> inertial <b>moment</b> because of their acceleration and angle acceleration. This periodic force <b>and</b> <b>moment</b> could cause machine’s strong vibration and noise if them couldn’t be balanced or counteracted. The noise requirement is very high in military engine field, so the problemis become outstanding especially. And the effective method of solve problem is do mechanism dynamic balance. The common dynamic balance method is adding balance weight in mechanism except making modification in original mechanism structure. The antecedent condition of this method is calculating mechanism inertial force <b>and</b> inertial <b>moment</b> accurately.

25|$|To {{calculate}} the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have floor-mounted load transducers, {{also known as}} force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces <b>and</b> <b>moments,</b> including the magnitude, direction and location (called the center of pressure). The spatial distribution of forces can be measured with pedobarography equipment. Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at every stage of the gait cycle. The computational method for {{this is known as}} inverse dynamics.|$|E

25|$|Inverse {{dynamics}} is {{an inverse}} problem. It commonly refers to either inverse rigid body dynamics or inverse structural dynamics. Inverse rigid-body dynamics {{is a method}} for computing forces and/or moments of force (torques) based on the kinematics (motion) of a body and the body's inertial properties (mass and moment of inertia). Typically it uses link-segment models to represent the mechanical behaviour of interconnected segments, such as the limbs of humans, animals or robots, where given the kinematics of the various parts, inverse dynamics derives the minimum forces <b>and</b> <b>moments</b> responsible for the individual movements. In practice, inverse dynamics computes these internal moments and forces from measurements of the motion of limbs and external forces such as ground reaction forces, under a special set of assumptions.|$|E

25|$|Aerodynamics is {{important}} {{in a number of}} applications other than aerospace engineering. It is a significant factor in any type of vehicle design, including automobiles. It {{is important}} in the prediction of forces <b>and</b> <b>moments</b> acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers also use aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, to calculate wind loads in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages {{is important in}} heating/ventilation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins as}} Torque (who never speaks) is being escorted by CO Ernesto Alvarez (voiced by Mark Dias) onto death row in Abbott State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, {{off the coast}} of Maryland, an island with a long and troubled history.

Shortly after entering his cell, an earthquake rocks the prison, <b>and</b> <b>moments</b> later, all of the inmates on death row except Torque are killed by strange creatures. One of the creatures opens Torque's cell, and he sets out to escape. After seeing several guards killed by the creatures, Torque uses security monitors to find the entire prison is under attack. He then gets a phone call from his dead wife, Carmen (Rafeedah Keys), telling him the island is more than a prison, that it brings out evil in everyone, and advising him to escape as soon as he can.|$|E
25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces <b>and</b> <b>moments</b> on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E
