40|$|AbstractIn rat microglial enriched cultures, expressing Toll-like {{receptor}} 4, {{we studied}} cytokine release after exposure with 1 ng/ml LPS for 0. 5 – 24 h. Dexamethasone and corticosterone exposure served as controls. We focused on whether naloxone, ouabain, and bupivacaine, all agents with reported anti-inflammatory effects on astrocytes, {{could affect the}} release of TNF-α and IL- 1 β in microglia. Our results show that neither ultralow (10 − 12 M) nor high (10 − 6 M) concentrations of these agents had demonstrable effects on cytokine release in microglia. The results indicate that <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substances</b> exert specific influences on different glial cell types. Astrocytes seem to be functional targets for <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substances</b> while microglia respond directly to inflammatory stimuli and are thus more sensitive to <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substances</b> like corticoids. The physiological relevance might be that astrocyte dysfunction influences neuronal signalling both due to direct disturbance of astrocyte functions and in the communication within the astrocyte networks. When the signalling between astrocytes is working, then microglia produce less pro-inflammatory cytokines...|$|R

Respiratory disease, primarily Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) infection, is recognised as a major factor causing reduced productivity in pigs. This thesis reports investigations into the use of novel immunomodulators in particular Interleukin 4 (IL- 4) and Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra) as alternatives to antibiotics to treat App infection. Immunological and molecular biological assays were used to investigate and accumulate data. An in vitro study undertaken to find potential anti-inflammatory substances, revealed that Interleukin 8 (IL- 8) mRNA production stimulated by PMA or LPS in whole pigs' blood was suppressed by IL- 4. IL- 1 ra also suppressed stimulated IL- 8 mRNA production by heat killed App bacteria (KB) in vitro. An acute LPS challenge in pigs in vivo however, showed no variation in illness or weight loss between pigs treated prophylactically with <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance</b> (IL- 4 and IL- 1 ra) and saline treated pigs. The use of plasmids as a delivery system for <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance</b> did not show promise since it did not enhance growth or prolong the expression of the substances in the pigs. However, in the chronic App challenge model IL- 4 and IL- 1 ra administered prophylactically in vivo showed an ability to improve growth. The therapeutic administration of IL- 4 and IL- 1 ra to App challenged pigs showed no difference in pigs' growth, regardless of the treatment or control administered. To conclude, IL- 4 and IL- 1 ra showed promise when administered prophylactically and improved growth and abrogated disease under conditions of App challenge. However when IL- 4 and IL- 1 ra where administered therapeutically they did not perform as well. Moreover these compounds have potential as a commercial application to reduce the growth reduction caused by disease such as App...|$|E

In the present study, we asked the question if administration of a novel kynurenic acid analogue (SZR 72), precursor of an excitotoxin antagonist and <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance,</b> can modify the neurogenic inflammatory response in the trigeminal ganglion. Methods: Inflammation in the trigeminal ganglion was induced by local dural application of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA). Levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase pERK 1 / 2 and IL- 1 β expression in V 1 region of the trigeminal ganglion were investigated using immunohistochemistry and Western blot.

We investigated whether warifteine, its main alkaloid, would have anti-inflammatory effect due to a blockage of neutrophil function. In vivo warifteine treatment inhibited casein-induced neutrophil migration to the peritoneal cavity but did not inhibit neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow. Analysis of the direct effect of warifteine upon neutrophil adherence and migration in vitro demonstrated that the alkaloid decreased cell adhesion to P and E-selectin-transfected cells. In addition, fLMP-induced neutrophil migration in a transwell system was blocked by warifteine; this effect was mimicked by cAMP mimetic/inducing substances, and warifteine increased intracellular cAMP levels in neutrophils.

Among PPs recalcitrant to water treatments, diclofenac, a nonsteroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance,</b> shows a high toxicity (Ferrari et al., 2003) and remains at high concentration in the environment (Miege et al., 2009) due to its particular resistance to the current treatment (Verlicchi et al., 2014).

40|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} effect of various substances {{was measured in}} rats implanted with cotton wool pellets. Injection or implantation of irritant materials decreased the deposition of granulation tissue on the pellets. As the amount of irritant material increased there was a corresponding decrease {{in the amount of}} tissue deposited on the pellets. There is evidence that this could not be explained by a limit to the amount of granulation tissue available within the body, and competition for it between the cotton pellets and the implanted substances.

40|$|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} dementia affecting {{a large proportion}} of the aging population. The histopathological changes in AD include neuronal cell death, formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. There is also evidence that brain tissue in patients with AD is exposed to oxidative stress (e. g., protein oxidation, lipid oxidation, DNA oxidation and glycoxidation) during the course of the disease. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are present in amyloid plaques in AD, and its extracellular accumulation may be caused by an accelerated oxidation of glycated proteins. AGEs participate in neuronal death causing direct (chemical) and indirect (cellular) free radical production and consequently increase oxidative stress. The development of drugs for the treatment of AD that breaks the vicious cycles of oxidative stress and neurodegeneration offer new opportunities. These approaches include AGE-inhibitors, antioxidants and <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substances,</b> which prevent free radical production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rehabilitation {{of joints}} that {{underwent}} major surgery, involves reducing postoperative pain and inflammation. Many pharmaceutical product used in reducing joint pain {{are based on}} the extended-release technology and becoming increasingly important in research domain. The performance of extended-release matrix tablets is dependent on the solid dosage properties like matrix materials used, which are semi-synthetic polymer like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and sodium carboxy methylcellulose (Na CMC). Depending on the properties of the polymer used, drug release from the tablets may be controlled by erosion mechanism and surface roughness. In a physiological environment, the release of drug from a solid dosage form requires a gradual erosion of solid shape with simultaneous change of surface roughness.

40|$|A {{chemical}} inhibition {{model of}} inflammation is proposed by semi-continuous monitoring {{the density of}} toll-like receptor 1 (TLR 1) expressed on mammalian cells following bacterial infection to investigate an in vivo-mimicked drug screening system. The inflammation was induced by adding bacterial lysate (e. g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to a mammalian cell culture (e. g., A 549 cell line). The TLR 1 density on the same cells was immunochemically monitored up to three cycles under optimized cyclic bacterial stimulation-and-restoration conditions. The assay {{was carried out by}} adopting a cell-compatible immunoanalytical procedure and signal generation method. Signal intensity relative to the background control obtained without stimulation was employed to plot the standard curve for inflammation. To suppress the inflammatory response, sodium salicylate, which inhibits nuclear factor-κB activity, was used to prepare the standard curve for anti-inflammation. Such measurement of differential TLR densities was used as a biosensing approach discriminating the <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance</b> from the non-effector, which was simulated by using caffeic acid phenethyl ester and acetaminophen as the two components, respectively. As the same cells exposed to repetitive bacterial stimulation were semi-continuously monitored, the efficacy and toxicity of the inhibitors may further be determined regarding persistency against time. Therefore, this semi-continuous biosensing model could be appropriate as a substitute for animal-based experimentation during drug screening prior to pre-clinical tests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{family of}} endocannabinoids (i. e., the {{endogenous}} agonists of cannabinoid receptors) contains several {{polyunsaturated fatty acid}} amides such as anandamide (AEA) and oleamide but also esters such as 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG). These compounds {{are the subject of}} growing interest in pharmacology for their multiple therapeutic potentials. Unfortunately, they are rapidly inactivated by enzymatic hydrolysis, which prevents their effective medical use. Inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation seem to be necessary tools for the development of endocannabinoid therapeutics. But hitting this target is inconceivable without good knowledge of the enzymes. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is the oldest and the best characterised enzyme involved in the degradation of endocannabinoids. Cloning, distribution in the body and crystal structure of FAAH have been described. A large number of FAAH inhibitors have also been synthesised and tested. For a long time, FAAH was considered as the only key enzyme hydrolysing endocannabinoids. But recent findings indicate that at least two other enzymes have critical role in the endocannabinoids degradation. Monoglyceride lipase participates in 2 -AG degradation and some data indicate that it is the primary mechanism for 2 -AG inactivation in intact neurons. N-palmitoylethanolamine-selective acid amidase (NPAA) is a second fatty acid amide hydrolase more active with N-palmitoylethanolamine, an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance.</b> The purpose of this review is to collect and compare the catalytic properties of these 3 key enzymes hydrolysing endocannabinoids...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work it was {{investigated}} in the animal model of anti-Thy 1 -induced chronic-progressive glomerulosclerosis of the rat for the first time, whether the progression {{of the disease and}} the associated loss of renal function could be attenuated by gavage of an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance</b> (mycophenolate mofetil, MMF), an anti-fibrotic substance (enalapril, ENA) and a combination of both substances. In the model of anti-Thy 1 -induced chronic glomerulosclerosis (cGS) uni-nephrectomized (NX) Wistar rats received a short-term immunological insult through i. v. injection of an antibody, which leads after a short time to a complement-dependent mesangial cell lysis. After setting this insult the renal damage progressed in a self-perpetuating, auto-progressive manner, without additional extrarenal influences, in contrast to hypertensive or diabetic nephropathies. This model allows to investigate in a unique manner purely intrarenal determinated processes, as they are taking place in the progression of chronic renal diseases. Altogether 56 rats were assigned into the following groups: a) 2 -N = no cGS/ no NX/ no therapy (n= 12); b) 1 -N = no cGS/ NX/ no therapy (n= 8); c) cGS = cGS/ NX/ no therapy (n= 8); d) cGS+MMF = cGS/ NX/ MMF therapy (n= 8); e) cGS+ENA = cGS/ NX/ ENA therapy (n= 8); f) cGS+MMF+ENA = cGS/ NX/ MMF and ENA therapy (n= 8). After a period of 15 weeks urine and blood was collected and the remained kidneys were removed after perfusion before sacrifizing the animals. For assessing renal function clinical parameters of relevancy for kidney function and representative markers for inflammation and fibrosis were determined. Therefore measurements of proteinuria (cGS 149 ± 14 mg/ 24 h: cGS+MMF 49 ± 14; cGS+ENA 43 ± 10; cGS+MMF+ENA 72 ± 19), systolic blood pressure (148 ± 8 mmHg: 126 ± 5; 124 ± 6; 123 ± 4), tubulointerstitial matrix accumulation (Matrix Score 2, 5 ± 0, 3 : 0, 9 ± 0, 3; 1, 1 ± 0, 3; 1, 1 ± 0, 2), tubulointerstitial expression of TGF-ß 1 (189 ± 31 pg/ mL: 91 ± 22; 87 ± 10; 107 ± 21), tubulointerstitial lymphocyte (112 ± 14, 4 CD 4 pos. cells/ section: 42 ± 18, 8; 45 ± 14, 7; 39 ± 8, 6) and macrophage infiltration (187 ± 23, 9 ED 1 -pos. cells/ section: 74 ± 19, 8; 53 ± 16, 2; 97 ± 12, 0) and levels of plasma creatinin (1, 2 ± 0, 28 mg/ dL: 0, 51 ± 0, 05; 0, 49 ± 0, 02; 0, 49 ± 0, 03) were determined. Furthermore tubulointerstitial fibronectin and PAI- 1 expression on protein and mRNA levels, as well as glomerular matrixprotein accumulation, expression of TGF-ß 1, fibronectin and PAI- 1 on protein and mRNA levels, glomerular lymphocyte (CD 4, CD 8) and macrophage infiltration, blood parameters, urea and GFR were analysed. The results of these parameters are following the representative results of the elected tubulointerstitial parameters. The present study reveals, that the component MMF is similar effective in the model of anti-Thy 1 -induced chronic glomerulosclerosis as the clinically established golden Standard enalapril in the treatment of chronic kidney diseases and that a combined therapy could not achieve additional effects in relevant parameters characterizing chronic renal disease. The here used pharmacological intervention is giving direct and indirect hints, that tubulointerstitial cellular infiltration and matrix accumulation are directed by using identical or at least very similar pathways in the progression of chronic kidney insufficiency The results of the present work are contrasting to other experimental studies performed in animal models, which achieved additional additive effects by using a combined anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic approach. This might be based on the fact, that divergent animal models (hypertensive nephropathy; cyclosporin-induced nephropathy) and relatively lower dosage of the substances were used. Nevertheless the results are comparable to a recently published study. Here a cohort of randomized patients with IgA-nephopathy pretreated with ACE-inhibitors received MMF in the follow up treatment. Consisting with the findings of this work patients revealed no signs of additional effects in the combined therapy compared to mono-therapy. Hence this work is an important contribution focussing at therapeutic strategies aiming at human chronic-progressive renal disease. The data of the animal experimental studies are proposing, that a combined therapy consisting of the primarily <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance</b> MMF and the primarily <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance</b> ENA provides no additional nephroprotective effects compared to the effects of administering mono-therapies solely. Summarizing the results of the work it can be proposed, that the pharmacological intervention targeted on influencing tissue inflammation and fibrosis represent similar or at least very closely interacting pathways mediating progression of chronic renal disease and that there is no benefit in treating patients in terms of chronic kidney disease with a dual therapeutic approach consisting of mycophenolate mofetil and enalapril...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAID) {{represent a}} {{one of the}} most widely used <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substances.</b> Their <b>anti-inflammatory</b> effects are mainly based on inhibition of cyclooxygenase. The potential direct effect of NSAID on leukocyte migration was poorly investigated. Using time-lapse microscopy and 96 -well fluorescence-based assay, we studied the effect of three different NSAID, ketoprofen, diclofenac and SC- 560, on leukocyte haptokinesis and haptotaxis in vivo and in vitro. Results NSAID induced an immediate inhibiting effect on leukocyte migration both in vitro and in vivo. This effect was dose-dependent and was not restricted to a specific type of leukocytes. The inhibition of leukocyte migration by NSAID was partially re-stored after removal of inhibiting agent. Only complete blockade of leukocyte migration was accompanied by a strong reduction of [Ca 2 +]i. Conclusions NSAID strongly supress leukocyte migration. The results of the present study may have important clinical implications since blockade of leukocyte migration can be achieved after topical application of NSAID. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mesalamine is the {{first-line}} {{therapy for}} colitis, but it lacks potency {{and is only}} effective for mild-to-moderate forms of this disease. Hydrogen sulfide {{has been shown to}} be a potent, endogenous <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance,</b> modulating leukocyte-endothelial adhesion and leukocyte migration. The purpose of this study was to det. if an H 2 S-releasing deriv. of mesalamine (ATB- 429) would exhibit increased potency and effectiveness in a mouse model of colitis. Colitis was induced in mice with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and the effects of ATB- 429 and mesalamine were compared in several treatment regimens. The severity of colitis was detd. using several indexes, including a disease activity score (comprised of scores for diarrhea, wt. loss and fecal blood), colonic myeloperoxidase activity and macroscopic/microscopic scoring of tissue injury. Irresp. of the treatment regiment, ATB- 429 was more effective than mesalamine in reducing the severity of colitis. ATB- 429 was particularly effective in reducing granulocyte infiltration into the colonic tissue (by. apprx. 70 %), as well as reducing the expression of mRNA for several key proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines (e. g., TNFa, IFNg). Treatment with ADT-OH, the H 2 S-releasing moiety of ATB- 429, did not affect severity of colitis. ATB- 429 exhibits a marked increase in anti-inflammatory activity and potency in a murine model of colitis, as compared to mesalamine. These results are consistent with recently described anti-inflammatory effects of H 2 S. ATB- 429 may represent an attractive alternative to mesalamine for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease...|$|E
40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs have}} been shown to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal cancers, but the propensity of these drugs to cause ulcers and bleeding limits their use. H 2 S {{has been shown to be}} a powerful cytoprotective and <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance</b> in the digestive system. This study explored the possibility that a H 2 S-releasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ATB- 346) would be effective in a murine model of hereditary intestinal cancer (APCMin+ mouse) and investigated potential mechanisms of action via transcriptomics analysis. Daily treatment with ATB- 346 was significantly more effective at preventing intestinal polyp formation than naproxen. Significant beneficial effects were seen with a treatment period of only 3 - 7 days, and reversal of existing polyps was observed in the colon. ATB- 346, but not naproxen, significantly decreased expression of intestinal cancer-associated signaling molecules (cMyc, β-catenin). Transcriptomic analysis identified 20 genes that were up-regulated in APCMin+ mice, 18 of which were reduced to wild-type levels by one week of treatment with ATB- 346. ATB- 346 is a novel, gastrointestinal-sparing anti-inflammatory drug that potently and rapidly prevents and reverses the development of pre-cancerous lesions in a mouse model of hereditary intestinal tumorigenesis. These effects may be related to the combined effects of suppression of cyclooxygenase and release of H 2 S, and correction of most of the APCMin+-associated alterations in the transcriptome. ATB- 346 may represent a promising agent for chemoprevention of tumorigenesis in the GI tract and elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|The new base of {{the pyramid}} that {{represents}} the Mediterranean Diet (MD) includes a balanced lifestyle, healthy cooking methods, traditional, local and eco-friendly products, conviviality, physical activity with an adequate amount of rest, as well as caloric restriction and food frugality. Moreover, it has been confirmed that {{the main source of}} MD fat is Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO). EVOO is considered a key feature of the healthy properties of the MD, due to its fatty acid, vitamin and polyphenol composition. However, these components need to be bioavailable to allow EVOO to exert its nutraceutical properties, which include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antiviral and hypoglycemic properties, as well as protective effects on the heart and brain, and during pregnancy and breast feeding. The main phenolic components responsible for the nutraceutical properties of EVOO are hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and oleuropein. The adopted oil production and extraction technologies, such as extraction at low oxidative stress, determine the final polyphenol content in virgin olive oil. Limited information on the epigenetic effects of olive polyphenols is presently available, although the epigenetic effects of many other plant polyphenols have been well documented. In this context, it has been found that, if mothers consume an adequate amount of olive oil during pregnancy, their children will be exposed to a lower risk of wheezing in the first period of their lives. In addition, EVOO, because of its oleochantal content, a natural <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substance,</b> may have an effect on many inflammatory diseases, even in the early period of life. <br /...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Surface biofunctional {{modification}} of coronary artery stents to prevent thrombosis and restenosis formation, {{as well as}} accelerate endothelialization, has become a new hot spot. However, bioactive coatings on implants are not yet sufficiently developed for long-term activity, as they quickly lose efficiency in vivo and finally fail. On {{the basis of a}} novel time-ordered concept of biofunctionality for vascular stents, heparin/poly L-lysine nanoparticle (NP) was developed and immobilized on a polydopamine-coated titanium surface, with the aim of regulating and maintaining the intravascular biological response within the normal range after biomaterial implantation. An in vitro dynamic release model was established to mimic the blood flow condition in vivo with three phases: (1) An early phase (1 − 7 days) with release of predominantly anticoagulant and <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substances</b> and to a minor degree antiproliferative effects against smooth muscle cells (SMCs); (2) this is followed by a phase (7 − 14 days) of supported endothelial cell (ECs) proliferation an...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether obesity, inflammation, or conventional risk factors {{are related to}} depressive symptoms (DeprSy) in the general population. Responses to 3 questions served to assess sense of depression. Body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP), and other epidemiologic data of participants were available. In 1940, individuals who consulted a psychiatrist in the preceding year, or felt depressed (together DeprSy), 248 were female. Logistic regressions for adjusted associations of BMI with DeprSy were not significant as was serum CRP level. Diabetes and, in men, fasting glucose concentrations were associated with DeprSy. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was robustly inversely associated with DeprSy in diverse models at ORs of 0. 74 (95 %CI 0. 63; 0. 89) independent of confounders, including antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication. The use of antidepressants could not explain the reduced BP. Women are predisposed to depression with which, not BMI and CRP, but SBP is inversely associated. <b>Anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substances</b> produced in depressed persons might explain the slightly lower BP...|$|R
40|$|A {{number and}} variety of {{hypotheses}} have been proposed to explain the primary mechanism of action of the antirheumatic drugs. A critical review is made of the biochemical and pharmacological parameters which, on current evidence, parallel the clinical activity of the drugs. The numerous chemical mediators of the inflammatory response are discussed, as is the possible role of endogenous <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>substances.</b> Particular {{attention is paid to}} the plasma protein-bincling effects of antirheumatic drugs and the competitive displacement theory of drug action is examined in the light of recent work on the behaviour of L-tryptophan bincling in vitro and in vivo. It is suggested that antirheumatic drugs can be differentiated by their influence on the acute-phase protein response and their effects on tryptophan bincling. Clinical finclings are reviewed to support the proposal that drugs such as alcofenac, which both inhibit the acute-phase response and exert prolonged influence on the bincling of tryptophan to plasma proteins, reduce inflammatory activity more profoundly than those drugs which produce symptomatic relief alone. They are capable, therefore, of altering the course of the disease. Read More: [URL]...|$|R
