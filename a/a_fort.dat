5|$|Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset, England, {{near the}} village of Tickenham. It is a {{scheduled}} monument. Although primarily known as <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> during the Iron Age it is likely, from artefacts, including a bronze spear or axe head, discovered at the site, that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the Anglo-Saxon period. It has been associated with Arthurian England and Camelot; however {{there is no evidence to}} support this.|$|E

5|$|California {{was quickly}} granted {{statehood}} in 1850 and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> on Alcatraz Island {{to secure the}} San Francisco Bay. Silver discoveries, including the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further drove rapid population growth. With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city, lawlessness was common, and the Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals, prostitution, and gambling.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{unable to}} find any {{evidence}} of <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> in the area, the soldiers went back down Fishing Creek to Bloomsburg. Dissatisfied with their findings, the soldiers conducted a search of several unfortified homes in northern Columbia County. They captured a number of residents of Sugarloaf Township on August 31, but these were soon released.|$|E
5|$|Excavation {{evidence}} {{from all the}} imperial borders which suggests that late forts were designed to accommodate much smaller garrisons than their predecessors from the Principate. Where such sites can be identified with forts listed in the Notitia, {{the implication is that}} the resident units were also smaller. Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> just one-seventh the size of a typical Principate legionary base, implying a strength of c. 750 men. At Abusina on the Danube, the Cohors III Brittonum was housed in <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> only 10% the size of its old Trajanic fort, suggesting that it numbered only around 50 men. The evidence must be treated with caution as identification of archaeological sites with placenames in the Notitia is often tentative and again, the units in question may be detachments (the Notitia frequently shows the same unit in two or three different locations simultaneously). Nevertheless, the weight of the archaeological evidence favours small sizes for frontier units. Archaeological evidence suggests that the army in Britain in ca. 400 just one-third its size in 200 (17,500 effectives versus 55,000).|$|E

50|$|A contravallation may be {{constructed}} {{in cases where}} the besieging army is threatened by a field army allied to <b>an</b> enemy <b>fort.</b> This is <b>a</b> second line of fortifications outside the circumvallation, facing away from <b>an</b> enemy <b>fort.</b> The contravallation protects the besiegers from attacks by allies of the city's defenders and enhances the blockade of <b>an</b> enemy <b>fort</b> by making it more difficult to smuggle in supplies.|$|R
5|$|Fort Wright was {{the first}} Confederate Army {{fortification}} built at Randolph. On January 20, 1861, the Memphis Appeal published a pro-secessionist proposal to build <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> at Randolph to defend Memphis. In April 1861, Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered to establish a camp and complete the fortification at Randolph. About 5,000 troops from Tennessee, Arkansas and the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task. By June 1861, fifty cannons were reported to be ready at Fort Wright.|$|E
5|$|Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent {{to build}} <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began {{construction}} of the fort, the first European habitation {{at the site of}} present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and built Fort Duquesne.|$|E
5|$|In April 1784, the Rowans {{and five}} other {{families}} set out for a tract of land on the Long Falls of the Green River that Rowan had purchased before leaving Pennsylvania. The party arrived on May 11, 1784, and constructed <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> which they dubbed Fort Vienna. The fort, then located approximately 100 {{miles from the nearest}} white settlement, is the present-day town of Calhoun. The settlers at Fort Vienna frequently clashed with the Shawnee who used the area as a hunting ground. The Rowans would remain at Fort Vienna for six years.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to British outposts on the Atlantic coast at Tangier and the Cumberland Islands, {{there was a}} similar outpost on the Gulf coast at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River in Spanish East Florida which attracted Redstick Creek Indians and Black Seminoles. George Woodbine and a detachment of Royal Marines were landed from HMS Orpheus in May 1814 with gifts, two thousand muskets and blankets for the Indians. <b>A</b> <b>fort</b> was constructed, and Cochrane sent Edward Nicolls to oversee the operations at Prospect Bluff.|$|E
5|$|In late April, {{leading a}} fleet of seven ships and over 700, Phips sailed from Boston to the Acadian capital, Port Royal. On May 9 he summoned {{governor}} Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Meneval to surrender. Meneval, in command of about 70 men and <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> in disrepair, promptly negotiated terms of capitulation. When Phips came ashore the next day, {{it was discovered that}} Acadians had been removing valuables, including some that were government property (and thus were supposed to come under the victor's control).|$|E
5|$|In mid-May 1695 García again marched southwards from Campeche, with 115 Spanish {{soldiers}} and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers.

5|$|In {{preparations}} {{for his next}} campaign, Germanicus sent Publius Vitellius and Gaius Antius to collect taxes in Gaul, and instructed Silius, Anteius, and Caecina to build a fleet. <b>A</b> <b>fort</b> on the Lippe called Castra Aliso was besieged, but the attackers dispersed on sight of Roman reinforcements. The Germans destroyed the nearby mound and altar dedicated to his father Drusus, but he had them both restored and celebrated funerary games with his legions {{in honor of his}} father. New barriers and earthworks were put in place, securing the area between Fort Aliso and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{dominance}} of the Gelug sect of Buddhism in Tawang, the Nyingmapa or the Black Hat sect of Buddhism was dominant and this resulted in their hegemony and even hostile approach towards the founder, Merek Lama. This problem was compounded by the Drukpas of Bhutan, who also belonged to the Nyingmapa sect, who even tried to invade and take control of Tawang. Hence, when the Tawang monastery was built like <b>a</b> <b>fort</b> structure, a strategic location was chosen from the defense point of view.|$|E
5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences.

In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into <b>a</b> <b>fort.</b> The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
