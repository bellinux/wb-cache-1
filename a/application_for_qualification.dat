40|$|The {{competition}} of maintenance {{services in the}} offshore wind industry is continually increasing. The quality of the services acts as the distinguishing feature in the industry. Furthermore, there are public standards, which lead to the permanent necessity to offer {{further education and training}} programs for employees. To meet the requirements for further training in the specific field of application within the offshore wind industry, a gamified e-learning application has been developed and is introduced in this paper. It consists of a complete solution, which contains the automated analysis of service protocols to identify qualification needs, the involvement of service technicians in the generation of learning materials, the preparation, transmission as well as the further development of those materials in accordance with the principles of e-learning. Finally, the solution contains a gamified mobile <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>qualification,</b> which is designed to meet the individual learning needs of the service technicians. This concept paper follows a problem-centred approach. Based on the current state of technology and research, the problem and motivation are identified and the urgency is verified. Furthermore, a detailed specification of the solution and a first implementation approach is presented...|$|E
40|$|Building on {{companion}} work {{investigating the}} efficacy of financial statement insurance (FSI) {{as an alternative to}} traditional auditor liability (ssrn. com/abstract= 554863), this Article presents the terms of a national enabling statute to implement this concept. The Model Financial Statement Insurance Act uses the architecture of the U. S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939. It authorizes issuer <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>qualification,</b> in connection with annual proxy statement filings, of policies of financial statement insurance. The Model FSI Act deems a series of provisions necessary to achieve securities law objectives to be part of all financial statement insurance policies so proposed, and requires insurers to possess characteristics relating to financial capacity, independence from issuers and adequate regulatory supervision. It empowers the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue stop orders against such applications in cases where insurers lack such qualifications. Qualifying policies are put to security holder vote and become effective when a registered public accounting firm engaged by the insurer issues an unqualified opinion that the financial statements provide a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Later-discovered material misstatements result in covered losses under the policy, administered in accordance with terms the Model FSI Act deems included, along with other tailored policy terms not in contravention of the Act. While using a United States template, the Model FSI Act is designed to be adaptable for use in other countries and jurisdictions of the world...|$|E

40|$|Thermal simulation, measuring, {{modeling}} {{and testing of}} integrated circuits requires special CAD tools. A key problem of the thermal representation is the modeling of the IC chip and the package system. This paper focuses to the identification algorithm and the related modeling tool which is capable to generate automatically the compact model of thermal subsystems. The model generation {{is based on the}} thermal responses obtained either from thermal simulation using, for example, FEM tools or from measurements. Two important uses of this method are presented in the paper: the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> the <b>qualification</b> and compact model generation of IC packages and for the package consideration and thermal transfer impedance modeling for electro-thermal simulation...|$|R

These stability classes specify the tolerance on temperature coefficients together with the permissible change of capacitance after defined tests. They are divided into different temperature coefficient grades (α) with associated tolerances and preferred values of permissible change of capacitance after mechanical, ambient (moisture) and life time tests.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Radiographic {{simulation}} of thick components represents a particular challenge, since the Monte-Carlo methods generally applied to obtain accurate scattering predictions are inherently slow, {{and as such}} not suited to <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> inspection procedure <b>qualification,</b> where {{a large number of}} parameter variations has to be studied in a reasonable time. We present a generic radiographic modeling code, which overcomes this impediment by combining a Monte-Carlo approach with a simple straight-line attenuation model and an analytical film-foil model. The code MODERATO has been thoroughly validated and is now used to perform parametric studies for performance demonstration purposes. Introduction: When modeling radiographic inspections for thin components, scattered radiation can often be entirely ignored. In the intermediate thickness range, a commonly used approach accounts for scattered radiation with tabulated build-up factors, often obtained previously with Monte-Carlo codes. For these situations, straight line attenuation models are sufficient to obtain reasonably accurate results. Another approach which has recently attracted interest in th...|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} of a testing system is established by application of various methodologies {{to determine the}} probability of detection (POD). One accepted metric of an adequate testing system {{is that there is}} 95 % confidence that the POD is greater than 90 % (90 / 95 POD). Design of experiments for vali-dating probability of detection (DOEPOD) {{capability of}} nondestructive testing systems is a diagnostic tool providing detailed analysis of POD test data, guidance on establishing data distribution require-ments and resolving test issues. DOEPOD demands utilization of observation of occurrences. The DOEPOD capability has been developed to provide an efficient and accurate methodology that yields observed POD and confidence limits for both hit/miss or signal amplitude testing. DOEPOD does not assume prescribed POD logarithmic or similar functions with assumed adequacy over a wide range of discontinuity sizes and testing system technologies, so multiparameter curve fitting or model optimization approaches to generate a POD curve are not required.
