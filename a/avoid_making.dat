5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Most Egyptian {{vultures}} in the subtropical zone of Europe migrate {{south to}} Africa in winter. Like many other large soaring migrants, they <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> long crossings over water. Italian birds cross over through Sicily and into Tunisia making short sea crossings by {{passing through the}} islands of Marettimo and Pantelleria. Those that migrate through the Iberian Peninsula cross into Africa over the Strait of Gibraltar while others cross further east through the Levant. In summer, some African birds fly further north into Europe and vagrants have been recorded in England and southern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Yasuhara {{wanted the}} game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was {{redesigned}} many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The development team read each issue of Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they can <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> the same mistakes.|$|E

5|$|For the {{original}} Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi required a larger production team than Square's previous titles. He began crafting the game's story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different {{approach has been}} taken for subsequent titles; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each title should have a minimum number of common elements. The development teams strive to create completely new worlds for each title, and <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out {{as a base for}} entire structures.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ella {{intensified}} {{quickly and}} reached hurricane status late on August31, based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a Hurricane Hunters flight. At the time, the hurricane was forecast to <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> landfall on North Carolina and ultimately turn northeastward, {{although it was}} expected to pass within 50miles (85km) of land during the busy Labor Day Weekend. On September1, Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a major hurricane and a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At {{the same time a}} short-wave trough reached the East Coast of the United States. The trough caused the hurricane to decelerate and turn slightly to the north, and a ridge behind the trough caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24hours. During that time, the threat toward the North Carolina coast diminished, and concurrently, the winds decreased as the convection diminished.|$|E
5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E

5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised {{him as a man}} who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E
5|$|Pixar got {{its start}} in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's (NYIT) founder Alexander Schure, who was also {{the owner of a}} {{traditional}} animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film. Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab. Schure kept pouring money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles. Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in order to reach their goal, and when George Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to move over to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> Schure suspicious, before they joined The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld lost {{hydraulic}} {{pressure on the}} grid; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same {{because he had a}} fuel leak in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race. Button made a pit stop {{at the end of the}} lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine made a good start, rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while Häkkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane to <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen made the best start, moving from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, de la Rosa, Irvine, Verstappen, Räikkönen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, Häkkinen, Panis, Frentzen, Alonso, Enge, Heidfeld, Yoong, Fisichella and Button.|$|E

25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often forget to put things back in their proper place, or Am careful to <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put things back in their proper place or Am careful to <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E
