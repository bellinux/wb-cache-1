40|$|AbstractAcid {{fracturing}} {{treatment is}} the key technique for stimulation and stable production in carbonate reservoirs. In order to improve the carbonate reservoirs acid fracturing effect, in this paper, {{with a large number}} of experiments as the main research methods, study on influencing factors of <b>acid-fracturing</b> effect for carbonate reservoirs from increase the effective distance of living acid, increase acid corrosion eched fracture conductivity, reduce the acid fluid loss, etc. The effective distances of live acid calculated with reacted acid limitations measured in different acid systems are quite different from those calculated according to previous standard. Fracture conductivity {{is one of the key}} parameters that affects acid fracturing effects, but it's difficult to be predicted accurately due to the strong randomness of acid-rock reaction as well as various influence factors. Analyses of the impacts on fracture conductivity resulted from the rock embedment intensity, closure stress, acid dosage, rock-acid contact time, acid fluid loss, acid pumping rate through self-developed small-core fracture capacity test instrument. Fluid loss during acid fracture can be well controlled by thickened liquid as well as solid particles, but formation damage occurs inevitably. Foamed acid is a specific fluid with high viscosity, low fluid loss, small friction resistance, good retarding property, strong fracture making ability, easy flowback and low damage, which is an ideal acid system for low pressure and low permeability carbonate reservoirs. In this paper, the theoretical study on percolation mechanism and fluid-loss control mechanism of foam (acid) in porous medium are presented with the help of visual microscopic model fluid drive unit...|$|E
30|$|A sharp {{reduction}} in gas well deliverability is often observed in many low-permeability gas-condensate reservoirs even {{at very high}} reservoir pressure. The decrease in well deliverability is attributed to condensate accumulation and water blocking (Li and Firoozabadi 2000; Allen and Roe. 1950; Barnum. 1995; Wagner and Leach 1958). As the pressure drops below the dew point, liquid accumulates at the wellbore in high saturations reducing gas relative permeability (Tang and Firoozabadi 2003; Fahes and Firoozabadi 2005), {{the result is a}} decrease in the gas production rate. Gas deliverability often increases after removal of water and condensate phases from the near-wellbore region. Several techniques have been used to increase gas well deliverability after the initial decline. Hydraulic fracturing and solvent injection are implemented in order to remove the accumulated liquid (Tannich 1975; Holditch 1979). The increased rates were, however, only sustained for a period. The approach is not a permanent solution to the problem as the condensate bank will form again. On the other hand, when hydraulic fracturing is used by injecting aqueous fluids, the clean-up of water accumulation from the formation after fracturing is essential to obtain an increased productivity. Water is removed in two phases, immiscible displacement by gas, followed by vaporization by the expanding gas flow (Mahadevan and Sharma 2003). Due to the low permeability and the wettability characteristics, {{it takes a long time}} to perform the clean-up; in some cases, as little as 10 – 15  % of the water load could be recovered. In a new approach, Li and Firoozabadi examined the alteration of wettability to intermediate gas-wetting by chemical treatment of the rock. A major factor in liquid accumulation is the liquid’s low mobility because of strong liquid-wetting (Walker et al. 2005; Zuluaga and Monsalve 2003). By altering the wettability of the rock from liquid-wetting to intermediate gas-wetting, an increase in liquid mobility is achieved, preventing the accumulation of liquid in high saturations and resulting in high rates of gas production (Boom and Zeelenberg 1996; Fahes and Firoozabadi 2005). The work of Firoozabadi and coworkers on wettability alteration may have a practical application in improving gas effective permeability due to the prevention of liquid accumulation in high saturations at the wellbore; the main requirement is the permanent alteration of wettability. Tang and Firoozabadi performed wettability alteration and measured the effect of wettability alteration on increased liquid mobility. The major goal of this work was to study the mobility of the gas and liquid phase (both water and oil) before and after wettability alteration from strong liquid-wetting to intermediate gas-wetting. For this purpose, in addition to relative permeability measurements, we also conducted various other tests to demonstrate that liquid mobility can be improved significantly due to wettability alteration. The alteration of wettability was achieved by treating the rock with the Zonyl 8740 solution at 24  °C. This paper is organized along the following lines: First, the description of rocks, model reservoir fluids, chemicals used in treating the rocks, and the treatment procedure were presented. Then, the measurements of contact angle, imbibition, and flow testing were described, and in the section that follows, the results of these measurements in treated and untreated cores are presented. At the end, conclusions from the work were drawn. Note that the wettability alteration to gas-wetness may also be applied in drilling and completion to reduce the water loss to tight gas formation, in water shutoff in tight gas reservoirs with bottom water, and <b>acid-fracturing</b> to contain secondary formation damage in low-permeability gas reservoirs.|$|E

The productive interval consists {{of thousands of}} feet of interbedded fractured clastic and carbonate beds deposited in a fluvial-dominated deltaic lacustrine environment. Wells in the Bluebell field are typically completed by perforating 40 or more beds over 1, 000 to 3, 000 vertical feet (300 - 900 m), then applying an <b>acid-fracture</b> stimulation treatment to the entire interval. This completion technique is believed to leave many potentially productive beds damaged and/or untreated, while allowing water-bearing and low-pressure (thief) zones {{to communicate with the}} wellbore.

The objective of this study was to discuss the selection of the applicable probe type, scanning method, scanning times and procedure of magnetic memory method in response to different high pressure manifolds types. And according to the inspection instances, it was certified that the stress concentration degree can be detected and assessed by the magnetic memory method, and thereby the service life of the high pressure manifolds can be forecasted. Furthermore, the common defects of the high pressure manifolds, such as transverse and longitudinal linear defects, etch pits and wall thickness reduction, can also be detected by magnetic memory method. And the inspection results won’t be influenced if the stress were released. Key words:Magnetic memory method; High pressure manifolds; Stress concentratio...|$|R
