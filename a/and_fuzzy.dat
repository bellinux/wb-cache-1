5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of the game and}} of its characters led Valve to develop merchandise for Portal made available through its online Steam store. Some of the more popular items were the Weighted Companion Cube plush toys <b>and</b> <b>fuzzy</b> dice. When first released, both were sold out in under 24 hours. Other products available through the Valve store include T-shirts and Aperture Science coffee mugs and parking stickers, and merchandise relating to the phrase the cake is a lie, which has become an internet meme. Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be as popular as they were, while other elements they had expected to become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.|$|E

For the second year in a row, his rushing yards total was second to Jim Brown of the Cleveland Browns. Taylor was selected as the second-team fullback behind Brown on the United Press International (UPI) All-Pro team, and finished second in voting behind Brown for the Associated Press (AP) team. The Packers again reached the NFL title game, this time defeating the New York Giants with a 37–0 shutout. Taylor had 69yards on 14 attempts while playing despite badly damaged ribs, as Hornung carried most of the load for Green Bay.|$|E
500|$|Mouna Ragam {{provides}} {{insight into}} the issues faced by married couples, exploring the plight and perception of divorce and how societies need to view the desires of women. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan compared the film to J.

Rakesh Mehar of The News Minute noted that one thing differentiating Mouna Ragam from Antha Ezhu Naatkal and similar films is that it remains focused on Divya. Kumuthan Maderya, writing for PopMatters, described Mouna Ragam a [...] "chick flick", because like other chick flicks, the film allowed romance to blossom between Divya and Chandrakumar, rather than let divorce split them; according to him, [...] "chick flicks center on the romantic worldview of females while gratifying their hopes and dreams usually through a warm <b>and</b> <b>fuzzy</b> denouement".|$|E

This fictional documentary within a pseudo-documentary form {{may be the most}} overrated, under-financed piece of film to come down the pike in a long time." [...] A critic from The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "The concept is clever, suggesting a new way to build horror-movie suspense without much on-camera gore.

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's {{welcoming}} aesthetics, and some, its visual design. Kill Screen considered the game's affect delightful and Destructoid said its bright color scheme and rubber-like surfaces were disarming and recalled {{the feel of}} an inflatable castle. Polygon reviewer described the title as having [...] "old-school sensibilities" [...] in its arcade-style visual design, with simple geometry and flat 2D art. He added that the game succeeds in particular because of its [...] "goofy tone" [...] and [...] "delightful wrapper" [...] of music, scrolling ticker, and fanciful announcers, which managed to charm him without appearing inauthentic. GameSpot reviewer wrote that Videoball audiovisual replication of 1990s-era Sega aesthetics triggered instant [...] "warm <b>and</b> <b>fuzzy</b> ... nostalgia". Reviewers said that the game's visuals deceptively betrayed the depth of its gameplay. Calixto of Kill Screen concluded that Videoball [...] "feels like it's trying to knock down barriers to entry" [...] in its [...] "bubbly and peaceful" [...] visual design, with gradients and 90s Japanese arcade-style music. He thought, however, that the voiceovers were somewhat campy.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Mateiu Caragiale's originality, Călinescu saw in him [...] "a {{promoter}} (maybe the first) {{of literary}} Balkanism, that greasy mix of obscene phrases, lascivious impulses, awareness of an adventurous <b>and</b> <b>fuzzy</b> genealogy, everything purified and seen from above by a superior intelligence". In relation to Romanian literature, he {{believed to have}} discovered a common trait of [...] "Balkan" [...] writers of mostly Wallachian origin, citing Mateiu Caragiale in a group that also included Caragiale-father, the early 19th century aphorist and printer Anton Pann, the modern poets Tudor Arghezi, Ion Minulescu and Ion Barbu, and Urmuz. He went on to define this gathering as [...] "the great grimacing sensitive ones, buffoons with just too much plastic intelligence." [...] In parallel, Lovinescu saw Caragiale as one {{in a group of}} modernist prose writers who sought to reshape the genre through the use of lyricism, and were thus paradoxically outdated by 20th century standards. The delayed character of Caragiale's contribution was also mentioned by literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu, who identified its roots in Art Nouveau and, through it, the subjects of Byzantine art.|$|E
