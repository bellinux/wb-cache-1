5|$|On defense, Virginia Tech linebacker Ashley Lee's 15 tackles {{remains the}} most ever {{recorded}} by <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> defender in a bowl game. Three Tech players were tied for second on the team with eight tackles. Behind defensive MVP Burt, Miami had one player with eight tackles and two with seven. Fred Marion, one of the Hurricanes with seven tackles, also intercepted <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> pass and broke up another pass.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati {{gained a}} 7–0 {{lead in the}} first quarter, but Virginia Tech scored 10 {{unanswered}} points to take a 10–7 lead into halftime. In the second half, Virginia Tech extended its lead as its defense kept the Bearcats scoreless. <b>A</b> <b>Tech</b> field goal {{in the third quarter}} was followed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, and the game ended with Virginia Tech on top, 20–7.|$|E
5|$|Tech quarterback Maurice DeShazo {{was also}} {{a major part of}} the record-breaking Tech offense. DeShazo threw 22 {{touchdown}} passes during the regular season, setting what was then a school record. He completed 129 of 230passes for 2,080yards and seveninterceptions in addition to the touchdown record. DeShazo's favorite target passing the ball was wide receiver Antonio Freeman, who set <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> record with nine touchdown receptions during the regular season. Freeman caught 32passes for 644yards in addition to the touchdown mark.|$|E

5|$|Because Stanford {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech received it to begin the second half. After starting from their 21-yard line, the Hokies went three-and-out. Following <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> punt, Stanford's first drive {{of the second half}} began at its 41-yard line. Two plays gained 13yards and a first down, then Stanford began battering Virginia Tech with its passing offense. Luck threw four consecutive passes: the first was incomplete, but the next three went for 10, 17, and 18yards, respectively. This gave Stanford a first down at the Tech one-yard line. Three plays later, Owen Marecic crossed the goal line on a running play. The subsequent extra point was missed, and Stanford extended its lead to 19–12 with 8:47 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Despite being pinned {{against their}} own goal line, the Hokies {{initially}} had some success moving the ball. Taylor completed a two-yard pass, Evans ran for six yards, and Taylor ran for two yards on third down to earn a first down at the Tech 13-yard line. After <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> timeout, Darren Evans ran for five yards. On the next play, he broke free for a 32-yard run, advancing {{the ball to the}} 50-yard line. The Hokies were unable to capitalize on Evans' run, however, as on the next play, a pass from Taylor was intercepted by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood at the Cincinnati 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix {{did not pay}} Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but {{after six months of}} development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even <b>a</b> <b>tech</b> demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form.|$|E

5|$|Having {{regained the}} ball, Wake Forest {{answered}} Georgia Tech's drive {{with one of}} their own. Several Wake running backs rushed with the ball, but it was Wake Forest quarterback Riley Skinner who advanced the ball the most. He completed a 24-yard pass to Willie Idlette, then an eight-yard toss to Nate Morton. Inside Tech territory, Wake's offense stumbled. Skinner was sacked by <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> defender, and kicker Sam Swank was sent into the game to attempt a 45-yard field goal. Swank's kick was no good, and with 7:26 remaining in the second quarter, Georgia Tech still had a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|Prior to full production, {{the team}} created <b>a</b> <b>tech</b> demo in 2012 {{to test the}} {{creation}} and movement of highly detailed models and environments. This tech demo was titled Agni's Philosophy, which also acted as a test demo for the Luminous Studio engine which {{would be used for}} Final Fantasy XV. Character designs and modelling was overseen by Business Division 2; the team was led by Kazuaki Iwasawa, the character model supervisor. The character Crowe's hair was based on the hairstyle for the main female protagonist of Agni's Philosophy. The hairstyles for both Crowe and Lunafreya were first modelled using a real mannequin wig to ensure they could be managed. Their fully rendered wigs were composed of three thousand curves each, a thousand more than originally estimated.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

5000|$|<b>As</b> with guitar <b>techs,</b> <b>a</b> bass <b>tech</b> also {{sets up the}} {{amplification}} {{equipment and}} effects pedals. Due to the lower pitch of the bass guitar, this instrument is amplified with specialized bass instrument amplifiers. While bass guitarists do not usually use as many effects pedals as most guitarists (e.g., reverb, chorus, flanger, etc.), most professional bassists may use a few [...] "sound conditioner" [...] effects such as a compressor, limiter, or equalizer. Some bassists also use octave pedals to generate extremely low pitches or bass overdrive pedals that produce a fuzzy, distorted sound. Although these effects function {{in the same way}} as regular electric guitar effects, <b>a</b> bass <b>tech</b> must be familiar with the settings and the resulting sounds and tones that are most often used by bass guitarists. <b>A</b> guitar <b>tech</b> who is in the first stages of learning to become <b>a</b> bass <b>tech</b> may know how to set up the bass effects from a technical point of view, but it may take a little longer for them to learn which compressor settings, for example, are associated with different funk or metal styles.|$|R

5|$|Tech {{recovered}} the punt at its 30-yard line and began its second possession. Lawrence rushed for five yards, and Miami committed a five-yard offsides penalty, giving Tech {{a first down}} by penalty. Dovel and Lawrence then combined for another first down after two plays. Tech was unable to gain another first down and punted the ball away. Attempting to field the ball, Miami's Fred Marion fumbled the ball, which was recovered by <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> defender at the Miami 25-yard line. Despite beginning with excellent field position, Tech was unable to score. On the first play after the fumble recovery, Tech attempted to run a trick play involving a pass by Lawrence. The pass was intercepted by a Miami defender at the Hurricanes' one-yard line, and Miami's offense returned to the field.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{returned}} Indiana's post-score kickoff to the 22-yard line, {{where the}} Hokie offense returned to action. Tech picked up nine yards on a pass from DeShazo, but two plays later, DeShazo threw his first interception {{of the game}} as Indiana's Mose Richardson jumped in front of <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> pass. Following the turnover, Indiana's offense began work from the Virginia Tech 31-yard line. The Hoosiers picked up a first down rushing the ball, but a holding call on first down pushed Indiana away from the end zone. Following the penalty, Virginia Tech's defense prevented the Hoosiers gaining another first down, and IU was forced to attempt another field goal. As before, Manopolous' kick—this one a 40-yard attempt—was good, and Indiana sliced Tech's lead to a single point, 1413, with 5:25 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 Peach Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1986 at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, fiveyears minus one day since Virginia Tech had last played in Atlanta for the 1981 Peach Bowl. Virginia Tech scored first, but NC State's Bulluck blocked <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> punt in the Tech end zone and {{recovered}} {{it for a}} tying touchdown. Virginia Tech kicked a field goal {{at the end of}} the quarter to take a 10–7 lead, but NC State fought back, scoring 14unanswered points in the second quarter to take a 21–10 lead by halftime.|$|E

5|$|The 23 points Tech {{allowed in}} the game marked just the third time that season Virginia Tech allowed more than 20points in a game. For his {{performance}} in the game, Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss was named the game's most valuable player on offense. Virginia Tech linebacker Vince Daniels was named the game's most valuable defensive player. Daniels had a game-leading 15tackles, tying <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> bowl-game record set by Ashley Lee in the 1981 Peach Bowl. The record still stands today. Meanwhile, Weiss completed six of his seven passes for 49 yards. His main success came rushing the ball, as he carried it 29times for 93yards and a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The Hurricanes' ground {{offense was}} led by Smokey Roan, who carried the ball 16 times for 86 yards. Second to Roan for Miami was Chris Hobbs, who contributed 66 yards and a {{touchdown}} on 10 carries. Hurricanes wide receiver Larry Brodsky finished with four catches for 80 {{yards and a touchdown}}. Miami turned the ball over four times {{during the course of the}} game. Tech's 80-yard touchdown drive in the third quarter remains tied for the longest ever recorded by <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> offense during a bowl game. Conversely, the 99-yard drive allowed to Miami remains the longest scoring drive Tech's defense has ever allowed in a bowl game.|$|E
5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech set several {{bowl game}} {{records in the}} Independence Bowl that still stand today. Tech allowed just two passing first downs, seven pass {{attempts}} and 49passing yards on defense. Conversely, the Hokies allowed 55rushing attempts by Air Force, a record for the most against Tech in a bowl game. Bart Weiss set a bowl-game record for most carries by a single player against Tech, and Falcons punter Mark Simon kicked a 63-yard punt that is the longest ever kicked by <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> opponent in a bowl game.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} ranked 11th nationally in scoring, {{averaging}} 36.4points per game, and 10th in rushing offense, averaging 242.8 yards per game. The totals {{were the most}} recorded to that point by a Virginia Tech offense. That high-ranking rushing attack was led by Dwayne Thomas, who accumulated 1,130yards and 11touchdowns during the regular season. Thomas' 11touchdowns were the most for <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> running back since 1969. Thomas was ably assisted by a capable offensive line anchored by center Jim Pyne, who earned consensus All-America honors in recognition of his performance. By being named to every All-America team in the country, Pyne became the first consensus All-American in Virginia Tech history.|$|E
5|$|Dodd's tenure {{included}} Georgia Tech's {{withdrawal from}} the Southeastern Conference. The initial spark for Dodd's withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham in 1961. After <b>a</b> <b>Tech</b> punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Granning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the signal for the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Granning's face causing severe fracturing in his face, a broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Granning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion, the result of which left him unable to play football ever again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Granning. Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd's interest in withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E
