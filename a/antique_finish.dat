25|$|Eagle Scout hat pins were {{produced}} from 1921 through 1958 with several variations. Eagle Scouts who earned additional merit badges were recognized using Eagle Palms, introduced in 1927. Adults who had earned Eagle Scout {{began to be}} recognized in 1934 with a red, white and blue ribbon bar. In 1940, a small eagle pin {{was added to the}} bar. Ribbon bars were replaced by embroidered square knot patches in 1947. Over the years, the knot was produced with various background colors to match the different uniforms. Although the Venturing and Sea Scout programs use different uniform shirts, the current knot is available only with a tan background that matches the Boy Scout uniform. When the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) was created in 1969, a gold-colored eagle device was introduced for wear on the Eagle Scout square knot. The Eagle Scout Mentor pin was introduced in early 2004 in a gold-colored version. In early 2006 it was changed to a silver-colored <b>antique</b> <b>finish</b> to match the mother and father pins but in 2007 was changed back to gold-colored. In 2008, the National Eagle Scout Association (NESA) introduced a knot recognizing those Eagle Scouts who are life members of NESA; it uses the standard knot emblem with a silver border.|$|E

40|$|Dhokra craftsmen, {{spread over}} Central Indian tribal belt and {{contiguous}} areas to the east, {{are engaged in}} making brass/bronze artefacts using the millennia- old lost-wax (cire per due) process of metal casting. (The name Dhokra is also applied to the process {{as well as the}} artifacts.) We have been working with Dhokra brass-craftsmen located in clusters in the Eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa. We have helped them with improving their technology, teaching them to use molten metal rather than metal scrap; soldering with brass rather than tin; and giving the artifact <b>antique</b> <b>finish</b> or gold finish as desired; We have also introduced them to the concept of measurement and levelling. We find that these craftsmen are quite aware of their own shortcomings and handicaps. They are willing to improve their process and skills provided this is done with empathy, in slow incremental stages and support continues till a new equilibrium state is required. They still need better wages and larger markets. Finding buyers for Dhokra artifacts through internet by emphasizing the civilizational significance of their work will ensure decent wages for these craftsmen; permit them to give form to their creative urges within the framework of tradition; and most importantly encourage their children to continue this fascinating art and craft...|$|E
40|$|Pyar Ke Taal is a Bollywood {{inspired}} Kathak {{number that}} depicts the dancer’s timeless love for dance and music. This “love story” is narrated with intricate footwork and eye movements. The dancer creates ornamental patterns {{in space and}} time to two very popular Bollywood songs, following the conventional Kathak structure from slow to fast tempo, ending with a dramatic climax. Although heavily rhythmic, this piece is infused with lyrical melodies, allowing the viewer to vicariously experience the vast array of sounds throughout the performance. The costume and jewelry presented in this piece are modernized, with a flavor of Bollywood. A traditional Kathak costume consists of a long, full-sleeved gown that is tight fitting above the waist and skirt-like below. Figure-fitting trousers cover the legs and give the appearance of cloth bangles with the many bells tied around the ankles. The skirt-like portion of the costume is cut in a way that during spins, the skirt flares out dramatically. The jewelry typically is gold and red with an <b>antique</b> <b>finish.</b> The most significant accessories are the 50 - 100 bells worn on the ankles; their distinctive sound complements and often even sets the rhythm for the dance. In this piece, just like in any Kathak piece, the beats are {{the heart and soul of}} the dance. Whether she is just moving her eyes, hands, feet, or any of these in combination, the dancer never skips a single beat. She eulogizes the beats as a way to express her sheer love for dance through two songs that describe this very love...|$|E
