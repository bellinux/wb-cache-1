5|$|The {{mobile phone}} {{version of the}} game is {{primarily}} a beat 'em up with role-playing elements. Unlike the console versions the game plays as a side-scroller in the same vein as the 1992 X-Men arcade game. There are five selectable characters, and players upgrade each through experience points earned. Players control one character at a time, and can switch to another at the press of <b>a</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though <b>a</b> <b>button</b> on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E
5|$|The {{caterpillars}} of many butterflies attach {{themselves by}} <b>a</b> <b>button</b> of silk to {{the underside of}} a branch or stone or other projecting surface. They remain attached to the silk pad by a hook-like process called a cremaster. Most chrysalids hang head downward, but in the families Papilionidae, Pieridae, and Lycaenidae, the chrysalis is held in a more upright position by a silk girdle around {{the middle of the}} chrysalis.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when <b>a</b> <b>button</b> is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a continue. The second type involves bouncing around {{a room with a}} slot machine in its center with the intention of winning extra lives and power-ups.|$|E

5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the <b>A</b> <b>button</b> is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of <b>a</b> <b>button.</b> Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E
5|$|Joust 2 is a 2D combat game {{taking place}} in the air and on landing platforms, like its predecessor. The player {{controls}} a yellow knight riding a flying ostrich and navigates the game world with a two-way joystick and <b>a</b> <b>button.</b> The joystick controls the horizontal direction that the knight travels, while pressing the button makes the ostrich flap its wings. The rate at which the player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend. The objective is to defeat groups of enemy knights riding buzzards that populate each level, referred to as a wave. Upon completing a wave, a more challenging one will begin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inside handle}} {{may have an}} {{affordance}} for locking the latchbolt: it may be <b>a</b> push <b>button,</b> <b>a</b> turn <b>button,</b> or may operate in both modes. It is {{referred to in the}} table as the [...] "inside locking mechanism".|$|R

5|$|Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses <b>a</b> <b>button</b> and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E
5|$|Mario and Princess Peach {{are walking}} {{together}} when lightning suddenly strikes Peach's castle nearby. As Mario runs to help, Bowser Jr. appears, {{sneaking up on}} the Princess from behind and kidnapping her. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and gives chase. Mario ventures through eight worlds pursuing Bowser Jr. and trying to rescue the kidnapped princess. Mario catches {{up to them and}} confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess from the young Koopa's clutches. At {{the end of the first}} world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father, Bowser, awaits Mario on a bridge over a pit filled with lava. In a scene highly reminiscent of the original Super Mario Bros., Mario activates <b>a</b> <b>button</b> behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava which burns his flesh, leaving a skeleton.|$|E

5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses <b>a</b> <b>button</b> to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as subtler choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E
5|$|Tank is an arcade game {{developed}} by Kee Games, {{a subsidiary of}} Atari, and released in November 1974. It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property {{developed by}} Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, in a central minefield. Each player controls their tank {{with a pair of}} joysticks, moving them forwards and back to drive, reverse, and steer, and firing shells with <b>a</b> <b>button</b> to attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long.|$|E
5|$|Tennis for Two is {{a sports}} video game {{developed}} in 1958, which simulates {{a game of}} tennis, {{and was one of}} the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution's Donner Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance. He designed the game, displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers, in a few hours, after which he and technician Robert V. Dvorak built it over three weeks. The game's visuals show a representation of a tennis court viewed from the side, and players adjust the angle of their shots with a knob on their controller and try to hit the ball over the net by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
