5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair <b>abridgement,</b> which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour {{on the part of the}} editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid <b>abridgement.</b> This distinction came with a later case involving an <b>abridgement</b> of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair <b>abridgement</b> eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On Bates's {{return to}} England, he was {{encouraged}} by Charles Darwin to write up his eleven-year stay in the Amazon as a book. The result was widely admired, not least by Darwin; other reviewers sometimes disagreed with the book's support for evolution, but generally enjoyed {{his account of the}} journey, scenery, people, and natural history. The book has been reprinted many times, mostly in Bates's own effective <b>abridgement</b> for the second edition, which omitted the more technical descriptions.|$|E

5|$|The History of Ferdinand and Isabella was {{published}} on Christmas Day, 1837 by the American Stationery Company, Boston, with a print run of 500copies. It {{was dedicated to}} his father. To the surprise of Prescott and the publisher, the book sold very well—the original print run was insufficient to adequately supply Boston's bookshops, let alone the whole nation's. It {{was first published in}} London by Richard Bentley in early 1838. The work received excellent critical reviews, both in America and in Britain, where Henry Vassall-Fox and Robert Southey expressed their admiration of the work. It was also noticed in France, despite the fact that a French translation was not available at the time. Prescott was adamant that his work should not be altered by anyone other than himself, and when he heard that his publishers were considering an <b>abridgement</b> of the History of Ferdinand and Isabella in June 1839, he produced an <b>abridgement</b> of the work himself, which resulted in the original project's cancellation. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in May 1839.|$|E
5|$|The {{case set}} a legal {{precedent}} which has shaped copyright law {{to the present}} day. It established the common law doctrine of fair <b>abridgement,</b> which was cited in other cases, ultimately building up {{to the idea of}} fair use. The opinion also recognised the author's right to a work through the nature of the labour it took to produce it, shifting copyright away from publishing rights and towards the idea of serving the greater good by encouraging the production of new, useful works.|$|E
5|$|Gyles v Wilcox (1740) 26 ER 489 was a {{decision}} of the Court of Chancery of England that established the doctrine of fair <b>abridgement,</b> which would later evolve into the concept of fair use. The case was heard and the opinion written by Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, and concerned Fletcher Gyles, a bookseller who had published a copy of Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown. Soon after the initial publication, the publishers Wilcox and Nutt hired a writer named Barrow to abridge the book, and repackaged it as Modern Crown Law. Gyles sued for a stay on the book's publishing, claiming his rights under the Statute of Anne had been infringed.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of The Lawyer to his Muse, his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published Elements of Architecture and An <b>Abridgement</b> of Architecture, two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction. His next work (1747) was The Pantheon: A Vision, an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light. This followed his election as a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford on 2 November 1743, and his call to the Bar by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.|$|E
5|$|Although Orion has a {{few lines}} in both Homeric poems and in the Works and Days, {{most of the stories}} about him are {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an <b>abridgement</b> of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E
5|$|Dušan had {{ambitions of}} conquering all the Byzantine lands, {{including}} Constantinople, and proclaiming himself Byzantine Emperor. In {{order to achieve}} this goal, {{he knew that he}} needed to secure the loyalty of his Greek subjects. Thus, Dušan decreed that lands inhabited by Greeks were to have Greek governors and follow traditional Byzantine laws as opposed to Serbian customary law. This had the effect of reducing tensions between Serbs and Greeks and made it easier for the Serbs to occupy Greek lands without any considerable threat of revolt. In 1349, Dušan issued a national legal code from his capital, Skopje, one that applied only to the northern half of the empire where Serbs predominated. Dušan's Code is Serbia's earliest surviving legal code; it was influenced heavily by Byzantine law. It {{was also one of the}} most advanced legal texts of its time, and the first wide-ranging set of laws promulgated by the South Slavs. Because it only covers specific crimes, it was likely part of a three-part legal document that also included an <b>abridgement</b> of Matthew Blastares' Syntagma and the Law of Justinian. The third part, Dušan's Code itself, was thus probably intended to supplement the first two texts by touching upon issues not covered in them rather than serve as a stand-alone legal system.|$|E
