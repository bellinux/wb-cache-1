5|$|Donayre's {{tenure as}} Commanding General {{of the army}} was {{controversial}} from the start due to corruption allegations <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>international</b> incident with Chile. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala criticized Donayre's designation as irregular because at that time he was not serving as general {{of any of the}} three major army divisions as stipulated by Peruvian law. As commander of the Army, Donayre was also accused of acquiring 50,000 American-made MREs— military rations— to supply troops deployed against Shining Path guerrillas in the Apurímac and Ene river valleys, instead of acquiring cheaper, locally-made alternatives. An attempt to buy 50,000 more rations led to an inquiry by the Ministry of Defense.|$|E
5|$|Dorset has {{a varied}} {{landscape}} featuring broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half {{the county is}} designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline {{is part of the}} Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>international</b> airport. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to one of Europe's largest outdoor shows. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.|$|E
5|$|During the First Balkan War, which {{broke out}} in the closing weeks of the Italo-Turkish War, Coatit <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>international</b> fleet was sent to {{safeguard}} foreign nationals in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople, which was threatened by a Bulgarian offensive. Neither ship saw action during World War I, though Agordat was involved in the occupation of Constantinople following the Ottoman defeat in November 1918. Both ships were reduced to secondary duties after the war, with Coatit being converted into a minelayer in 1919 and Agordat being reduced to a gunboat in 1921. Neither ship served for long in these new roles; Coatit was scrapped in 1920 and Agordat was sold to ship breakers in 1923.|$|E

5|$|For {{the match}} against Bristol Rovers in April, Shankly favoured an 18-year-old Ian Callaghan, {{considered}} by Liddell {{to be his}} successor. He received a standing ovation {{at the end of}} the match and ultimately broke Liddell's appearances record. Liddell's last league game came in the 1960–61 season, in a 1–0 defeat to Southampton. The match gave him the distinction of being the oldest footballer to play for the club in a post-war senior match (at 38 years and 224 days) until Kenny Dalglish in 1990. To recognise Liddell's 22-year service, Liverpool organised a testimonial in September between the club <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>International</b> XI at Anfield. The game had an attendance of 38,789 and generated £6,340 in revenue, enabling Liddell to purchase a home. He ended his career in the reserves and made his final appearance on 29 April 1961, scoring one of his side's five goals against Blackburn.|$|E
5|$|In the UEFA Champions League, Gourcuff {{assisted}} on Bordeaux's only {{goal in the}} club's opening 1–1 draw against Italian club Juventus {{scored by}} Jaroslav Plašil. On 30 September, Gourcuff suffered a groin injury in the club's 1–0 victory over Israeli club Maccabi Haifa, which forced him to miss two league matches <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>international</b> call up. Bordeaux lost both matches. He returned to the team for Bordeaux's back-to-back matches with German club Bayern Munich. In the first match, which Bordeaux won 2–1, Gourcuff missed a penalty after attempting to cheekily chip the ball over goalkeeper Hans-Jörg Butt, however in the second match, he made amends scoring the game-winning goal in Bordeaux's 2–0 victory at the Allianz Arena. Bordeaux eventually finished the group stage portion undefeated.|$|E
