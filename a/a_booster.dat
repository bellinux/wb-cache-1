5|$|By 1980, Shabazz was {{overseeing}} the health sciences department, {{and the college}} president decided she could {{be more effective in}} a purely administrative position than she was in the classroom. She was promoted to Director of Institutional Advancement. In her new position, she became <b>a</b> <b>booster</b> and fund-raiser for the college. A year later, she was given tenure. In 1984, Shabazz was given a new title, Director of Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs; she held that position at the college until her death.|$|E

5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon Missile, <b>a</b> <b>booster</b> propelled {{the missile}} {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E

5|$|At Cranbrook, Romney helped {{manage the}} ice hockey team, {{and he joined}} the pep squad. During his senior year, he joined the cross country running team. He belonged to eleven school {{organizations}} and school clubs overall, including the Blue Key Club, <b>a</b> <b>booster</b> group that he had started. During his final year there, his academic record improved but fell short of excellence. Romney was involved in several pranks while attending Cranbrook. He has since apologized for those, stating {{that some of the}} pranks may have gone too far. In March of his senior year, he began dating Ann Davies; she attended the private Kingswood School, the sister school to Cranbrook. The two became informally engaged around the time of his June 1965 graduation.|$|E
5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, <b>a</b> <b>booster</b> group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, {{the number of visitors}} to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. <b>A</b> <b>booster</b> vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Vaccines {{typically}} contain {{one or more}} adjuvants, used {{to boost}} the immune response. Tetanus toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto alum.

People who have an adverse reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when the time comes for <b>a</b> <b>booster.</b>|$|E

25|$|Booster {{shots are}} {{important}} because lymphocyte production (antibodies) is not at a constant high rate of activity. This is because after {{the introduction of the}} vaccine when lymphocyte production is high, the production activity of the white blood cells will start to decline. The decline in activity of the T-helper cells means that there must be <b>a</b> <b>booster</b> to help keep the white blood cells active.|$|E

25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{are typically}} given to age 9 to 26 as the vaccine is only effective if given before infection occurs.

The high cost of this vaccine has been a cause for concern. Several countries have considered (or are considering) programs to fund HPV vaccination.|$|E
