40|$|Longterm hydrochemical {{research}} in forested catchment in Petrohan {{area has been}} carried out for risk assessment of water acidification. The time series are 27 years long. Deposition shows declining sulfate and nitrogen. The concentration of base cations has been decreased in both bulk precipitation and surface water showing the decrease of the neutralizing capacity of stream water. The mean value of pH for spring water have been averaged as 5. 99 pH units and for stream water at the same catchment area 6, 68 pH units respectively. It has been found that the ratio between the sum of base cations (K+, Na+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) and the sum of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants,</b> like nitrogen sulfate and chloride, has been decreased for the period 1986 - 2013. Critical loads of acidity, sulfur and nitrogen have been calculated {{in order to determine the}} sensitivity of water bodies to the <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> and the results obtained showed different sensitivity.

40|$|Sensitive receptors such as {{soil and}} fresh {{bodies of water}} are {{at the end of}} a long chain of events in the process of {{regional}} acidification. This chain begins thousands of kilometers upwind at the emitters of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The topics covered in this book are important in the study of regional acidification for two reasons. First, it is important to assess the sensitivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to the deposition of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants.</b> If the sensitivity of an ecosystem is known, then international control strategies can be developed to reduce deposition in the receptor areas of greatest importance. This is an important factor in designing the most effective strategies because of the very high costs of reducing emissions of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Second, it is important to be able to predict changes in ecosystems for decades into the future, whether it be an improvement owing to decreases in acidifying emissions or, alas, a further deterioration because control strategies are nonexistent or inadequate. In either event, it is important to be able to judge the results of our actions. Decision makers tend to be mistrustful of models unless they can judge their reliability. The application and testing of the models in Part III of this book cover, therefore, an important facet of model building. This book is an ideal companion to another book that is forthcoming from the Transboundary Air Pollution Project at IIASA: The RAINS Model of Acidification: Science and Strategies in Europe. The latter book is a description of the development and use of the Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation (RAINS) model, an integrated assessment model for developing and determining control strategies to reduce regional acidification in Europe.

40|$|Due {{to forest}} fragmentation, forest edges as ecotone {{boundaries}} between forest and open area such as heathland, pasture, or agricultural land are increasingly dominant features in landscapes around the world. In Flanders, {{the northern part}} of Belgium, forests are strongly fragmented: the relative amount of forest edge in the total forested area amounts to almost 60 % when considering an edge depth of only 50 m. Forest edges have a vast influence on the flux of nutrients or pollutants from the atmosphere towards the forest ecosystem. Due to these so-called edge effects, throughfall deposition of nitrogen (N) and potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> [sulfate (SO 42 -), nitrate (NO 3 -), and ammonium (NH 4 +) ] is enhanced {{from the front of the}} edge to up to more than 100 m from the edge, by up to a fourfold compared with the forest interior. On top of that, Flanders suffers from N and SO 42 - deposition levels that are among the highest in Europe. In the interior of forests, high levels of N (NHx + NOy) and sulphur (S, SOx) deposition are associated with N saturation, increased levels of nitrate seepage, soil acidification, and eventually vitality decreases, floristic shifts, and declines in forest biodiversity. These facts argue for mitigating measures that reduce the input of N and potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> in forest ecosystems. In order to formulate recommendations for the design and management of forest edges for the mitigation of edge effects, we tried to get insight into (i) the impact of forest type and edge structure on the extent of edge effects on throughfall deposition, and (ii) the impact of enhanced input of N and potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> on two ecosystem responses at edges, i. e., nitrate seepage and soil acidification. For this reason, we sampled throughfall deposition, soil solution, and soil and determined stand structure characteristics along transects perpendicular to edges of contrasting forest stands, from the edge front up to a distance of 128 m from the edge. We focused on forest ecosystems on sandy soils, which are most vulnerable to nitrate seepage and soil acidification, and in regions with intensive livestock breeding and consequently high NH 3 emissions. In addition, a wind tunnel study was performed in which we simulated edge effects in model forests with differing structure. Two field studies demonstrated that the throughfall deposition of N and potentially acidifying deposition in pine stands are subject to edge effects that penetrate the forest to a deeper extent and cause a higher level of deposition enhancement at the edge front than in deciduous oak and birch stands. The additional input of N and potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the oak and birch stands was 10 to 15 times lower than in the pine stands. The difference between a pine and an adjacent birch edge in additional input was higher for the potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> than for the so-called base cations. This indicates that the higher additional input of potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> in pine edges is not compensated by a higher input of ‘potentially neutralising’ base cations, so higher rates of soil acidification can be expected at pine edges in comparison with birch edges. By means of a wind tunnel study and two field studies, the impact of edge structure on edge patterns of (throughfall) deposition was explored. In the wind tunnel study, a gradual forest edge (i. e., a gradual transition of vegetation height in front of the forest edge) deflected the wind flow and decelerated wind speed in front of the forest. Consequently, it induced a decrease in the level of deposition enhancement at the edge front in comparison with a steep forest edge, particularly in sparse forest models. A field study, in which throughfall deposition patterns were measured in adjacent steep and gradual edges, confirmed the wind tunnel results on the lower level of deposition enhancement at gradual edges, but also pointed to a decrease in penetration depth of edge effects. With a steep transition, the additional N and S deposition induced by edge effects in the forest was, on average, three times higher than the additional N and S deposition in the forest and the gradual edge vegetation itself in the case of a gradual transition. In addition, the field study pointed to an important prerequisite in terms of shape and size of the gradual edge vegetation for the mitigation of edge effects on N and potentially acidifying deposition. In the wind tunnel study, edge effects penetrated further into a sparse model forest than in a dense forest, which was caused by the stronger deceleration of wind speed and turbulence in the dense forest. This effect of canopy density, expressed as leaf area index (LAI), was verified in a field study on Corsican and Scots pine stands with differing LAIs. LAI was found to be a key driver in the processes causing edge effects on deposition as it determined both the level of deposition enhancement at the edge front and the penetration depth of the edge effects. The overall increase in deposition in the entire edge zone of forests displayed an optimum at an intermediate LAI level, with small penetration depths in forests with high LAI and low levels of deposition enhancement in forests with low LAI. In both deciduous and coniferous forests, higher NO 3 - seepage fluxes occurred in forest edges to up to approximately 80 m from the edge. In the first 10 - 20 m from the forest edge, however, the NO 3 - seepage was no straightforward reflection of N input via throughfall deposition. The difference between N input and NO 3 - output via soil nutrient leaching of about 25 kg N per ha per year was partly attributed to the higher N uptake by the trees and the higher seepage fluxes of dissolved organic nitrogen, but mainly to the enhanced N retention in the soil. Higher pH values and higher levels of exchangeable base cations in the upper mineral soil at edges indicated that, in contrast with what was expected based on the higher input of potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> at edges, the rate of soil acidification was lower at edges than in interior zones. We presumed that edge gradients in microclimate, input of so-called base cations via throughfall deposition, and biomass production together with drift of agriculturally applied lime fertilizer were the main causes for the higher N retention in the soil and lower rates of soil acidification at edges. Based on the results this thesis, we provided edge layout and management suggestions for the purpose of mitigating edge effects on the deposition of N and potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants.</b> We suggest, on a scale of increasing impact on the edge patterns of deposition but decreasing ease of implementation: (i) early and frequent thinning of forests, (ii) layout of gradual edge vegetation at steep edges, and (iii) conversion of coniferous pine plantations to deciduous forest types. Particularly at edges exposed to the prevailing wind directions (in Flanders, the south to westerly oriented edges), efforts should be made to reduce the extent of edge effects. It should be kept in mind, however, that mitigating measures, such as adjusted edge layout and management, do not provide the key solution for the environmental problem of air pollution. Instead, the achievement of vast emission reductions is the most fundamental prerequisite for full and sustainable protection and recovery of forest ecosystems and ecosystems in general...|$|R
40|$|Emissions and {{accumulation}} of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides negatively affect welfare both directly and indirectly. The direct effects {{are due to}} {{the negative effects of}} acidification on the consumption value of the environment. The indirect effects are due to the negative impact of acidification on forest growth and the productivity of labor and capital. In other words acidification has feedback effects on the rate and pattern of economic growth. Moreover, if these feedback effects are neglected in numerical models both environmental policy evaluations and long term economic projections based on these models will be biased. The {{purpose of this study is}} to elucidate feedback effects of acidification on productivity and economic growth within the frame of a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Swedish economy. The basic aim is to develop a model framework for environmental policy evaluation. The model distinguishes 17 production sectors, and is based on recently developed economic and emissions data for Sweden. Key damage functions are based on unique data on the impact of acid deposition on forest growth. The simulation results suggest that emissions of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> over the next few decades will have a non-negligible negative impact on labor productivity and on the supply of forest raw material, leading to a noticeable impact on Sweden’s GDP. However, in terms of the overall rate and pattern of economic growth numerical CGE models with and without endogenous feedback effects of acidification produce very similar results. Moreover, according to the model simulation results the positive productivity effects of proposed emission reductions are smaller than the costs of attaining these emission reductions.

40|$|International {{agreements}} {{to reduce the}} emissions of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> have resulted in major changes in deposition of sulphur and nitrogen in southern Scandinavia over the past 25 years.

During the 1980 s and 1990 s sulphate deposition in the region decreased by 30 to 60 %, whereas inorganic nitrogen deposition showed very little change until the mid- 1990 s. Deposition of non-marine base cations (especially calcium) declined in the 1990 s most markedly in southern Finland. Run-off response to these changes in deposition has been rapid and clear at the nine catchments. Sulphate and base cations (mostly calcium) concentrations declined and acid neutralising capacity increased. Occasional years with unusually high inputs of sea-salt confound the general trends.

40|$|Research on the {{ecosystem}} impacts of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants,</b> and measures to control them, has focused {{almost exclusively on}} sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) compounds. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), although emitted by coal burning, has been overlooked as a driver of ecosystem change because {{most of it was}} considered to redeposit close to emission sources rather than in remote natural ecosystems. Despite receiving little regulatory attention, measures to reduce S emissions, and changes in energy supply, have led to a 95 % reduction in United Kingdom HCl emissions within 20 years. Long-term precipitation, surface water, and soil solution data suggest that the near-disappearance of HCl from deposition could account for 30 - 40 % of chemical recovery from acidification during this time, affecting both near-source and remote areas. Because HCl is highly mobile in reducing environments, it is amore potent acidifier of wetlands than S or N, and HCl may have been the major driver of past peatland acidification. Reduced HCl loadings could therefore have affected the peatland carbon cycle, contributing to increases in dissolved organic carbon leaching to surface waters. With many regions increasingly reliant on coal for power generation, HCl should be recognized as a potentially significant constituent of resulting emissions, with distinctive ecosystem impacts...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) emissions, from {{agricultural}} and non-agricultural sources, {{have been associated}} with mainly two environment impacts - acidification and nutrient enrichment. As a source of nitrogen, ammonia can increase soil fertility and cause damage to ecosystems that exist because of naturally low levels of soil nitrogen. It can also contribute to the eutrophication of water bodies. Deposition of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> (including NOx and NH 3) has a range of detrimental effects including: •	Increased acidity of freshwaters which has led to the loss of fish and other organisms from many rivers and lakes; •	Increased acidity of soils which alters soil chemistry and can leave forests and other terrestrial ecosystems vulnerable to drought, disease and insect attack; •	Acidic groundwater which damage water supply infrastructure and increase the levels of harmful metals in drinking water; •	Eutrophication (excess nutrient enrichment of natural ecosystems) from deposition of the nitrogen-containing atmospheric pollutants NOx and NH 3; and •	Ammonia emissions are also associated with secondary particulate formation (ammonium sulphates and ammonium nitrates) and thus have implications for human health and climate change.

However, there are concerns about the impacts of the transport system on the quality of life, since it constitutes one of the main sources of greenhouse gases and also gives rise to significant air pollution stemming from <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants,</b> ozone precursors and particulate matter. During the last decade, the demand for transport services in Greece has rapidly grown following the European trend. Transport policies have recognised the need to restrain transport growth and to improve the various transport modes.

The primary strategy is a significant reduction in SO{sub 2 } emissions, with lesser reductions scheduled for NO{sub {times}} emissions. However, lessening of acid deposition is not the only important benefit of the emission control strategy. Decreasing SO{sup {minus}} and NO {sup {minus}} emissions will decrease atmospheric concentrations of sulfate and nitrate particles, which account for much of the visibility reduction associated with regional haze. Although one can get a qualitative sense of how visibility might improve by examining historical large-scale trends in regional emission totals and regional visibility, quantification of the expected improvement requires model simulations. One must model the spatial and temporal patterns of emissions reductions; the relevant pollutant transport, transformation, and removal processes in the atmosphere; and the changes in particulate loading. For this initial examination of the visibility improvement at Shenandoah National Park associated the the Phase I and Phase II SO{sub 2 } emission reductions, we have linked emission trend projections taken from ongoing analysis of the 1990 CAAA at Argonne National Laboratory, regional transport modeling with the Advanced Statistical Trajectory Regional Air Pollution (ASTRAP) model and visual impairment modeling with the Visibility Assessment Scoping Model (VASM) ...|$|R

Reasonable agreement was also obtained with wet deposition measurements. A greater scatter was apparent in the correlation with measurements of NH 3 concentrations, due to the highly localised nature of their emissions. The development of a fine scale (1 km resolution) version of FRAME over the UK represents an important step forward in improved spatial representation of concentrations and dry deposition of both oxidised and reduced nitrogen. Improvement in spatial disaggregation of ammonia emission sources and nature reserves at 1 km resolution was found to be highly significant in assessment of exceedance of the critical level for ammonia concentration at Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas.

Nitrogen deposition has been roughly constant during the past 20 years, with only a minor decrease in the late 1990 s. The resulting changes in the chemistry of small lakes have been followed by national monitoring programmes initiated in the 1980 s in Finland (163 lakes), Norway (100 lakes) and Sweden (81 lakes). These lakes are partly a subset from the survey of 5690 lakes in the Northern European lake survey of 1995. Trend analyses on data for the period 1990 - 1999 show that the non-marine sulphate concentrations in lakes have decreased significantly in 69 % of the monitored lakes. Changes were largest in lakes with the highest mean concentrations. Nitrate concentrations, on the other hand, were generally low and showed no systematic changes. Concentrations of non-marine base cations decreased in 26 % of the lakes, most probably an ionic-strength effect due to the lower concentrations of mobile strong-acid anions. Acid neutralising capacity increased in 32 % of the lakes. Trends in recovery were in part masked by large year-to-year variations in sea-salt inputs and by increases in total organic carbon concentrations. These changes were most probably the result of climatic variations. Nordic lakes, therefore, show clear signs of recovery from acidification. Recovery began in the 1980 s and accelerated in the 1990 s. Reductions in sulphur deposition are the major "driving force" {{in the process of}} recovery from acidification.

Survey lakes were selected using a stratified-random sampling design in 10 sampling blocks within the overall survey domain. Few lakes had pH < 6, and only three (all in SK) were acidic, i. e., Gran Alkalinity (Alk) < 0 μeq L– 1. A broad range in lake sensitivity was apparent, and very sensitive lakes (low specific conductance, base cations and Alk) were present in all sampling blocks. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was an important constituent of many lakes. Critical loads (CL) of acidity calculated using the Steady-State Water Chemistry model (SSWC) revealed extremely low 5 th percentile values for every block (range 1. 9 to 52. 7 eq ha– 1 y– 1). Block CL exceedances calculated using estimated S and N deposition for 2002 ranged from 54. 5 to 909 eq ha– 1 y– 1. The largest exceedances were for sampling blocks located near smelter sources or downwind of the oil sands. Lake chemistry revealed by our surveys was compared to others conducted both nearby and outside Canada.

40|$|Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) is an {{important}} component of the global carbon (C) cycle and has profound impacts on water chemistry and metabolism in lakes and rivers. Reported increases of DOC concentration in surface waters across Europe and Northern America have been attributed to several drivers, including changing climate, changing land-use to eutrophication and declining acid deposition. The latter of these suggests that acidic deposition suppressed the solubility of DOC, and that this historic suppression is now being reversed by reducing emissions of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants.</b> We studied a set of four parallel acidification and alkalization experiments in organic matter-rich soils, which, after three years of manipulation, have shown distinct soil solution DOC responses to acidity change. We tested whether these DOC concentration changes were related to changes in the acid/base properties of DOC. Based on laboratory determination of DOC site density (S. D. = amount of carboxylic groups per milligram DOC) and charge density (C. D. = organic acid anion concentration per milligram DOC) we found that the change in DOC soil–solution partitioning was tightly related to the change in degree of dissociation (α =C. D. :S. D. ratio) of organic acids (R 2 = 0. 74, P < 0. 01). Carbon turnover in soil organic matter (SOM), determined by soil respiration and β-D-glucosidase enzyme activity measurements, also appears to have some impact on DOC leaching, via constraints on the actual supply of available DOC from SOM; when the turnover rate of C in SOM is small, the effect of α on DOC leaching is reduced. Thus, differences in the magnitude of DOC changes seen across different environments might be explained by interactions between physicochemical restrictions of DOC soil–solution partitioning and SOM carbon turnover effects on DOC supply...|$|R
40|$|The {{capture of}} cloud and fog {{droplets}} by vegetation as a possibly important deposition mechanism has been recognised lately after reports of increased forest decline with altitude. We {{are concerned with}} interception, impaction and stickiness of polluted cloud water and fog droplets to terrestrial surfaces, including forest canopies. This deposition is mediated by low-level clouds, in which parts of the terrain can be immersed, or {{by the presence of}} orographic and radiation fog. In this study the transport of cloud and fog droplets towards terrestrial surfaces is parameterised and the “occult” deposition (mediated by both clouds and fog) is calculated by a new approach, implemented in “Sverigemodellen” (MATCH-Sverige), a 3 D Eulerian transport and dispersion model employed for making environmental assessments in Sweden. The model scheme is taking into account the mesoscale analysis (MESAN) of low-cloud coverage and cloud-base height, the visibility analysis, detailed topography information, land use, modelled atmospheric concentrations and the instantaneous deposition parameters for the investigated species (acidifying air pollutants: sulphate and oxidised/reduced nitrogen). The model scheme is validated by comparing with throughfall monitoring of sulphate deposition to coniferous forests at elevated sites in the Swedish mountains. It shows a rather good fit to the measurements, generally within 25 %, which is deemed as encouraging. Discrepancies exist though and are subject of discussion. The percentage of occult deposition can be up to 115 % of the sum of dry and wet deposition. Therefore we cannot ignore this contribution in the assessments of deposition of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The highest fluxes of cloud deposition are assigned to mountainous regions in Northern Sweden, while the highest fog deposition is calculated at a location in Jönköpings County, on the Sydsvenska höglandet...|$|R

Study of tree response towards changes in acidifying pollutants' (SO 2 and NO 2) concentration dynamics is relevant, as forest parks and parks fulfil a lot of beneficial functions in cities. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sample trees, growing in parks and forest parks in Vilnius and Kaunas cities, were chosen as the objects of this research. Wood samples were collected from 330 sample pines in 15 sample plots in Kaunas city and from 480 sample pines in 20 sample plots in Vilnius city. Dendroscales of radial increment of pines growing in cities were transformed into sequences of the radial increment ratio for eliminating an impact of tree age without removing a negative impact of anthropogenic pollution. Reduction in NO 2 and SO 2 concentration in the atmosphere could determine an increase in pine radial increment in 1990 - 2006 : significant relation was estimated between radial increment and NO 2 concentration in Vilnius and Kaunas cities (mean correlation coefficient r was equal to- - 0. 61 and - 0. 62, respectively, p 2 - in Vilnius city (r =- 0. 65, p < 0. 05).

40|$|Declining sulphur {{deposition}} {{since the}} late 1970 s has led to increases in pH in lakes and streams of the English Lake District (Cumbria, UK). To determine whether there have been biological responses to the chemical changes, we carried out surveys of stream macroinvertebrates and lake surface sediment diatoms, and compared the results with those from earlier surveys. Macroinvertebrate taxa in five streams (current average pH range 5. 1 – 7. 0) sampled in 1999 showed clear changes from those found during 1965 / 1966 and 1972. For three of the streams, more taxa were present in 1999 than recorded using comparable sampling methods in the 1960 s and 1970 s, despite lower numbers of individuals being recovered in 1999. Values of the Margalef diversity index could be calculated for both 1965 – 1972 and 1999 for four of the streams; the index was significantly greater in 1999 (P< 0. 001) in three streams, and unchanged in one stream (the most acid). The 1999 survey revealed the presence of acid-sensitive taxa that had been absent in the earlier surveys, notably the three stoneflies Leuctra fusca, L. moselyi and Chloroperla tripunctata. Some taxa that had been present during 1965 – 1972 were absent in 1999, but few of these were acid-sensitive. Diatoms from the surface sediments of six lakes were classified according to their acid sensitivities. In three of the lakes sampled in 1999 there were more diatoms characteristic of circumneutral waters, and less acidophilic species than {{had been found in}} 1983 – 1985. In the remaining three lakes, no noticeable changes had occurred. Overall, the observed biological changes are qualitatively as expected for the observed increases in pH, and there have been no instances of biological change in the opposite direction. The results support the expectation that changes in freshwater ecological status can be reversed by decreasing the remote emissions of <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants...</b>|$|R

40|$|For the {{protection}} and promotion of biodiversity in forest edges and interiors, forest edge management Practices are put forward like the creation of gradual forest edges (i. e., edges with a gradual increase of vegetation height from open area to forest, e. g., {{by means of a}} fringe, a belt, and a mantle). In this study, we tested the mitigating effect of gradual forest edges on the atmospheric deposition of inorganic nitrogen (N) and the potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> SO 42 -, NO 3 -, and NH 4 + (N + S). We conducted field experiments at three exposed forest edges in Flanders and the Netherlands and compared throughfall deposition at steep edges (i. e., edges with an abrupt transition from open area to forest) and at adjacent gradual edges. Along transects perpendicular to the edges, during three months in both winter and summer, throughfall deposition of Cl-, SO 42 -, NO 3 -, and NH 4 + was monitored in the forest between 0 and 64 m from the edges and in the gradual edge vegetation. At the smoothest and best fitting gradual edge, the extra N + S throughfall deposition the forest received due to edge effects was lower than at the adjacent steep edge, with on average 80 and 100 % in winter and summer, respectively. This was due to a halving of the depth of edge influence and an almost full reduction of the magnitude of edge influence. This decrease in throughfall deposition in the forest was not compensated by the additional throughfall deposition on the gradual edge vegetation itself, resulting in a final decrease in throughfall deposition in the forest edge by 60 % in winter and 74 % in summer. While this result confirms that gradual edges can mitigate edge effects on atmospheric deposition, the results of the other sites indicate the importance of size and shape of the gradual edge vegetation in mitigating edge effects on deposition: due to insufficient height ('size') or inadequate shape of the gradual edge vegetation, only small or insignificant decreases in throughfall deposition were observed. Hence, for mitigating edge effects on N + S and N deposition, our results support the recommendation of creating gradual edges at forests with poorly developed, abrupt edges, but it stresses the importance of a thorough consideration of the shape and size of the gradual edge vegetation in the design and management of gradual forest edges.

40|$|Forests on {{sandy soil}} did clearly acidify {{during the past}} decades, what {{was found to be}} related to high {{depositions}} of potentially acidifying compounds to the forest floor. Several factors are a stimulus for high atmospheric deposition load in these types of forest ecosystems. (1) Forests are often situated in the vicinity of intensive livestock husbandry, which is the cause of high NH 3 emissions to the atmosphere (one of the most important potentially <b>acidifying</b> <b>pollutants</b> at the moment). (2) Forests are often very small, so have a high surface area of forest edge (this is on average the outer 50 m zone of the forest). Forest edges act as ‘hotspots’ for potentially acidifying and nitrogen (N) deposition and can show up to four-fold increases in the rate of atmospheric delivery compared with nearby areas without edge. (3) The prevailing forest types are plantations of coniferous tree species (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus nigra) which have, in comparison to other vegetation types, a higher filtering capacity due to their higher leaf area index and evergreen character. Besides the acidification of the soil, clear symptoms of N saturation were found in several forest ecosystems. All studied vegetation types were originally N limited, so without any significant seepage of nitrate. At the moment, nitrate seepage occurs at a significantly higher rate than background levels (5 kg (357 mol) N. ha- 1. yr- 1), and during the entire year. When forest ecosystems are nitrogen saturated - and it might be expected that, under the current load of N emissions, this will hold true for most ecosystems on the long-term - a close relationship exists between the level of N deposition input and the level of N seepage. This work clearly demonstrates that different forest types, in this thesis simplified as coniferous versus deciduous forest types, have different impacts on ion throughfall and seepage fluxes. Coniferous forests receive significantly higher amounts of N and sulphur (S) to the forest floor than deciduous forests. Consequently, more nitrate and sulphate, and also more so-called base cations and aluminium are seeped to the groundwater. Besides a higher pollution of ground and surface water with nitrate and sulphate, the related higher seepage of so-called base cations and aluminium furthermore accounts for a higher reduction of the soil buffering capacity. From this work it can be concluded that converting coniferous Pinus nigra and Pinus sylvestris plantations into mixed species forests with Betula pendula and Quercus robur certainly diminishes the input of potentially acidifying and N deposition and consequently soil acidification and nitrate seepage to groundwater. But it should be emphasized that also in some of the observed deciduous forest types clear symptoms of a nitrogen surplus and soil acidification processes were apparent. Therefore, conversion of coniferous to deciduous forests might certainly not be seen as the solution for this environmental problem. Reducing the emission loads is a necessary condition for the sustainable protection of forest and other ecosystems on the long-term...|$|R
