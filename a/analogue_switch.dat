40|$|This paper {{describes}} how <b>analogue</b> <b>switched</b> circuits (switched-capacitor and switched-current circuits) can be optimized {{by means of}} a personal computer. The optimization of this kind of circuits is not so common and their analysis is more difficult in comparison with continuously working circuits. Firstly, the nonidealities occurring in these circuits whose effect on their characteristics should be optimized are discussed. Then a few ways to analyze <b>analogue</b> <b>switched</b> circuits are shown. From all optimization algorithms applicable for this kind of optimization, two ones that seem to be the most promising are proposed. The differential evolution (one of evolutionary algorithms) combined with the simplex method was found to be most appropriate from these two ones. Two types of programs are required for the optimization of these circuits: a program for implementing calculations of the used optimization algorithm and a program for the analysis of the optimized circuit. Several suitable computer programs from both of the groups together with their proper settings according to authors’ experience are proposed. At the end of the paper, an example of a switched-current circuit optimization documenting the previous description is presented...|$|R

It was first shown in mid 1983 and was broadcast on the hour between 13:00 and 16:00 but as Channel 4 extended its broadcast hours, it moved to increasingly earlier times. The first change was in October 1984 when Channel 4 began weekday afternoon programming and the 15-minute broadcasts shown every half hour between 10:00 and 13:30 and from September 1987 broadcast hours were 08:00 to 09:00 (08:00 to 11:30 during school holidays).
