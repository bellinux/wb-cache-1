5|$|Having {{served on}} the board of {{directors}} since 1986, David Sheepshanks was appointed as club Chairman in 1995. The next four seasons brought near-misses as the club flirted with promotion; in 1995–96, Ipswich fell one place short of the First Division play-off zone, and the ensuing three seasons brought successive semi-final play-off defeats. In 2000, Ipswich qualified for the Division One play-off final, the last such match at Wembley Stadium before the stadium was to be redeveloped.

5|$|Mycena granulifera, {{a species}} {{originally}} described from Brazil, {{is comparable to}} M.nidificata in having inamyloid spores, club-shaped cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae. M.granulifera differs in forming a whitish, wrinkled cap and club-shaped to roughly spindle-shaped pleurocystidia. Mycena nidificata also bears some resemblance to the European species M.flos-nivium, which is distinguished by having cylindrical, amyloid spores, gills without veins between them, and <b>an</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> cord-like rhizomorphs.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet in length, {{was released}} on June 10, 1910. The film was advertised in the June 11, 1910 edition of Billboard magazine.

5|$|The words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are {{a little}} {{ambiguous}} and can overlap in meaning.

However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies <b>an</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> a defined conformation.|$|E
