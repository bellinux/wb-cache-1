5|$|The Studios on Broadway, {{contains}} seven high-definition studios, {{claimed by}} Peel Media {{to be the}} largest such facility in Europe. The largest studio has an area of , {{making it one of the}} biggest in western Europe. Fitting began in 2010 at a cost of £22million, in time for the BBC's move in summer 2011. The seven studios vary in size; the large studios <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor, and the smaller studios on the first floor. The larger of the two audio studios, sitting on hydraulic jacks to insulate it from noise generated in the surrounding studios, is dedicated to the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. The studio block contains offices and the glass-fronted, 16-storey Holiday Inn hotel.|$|E

The mansion contains a series of 18th century salons decorated and furnished {{in the style of}} that period, with polychrome marble floors, and painted ceilings depicting classical scenes of Greek and Roman mythology. Of particular note is the entrance hall, which resembles a Roman atrium with marbled columns and a painted ceiling copied from Robert Wood's Ruins of Palmyra.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E

25|$|Lying to {{the east}} of Dunduff Farm on a rocky knoll, this tower castle was built to an L-shaped plan, with a square three floored stair-tower in the {{re-entrant}} angle on the south. Three barrel-vaulted chambers <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor and these were accessed via the lobby of the tower. A private chamber on the first floor was accessed by a corridor that ran the length of the main block. A fireplace in the wing heated the hall, with its splayed window embrasure. An intermediate floor once existed, as indicated by joist sockets. Window and door features of the original ruin suggest construction in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.|$|E
25|$|The two-story Triangle Market (Thompson & Thompson, 1908; {{rehabilitation}} by Fred Bassetti & Co., 1977) originally {{housed the}} South Park Poultry Company. The 1977 rehabilitation joined {{it with the}} adjacent 3-story Silver Oakum Building (unknown, 1910; Bassetti, 1977). The Outlook Hotel (now LaSalle Hotel; architect unknown; rehabilitation by Bartholick, 1977) also dates from 1908. A legitimate seaman's and workingman's hotel until 1942, its Japanese American operators Rosuke and T.K. Kodama were forcibly interned during World War II. Nellie Curtis took it over, changed the name, and ran it as a brothel into the 1950s. Since 1977 the building has been joined to the adjacent Cliff House (c. 1901), and largely devoted to low-income housing. Shops and the Market PDA office <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor. Its roof provides outdoor seating for the restaurant Maximilien.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{and young}} in scrape nests, and the adults that brood them, are more exposed to predators and the {{elements}} {{than those in}} more sheltered nests; they <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and typically in the open, with little to hide them. The eggs of most ground-nesting birds (including those that use scrape nests) are cryptically coloured to help camouflage them when the adult is not covering them; the actual colour generally corresponds to the substrate on which they are laid. Brooding adults {{also tend to be}} well camouflaged, and may be difficult to flush from the nest. Most ground-nesting species have well-developed distraction displays, which are used to draw (or drive) potential predators from the area around the nest. Most species with this type of nest have precocial young, which quickly leave the nest upon hatching.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{is known}} to kill animals up to three times its own weight, the African wolf targets {{mammalian}} prey much less frequently than the black-backed jackal overall. On capturing large prey, the African wolf makes no attempt to kill it; instead it rips open the belly and eats the entrails. Small prey is typically killed by shaking, though snakes may be eaten alive from the tail end. The African wolf often carries away more food than it can consume, and caches the surplus, which is generally recovered within 24 hours. When foraging for insects, the African wolf turns over dung piles to find dung beetles. During the dry seasons, it excavates dung balls to reach the larvae inside. Grasshoppers and flying termites are caught either by pouncing on them while they <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or are caught in mid-air. It is fiercely intolerant of other scavengers, having been known to dominate vultures on kills – one can hold dozens of vultures at bay by threatening, snapping and lunging at them.|$|E
25|$|During {{the sales}} of 1921 & 1922 all the {{remaining}} furnishing and art works not sold in 1848 were auctioned, as were several fittings including chimneypieces. Some of the family portraits and other items associated with the house have been bought back and are now {{on display in the}} House. Several owners of Stowe undertook the Grand Tour, Earl Temple spent 1729-33 in France, Switzerland & Italy, the 1st Marquess in 1774 visited Italy, the 2nd Duke before he inherited his title in 1817, and the 1st Duke in 1827-29 toured the Mediterranean aboard his yacht the Anna Eliza named after his wife. Many of the art works that adorned the house were acquired both during these trips and through the 1st Duke inheriting his father-in-law's art collection. The 1st Duke, before he inherited Stowe, also bought paintings at the sale of the Orleans Collection in 1798 and continued to buy paintings for another twenty years as well as books, engravings and the Stowe Service of Worcester Porcelain, as well as archaeological specimens. The main rooms are mainly located on the 1st floor (referred to in the USA as the 2nd floor) Piano nobile, a few <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor (referred to in the USA as the 1st floor).|$|E

The first floor has a long gallery corridor running the whole length of the inner courtyard. Another pair of Corinthian columns screen the cantilevered staircase from the gallery corridor. Several trompe-l'œil panels and borders are present and the plastered walls mimic timber panelling. Bedrooms were accommodated on {{the first and second}} floor. The bedrooms housed within the north-west elevation on the third floor are simple and were used by the servants of visitors if there was insufficient room for them on the ground floor. Polished red granite was used for the mantlepieces.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} faces south west over Cardiff Bay, {{it has a}} glass façade {{around the}} entire building and is dominated by a steel roof and wood ceiling. It has three floors, {{the first and second}} floors are accessible to the public and the ground floor is a private area for officials. The building was designed to be as open and accessible as possible, the architects, the Richard Rogers Partnership (RRP) said [...] "The building was not to be an insular, closed edifice. Rather it would be a transparent envelope, looking outwards to Cardiff Bay and beyond, making visible {{the inner workings of the}} Assembly and encouraging public participation in the democratic process." [...] The main area in the building is the debating chamber, called the Siambr, including a public viewing gallery. Other areas of the building are the Neuadd, which is the main reception area on the first floor and the Oriel on the second floor. The three committee rooms and the Cwrt <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor.|$|E
500|$|Elephants {{can move}} both {{forwards}} and backwards, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop. They use only two gaits when moving on land, the walk and a faster gait similar to running. In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders {{rising and falling}} while the foot is planted on the ground. With no [...] "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and can reach {{a top speed of}} [...] At this speed, most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length. Spring-like kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephants and other animals. During locomotion, the cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving. Elephants are capable swimmers. They have been recorded swimming for up to six hours without touching the bottom, and have travelled as far as [...] at a stretch and at speeds of up to [...]|$|E

However, less-experienced riders can check for the correct diagonal by a quick glance at the horse's shoulder, sitting when the outside foreleg is on the ground and the shoulder is back.|$|E
