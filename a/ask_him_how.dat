25|$|In 629, Emperor Gaozu's son and successor, Emperor Taizong, {{ordered his}} {{officials}} to submit suggestions for him. As Chang was unacquainted with historical writings, Ma drafted some 20 suggestions for him. When Emperor Taizong read the suggestions that Chang submitted, he was impressed, {{but he knew}} that Chang was not well-studied, he summoned Chang to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he came up with the suggestions. Chang told Emperor Taizong that he did not write the suggestions and that Ma did. He also told Emperor Taizong that whenever he conversed with Ma, Ma was always concerned about faithfulness and filial piety. Emperor Taizong sent messengers to summon Ma into his presence, and once they conversed, he was impressed by Ma and, while initially not giving him an official position, had him serve at the examination bureau of the government (門下省, Menxia Sheng). In 632, he officially made Ma a governmental auditor. He awarded Chang silk for having discovered Ma.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{figures in}} {{organized}} crime {{had always been}} perp-walked when arrested. Later in the 1980s, one of these, John Gotti, head of the Mafia's Gambino family, [...] "took the perp walk {{to a whole new}} level", according to Miller. He made his walks wearing the expensive custom-tailored suits that earned him the [...] "Dapper Don" [...] nickname. Reporters would politely <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he was doing as he walked. A Times freelancer once asked him the question in formal Italian: [...] "Buona sera, signore, come sta?". Gotti responded in kind [...] "Bene, grazie" [...] and turned to the cameras and smiled, giving the photographers and television cameras the memorable image they had sought.|$|E
2500|$|As Arthur and Zelena {{return to}} Camelot, Arthur {{wants to come}} up with a plan of action, with Arthur telling her that they would have to go to a place called DunBroch. Over in DunBroch, Merida puts a flower on her father’s grave and tells him she saved the boys and proved she’s fit to be queen. She says now it’s even harder since she has to rule and her father made it look easy. She says she wishes he was here so she could <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he did it. Her mother is there and says her father is always with her then says she misses him too. She tells Merida it’s not a day for sadness since she’s got her coronation. They leave the grave of King Fergus.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests such under-counts {{cut in half}} the actual Armenian population. In the district of Mus (compromising Mus plain, Sassoun, and the counties of Mus) for example, the Armenian official {{in charge of the}} census, Garabed Potigian, presented the official figures as 225,000 Armenians and 55,000 Turks. Upon the insistence of his Turkish superiors he was forced to reduce the Armenian population to 105,000 and increase the Turkish population to 95,000. Lynch himself report similar incidences: “Pursuing our way, we meet an Armenian priest—a young, broad-shouldered, open-faced man. He seems inclined to speak, so we <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> many churches there may be in Mush (Mus). He answers, seven; but the commissary had said four. A soldier addresses him in Kurdish; the poor fellow turns pale, and remarks that he was mistaken in saying seven; there cannot be more than four ...Such are a few of our experiences during our short sojourn at Mush.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1962, Olivia died of measles {{encephalitis}} at age seven. Her death left Dahl [...] "limp with despair", {{and gave}} him a feeling of guilt that he could not do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation and dedicated his 1982 book The BFG to his daughter. After Olivia's death, Dahl lost faith in God and viewed religion as a sham. While mourning her loss he had sought spiritual guidance from the former Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, but became dismayed when Fisher told him that although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there, with Dahl recalling: [...] "I wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us. I sat there wondering if this great and famous churchman really knew {{what he was talking about}} and whether he knew anything at all about God or heaven, and if he didn't, then who in the world did?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 17, NCAA President Mark Emmert {{personally}} wrote Erickson—who {{had had the}} [...] "interim" [...] tag {{removed from}} his title on the same day—to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> Penn State had exercised control over its athletic program {{in the wake of}} the disclosures about Sandusky's crimes. [...] The letter also demanded answers to four specific questions about how Penn State had complied with NCAA policies during that time. [...] Penn State pledged full cooperation, but asked to defer its response until after the release of the Freeh report. [...] On July 16, Emmert appeared on PBS' Tavis Smiley and said that with the release of the Freeh report, Penn State had [...] "weeks, not months" [...] to answer the questions he'd raised in the November letter. [...] He also hinted that he had not ruled out issuing the so-called [...] "death penalty", which would have forced Penn State to cancel at least the 2012 season. [...] The NCAA had not handed down a death penalty to a Division I school since Southern Methodist University was hit with it in 1987 for massive violations in its football program. [...] Although the NCAA is required to consider handing down a death penalty if a school commits two major violations within five years, it has the power to shut down a program without any preliminary sanctions in the event of particularly egregious misconduct.|$|E

2500|$|Abaye {{urged his}} disciples to conduct {{themselves}} {{in such a}} way as to lead others to the love of God (Yoma 86a). In Biblical exegesis, he was one of the first to draw a distinct line between the evident meaning of the text (peshat) and the sense ascribed to it by midrashic interpretation. He formulated the following rule, of great importance in Talmudic exegesis (Sanhedrin 34a): [...] "One Bible verse can be referred to different subjects, but several different Bible verses can not refer to one and the same subject." [...] He defended the Apocryphal book Ecclesiasticus against his teacher Rav Yosef. By quoting from it a number of edifying passages he showed that it did not belong to the heretical books which are forbidden, and even compelled his teacher to admit that quotations might with advantage be taken from it for homiletical purposes (Sanhedrin 100b). Possessing an extensive knowledge of tradition, Abaye became a most eager disciple of Dimi, the israeli amora, who had brought to Babylonia a perfect treasury of interpretations by israel amoraim. Abaye considered Dimi, as a representative of the israel school, a qualified Bible exegete, and used to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> this or that Bible verse was explained in [...] "the West," [...] or israel. Of his own interpretations of Biblical passages only a few, of a haggadic nature, are preserved; but he often supplements, elucidates, or corrects the opinions of older authorities.|$|E
