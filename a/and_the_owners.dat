5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E
5|$|By 1939, Low Fell {{had become}} the select suburb of Gateshead and had {{substantial}} and independent shopping facilities. All of the houses between Shipcote and the village were private <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> added 'Low Fell' to their addresses, at times not even mentioning Gateshead, although, if we adhere to the original boundaries, they did not live in Low Fell at all".|$|E

5|$|Fires in the {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, {{and it took}} several days before they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|The West Pier Trust {{now owns}} the pier and has {{proposed}} various plans to renovate it. Some schemes have been opposed by local residents <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> {{of the nearby}} Palace Pier, who have claimed unfair competition. The pier gradually collapsed during the early 21st century. Major sections collapsed in late 2002, and two fires in March and May 2003 left little of the original structure. Subsequently, English Heritage declared it to be beyond repair. Structured demolition took place in 2010 {{to make way for}} the observation tower i360; further structural damage from storms has occurred since.|$|E

5|$|When {{the news}} of Zong voyage reached Britain, the ship's owners claimed {{compensation}} from their insurers {{for the loss of}} the slaves. The insurers refused to honour the claim <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> took them to court. Zongs logbook went missing after the ship reached Jamaica, two years before the hearings started. The legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre but there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the appeals hearing. The ship's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the Jockey Club <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of the General Stud Book {{passed a}} {{regulation}} {{named by the}} foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds {{during and after the}} Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Located {{entirely in}} southeastern Millard County, SR-161 starts at a diamond {{interchange}} with the westernmost exit on I-70 before it terminates at I-15. The road continues northward {{until it reaches}} the historic Cove Fort and the associated visitors center. On {{the eastern side of}} the highway is a Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) maintenance center. SR-161 starts to make a gentle turn to the northeast, passing a filling station, which also serves as a rest area as part of a public–private partnership between UDOT <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of the station. The highway intersects I-15 and comes to an end at a cattle guard on Black Rock Road northwest of the interchange with I-15.|$|E
5|$|The NFL's {{struggle}} against the AAFC generated stress on wages, attendance, marketing, and by 1949, it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years. Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless. In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had {{a negative impact on}} the sale of home tickets. Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract—the 1949 championship game. Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich, who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC. Bell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell.|$|E

5|$|When Peng's grand-uncle died in 1911, Peng {{left home}} {{and worked at}} a coalmine in Xiangtan, where he pushed carts of coal for {{thirteen}} {{hours a day for}} a wage of nine yuan a month. In 1912, shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> fled, cheating Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer {{for the construction of a}} dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.|$|E
