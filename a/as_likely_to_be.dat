5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected as men.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, Harris held a {{press conference}} in which he {{announced}} his intentions to enter the NBA draft. Multiple draft outlets ranked Harris <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drafted in the 2nd round or go undrafted. Two days after the announcement, Harris was recognized as an Academic All-Conference performer again. Harris suffered a hamstring injury shortly before the draft, which hampered his draft workouts and draft potential. Harris was undrafted in the 2010 NBA draft.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against {{people who may have}} been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since {{the last days of the}} Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, a 2010 study {{published}} in the Journal of International and Intercultural Communication indicated that Asian Americans <b>are</b> perceived <b>as</b> most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nerds, followed by White Americans, while non-White Hispanics and Black Americans <b>were</b> perceived <b>as</b> least <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nerds. These stereotypes stem from concepts of Orientalism and Primitivism, as discussed in Ron Eglash's essay Race, Sex, and Nerds: From Black Geeks to Asian American Hipsters. Among Whites, Jews are perceived as the most nerdy and are stereotyped in similar ways to Asians.|$|R
50|$|Strontium-90 is {{not quite}} <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> caesium-137 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{released}} {{as a part of}} a nuclear reactor accident because it is much less volatile, but is probably the most dangerous component of the radioactive fallout from a nuclear weapon.|$|R

25|$|Lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys {{writes in}} The Lesbian Heresy (1993) that while many feminists are {{comfortable}} working alongside gay men, they are uncomfortable interacting with bisexual men.

2500|$|The {{main reasons}} states impose visa {{restrictions}} on foreign nationals <b>are</b> <b>to</b> curb illegal immigration, security concerns, and reciprocity for visa restrictions imposed {{on their own}} nationals. Typically, nations impose visa restrictions on citizens of poorer countries, along with politically unstable and undemocratic ones, <b>as</b> it is <b>likelier</b> that people from these countries will seek to illegally immigrate. Visa restrictions may also be imposed when nationals of another country <b>are</b> perceived <b>as</b> <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> terrorists or criminals, or by autocratic regimes that perceive foreign influence <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a threat <b>to</b> their rule.

25|$|Acid jazz {{developed}} in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by jazz-funk and electronic dance music. Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including Sampling (music) or a live DJ cutting and scratching), {{but it is just}} <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. Jazz-funk musicians such as Roy Ayers and Donald Byrd are often credited as the forerunners of acid jazz.|$|E
25|$|After {{the break}} {{up of the}} Soviet Union, the new {{independent}} Ukraine had a large arsenal of nuclear weapons on its territory. However, in 1994 Ukraine agreed to give up nuclear arms, {{became a member of}} the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and within two years had removed all atomic weapons. Almost alone among observers, Mearsheimer was opposed to that decision because he saw a Ukraine without a nuclear deterrent <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subjected to aggression by Russia.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{original}} 2011 system, SLC would have assigned 16-18 players to each team, with five foreign players per team, and a Sri Lankan captain. But after the 2012 franchise system was adopted, a draft was organized and a lottery held {{to determine the}} order in which players were picked. SLC determined the value of the contract for each player in advance. The players were seen <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drafted in two groups – Sri Lankan players and foreign players.|$|E
25|$|Endler's {{survey of}} natural {{selection}} gave {{an indication of the}} relative importance of polymorphisms among studies showing natural selection. The results, in summary: Number of species demonstrating natural selection: 141. Number showing quantitative traits: 56. Number showing polymorphic traits: 62. Number showing both Q and P traits: 23. This shows that polymorphisms are found to be at least as common as continuous variation in studies {{of natural selection}}, and hence just <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the evolutionary process.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, the BBC {{programme}} Horizon {{reported on}} an unnamed and unpublished study of blood samples {{from a group}} of 100 autistic children and 200 children without autism.
