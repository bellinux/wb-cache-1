Either Jericho rids the West of the Curse of Lazarus, or he becomes the Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose the good option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala; if the player chooses to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy.

40|$|As a {{multimodal}} travel behavior, park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> includes several trip modes such as car, walking, bus, or railway.

This paper, based on the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> behavior survey in Beijing, will analyze {{the relationship between the}} perception of the influencing factors and the behavior intent for park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> by using structural equation modeling. The conclusions suggest that the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> choice for travelers is a passive behavior which means giving up driving the car is mainly caused by the serious traffic congestion. Furthermore, improving the service level of the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> facilities <b>and</b> the comfort for riding bus or railway will increase the utilization of park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> facilities. The perceptions of the influencing factors have both direct and indirect effects on the travel intent for park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> by the interaction among the influencing factors...|$|R

5|$|The Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. Developed as an {{all-around}} farm <b>and</b> <b>riding</b> horse in eastern Kentucky, it {{is related to}} the Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breeds. In 1989 the Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse Association (KMSHA) was formed, and in 2002, the subsidiary Spotted Mountain Horse Association (SMHA) was developed to register Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses with excessive white markings and pinto patterns. Conformation standards are the same for the two groups of horses, with the main difference being the color requirements. The KMSHA studbook is now closed to horses from unregistered parents, although it cross-registers with several other registries, while the SMHA studbook remains open.|$|E
5|$|The first Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, {{designed}} by Elias David Häusser and {{completed in the}} 1740s, was {{certainly one of the}} most impressive Baroque buildings of its day.

Fredensborg Palace (1731), the royal residence on the shore of Sealand's Lake Esrum, with its exquisite Chancellery House, is the work of Johan Cornelius Krieger who was the court gardener at Rosenborg Castle.

Alumna Forence Cushing, along with a cohort of other Boston-based alumnae, observed in 1883 that Vassar's {{physical education}} program was lagging behind those at other recently opened Seven Sisters schools including Wellesley College and Smith College.

5|$|A pony-sized Finnhorse must measure no {{more than}} 148cm (14.2-1/2 hands, 58-1/2inches) at the withers or the croup. Both sexes are also {{required}} to pass either a drivability or a ridability test. The horse's pedigree is also evaluated, and uncharacteristically small individuals descending from larger-sized lines are not accepted. The horse should be proportionately small all over, and express all the qualities of a full-size Finnhorse. Especially thorough {{attention is paid to}} the pony-sized horse's character, obedience and cooperation. The pony-sized Finnhorse is suited to practically any use the larger Finnhorse is, with the exception of heavy draught work because of its smaller size and proportionally reduced strength. However, some individuals have been able to compete with and even win against full-size Finnhorses in work horse competitions. Many pony-sized individuals are cross-registered for trotter section breeding, as small Finnhorses can be equal competitors in harness against larger ones. In combined driving, the pony-sized Finnhorse's size is an advantage, allowing for greater agility. The section is popular for therapy <b>and</b> <b>riding</b> school use.|$|E

40|$|The {{detailed}} and {{long-term effects of}} park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> are more complex than generally acknowledged. In 1994, studies of park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> were carried out in Oxford and York.

However, some users had switched from modes other than car and others {{were found to be}} making additional trips which had been attracted by the opportunity to park <b>and</b> <b>ride.</b> Congestion has remained persistent in the cities studied and there is concern that total travel may have been increased rather than reduced, which was the intention.

Of the ten horses currently {{employed by the}} mounted police of Helsinki, two are Finnhorses, though they are considered a bit small for the job. They are also competitive in many disciplines, and in the 1970s separate competition classes for Finnhorses were established at horse shows, which also helped to increase {{the popularity of the}} breed. While in eventing and horse racing, Finnhorses are too slow to compete directly against Thoroughbreds and the sport horse breeds, they are a highly reliable mount for cross-country riding, particularly over difficult terrain; during the Continuation War, the breed successfully crossed any wetland with which it was confronted.

5|$|In 1872, the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing <b>and</b> <b>riding</b> horses. In 1875, the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, the Norwegian or Dole Trotter studbook {{was taken over by}} the Norwegian Trotting Association, as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture. The Dole Trotter studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses have to meet many of the same standards. The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Anglo-Saxon period, the {{internal}} street layout of Canterbury was remodelled, but {{the line of}} the outer walls remained the same. A cattle market was created outside the city to the south-east, and Newingate, later renamed St George's Gate, was inserted into the walls to allow easy access to it. During this the period the main axis of the city shifted from the older line of streets running from London Gate <b>and</b> <b>Riding</b> Gate, to the new route between West Gate and Newingate. A lane was built running around the inside of the walls, in a similar way to the intramural streets built around the same time at Exeter and Winchester. Churches and chapels were built over the gates, including St Mary's above the North Gate; the Holy Cross over West Gate; St Michael's over Bargate; St Edmund's within Riding Gate; and, potentially, St George's Chapel over Newingate. Canterbury's walls were mentioned by the early chronicler, Bede, in his history of England.|$|E
