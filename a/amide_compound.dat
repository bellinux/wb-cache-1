Methodology/Principal Findings: Our novel derivatives of chlorin e 6, that is, its <b>amide</b> (<b>compound</b> 2) and boronated <b>amide</b> (<b>compound</b> 5) evoked no dark toxicity and demonstrated {{a significantly higher}} photosensitizing efficacy than chlorin e 6 against transplanted aggressive tumors such as B 16 melanoma and M- 1 sarcoma. Compound 5 showed superior therapeutic potency. Illumination with red light of mammalian tumor cells loaded with 0. 1 mM of 5 caused rapid (within the initial minutes) necrosis as determined by propidium iodide staining. The laser confocal microscopy-assisted analysis of cell death revealed the following order of events: prior to illumination, 5 accumulated in Golgi cysternae, endoplasmic reticulum and in some (but not all) lysosomes. In response to light, the reactive oxygen species burst was concomitant with the drop of mitochondrial transmembrane electric potential, the dramatic changes of mitochondrial shape {{and the loss of}} integrity of mitochondria and lysosomes. Within 3 – 4 min post illumination, the plasma membrane became permeable for propidium iodide. Compounds 2 and 5 were one order of magnitude more potent than chlorin e 6 in photodamage of artificial liposomes monitored in a dye release assay. The latter effect depended on the content of non-saturated lipids; in liposome...|$|E

Such glycosylpeptides {{have been shown}} to be extremely potent analgesic agonists. The conformational analysis of these three compounds in DMSO-d 6 solution has been carried out using two-dimensional NMR methods. Both the parent compound (1) and the beta N-galactosyl derivative (2) show similar NMR parameters which are consistent with fairly rigid beta-strands at both the N-terminus and C-terminus, connected by a glycine residue that displays a mixture between multiple conformational states. Thus, although the beta N-galactosyl derivative (2) has been shown to be significantly more potent than the parent compound (1) in the tail immersion and paw pressure tests of analgesia, no correlation can be established between the conformation of (1) and (2) in DMSO and the difference in analgesic activity.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of HDACIs (MS and SAL) alone and/or combined use with EF 24 (EF), a novel synthetic curcumin analog, on human pancreatic cancer cell line (BxPC- 3). In vitro, BxPC- 3 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of MS, SAL with or without EF, and their effects on cell viability, acetylated Histone H 3 and H 4 levels, cytotoxicity, and cleaved caspase 3 levels, and cell cycle distribution were measured. The viability of BxPC- 3 cells decreased significantly after treatment with EF, MS and SAL treatments. MS and SAL treatment increased the acetylation of histone H 3 and H 4 in a dose dependent manner. MS and SAL alone or combined with EF were increased the number of cells in G 1 phase. In addition, treatment with agents significantly decreased the ratio of cell in G 2 /M phase. There were significant dose-dependent increases at cleaved Caspase 3 levels after MS treatment but not after SAL treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glucagon is a 29 -residue peptide {{produced}} in the alpha cells of the pancreas that interacts with hepatic receptors to stimulate glucose production and release, via a cAMP-mediated pathway. Type 2 diabetes patients may have an excess of glucagon and, as such, glucagon antagonists might serve as diabetes drugs. The antagonists that bind to the glucagon receptor but do not exhibit activity could be analogs of glucagon. The presence of salt bridges between some residues of glucagons (such as aspartic acid) and others (such as lysine) might influence both the binding to the receptor and the activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental-The solid phase method with 4 -methylbenzilhydrilamine resin (p-MBHA resin) {{was used for the}} synthesis of glucagon analogs. Rat liver membranes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats by the Neville procedure. The receptor binding essay was performed in 1 % BSA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7. 2. Adenyl cyclase activity was measured in an assay medium containing 1 % serum albumin, 25 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0. 025 mM GTP, 5 mM ATP, 0. 9 mM theophylline, 17. 2 mM creatine phosphate, and 1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase. Theoretical-Quantum chemical calculations using the Titan program with the 6 - 31 G* basis set were performed to calculate the binding energies of salt bridges between aspartic or glutamic acids and lysine. The relative stability of cyclic conformations of glucagon segments versus the extended segments was determined. RESULTS: It was found that the cyclic Glu 9 -Lys 12 <b>amide</b> <b>compound</b> displayed a 20 -fold decrease in binding affinity. DesHis 1 cyclic compounds Glu 20 -Lys 24 amide and DesHis 1 Glu 9 Glu 20 -Lys 24 amide behave as glucagon antagonists. The calculations show that cyclic conformations of tetrapeptidic and pentapeptidic segments of glucagon are more stable than the extended species. CONCLUSIONS: The biological data and the theoretical calculations show that an intramolecular salt bridge might impart stability to some glucagon antagonists and, when situated at the C-terminus of glucagon, might facilitate induction of an alpha-helix upon initial hormone association with the membrane bilayer. These findings might be a useful tool for the design of new glucagon antagonists...|$|E

Fecha de lectura: 24 - 05 - 2010 The infection {{caused by}} opportunistic fungi {{is a growing}} threats for human health, because the increase of immunocompromised population. Unlike the antibacterials, the number of antifungal drugs is very limited. Only three out of seven classes of currently available antifungal agents are suitable for treatment of systemic infections: polyenes, azoles and echinocandins; these seemed to be insufficient for flight the widespread of opportunistic pathogens. In the last decades, several semi synthetics polyene macrolide derivatives were developed in attempts to improve their excellent pharmacological properties. The data concerned with the structure/activity relationships, currently available on the literature, clearly demonstrated that changing the charge of exocyclic carboxylic group (present {{in most of the}} polyene macrolides) into a positive group increases the specificity of the drugs towards their targets microorganisms. Thus, modification of the well conserved carboxyl group into their carboxamide derivatives, can be an interesting tool for generating new and more specific antimycotic agents. Recently, new natural carboxamide tetraenes were reported. The polyene-amide derivatives were “in vivo” generated by tailoring the parental polyene rimocidin, pimaricin and CE- 108. The activity was shown to be ATP and glutamine dependent and can be a tool for biotechnological challenge to develop new antifungal drugs. In this work the pcsB gene from Streptomyces sp. RGU 5. 3, responsible for the conversion of pimaricin into its amide derivative AB- 400, was isolated and characterized its gene product. The pcsB gene codes for an asparagine synthase of 615 amino acid residues. The gene is located outside the pimaricin biosynthetic cluster and in a very well conserved chromosomal region next to the pho operon. The genetic architecture {{is similar to that of}} pcsA from Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108, which also tailors rimocidin, CE- 108 and pimaricin. PcsB seemed to be more restricted for their substrate recognition that PcsA. Streptomyces sp. RGU 5. 3, engineered with pcsB gene showed AB- 400 as the main bioactive polyene. In this strain a new polyene <b>amide</b> <b>compound,</b> presumably 4, 5 -deepoxiAB- 400, was also detected. The protein PcsB was purified using a histidine tag and some enzymatic parameters was determined for the three substrates: pimaricin, ATP and glutamine. Interestingly, PcsB can partially recognize CE- 108 D (a polyene macrolide of the rimocidin family), but neither Rimocidin nor CE- 108. The differences on the substrate recognition pattern between PcsA and PcsB can help in future for affording directed changes in the proteins, aimed to increase the availability of substrates and eventually generate new carboxamide derivative...|$|E

40|$|Chemical and {{pharmaceutical}} industries make {{extensive use of}} <b>amide</b> <b>compounds</b> for the manufacture of commodity chemicals (e. g., acrylamide) and drug intermediates (e. g., nicotinamide). Production of <b>amide</b> <b>compounds</b> is typically achieved by the hydration of nitrile compounds under acidic or basic conditions, high temperatures, and copper catalysts. However, {{the use of such}} chemical methods leads to the generation of unwanted by-products and toxic wastes, in addition to low product yields and high production costs. An alternative route for amide production is the use of a natural catalyst, for example nitrile hydratases (NHase, E. C. 4. 2. 1. 84). NHase is a metalloenzyme that efficiently converts nitriles to amides at neutral pH and ambient temperatures, thus reducing production of unwanted by-products and toxic wastes. NHase contains either a non-heme Fe 3 + or a non-corrin Co 3 + metal ion at its active site and consist of two non-homologous subunits, α and β, which form an (αβ) 2 heterotetramer. In order to utilize NHases to their full potential, it is crucial to understand their biochemical and catalytic properties; therefore, the goal of this research project was to gain insight into these fundamental properties. A combination of molecular biology, enzyme kinetics, UV-Visible spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and enzyme immobilization were used to accomplish this goal.

The extraction agent was recycled through back extraction and exhibited good recycling properity and high extraction efficiency. Based on above experimental results, a separation process was proposed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite advancements in {{many areas}} of human medicine, {{infectious}} disease continues to be a major cause of mortality worldwide. Improper and excessive use of antibacterial compounds has led to the rise of resistant species of bacteria like Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We have discovered a new class of antibiotics that inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. Upon discovery of inhibition against S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria, MRSA, VRE, and other resistant strains were tested. Inhibition by the newly developed compounds on the resistant strains was identical to their inhibition levels against non-resistant strains of these species. We have continued to synthesize and test chemical derivatives of our lead compound in an effort to increase their effectiveness. Overall, these results demonstrate that our carboxylic <b>amide</b> <b>compounds</b> are a novel, non-penicillin based antibiotic {{that could be used to}} treat MRSA and other Gram-positive infections...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAppropriate {{values for}} the {{orientation}} of the amide transition dipoles are essential to the growing use of isotopically edited vibrational spectroscopy generally in structural biology and to infrared dichroism measurements on membrane-associated α-helices, in particular. The orientations of the transition moments for the amide vibrations of an α-helix have been determined from the ratio of intensities of the A- and E 1 -symmetry modes in the infrared spectra of poly(γ-methyl-l-glutamate) x-co-(γ-n-octadecyl-l-glutamate) y oriented on silicon substrates. Samples possessing a high degree of alignment were used to facilitate band fitting. Consistent results were obtained from both attenuated total reflection and transmission experiments with polarized radiation, yielding values of ΘI= 38 °, ΘII= 73 °, and ΘA= 29 °, relative to the helix axis, for the amide I, amide II, and amide A bands, respectively. The measurements are discussed both {{in the context of the}} somewhat divergent older determinations, and in relation to the helix geometry and results on model <b>amide</b> <b>compounds,</b> to resolve current uncertainties in the literature...|$|R
