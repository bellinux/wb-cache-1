5|$|Background {{selection}} {{is the opposite}} of a selective sweep.

5|$|Early on March28, an upper-level low tracked eastward {{into the}} Southern United States {{along with its}} {{associated}} shortwave trough, sending the subtropical jet through Texas and bringing <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> strong west-northwesterly winds in the upper-levels of the troposphere. Concurrently, a cold front extended zonally tracked south across the Great Plains before eventually stalling near the Red River valley, providing an additional focus area for storm development. Favorable conditions for severe weather were expected ahead of the upper-level low over areas of North Texas; accordingly, the Storm Prediction Center(SPC) issued a moderate risk for severe weather for the region, citing an unstable atmosphere caused by steep lapse rates of 7.5-8.0°C/km and high convective available potential energy values. The environment {{was expected to be}} conducive for the development of supercells as the warped subtropical jet produced strong wind shear over Texas.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Nanmadol, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Yoyong, {{was the last of}} four {{consecutive}} tropical cyclones to strike the Philippines in 2004. A quickly moving system, Nanmadol brought heavy rainfall and strong winds over the same regions impacted by the previous storms, exacerbating flood conditions in Luzon and surrounding regions. Together Nanmadol and these systems accounted for around 1,000deaths in the Philippines. The typhoon later became the first December tropical cyclone to strike Taiwan since record keeping began, bringing <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> heavy rain, which also affected nearby regions of eastern China. As an extratropical storm, Nanmadol brought gusty winds and rain to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its primary}} effects were felt in a {{localized}} area of India, the outer {{fringes of the}} super cyclone impacted Myanmar and Bangladesh. Ten {{people were killed in}} the former, while two were killed in the latter by the storm's rainbands. The storm was the most severe to strike Odisha in the 20th century, raking the state and adjacent areas with high storm surge, powerful winds, and torrential rainfall. The storm's impacts exacerbated the damage caused by a very severe cyclone that struck the same region less than two weeks earlier. The 5–6m (16–20ft) surge brought water up to 35km (20mi) inland, carrying <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> coastal debris and inundating towns and villages. The surge combined with heavy rains to produce widespread flooding, damaging around 1.6million homes and causing rivers to breach 20,005flood embankments. The storm's effects destroyed numerous crops, including sugar cane, rice, and other winter-time harvests. Although estimates of the death toll varied significantly—at times suggesting 30,000fatalities—the Government of India enumerated 9,887fatalities in the country, of which a majority were caused by storm surge; over 8,000deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpur. The total damage cost of the destruction wrought by the super cyclone amounted to US$4.44billion.|$|E

5|$|On 29 June, Hitler, {{through the}} Commander-in-Chief of the German Army Walther von Brauchitsch, {{instructed}} {{the commander of}} Army Group Center Fedor von Bock to halt the advance of his panzers until the infantry formations liquidating the pockets catch up. But {{the commander of the}} 2nd Panzer Group Heinz Guderian, with the tacit support of Fedor von Bock and the chief of OKH Franz Halder, ignored the instruction and attacked on eastward towards Bobruisk, albeit reporting the advance as a reconnaissance-in-force. He also personally conducted an aerial inspection of the Minsk-Białystok pocket on 30 June and concluded that his panzer group was not needed to contain it, since Hermann Hoth's 3rd Panzer Group was already involved in the Minsk pocket. On the same day, some of the infantry corps of the 9th and 4th Armies, having sufficiently liquidated the Białystok pocket, resumed their march eastward {{to catch up with the}} panzer groups. On 1 July, Fedor von Bock ordered the panzer groups to resume their full offensive eastward on the morning of 3 July. But Brauchitsch, upholding Hitler's instruction, and Halder, unwillingly going <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> opposed Bock's order. However, Bock insisted on the order by stating that it would be irresponsible to reverse orders already issued. The panzer groups, however, resumed their offensive on 2 July before the infantry formations had sufficiently caught up.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{flight from}} {{and return to}} Egypt was a common feature of temple ritual in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods (305 BC–AD 390), when the new year and the Nile flood that came <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> were celebrated as {{the return of the}} Eye after her wanderings in foreign lands. The Egyptians built shrines along the river {{containing}} images of animals and dwarfs rejoicing at the goddess' arrival. Scholars do not know how well developed the myth and the corresponding rituals were in earlier times. One of the oldest examples is Mut's return to her home temple in Thebes, which was celebrated there annually as early as the New Kingdom. At the temple of Montu at Medamud, in a festival that may date back to the late Middle Kingdom, it was Montu's consort Raettawy who was equated with Hathor and the Eye of Ra. The return of this Eye goddess, in fertile, moisture-bearing form, set the stage for her subsequent marriage to Montu and the birth of their mythological child, a form of Horus. The temple's new year festival celebrated her homecoming with drinking and dancing, paralleling the goddess' inebriated state after her pacification. In other cities, two goddesses were worshipped as the belligerent and peaceful forms of the Eye, as with Ayet and Nehemtawy at Herakleopolis or Satet and Anuket at Aswan.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Paul City Council {{decided in}} late 1974 to support I-35E, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} influence of proponents. R.I.P. 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan, and convinced the city council to go <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> The plan included a four-lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I-94 near the State Capitol, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying noise pollution, air pollution, vibrations, and slope stability as the main concerns. In addition to the nearby location of historic districts, hospitals were worried about the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed. The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I-35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice, but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street.|$|E
