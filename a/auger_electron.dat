40|$|Radioactive copper (II) (diacetyl-bis N 4 -methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-ATSM) {{isotopes}} {{were originally}} devel-oped for the imaging of hypoxia in tumors. Because {{the decay of}} a 64 Cu atom is emitting not only positrons but also <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons,</b> this radionuclide has great potential as a theranostic agent. However, the success of 64 Cu-ATSM internal radiation therapy {{would depend on the}} contribution of <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> to tumor cell killing. Therefore, we designed a cell culture system to define the contributions to cell death from <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> to support or refute our hypothesis that the majority of cell death from 64 Cu-ATSM is a result of high-LET <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> and not positrons or other low-LET radiation. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) wild type and DNA repair–deficient xrs 5 cells were exposed to 64 Cu-ATSM during hypoxic conditions. Surviving fractions were com-pared with those surviving gamma-radiation, low-LET hadron radiation, and high-LET heavy ion exposure. The ratio of the D 10 values (doses required to achieve 10 % cell survival) between CHO wild type and xrs 5 cells sug-gested that 64 Cu-ATSM toxicity {{is similar to that of}} high-LET Carbon ion radiation (70 keV/μm). γH 2 AX foci assays confirmed DNA double-strand breaks and cluster damage by high-LET <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> from 64 Cu decay...|$|R
25|$|Often the {{annealing}} process will let bulk impurities diffuse {{to the surface}} and therefore give rise to a re-contamination after each cleaning cycle. The problem is that impurities which adsorb without changing the basic symmetry of the surface, cannot easily be identified in the diffraction pattern. Therefore, in many LEED experiments <b>Auger</b> <b>electron</b> spectroscopy is used to accurately determine the purity of the sample.|$|E
25|$|To {{improve the}} {{measured}} signal in <b>Auger</b> <b>electron</b> spectroscopy, the gate voltage is scanned in a linear ramp. An RC circuit serves to derive the second derivative, {{which is then}} amplified and digitized. To reduce the noise, multiple passes are summed up. The first derivative is very large due to the residual capacitive coupling between gate and the anode and may degrade {{the performance of the}} circuit. By applying a negative ramp to the screen this can be compensated. It is also possible to add a small sine to the gate. A high Q RLC circuit is tuned to the second harmonic to detect the second derivative.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} work of Pontecorvo {{is full of}} formidable intuitions, {{some of which have}} represented milestones in modern physics. Much of this involved the neutrino, a subatomic particle first proposed theoretically by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 in order to explain undetected energy that escaped during beta decay so that the law of conservation of energy was not violated. Fermi named it the neutrino, Italian for [...] "little neutral one", and in 1934, proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino. Initially neutrinos were thought to be undetectable, but in 1945 Pontecorvo noted that a neutrino striking a chlorine nucleus could transform it into unstable argon-37 that emits, with a 34 days half-life, after a K-capture reaction, a 2.8 keV <b>Auger</b> <b>electron</b> allowing its direct detection: ...|$|E

50|$|Upon ejection, the {{kinetic energy}} of the <b>Auger</b> <b>electron</b> {{corresponds}} {{to the difference between}} the {{energy of the}} initial electronic transition into the vacancy and the ionization energy for the electron shell from which the <b>Auger</b> <b>electron</b> was ejected. These energy levels depend on the type of atom and the chemical environment in which the atom was located. <b>Auger</b> <b>electron</b> spectroscopy involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either X-rays or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons that result {{as a function of the}} <b>Auger</b> <b>electron</b> energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment. Auger recombination is a similar Auger effect which occurs in semiconductors. An electron and electron hole (electron-hole pair) can recombine giving up their energy to an electron in the conduction band, increasing its energy. The reverse effect is known as impact ionization.|$|E

50|$|The {{excess energy}} of the {{electron}} that migrates to an inner shell to fill the newly created hole {{can do more than}} emit an X-ray. Often, instead of X-ray emission, the excess energy is transferred to a third electron from a further outer shell, prompting its ejection.

Namely, different kinds of Post Collisional Interactions (PCI) occurring in the decay of Argon 2 p holes by emission of two <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> are isolated experimentally with a powerful coincidence technique and are modeled with an eikonal approach. It is shown that PCI distortion of the photoelectron line shape is stronger than in the single Auger paths and depends critically on the process: in direct Double Auger decays where two <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> are emitted simultaneously, direct interaction of the 2 p photoelectron with the two <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> is demonstrated; in cascade Double Auger processes, the PCI distortion depends only slightly on the last electron emitted in the cascade.

This technique involves the illumination of the sample by high-intensity X-ray beams from a synchrotron and monitoring their photoabsorption by detecting in the intensity of <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> {{as a function of}} the incident photon energy. Surface sensitivity is achieved by the interpretation of data depending on the intensity of the <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> (which have an escape depth of ~1-2 nm) instead of looking at the relative absorption of the X-rays as in the parent method, EXAFS.|$|R

30|$|Radionuclides {{emitting}} densely ionizing <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> impart high cytotoxicity {{when they}} decay {{in close proximity}} to nuclear DNA due to the formation of double-strand breaks, resulting in severe DNA damage [1]. Because <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> are characterized by short path lengths in the tissue and a very high linear energy transfer, their cytotoxic effects are limited to a sphere of a few nanometers in the immediate vicinity of the site of decay [2].

40|$|Auger {{intensity}} variations over an oxygen-charged polycrystalline silver surface {{have been}} observed by studies of Auger images and line scans of selected adjacent grains which were determined to be the (421) and (221) orientations. The observed contrast (M 4. 5 VV transition) between the grains is produced by the variation in the detected <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> caused by the different directions (interatomic direction) of forward focusing in each grain. The contrast produced by the Ag <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on the surface order of the grains, but that of the O <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons</b> was not, presumably because the atoms were randomly distributed throughout the Ag surface or subsurface. The contrast observed between the grains at the lower Auger energies (N 1 VV and N 1 N 2. 3 V transitions) appeared to be produced by constructive interference from multiple scattering. The N 1 N 2. 3 V electrons at 29 eV, for example, gave higher contrast than that of the N 1 VV transition at 78 eV...|$|R
5000|$|Surface {{sensitivity}} in AES {{arises from}} the fact that emitted electrons usually have energies ranging from 50 eV to 3 keV and at these values, electrons have a short mean free path in a solid. The escape depth of electrons is therefore localized to within a few nanometers of the target surface, giving AES an extreme sensitivity to surface species. Because of the low energy of <b>Auger</b> <b>electrons,</b> most AES setups are run under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Such measures prevent electron scattering off of residual gas atoms as well as the formation of a thin [...] "gas (adsorbate) layer" [...] {{on the surface of the}} specimen, which degrades analytical performance. A typical AES setup is shown schematically in figure 2. In this configuration, focused electrons are incident on a sample and emitted electrons are deflected into a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA).
