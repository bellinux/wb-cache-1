25|$|Many of {{the early}} school {{accidents}} were related to spin-training. Once the AA-1 entered a fully developed spin and exceeded three turns, it was usually not recoverable. The AA-1 had been spin-tested {{as part of its}} certification, but in 1973 the FAA issued <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> 73-13-07 ordering the aircraft placarded against spins.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, 2016, the FAA {{issued an}} <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directive</b> {{following}} a January 29 {{incident in which}} a General Electric GEnx-1B PIP2 engine suffered damage and non-restartable power loss while flying {{at an altitude of}} 20,000 feet. The damage is thought to have been caused by a fan imbalance resulting from fan ice shedding.|$|E

50|$|The Certification {{work also}} {{includes}} all post-certification activities, {{such as the}} approval of changes to, and repairs of, aeronautical products and their components, {{as well as the}} issuing of <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directives</b> to correct any potentially unsafe situation.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has been}} relatively free of Service Bulletins and <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> and has proved exceedingly effective in competition at all levels. The obvious capabilities of the aircraft and its success in use, together with the relatively large numbers built (some 250) have meant that owners make relatively few modifications and that few are needed.|$|R
25|$|The {{accident}} triggered {{an investigation}} of the Lockheed L-109C Flight Data Recorder which resulted in modifications of that device and revision of the standards for all recorders. Also addressed were potential problems with the Pyrene Duo Head Model DCD-10 for the underfloor baggage and heater compartments. There was an <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> issued. Revisions were made to the Pilot's Manual, Viscount Maintenance and Instruction, and Accessories Manuals.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a series}} of {{high-pressure}} turbine failures on 6 September 1997, 7 June 2000 and 8 December 2002, and resulting in 767s being written off on 22 September 2000, and on 2 June 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directive</b> mandating inspections for over 600 engines and the NTSB believed that this number should be increased to include all -80 series engines with more than 3000 cycles since new or since last inspection.|$|E
25|$|Early models {{featured}} {{front seat}} three-point harnesses where the shoulder belt was {{fixed to the}} seat itself. This was found to offer too little strength and was replaced with one fixed to the fuselage behind the seat {{as part of a}} 1987 <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> (AD). In spite of being designed specifically to avoid fatigue issues, the series has been subject to a number of ADs due to fatigue cracking, both in the main wing and the elevator.|$|E

25|$|During repairs {{following}} the accident, cracks {{were discovered in}} {{the wings of the}} aircraft. As a result of the discovery, an <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> was issued affecting twenty A380-841, A380-842 and A380-861 aircraft that had accumulated over 1,300 hours flight. Those aircraft with under 1,800 hours flight were to be inspected within 6 weeks or 84 flights (whichever occurred first), while those with more than 1,800 hours flight were to be examined within four days or 14 flights. On 8 February 2012, the checks were extended to cover all 68 A380 aircraft in operation.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2010, the European Aviation Safety Agency {{issued an}} Emergency <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive,</b> {{ordering}} airlines using the Trent 900 engine to conduct frequent and stringent tests: extended ground idle runs, Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) stage one blade and case drain inspections and High Pressure/Intermediate Pressure (HP/IP) structure air buffer cavity and oil service tube inspections. However, on 22 November, the EASA eased its inspection guidelines, citing {{progress in the}} investigation. It dropped requirements for extended ground idle runs and requirements for repetitive inspections of the LPT stage one blades and case drain.|$|E
25|$|On 11 March 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board issued urgent safety {{recommendation}} SB-09-11 {{calling for the}} redesign of the fuel-oil heat exchangers used on Rolls-Royce Trent 800 Series engines. A build-up of ice from water naturally occurring in the fuel had caused a restriction {{of the flow of}} fuel to the engines of G-YMMM. Rolls-Royce had already started on redesigning the component, with an in-service date of March 2010 at the latest. All affected engines were to be fitted with the redesigned component within six months of its certification. In May 2010 the <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> was extended to cover the Trent 500 and 700 series engines as well.|$|E
5000|$|The FAA {{refers to}} the non-responsiveness of new and {{improved}} TSO C74c compliant transponders to Mode S compatible radars and TCAS as [...] "The Terra Problem", and has issued <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> (ADs) against various transponder manufacturers, over the years, at various times on no predictable schedule. The ghosting and ring around problems have recurred on the more modern radars.|$|R
50|$|The NTSB's {{recommendations}} {{following the}} earlier Flight 96 incident, which {{were intended to}} decrease the possibility of another hatch failure, were not implemented by any airline. As a result, the NTSB now communicates directly with the FAA regarding the former's recommendations for safety improvements, and the FAA may issue <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> based on those recommendations. However, the FAA is not obligated to act on NTSB recommendations.|$|R
25|$|The FAA {{began an}} {{aggressive}} safety evaluation in July 2005. The evaluation is performing a detailed review of accidents, incidents, <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directives,</b> service difficulty reports, safety recommendations and safety reports. It also is examining pilot training requirements, {{the history of}} the aircraft's commercial operators and possible engine problems. The goal is to identify the root causes of MU-2 accidents and incidents and determine what, if any, additional safety actions are needed.|$|R
25|$|In January 2012 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority {{issued an}} <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directive</b> {{grounding}} all Bonanzas, Twin Bonanzas and Debonairs {{equipped with a}} single pole-style yoke, having forward elevator control cables more than 15 years old, until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have frayed cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff and resulting concerns {{about the age of}} the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding some Bonanzas had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with frayed cables were grounded until the cables were replaced and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) requesting that the elevator control cables be inspected during the annual inspection.|$|E
500|$|Following the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) {{issued an}} <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> {{ordering}} all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be {{fitted with a}} sequence gate latch, known as a Martin bar. The device is a metal bar which a crew would manually swing {{in front of the}} thrust levers over the idle line, physically preventing the thrust levers from being retarded into the reverse position. According to the CAB report, a United Airlines engineer told investigators the Martin bar should make propeller reversal [...] "a more reliable and safer device ... with its numerous switches, relays, and automatic operation." ...|$|E
500|$|CF6 engines {{like that}} {{containing}} the crash disk {{were used to}} power many civilian and military aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] Due to concerns that the accident could recur, a large number of disks that were in service were examined by ultrasound for indications of defects. The fan disks on at least two other engines were found to have defects like that of the crash disk. Prioritization and efficiency of inspections of the many engines under suspicion would have been aided by determination of the titanium source of the crash disk. [...] Chemical analyses of the crash disk intended to determine its source were inconclusive. [...] The NTSB report stated that if examined disks were not from the same source, “the records on a large number of GEAE disks are suspect. [...] It also means that any AD (<b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive)</b> action that is based on the serial number of a disk could fail to have its intended effect because suspect disks could remain in service.” [...] The FAA report did not explicitly address the impact of these uncertainties on operations of military aircraft that might have contained a suspect disk.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of fatal {{accidents}} involving spins have occurred with the Puchacz. Investigations have failed to uncover a common design flaw, but the type's reputation has nevertheless been tainted. Its supporters {{point out that it}} was designed to obey faithfully all control inputs - including foolish ones. Partial failures at the rudder bar and control sticks have been known to occur, but <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> have been issued for modifications.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> 83-14-08 {{issued in}} September 1983 {{mandated}} an additional pair of stall strips {{to be added}} to the inboard leading edge of the PA-38 wing to [...] "standardize and improve the stall characteristics".|$|E
2500|$|Ground {{handling}} requires certain {{attention and}} procedures. The rear engine tends to overheat and can quit while taxiing on very hot days. Accidents have occurred when pilots, {{unaware of the}} shutdown, have attempted take-off on the nose engine alone, though the single-engine take-off roll exceeded the particular runway length. Federal Aviation Administration <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> 77-08-05 prohibits single-engine take-offs and requires the installation of a placard marked [...] "DO NOT INITIATE SINGLE ENGINE TAKEOFF".|$|E
50|$|Maintenance {{may include}} such tasks as {{ensuring}} compliance with <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> or Service Bulletins. The {{maintenance of aircraft}} is highly regulated, {{in order to ensure}} safe and correct functioning during flight. National regulations are coordinated under international standards, maintained by bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The maintenance tasks, personnel and inspections are all tightly regulated and staff must be licensed for the tasks they carry out.|$|R
5000|$|In April, 1996 the American FAA issued 18 <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> (ADs) {{affecting}} 29 turboprop aircraft {{which had}} the combination of unpowered flight controls, pneumatic deicing boots and NACA [...] "five-digit sharp-stall" [...] airfoils. They included significant revisions of pilot operating procedures in icing conditions (higher minimum speeds, non-use of the autopilot, different upset recovery procedures) {{as well as physical}} changes to the coverage area of the de-icing boots on the airfoils.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of a proactive system (a Web-based Surveillance and Auditing Tool- WebSAT), which promotes standardization in data collection and identifies the contributing factors that impact aircraft safety. This system will document the processes and the outcomes of maintenance activities, make the results more accessible, and reduce future maintenance error rates. WebSAT will capture and analyze data for the different operations involved in surveillance, auditing, and <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directives.</b> To achieve standardization in data collection, data needs to be collected on certain variables which measure maintenance processes. These variables are defined as process measures. The process measures incorporate the response and observation-based data collected during surveillance, audits, and the control of the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directives.</b> This paper elaborates on the processes that exist in the aviation maintenance work group, the concerns {{that need to be addressed}} while identifying the process measures, and the utility of these process measures in conducting data analysis. Once data is captured in terms of these process measures, data analysis can be conducted to identify the potential problematic areas affecting the safety of an aircraft...|$|R
