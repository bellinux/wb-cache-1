5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>problems,</b> is less strong.|$|E

40|$|Background: Childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> {{behaviour}} <b>problems</b> are antecedents {{for later}} psychopathology. This study investigated genetic and environmental influences shaping the longitudinal association between childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems</b> and specific PEs. Method: In a community-based twin sample, parents reported on <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems</b> when twins were ages 7 and 12 years. At age 16 years, specific PEs were measured using self-reports and parent reports. Structural equation model-fitting was conducted. Results: Childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems</b> were {{significantly associated with}} paranoia, cognitive disorganisation and parent-rated negative symptoms in adolescence (mean r =. 15 –. 38), {{and to a lesser extent}} with hallucinations, grandiosity and anhedonia (mean r =. 04 -. 12). Genetic influences on childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems</b> explained significant proportions of variance in adolescent paranoia (4 %), cognitive disorganisation (8 %) and parent-rated negative symptoms (3 %). Unique environmental influences on childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems</b> explained ≤ 1 % of variance in PEs. Common environmental influences were only relevant for the relationship between childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems</b> and parent-rated negative symptoms (explaining 28 % of variance) and are partly due to correlated rater effects. Conclusions: Childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems</b> are significantly, if weakly, associated with adolescent PEs. These associations are driven in part by common genetic influences underlying both <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems</b> and PEs. However, psychotic experiences in adolescence are largely influenced by genetic and environmental factors that are independent of general childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems,</b> suggesting they are not merely an extension of childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behaviour <b>problems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to examine the prevalence <b>and</b> predictors of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in a general population sample of Moroccan immigrant children aged 4 through 18 living in the Netherlands. In chapter 1, it was described that Moroccan immigrant youth are expected to be at high risk of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems,</b> as they are over-represented in the population of juvenile delinquents and they increasingly apply for youth assistance. Moreover, Moroccan immigrant youth may have to cope with several risk factors related to migration and culture. An overview was provided of levels of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in immigrant youth samples, and factors associated with <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> were lined out. As presented in the first chapter, with this study we aimed to: 1. Determine the prevalence of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant children and adolescents, and to compare this with the prevalence of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in Turkish immigrant and Dutch native children and adolescents. 2. Identify patterns of psychological acculturation in Moroccan immigrant adolescents and adults. 3. Determine the factors associated with <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant youth. a. Examine the relation between acculturation <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant adolescents. b. Gain insight into the association between parenting <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant children and adolescents. c. Determine other factors associated with <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant adolescents. Children, aged 4 through 18 with at least one parent born in Morocco, were randomly selected from municipal registers of two major cities in the Netherlands, The Hague and Rotterdam. Eight hundred nineteen parents (response rate 73 %); 387 adolescents aged 11 through 18 (response rate 91 %); and 541 teachers (response rate 83 %) participated in the study.

40|$|Objectives: Understanding the {{psychological}} reasons underlying children’s <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems</b> can guide appropriate interventions. This study examined <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems</b> in Australian children and unhealthy family {{functioning as a}} psychological factor associated with development of these <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems.</b> Methods: The study utilised stratified surveys conducted by the New South Wales, Ministry of Health, during the years 2005 - 2008. A computer assisted telephone interviewing method was employed. The surveys collected information on demographics, family functioning measured by the General Functioning Scale, <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems</b> measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Children aged 4 - 15 years (n= 7, 210 children) were included. Logistic regression analyses {{were used for the}} <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problem</b> outcomes. Results: Analyses adjusting for demographics revealed that unhealthy family functioning increased substantially the risks of emotional symptoms (OR = 2. 53; 95 % CI = 1. 36 - 4. 69), peer problems (OR = 6. 26; 95 % CI = 4. 43 - 11. 42), conduct problems (OR = 3. 83; 95 % CI = 1. 88 - 7. 84), <b>and</b> the overall <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems</b> (OR = 5. 06; 95 % CI = 2. 42 - 10. 58). Conclusions: Children from unhealthy family functioning backgrounds have a potential risk factor for <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems.</b> Mental health interventions aiming at improving the quality of parent-child relationships may reduce this potential risk for <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems</b> among the children...|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>problems</b> seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of sleep <b>problems</b> to <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> among young children {{within the context}} of known risk factors for psychopathology was examined. Data on 2 - and 3 -year-olds, representative of Canadian children without a chronic illness, from three cross-sectional cohorts of the Canadian National Longitudinal Study of Child and Youth were analysed (n = 2996, 2822, and 3050). The person most knowledgeable (PMK), usually the mother, provided information about her child, herself, and her family. Predictors included: child health status and temperament; parenting and PMK depressive symptomatology; family demographics (e. g., marital status, income) and functioning. Child sleep problems included night waking and bedtime resistance. Both internalizing/emotional (i. e., anxiety) and externalizing/behavioral problems (i. e., hyperactivity, aggression) were examined. Adjusting for other known risk factors, child sleep problems accounted for a small, but significant, independent proportion of the variance in internalizing and externalizing problems. Structural equation models examining the pathways linking risk factors to sleep <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> were a good fit of the data. Results were replicated on two additional cross-sectional samples. The relation between sleep <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> is independent of other commonly identified risk factors. Among young children, sleep problems are as strong a correlate of child <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> as PMK depressive symptomatology, a well-established risk factor for child psychopathology. Adverse parenting and PMK symptomatology, along with difficult temperament all contribute to both sleep <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems.</b> Children 2 ̆ 7 s sleep problems appear to exacerbate <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>problems</b> such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS.

40|$|Background: Although it is {{well-established}} {{that children}} with language impairment (LI) and children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) both show elevated levels of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems,</b> the level and types of difficulties across the two groups have not previously been directly compared. Aims: To compare levels of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems</b> in children with LI and children with ASD recruited from the same mainstream schools. Methods & Procedures: We measured teacher-reported <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems</b> using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) {{in a sample of}} 5 – 13 -year-old children with LI (N = 62) and children with ASD (N = 42) attending mainstream school but with identified special educational needs. Outcomes&Results: Both groups showed similarly elevated levels of <b>emotional,</b> conduct <b>and</b> hyperactivity <b>problems.</b> The only differences between the LI and ASD groups were on subscales assessing peer problems (which were higher in the ASD group) and prosocial behaviours (which were higher in the LI group). Overall, there were few associations between <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems</b> and child characteristics, reflecting the pervasive nature of these difficulties in children with LI and children with ASD, although levels of problems were higher in children with ASD with lower language ability. However, in the ASD group only, a measure of family social economic status was associated with language ability and attenuated the association between language ability <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems.</b> Conclusions & Implications: Children with LI and children with ASD in mainstream school show similarly elevated levels of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems,</b> which require monitoring and may benefit from intervention. Further work is required to identify the child, family and situational factors that place children with LI and children with ASD at risk of <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioural <b>problems,</b> and whether these differ between the two groups.

This study used cognitive assessments and questionnaires to measure cognitive function, coping strategies, <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in children aged 6 to 16 years near the time of diagnosis of a brain tumor and at four follow-up time-points up to 2 years post-diagnosis. The associations between domains of cognitive function, coping strategies (primary control coping, secondary control coping, disengagement coping) <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> were examined using correlational analyses. While new treatments have increased the survival rate of pediatric patients with brain tumors, they have also left this population with many adverse cognitive, <b>emotional,</b> <b>and</b> behavioral outcomes. Prior research provides evidence to support an association between cognitive function and use of complex secondary control coping strategies (e. g., acceptance and cognitive reappraisal). In children with brain tumors and other populations of children with chronic illness, these coping strategies {{have been associated with}} fewer adjustment problems. The present study used cognitive assessments and questionnaires to measure cognitive function, coping strategies, <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>problems</b> in children aged 6 to 16 years near the time of diagnosis of a brain tumor and at four follow-up time-points up to 2 years post-diagnosis.

500|$|The {{notion that}} {{thiomersal}} causes autism {{has led some}} parents to have their children treated with costly and potentially dangerous therapies such as chelation therapy, which is typically used to treat heavy metal poisoning, due to parental fears that autism {{is a form of}} [...] "mercury poisoning". As many as 2 to 8% of autistic children in the U.S., numbering as many as several thousand children per year, receive mercury-chelating agents. Although critics of using chelation therapy as an autism treatment point to a lack of any evidence to support its use, hundreds of doctors prescribe these medications despite possible side effects including nutritional deficiencies as well as damage to the liver and kidney.
