5|$|Jim avidly {{read the}} Liverpool Echo or Express, liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His {{attitude}} to life {{was based upon}} self-respect, perseverance, fairness and a strong work ethic. His political views were far from left-wing, as he insisted {{that there was nothing}} <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, and nothing would ever change.|$|E
5|$|A {{town meeting}} is held to discuss Mr. Burns' actions. Mr. Burns arrives, {{armed with a}} gun after his {{encounter}} with Homer. Despite the whole town standing up to him, he activates the sun-blocking device, thinking himself invincible. He walks into an alley, obscured from view, and struggles with someone until a gunshot is heard. He stumbles out into the open, wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since Mr. Burns has angered so many people recently, just about <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> have been the shooter.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kecal is {{attempting}} to buy Jeník off, and after some verbal fencing makes a straight cash offer: a hundred florins if Jeník will renounce Mařenka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E

5|$|On May 2, 1947, General Douglas MacArthur {{lifted the}} {{restrictions}} on displaying the Hinomaru in {{the grounds of the}} National Diet Building, on the Imperial Palace, on the Prime Minister's residence and on the Supreme Court building with the ratification of the new Constitution of Japan. Those restrictions were further relaxed in 1948, when people were allowed to fly the flag on national holidays. In January 1949, the restrictions were abolished and <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> fly the Hinomaru at any time without permission. As a result, schools and homes were encouraged to fly the Hinomaru until the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|She {{remained}} laid up {{for some}} time, before being put to varied use around England, Scotland and Ireland. In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's iron ship SS Great Britain ran aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to whether she could be re-floated. Brunel advised that if <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> rescue the ship then the man to do it was the naval engineer James Bremner. He was engaged and the Great Britain was re-floated on 27 August 1847 {{with the assistance of}} HMS Birkenhead.|$|E
5|$|Steam's {{primary service}} {{is to allow}} its users to {{download}} games and other software {{that they have in}} their virtual software libraries to their local computers as game cache files (GCFs). Initially, Valve was required to be the publisher for these titles since they had sole access to the Steam's database and engine, but with the introduction of the Steamworks software development kit (SDK) in May 2008, <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> potentially become a publisher to Steam, outside of Valve's involvement to curate titles on the service.|$|E

5|$|The French Revolution was {{integral}} {{to the expansion of}} French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Marie-Antoine Carême was born in 1784, five years before the Revolution. He spent his younger years working at a pâtisserie until he was discovered by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, who would later cook for Napoleon Bonaparte. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Carême had become known for his pièces montées, which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospects}} of {{a link between the}} navigation and the Basingstoke Canal being constructed, the undertaking was valued at £24,000, and D'Arcy sold a half share in it to his agent, George Hollis. He then sold the other half to him, and moved to Ireland. Hollis became the sole proprietor from 1804, having bought out his sleeping partner. Throughout its life, the navigation had almost been a monopoly, but Hollis planned to end this, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1802, to make it an open navigation, where <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> use it on payment of the appropriate tolls. These were laid down in the Act, ending the setting of tolls by the Commissioners. The Act also specified that he had three years to put the river in order, which he appears to have achieved, since he then leased it to a group of merchants.|$|E
5|$|Eager {{to promote}} and defend her religion, she {{played a leading role}} in both the Witchcraft Research Association and then the Pagan Front during the 1960s and 1970s. That latter decade also saw her briefly involve herself in far right {{politics}} as well as becoming a keen ley hunter and proponent of Earth mysteries. As well as regularly writing articles on esoteric topics for various magazines, from the 1960s onward she authored a number of books on the subject of Wicca, as well as contributing to the publication of works by Wiccan friends Stewart Farrar, Janet Farrar, and Evan John Jones. In these works also she became an early advocate of the idea that <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> practice Wicca without requiring initiation by a pre-existing Wiccan, while also contributing to and encouraging research into the religion's early history. Living in Brighton during these years, she worked with both her partner and initiate Ron Cook and {{was a member of the}} Silver Malkin coven. In her final years she served as patron of the Sussex-based Centre for Pagan Studies prior to her death from pancreatic cancer.|$|E

25|$|The party {{suffered}} as bad a defeat as <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> have {{expected in the}} 1971 election. It was {{shut out of the}} legislature altogether in an election that saw Social Credit defeated after 36 years in power at the hands of Lougheed's Progressive Conservatives.|$|E
25|$|Peter Masefield, in {{his review}} of caste {{situation}} in India states that <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> in principle perform any profession. The texts state that the Brahmin took food from anyone, suggesting that strictures of commensality were as yet unknown. The Nikaya texts also imply that endogamy was not mandated.|$|E

25|$|Konstantin {{tried in}} vain to {{convince}} his attendants to take him to see his second family, but they were under strict orders not to do so and pretended not to understand the invalid's wishes. One day, brought home by his attendants, he grabbed his wife's hair and beat her with a stick before <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> intervene.|$|E
25|$|Because the customer's {{name was}} not on the charge coin, almost <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> use it. This {{sometimes}} led to a case of mistaken identity, either accidentally or intentionally, by acting on behalf of the charge account owner or out of malice to defraud both the charge account owner and the merchant. Beginning in the 1930s, merchants started to move from charge coins to the newer Charga-Plate.|$|E

25|$|After the Mexican War of Independence, the crafts’ guilds {{that had}} {{regulated}} manufacture through {{the colonial period}} were abolished. Since <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> call themself a craftsman, product quality deteriorated badly, especially in pottery, foreign products entered the country freely and industrialization began to take hold. To help stop the socio-economic deterioration of artisans, brotherhoods, cooperatives and professional organizations were founded. However, indigenous artists generally did not join these associations, and they remained within their own socioeconomic organizations.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{achievement of the}} IPP was the introduction to Irish society of a parliamentary constitutional tradition and all that went with it– a fully up and running local government administration with its diverse institutions, which had rooted itself more deeply than <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> have imagined {{into the life of}} the country. The party had above all (in the era prior to 1914) contributed in its prime to the political maturity of the nation and to the transformation of its society.|$|E
25|$|Timothy Hutton plays Archie Goodwin, and I can't see how <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> do {{a better}} job. Not only does he catch Archie's snap-brim Thirties tone with sharp-eared precision, but he also bears an uncanny {{physical}} resemblance to the dapper detective-narrator I've been envisioning all these years. No sooner did Hutton make his first entrance in The Golden Spiders than he melded completely with the Archie of my mind's eye. I can no longer read a Stout novel without seeing him, or hearing his voice.|$|E
