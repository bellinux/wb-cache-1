40|$|Mitigating {{the effects}} of {{damaging}} wind turbine loads and responses extends the lifetime of the turbine and, consequently, reduces the associated Cost of Energy (COE). Active control of aerodynamic devices is one option for achieving wind turbine load mitigation. Generally speaking, control system design and analysis requires a reasonable dynamic model of {open_quotes}plant,{close_quotes} (i. e., the system being controlled). This paper extends the wind turbine <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> research, previously conducted at the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), by presenting a more detailed development of the wind turbine dynamic model. In prior research, active <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> designs were implemented in an existing wind turbine structural dynamics code, FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence). In this paper, the FAST code is used, in conjunction with system identification, to generate a wind turbine dynamic model for use in active <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> system design. The FAST code is described and {{an overview of the}} system identification technique is presented. An <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> case study is used to demonstrate this modeling technique. The results of the case study are then used to propose ideas for generalizing this technique for creating dynamic models for other wind turbine control applications...|$|R

Even during {{take-off}} from Istres on 18 October 1932, Marmoz noticed the <b>aileron</b> <b>controls</b> were slack, the ailerons themselves vibrated and there were large oscillations of the wings, with amplitude as much as 1m.

2500|$|The ERCO 310, which {{included}} a fully cowled engine, made its first flight in October 1937 at College Park Airport and was soon renamed the [...] "Ercoupe". The easy-to-fly design included unique design features, including a large glazed canopy for improved visibility. The prototype 310 featured an ERCO-made inverted four-cylinder engine, the ERCO I-L 116, which was quickly dropped due to its high manufacturing cost compared to the new Continental A-65 horizontal. Lacking rudder pedals, the Ercoupe was flown using only the <b>control</b> <b>wheel.</b> A two-control system linked the rudder and <b>aileron</b> systems, which <b>controlled</b> yaw and roll, with the steerable nosewheel. The <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>controlled</b> the pitch and the steering of the aircraft, both {{on the ground and}} in the air, simplifying control and coordinated turning and eliminating the need for rudder pedals. A completely new category of pilot's license was created by the CAA for Ercoupe pilots who had never used a rudder pedal.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> and rudder pedals. The <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and bell cranks. Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} <b>control</b> <b>wheels.</b> The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw <b>control.</b> Nose <b>wheel</b> steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.|$|R
50|$|One {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of}} the Tiger Moth design is its differential <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> setup. The <b>ailerons</b> (on the lower wing only) on a Tiger Moth are operated by an externally mounted circular bellcrank, which lies flush with the lower wing's fabric undersurface covering. This circular bellcrank is rotated by metal cables and chains from the cockpit's control columns, and has the externally mounted aileron pushrod attached at a point 45° outboard and forward of the bellcrank's centre, when the ailerons are both at their neutral position. This results in an <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> system operating, with barely any travel down {{at all on the}} wing {{on the outside of the}} turn, while the aileron on the inside travels a large amount upwards to counteract adverse yaw.|$|R

25|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} cause of the accident was that the co-pilot's <b>aileron</b> <b>controls</b> had jammed due to a chain slipping off its sprocket.

5000|$|Mass balancing: the <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> {{system is}} mass balanced, with {{integral}} counterweights inside the wings.
