Santa Anna ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E
25|$|By 1945, Gardiner was {{considered}} one of the top half-dozen trial lawyers in the province and he commanded high fees.

Gardiner worked hard at research and marshalled detailed evidence with self-assurance.|$|E
25|$|Under Henry VI of England, in {{the fifteenth}} century, just before the Wars of the Roses, {{attendance}} at Parliament became more valuable. The first claim of hereditary right to a writ comes from this reign; so does the first patent, or charter declaring <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Baron; and the five orders began to be called Peers; holders of older peerages also began receive greater honor than Peers of the same rank just created.|$|E

25|$|The {{students}} of the University enjoy an unusual family tradition designed to make new students feel at home and build relationships within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires academic parents who are at least in their third year as students. These older students act as informal mentors in academic and social matters {{and it is not}} uncommon for such academic family ties to stretch well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his Senior Man but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to be his Senior Woman. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her Senior Man but there is no overt rule regarding how she acquires a Senior Woman. The establishment of these relationships begins at the very start of the first semester – with the aim of being in place ahead of Raisin Weekend.|$|E
500|$|The passage was lightly {{adapted from}} an earlier book with a similar title, John Nott's [...] (1723), which {{declared}} he had added an introduction because fashion had made it as odd for a book to be printed without one as for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen [...] "in church without a neck cloth or a lady without a hoop-petticoat." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being the}} last great failure of the British Army, Arnhem has become a byword for the {{fighting}} spirit of the British people and has set a standard for the Parachute Regiment. Montgomery claimed that [...] "in years to come {{it will be a}} great thing for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to say: 'I fought at Arnhem'", a prediction seemingly borne out by the pride of soldiers who took part, and the occasional desire of those who did not to claim that they were there.|$|E

[...] However, the magistrates refused. [...] Informed of Vane's conduct before and during the trial, Charles II now felt that Vane was too dangerous <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left alive, and retracted his clemency. [...] (Unlike Vane, John Lambert at his trial had thrown himself on the mercy of the court, and was consequently exiled to Guernsey after his conviction.) [...] Although Vane had been sentenced to the commoner's death of being hanged and then drawn and quartered, Charles was persuaded to grant him the gentleman's death of beheading. [...] On 14 June 1662 Vane was taken to Tower Hill and beheaded. Noted diarist Samuel Pepys was there and recorded the event: ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{this caused}} {{considerable}} annoyance to the Portuguese at Zumbo, though the boma coexisted with Clark's settlement {{for the most}} part. The most prominent trans-river clash came when Clark demonstrated {{the strength of his}} army by overpowering the fort's garrison, pulling down the Portuguese flag and running up the Union Jack in its place. He then returned to Feira, leaving the British flag flying over Zumbo. His point made, he made no attempt to stop the Portuguese garrison from returning. The Portuguese arrested Clark at one point, according to one story, but released him after the native troopers refused to guard him, saying he was [...] "too great <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arrested". A similar tale has Harrison Clark being captured in Mozambique and deported to Feira under guard by two Portuguese soldiers; these men found the journey so harrowing that Clark ended up escorting them back. According to one of Clark's indigenous followers, he once put an intruding Chikunda force to flight simply by bellowing at the enemy leader to [...] " [...] you bloody nigger".|$|E
500|$|One such {{relationship}} was between Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who wrote to Anne Wortley in 1709: [...] "Nobody was so entirely, so faithfully yours ... I {{put in your}} lovers, for I don't allow it possible for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so sincere as I am." [...] Similarly, English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd, who {{was the subject of}} many of Seward's sonnets and poems. When Sneyd married despite Seward's protest, Seward's poems became angry. However, Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death, extolling Sneyd's beauty and their affection and friendship. As a young woman, writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood. Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed, Wollstonecraft declared, [...] "The roses will bloom when there's peace in the breast, and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart:—You know not how I love her." [...] Wollstonecraft's first novel , in part, addressed her relationship with Fanny Blood.|$|E

500|$|The {{previous}} {{husband of}} a British queen regnant, William of Orange, had become king, refusing {{to take a}} subordinate rank to Mary. William and Mary had exemplified the traditional gender roles of seventeenth-century Europe: Mary was the dutiful wife and William held the power. George and Anne, however, reversed the roles: George was the dutiful husband and it was Anne who exercised the royal prerogatives. William had assumed incorrectly that George would use his marriage to Anne {{as a means of}} building a separate power base in Britain, but George never challenged his wife's authority and never strove to accrue influence. Anne occasionally used the image of wifely virtue to escape unpalatable situations by claiming, as a woman, she knew [...] "nothing except what the prince tells me", but it was an artifice. Husbands had a legal right to their wife's property, and it was argued that it was unnatural and against the church's teachings for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subject to his wife. George made no such claim or demand; he was content to remain a prince and duke. [...] "I am her Majesty's subject", he said, [...] "I shall do naught but what she commands me." [...] In the words of historian Anne Somerset, [...] "the fact that Prince George was widely regarded as a nonentity helped reconcile people to his anomalous status, and so, almost by accident, George achieved a major advance for feminism." [...] Winston Churchill wrote that he [...] "was a fine-looking man, tall, blond, and good-natured... He was neither clever nor learned—a simple, normal man without envy or ambition, and disposed by remarkable appetite and thirst for all the pleasures of the table. Charles's well-known verdict... does not do justice to the homely virtues and unfailing good-humour of his staid and trustworthy character." ...|$|E
