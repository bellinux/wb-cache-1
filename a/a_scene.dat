40|$|Graphics systems use many {{advanced}} {{techniques that}} enable to model and visualize <b>a</b> virtual <b>scene</b> with {{varying level of}} realism. Unfortunately, rendering algorithms significantly differ in the way how they process <b>a</b> virtual <b>scene.</b> Concrete implementations therefore usually lead to monolithic solutions. In this paper we propose the concept of <b>a</b> component-based <b>scene</b> graph, i. e. <b>an</b> independent <b>scene</b> graph, {{which can be used}} by many rendering strategies simultaneously and, moreover, which can be easily replaced with another implementation...|$|R

5000|$|Space {{partitioning}} {{is particularly}} important in computer graphics, especially heavily used in ray tracing, where it is frequently used to organize the objects in <b>a</b> virtual <b>scene.</b> <b>A</b> typical <b>scene</b> may contain millions of polygons.

The most common example of such <b>a</b> nonlinear <b>scene</b> is <b>a</b> natural <b>scene</b> (e.g., <b>a</b> mountain range) which frequently does not contain any parallel lines. A perspective without vanishing points can still create a sense of depth. A zero-point perspective view is equivalent to an elevation.|$|R
