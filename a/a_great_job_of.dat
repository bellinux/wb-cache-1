30|$|Dr. Wells’ course. The {{final case}} is that of five female {{students}} taking an upper division anatomy and physiology course with Dr. Wells. In this course, which had an enrollment of 525 students across three sections, Dr. Wells had provided a rich array of learning resources {{on the course website}} that included weekly postings of videotaped lectures and PowerPoint slides, weekly practice questions, old exams, and links to other online resources. The students in the focus group noted that Dr. Wells did not simply post these resources and let students figure out how to utilize them but instead discussed in class how to use each tool and study with them. As Angelica noted, “She just does <b>a</b> really <b>great</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> giving us <b>a</b> lot of different ways to study.” Jacquie concurred, saying that while an online course she was taking was similarly well-resourced, “Dr. Wells provides more alternative methods to study which is what makes her course stand out.” Ultimately, in providing such a variety of resources for studying, Dr. Wells had crafted a learning experience that stood out for these students. For Bailey, who had little experience with the material, this was particularly important because “it’s really hard to stick your fingers in and get going,” and if you only have a textbook to work with, the entry points to the material are limited, often inaccessible and not particularly engaging.|$|R

[...] Joe Juba of Game Informer was also pleased with the system which he {{considered to be an}} improvement over the previous two XIII games, noting that the switching of Schema created [...] "a fast-paced, high-tension system that makes fights exciting." [...] Eurogamer's Simon Parkin called it [...] "perhaps the best and certainly most flexible version yet" [...] when compared to the other XIII games, while GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd stated that {{if it were not for}} a few flaws such as the blocking, [...] "it may have even found a place among Final Fantasy's better battle systems." [...] Famitsu generally cited the battle system as [...] "excellent", noting it as fast-paced and fun, but also noting that some enemies were tricky even on Easy mode.

[...] However, she did positively compare the American version of the show to the British version, stating, [...] "All things considered, I think the first season is very underrated owing to unnecessary comparisons to the British version," [...] but concluded that the episode was [...] "its weak moment." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{origins of}} the episode and the {{character}} of Patrick began when Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff {{and asked if he}} could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son is a fan of the show, so the producers came up with the character of Patrick for Downey. Show producer Seth MacFarlane believes Downey [...] "did a great job," [...] and brought a [...] "very kind of half crazy, and maybe just eccentric personality to that character that really worked out great." [...] When Patrick makes his second appearance in season 10's [...] "Killer Queen", he is not voiced by Downey. Instead, he is voiced by Family Guy writer, and recurring guest voice actor, Danny Smith. Bob Barker voiced himself presenting The Price Is Right; but the actual sequence took years to make. Barker has provided his voice for the show twice, although MacFarlane has never met him. John Veiner voiced Bobby McFerrin falling down a flight of stairs. The ball-in-a-cup scene is commented upon by MacFarlane, where he states that [...] "the voice-overs work, the drawings work" [...] and that Walter Murphy [...] "did <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> creating a piece of deliberately annoying music." [...] Several jokes had been pitched for Peter's words after killing an evil dragon, but all were dropped, as they weren't deemed funny enough by production staff.|$|E

The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind."
