50|$|The grey-cheeked mangabey (Lophocebus <b>albigena)</b> is an Old World monkey {{found in}} the forests of Central Africa. It ranges from Cameroon down to Gabon. The grey-cheeked mangabey is a dark monkey, looking in shape overall like a small, hairy baboon. Its thick brown fur is almost black in its forest home, with a {{slightly}} rufus/golden mane around the neck. The sexes are similar, with the males slightly larger than the females.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of seed dispersal via animal link vectors (endozoochoric dispersal) may explain how most Burseraceae {{were able to}} expand their range so efficiently across the globe. Beiselia, Boswellia, and Triomma have dry fruits better suited for wind dispersal, but most Burseraceae have fleshy, edible fruit that is eaten by many animal dispersers. The seeds may provide a high reward in fat (24-73%) and protein (2.7-25.9%) if digested, but many animals eat just the fleshy part of the fruit and either discard the endocarp right away or excrete it some time later. Some known Burseraceae fruit consumers include hornbills (Buceros bicornis, Ceratogyma atrata, C. cylindricus, Penelopides panini), oilbirds (Steatnoris caripensis), fruit pigeons, warblers, vireos, orioles, flycatchers, tanagers, woodpeckers, loeries, primates (Cercopithecus spp., Lophocebus <b>albigena),</b> lemurs (Varecia variegate subsp. variegate), and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus). The fruits {{may also have been}} water dispersed.|$|E
50|$|The {{crowned eagle}} {{occupies}} a unique niche, {{as it is}} the only bird in which primates are the most commonly taken prey at the species level. While at least a dozen other accipitrids opportunistically hunt small or young monkeys, only the harpy eagle and, possibly, crested eagle of the neotropics have diets where primates may locally outnumber other prey. However, New World monkeys are generally smaller and less formidable than Old World monkeys. Also, both other eagles may prefer different prey where available: harpy eagles primarily take sloths, which can be as heavy as a colobus or mangabey but are much slower and less able to defend themselves, while crested eagles take a variety of tropical birds and arboreal mammals. Other large eagles have been confirmed to hunt adult Old World monkeys, including martial eagles, Verreaux's eagles, mountain hawk-eagles and Philippine eagles, whose generic scientific name and old common was even the monkey-eating eagle, but all are believed to rely on non-primate prey for the majority of their diet. The favored group in the crowned eagles diet is certainly the Cercopithecus genus. In Kibale National Park, Uganda, the red-tailed monkey (Cercopithecus ascanius) was the most represented prey species, making up 40% of the remains. Slightly larger monkeys, such as western red colobus (Piliocolobus badius), mantled guereza (Colobus guereza) and grey-cheeked mangabey (Lophocebus <b>albigena)</b> were secondary in the prior study and, altogether, primates made up 82.2% of the remains from two nests there. A total of 88% of the remains found around crowned eagle nests in the Ituri Rainforest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were from primates: blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis), red-tailed monkey, Wolf's mona monkey (C. wolfi), western red colobus and a mixture of mangabeys and black-and-white colobus. In 16 nests in the Ivory Coast's Taï Forest, more than 60% of remains around the eyries were monkeys and more than 45% of remains were from Cercopithecus monkeys. About half of the Cercopithecus remains were from Diana monkey (C. diana; 44 items from 28 adults and 16 immatures), with the other half from Campbell's mona monkey (C. campbelli) and lesser spot-nosed monkey (C. petaurista), which were indistinguishable as remains. Other represented monkeys in the Taï Forest included the Western red colobus, the olive colobus (Procolobus verus) and the king colobus (Colobus polykomos). The diet is, by necessity, more diverse in Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve in the Matumbi Hills of Tanzania but the blue monkey was still the most represented prey species, making up 20% of the remains. In one nest in the prior study, the Blue monkey made up more than 90% of the remains. Where they overlap in range, the vervet monkey can be quite prominent as prey for crowned eagles, as their relatively small size, diurnal and terrestrial habits may make them more vulnerable.|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{fluctuations}} in resource abundance often cause primates {{to change their}} feeding behavior and ecology. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the response of a largely frugivorous monkey, the grey-cheeked mangabey (Lophocebus <b>albigena),</b> to seasonal variations in fruit abundance. We used 15 -min scan sampling to quantify feeding, activity, and habitat use by monkeys between February and December 1998 in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. L. <b>albigena</b> were found to have omnivorous feeding habits, consuming the fruits, seeds, leaves, and flowers of 132 plant species. Although monkeys fed from many plant species, only five plant species accounted for 45 % of all feeding records. The number of feeding observations on a plant species was significantly correlated with its fruit production. L. <b>albigena</b> responded to fruit-lean periods by shift-ing from a diet dominated by fruit to one dominated by seeds, flowers, and young leaves. This diet shift coincided with greater use of swamp habitat and higher dietary diversity. L. <b>albigena</b> spent the greatest per...|$|E

The arboreal Cercocebus <b>albigena</b> {{differs from the}} more terrestrial Cercocebus torquatus and Cercocebus galeritus in having more mobile joints and more grecile bones. In Cercocebus torquatus and Cercocebus galeritus, joint movements tends to be restricted to the parasagittal plane emphasizing the economy of parasagittal excursion of the limbs. Similar tendencies were observed between the arboreal Cercopithecus mitis and Cercopithecus mona and the semi-terrestrial Cercopithecus aethiops. However, the morphological distinctions, associated to arboreality vs. terrestriality, are not identical between Cercopithecus and Cercopithecus. Semi-terrestrial mangabeys exhibit stronger adaptations for terrestrialiy by comparison with the semi-terrestrial guenon. While the postcrania of the arboreal mangabey seem to be adaptive for deliberate movements in trees, those of the arboreal guenons suggest more rapid and agile activities. In addition, the arboreal Cercopithecus mona exhibits features related to leaping, which are {{not found in the}} more deliberately moving Cercopithecus mitis. Despite these differences, the common morphotype of the humerus and femur in the Cercopithecinae is exhibited in both Cercocebus and Cercopithecus, contrasting with the morphology shown by other primates (Colobinae, Hominoidea and Cebidae). The cercopithecine morphotype is characterized by the restriction of joint movements for economical fore-aft excursions of the limbs. Both the large-bodied cebids and apes exhibit a morphotype that allows greater mobility of the joints involving axial rotations and abduction. The humerus of apes is further characterized by specializations for suspensory positional behaviors. The morphotype of the limb bones of the Colobinae differs from that of the Cercopithecinae in having less restricted joint movements. However, the morphotypes of these two subfamilies show a greater similarity to each other than to those of large-bodied cebids and apes. It is presumed that positional behaviors of ancestral cercopithecids involved parasagittal excursions of the limbs...|$|E

The first half of the survey was conducted in the Regions of Niari and Lekoumou. In this area, the occurrence of Pan t. troglodytes and Cercopithecus pogonias was confirmed by direct observations. The occurrence of Gorilla g. gorilla, Mandrillus sphinx, Cercopithecus cephus and C. nictitans was confirmed by the indirect evidence. Local people informed me of the presence of Cercocebus <b>albigena,</b> C. torquatus and Miopithecus talapoin, although they were not confirmed directly.

The chimpanzee population densities, calculated from nest counts in the survey, were higher near the border of Gabon and {{in the eastern part of}} the Region of Lekoumou than other areas. This difference in population densities seemed to be due to differences in hunting pressure by humans.

Here we present results from a 9 -yr (2004 – 2012) study of female reproductive performance in relation to mother’s age and rank, presence of immigrant males, rainfall, and fig fruit abundance in four groups of gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus <b>albigena)</b> in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We found that females had a rank- and age-specific reproductive pattern, with high-ranking females maturing earlier, having their first births earlier, and exhibiting significantly slower reproductive aging than low-ranking females. We also found that both immigrant and resident males were associated with higher birth rates. Finally, we found that reproduction was aseasonal and did not correlate with rainfall, but that births correlated positively with the abundance of fruits of Ficus spp. Our results show broad similarities between arboreal, forest-dwelling gray-cheeked mangabeys and their more terrestrial, open habitat-dwelling papionin relatives {{in the importance of}} dominance rank in estrous cycle initiation, first reproduction, and reproductive aging...|$|E
40|$|Frugivorous forest {{primates}} face {{a continual}} challenge to locate ripe fruit {{due to the}} poor visibility characterizing a heavily vegetated habitat and the spatial and temporal unpredictability of their fruit sources. We present two hypotheses regarding fruit finding in gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus <b>albigena).</b> The first hypothesis is that mangabeys monitor nonfruiting fig trees by visiting and checking them for fruit {{at a higher rate}} than control trees that do not produce preferred fruit. We test this hypothesis by comparing rates of visitation to focal fig trees and control trees. The second hypothesis is that mangabeys use sym-patric frugivore loud calls to locate fruit sources. We test this hypothesis (1) observationally, by comparing the rates at which mangabeys visit calling sites of sympatric frugivores and matched control areas; and (2) experimentally, by following mangabey responses to playbacks of tape-recorded calls: the black-and-white-casqued hornbill (Bycanistes subcylindricus) long call, the great blue turaco (Corythaeola cristata) rattling kok, the adult male mangabey whoopgobble, and the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) pant hoot.

40|$|Two {{opposing}} hypotheses concerning {{determinants of}} mangabey (Cerco-cebus <b>albigena)</b> ranging patterns have been advocated. One hypothesis suggests that ranging patterns of mangabeys are largely {{a response to}} fruit availability, while the other hypothesis advocates that concerns of fruit availability are supplemented or overridden by concerns of fecal contamination and {{that the risk of}} parasite infection, especially during dry weather, determines their pattern of range use. In this 9 month study of mangabeys in the Kanyawara study area of Kibale National Park, mangabeys moved longer distances during the wet season than during the dry season. There were no seasonal differences in group spread, num-ber of 50 by 50 m quadrats used, or in quadrat overlap between sequen-tial sample periods. Intensity of quadrat use was closely related to the number of fruiting trees/lianas in the quadrats, irrespective of season. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that fruit availability is a main factor influencing mangabey ranging patterns. The results are not consistent with the hypothesis that mangabey ranging patterns largely reflect differential seasonal risk of parasite infection. Am. J. Primatol...|$|E

40|$|The {{power stroke}} of {{mastication}} has been traditionally {{divided into two}} parts, one which precedes centric occlusion, and the other which follows it- 2 ̆ 2 Phase I 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Phase II, 2 ̆ 2 respectively. Recent studies of primate mastication have called into question the role of Phase II in food processing, as they have found little muscle activity or accompanying bone strain following centric occlusion. That said, many researchers today look to Phase II facets to relate diet to patterns of dental microwear. This suggests the need to reevaluate microwear patterns on Phase I facets. Here we use texture analysis to compare and contrast microwear on facets representing both phases in three primate species with differing diets (Alouatta palliata, Cebus apella, and Lophocebus <b>albigena).</b> Results reaffirm that microwear patterns on Phase II facets better distinguish taxa with differing diets than do those on Phase I facets.

In contrast the two adult human subjects who showed preference for novelty in the between-category, did not show preference for novelty when comparing known and unknown food-items but did show such a preference when comparing different views of the same food items.

Therefore socialization processes would differ in various social environments. In this study, we considered two main socialization processes, the acquisition of a social behavioral repertoire {{and the development of}} a network of social relationships, and consequently defined six comprehensive developmental parameters. We analyzed the variability of these parameters using a new multifactorial method, the Principal Components Analysis with Instrumental Variable, PCAIV, derived from the Principal Components Analysis and Multivariate Analyses of Variance. This technique allowed us to jointly represent the influence of the independent variables and the complex relationships between the six dependent variables. The study of the social ontogeny of eight infant mangabeys (Cercocebus <b>albigena),</b> reared in three different social environments, served as an illustration of the use of the new multivariate analysis. A 3 -variable-model (age, social environment and sex) significantly explained the variability of the developmental parameters.

Home ranges remained stable for 3 of our 4 groups (overlap over 10 yr> 60 %). Core areas were more labile, but group centroids drifted an average of only 530 m over the entire decade. Deviations from site fidelity were associated with dispersal or group fission. During natal dispersal, subadult males expanded their home ranges over many months, settling ≤ 4 home ranges away. Adult males, in contrast, typically dispersed {{within a few days}} to an adjacent group in an area of home range overlap.

We observed the groups' visiting patterns and speed when they approached within a critical distance of a target tree {{as a function of the}} tree's fruiting state. For both groups, the likelihood of coming into sight or actually entering these trees was significantly higher if fruit was available. Target trees with fruit were also approached significantly faster than were trees without fruits. These behavioural differences were unlikely to be the result of auditory, visual or olfactory cues available over long distances, suggesting that monkeys relied on spatial memory to relocate fruit trees and distinguish between trees that had and had not carried fruit in the immediate past. Results further indicated that the monkeys clearly distinguished between different types of fruit-bearing target trees. We suggest that the monkeys used memory of previous feeding experience to assess each tree's differences and were able to anticipate changes in fruit quality. We found no evidence that individuals belonging to a particular age or sex class led the group towards trees with fruit more often than did others. settings...|$|E

In 2 groups, we also found rank-related grooming discrepancies but showing opposite patterns to each other. Consistent with predictions based on biological markets theory, these groups may have been under greater feeding competition, revealed more by adjustments in ranging behavior than increased agonistic rates. Although these results support current allogrooming models, they also suggest that the models may become more robust if the influence of scramble competition is incorporated. In addition, they emphasize the flexibility and dynamic nature of female competitive relationships within the same population of primates. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHumans and simian {{species are}} {{infected}} by deltaretroviruses (HTLV and STLV respectively), which are collectively called primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). In humans, {{four types of}} HTLV have been described (HTLV- 1 to - 4) with three of them having closely related simian virus analogues named STLV- 1, 2 and 3. In this study, {{our aim was to}} search for a simian HTLV- 4 -related virus and to document and characterize further the diversity of STLV infections in wild primate populations. We screened 1297 whole blood samples from 13 different primate species from southern Cameroon. Overall, 93 samples gave HTLV- 1, HTLV- 2 or dual HTLV- 1 /- 2 INNOLIA profiles, 12 were HTLV positive but untypeable and 14 were indeterminate. Subsequently, we performed generic and specific (STLV- 1 to - 3) tax-rex PCRs to discriminate the different PTLV types, completed with phylogenetic analysis of 450 -bp LTR sequences for STLV- 1 and 900  bp pX-LTR sequences for STLV- 3. We show {{for the first time that}} Lophocebus <b>albigena</b> and Cercopithecus cephus carry both STLV- 1 and a divergent STLV- 3. We also identified a new STLV- 1 lineage in one C. cephus. Finally, we identify relative divergence levels in the tax/rex phylogeny suggesting that additional types of PTLV should be defined, particularly for the highly divergent STLV- 1 (MarB 43) strain that we provisionally name STLV- 5...|$|E
40|$|Among social vertebrates, {{immigrants}} may incur {{a substantial}} fitness cost when {{they attempt to}} join a new group. Dispersers could reduce that cost, or increase their probability of mating via coalition formation, by immigrating into groups containing first- or second-degree relatives. We here examine whether dispersing males tend to move into groups containing fathers or brothers in gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus <b>albigena)</b> in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We sampled blood from 21 subadult and adult male mangabeys in 7 social groups and genotyped them at 17 microsatellite loci. Twelve genotyped males dispersed to groups containing other genotyped adult males during the study; in only 1 case did the group contain a probable male relative. Contrary to the prediction that dispersing males would follow kin, relatively few adult male dyads were likely first- or second-degree relatives; opportunities for kin-biased dispersal by mangabeys appear to be rare. During 4  yr of observation, adult brothers shared a group only once, and for only 6  wk. Mean relatedness among adult males sharing a group was lower than that among males in different groups. Randomization tests indicate that closely related males share groups no more often than expected by chance, although these tests had limited power. We suggest that the demographic conditions that allow kin-biased dispersal to evolve do not occur in mangabeys, may be unusual among primates, and are worth further attention...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDifferences among {{females in}} infant {{survival}} can contribute substantially to variance in fitness. Infant survival {{is a product}} of external risk factors and investment by kin, especially the mother, and is thus closely tied with the evolution of behavior and life history. Here we present a 9 -yr study (2004 – 2012) of infant survival and sex ratio relative to age and dominance ranks of mothers and the presence of immigrant males in a free-ranging population of gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus <b>albigena)</b> in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We consider immigrant males because they are known to increase infant mortality in several other species. We found that infants of older mothers had higher survival than those of younger mothers but that high rank did not confer a significant benefit on infant survival. Female infants had higher survival than male infants. Young, low-ranking females had more male infants than young, high-ranking females, which had slightly more daughters, but this difference declined as females aged because low-ranking females had more daughters as they aged. With limited data, we found a significantrelationship between the presence of male immigrants and infant mortality (falls and unexplained disappearances) to 18 mo. Our results suggest that infant survival in graycheeked mangabeys is most precarious when mothers must allocate energy to their own growth as well as to their infants, that sons of young mothers are at greatest risk, and that immigrant males can negatively affect infant survival...|$|E
