5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} <b>and</b> <b>heated.</b> At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the element is credited to the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth. While he was working in his experimental laboratory in Berlin in 1789, Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element <b>and</b> <b>heated</b> it with charcoal to obtain a black powder, which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself (in fact, that powder was an oxide of uranium). He named the newly discovered element after the planet Uranus (named after the primordial Greek god of the sky), which had been discovered eight years earlier by William Herschel.|$|E

The response of Arabidopsis plants to a combination of drought <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> stress was found to be distinct from that of plants subjected to drought or heat stress. Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis plants subjected to a combination of drought <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> stress revealed a new pattern of defense response in plants that includes a partial combination of two multigene defense pathways (i. e. drought <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> stress), as well as 454 transcripts that are specifically expressed in plants during a combination of drought <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> stress. Metabolic profiling of plants subjected to drought, heat stress, or a combination of drought <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> stress revealed that plants subject to a combination of drought <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> stress accumulated sucrose and other sugars such as maltose and gulose. In contrast, Pro that accumulated in plants subjected to drought did not accumulate in plants during a combination of drought <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> stress. Heat stress was found to ameliorate the toxicity of Pro to cells, suggesting that during a combination of drought <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> stress sucrose replaces Pro in plants as the major osmoprotectant.

During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions <b>and</b> <b>heated</b> arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated.

5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug <b>and</b> <b>heated</b> for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E

For 30 minutes the battle continued until, with the ships off Cape Spartel in North Africa, a wounded Le Ray decided that his ship was no longer able to contest the action and hailed Superb to announce that he had surrendered. The halyards that held up his pennant had however become tangled in the rigging, giving the appearance that the ship was still in French hands: this later led it to be attacked repeatedly by other British ships as they came up during the night. Formidable was also {{to the rear of the}} combined squadron, escaping attack by feigning British signal lights until it had safely passed the battle between Superb and Saint Antoine. Keats remained with his prize, awaiting the arrival of the rest of the squadron: Caesar, Venerable, Spencer and Thames arrived after midnight, all firing on Saint Antoine as they passed before continuing westwards in search of the remainder of Moreno's squadron. Superb was later joined by Carlotta and the small ships HMS Calpe and Louisa, which remained on hand during the night.|$|E

In this thesis, a combined analysis {{was developed to}} investigate the performance of electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> networks as an integrated whole. This {{was based on a}} model of electrical power flow and hydraulic and thermal circuits together with their coupling components (CHP units, heat pumps, electric boilers and circulation pumps). The flows of energy between the electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> networks through the coupling components were taken into account. In the combined analysis, two calculation techniques were developed. These were the decomposed and integrated electrical-hydraulic-thermal calculation techniques in the forms of the power flow and simple optimal dispatch. Using the combined analysis, the variables of the electrical <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> networks were calculated. The results of the decomposed and integrated calculations were very close. The comparison showed that the integrated calculation requires fewer iterations than the decomposed calculation. A case study of Barry Island electricity <b>and</b> district <b>heating</b> networks was conducted. The case study examined how both electrical <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> demands in a self-sufficient system (no interconnection with external systems) were met using CHP units. A solution was demonstrated to deliver the electrical <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> energy from the CHP units to the consumers through electrical <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> networks.
