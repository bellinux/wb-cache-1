5000|$|In modern use, evil twin and {{one sense}} of the word doppelgänger have come to be {{virtually}} interchangeable. While [...] "evil twin" [...] does not connote the sense of [...] "supernatural harbinger of death", {{it can be used to}} mean [...] "a physical copy of one's self who has an altered morality". If you watch enough daytime soap operas, then you already know the horrifying truth: Everyone on earth has an evil twin (or doppelgänger, if you will) roaming around and acting like a jerk. These doppelgängers are the ones who sleep with your best friend's boyfriend, steal prescription medication out of your bathroom cabinet, and spread vicious (and only partially true) rumors about your sexual proclivities. You have a doppelgänger, your dog has a doppelgänger, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>mom</b> has a doppelgänger. Everybody has a doppelgänger—except for me. As it turns out, I'm someone else's doppelgänger. Steven Humphrey, in an article from Seattle-based The Stranger ...|$|E

2500|$|When Wired {{published}} a negative review of Postal, Boll responded with an e-mail {{claiming that the}} critic didn't [...] "understand anything about movies and that you are an untalented wannabe filmmaker with no balls and no understanding what POSTAL is.
