2500|$|Kevin Lonergan at Information Age, a business-technology magazine, has {{referred}} to the terms surrounding IoT as a “terminology zoo”. The lack of clear terminology is not “useful from a practical point of view” and a “source of confusion for the end user”. A company operating in the IoT space could be working in anything related to sensor technology, networking, embedded systems, or analytics. According to Lonergan, the term IoT was coined before smart phones, tablets, and devices {{as we know them}} today existed, and there is a long list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological convergence: Internet of things, Internet of everything (IoE), industrial Internet, pervasive computing, pervasive sensing, ubiquitous computing, cyber-physical systems (CPS), wireless sensor networks (WSN), smart objects, cooperating objects, machine to machine (M2M), <b>ambient</b> <b>intelligence</b> (AmI), operational technology (OT), and information technology (IT). Regarding IIoT, an industrial sub-field of IoT, the Industrial Internet Consortium's Vocabulary Task Group has created a [...] "common and reusable vocabulary of terms" [...] to ensure [...] "consistent terminology" [...] across publications issued by the Industrial Internet Consortium. IoT One has created an IoT Terms Database including a New Term Alert to be notified when a new term is published. As of March 2017, this database aggregates 711 IoT-related terms, however, without any attempts to reduce terminological ambiguity and complexity.|$|E

40|$|Modern smart {{phones are}} {{becoming}} helpful {{in the areas}} of Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and <b>ambient</b> health <b>intelligence.</b> By learning data from several mobile sensors, we detect nearness of the human body to a mobile device in a three-dimensional space with no physical contact with the device for non-invasive health diagnostics. We show that the human body generates wave patterns that interact with other naturally occurring ambient signals that could be measured by mobile sensors, such as, temperature, humidity, magnetic field, acceleration, gravity, and light. This interaction consequentially alters the patterns of the naturally occurring signals, and thus, exhibits characteristics that could be learned to predict the nearness of the human body to a mobile device, hence provide diagnostic information for medical practitioners. Our prediction technique achieved 88. 75 % accuracy and 88. 3 % specificity.

A city {{is smart}} {{if it can}} provide ambient {{services}} for citizens and other end-users who have to tackle emergency situations, including small and wide scale accidents and incidents.

This paper aims {{to serve as a}} reference point and guide for researchers and developers interested in technologies of autonomic dependable service platforms from three viewpoints: i) architectural options, ii) ontology models for services, context and dependability, and iii) modeling methods and practices for achieving high quality service platforms and intelligent applications. Our findings are illustrated through a smart city experiment and a set of open research challenges that need to be carried out for achieving a generic solution for an autonomic dependable service platform. ...|$|R

Presented is a three layer abstraction of the hardware platform; {{consisting of a}} Sensor Layer, a Main Layer and a Power Layer. Extended operational lifetime {{is one of the}} primary design goals, necessitating the inclusion of supplemental energy sources, energy awareness, and the implementation of optimal components (microcontroller(s), RF transceiver, etc.) to achieve lowest-possible power consumption, whilst ensuring that the functional requirements of the intended application area are satisfied. A novel Smart Power Unit has been developed; including <b>intelligence,</b> <b>ambient</b> available energy harvesting (EH), storage, electrochemical fuel cell integration, and recharging capability, which acts as the Power Layer for the node. The functional node has been prototyped, demonstrated and characterised in a variety of operational modes.

40|$|Vision based human motion {{recognition}} has fascinated {{many researchers}} {{due to its}} critical challenges {{and a variety of}} applications. The applications range from simple gesture recognition to complicated behaviour understanding in surveillance system. This leads to major development in the techniques related to human motion representation and recognition. This paper discusses applications, general framework of human motion recognition, and the details of each of its components. The paper emphasizes on human motion representation and the recognition methods along with their advantages and disadvantages. This study also discusses the selected literature, popular datasets, and concludes with the challenges in the domain along with a future direction. The human motion recognition domain has been active for more than two decades, and has provided a large amount of literature. A bird's eye view for new researchers in the domain is presented in the paper.

40|$|WiFi-based {{localization}} {{became one}} of the main indoor localization techniques due to the ubiquity of WiFi connectivity. However, indoor environments exhibit complex wireless propagation characteristics. Typically, these characteristics are captured by constructing a fingerprint map for the different locations in the area of interest. This fingerprint requires significant overhead in manual construction, and thus {{has been one of the}} major drawbacks of WiFi-based localization. In this paper, we present an automated tool for fingerprint constructions and leverage it to study novel scenarios for device-based and device-free WiFi-based localization that are difficult to evaluate in a real environment. In a particular, we examine the effect of changing the access points (AP) mounting location, AP technology upgrade, crowd effect on calibration and operation, among others; on the accuracy of the localization system. We present the analysis for the two classes of WiFi-based localization: device-based and device-free. Our analysis highlights factors affecting the localization system accuracy, how to tune it for better localization, and provides insights for both researchers and practitioners.
