5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is {{a canopy}} or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest community of north Queensland. Its terminal tubular flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally <b>as</b> <b>vulnerable</b> under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum {{is listed}} nationally <b>as</b> <b>vulnerable</b> under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), which {{indicates}} {{that there is a}} high risk it will become extinct in the wild in the mid-term future. Before the establishment of the EPBC Act, it was, and currently remains, listed <b>as</b> <b>vulnerable</b> under the state-based Nature Conservation Act 1992. Furthermore, it was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1997. Most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and development. Remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented. Furthermore, plants in cultivation are likely to come from a limited genetic pool. With under 2% of its original extent remaining, the rainforest is threatened by invasive plants and grazing by feral and domestic animals.|$|E

5|$|Because of its low {{reproductive}} rate and historically documented declines {{in areas such}} as the Caribbean, the night shark has been assessed <b>as</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the American Fisheries Society (AFS).

5|$|Both {{species are}} listed <b>as</b> <b>vulnerable</b> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, {{entanglement}} in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers {{for use in}} Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed P.parienti, P.electromontis, and P.pallescens as endangered, and P.furcifer <b>as</b> <b>vulnerable.</b> Before this assessment, it {{was assumed}} that their {{population}} was in decline due to habitat destruction for the creation of pasture and agriculture. Measures of their population density vary widely, from 50 to 550 individuals per square kilometer (250acres), but these numbers are thought to reflect only small, gum-rich areas, and therefore only small, clustered populations with an overall low population density.|$|E

5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab endemic to the Seychelles, and the only true freshwater crab in that country.

If its habitat were to decline in quality, S.alluaudi might become endangered, but it is currently listed <b>as</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the night shark globally <b>as</b> <b>Vulnerable,</b> citing its slow reproductive rate and historical declines under fishing pressure. It {{has also been}} listed <b>as</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> by the American Fisheries Society (AFS). This species was once {{a significant part of}} the Cuban artisanal shark fishery, comprising 6075% of the catch from 1937 to 1941, before its numbers dropped substantially in the 1970s. Similarly, the proportion of night sharks in the shark catch of the southeastern U.S. pelagic longline fishery fell from 26.1% from 1981 to 1983 to 0.33.3% in 1993 and 1994; a comparable decline was observed in catches by south Florida marlin tournaments since the 1970s. Currently, the intense Brazilian targeted fishery is of particular concern, although fishing pressure on the night shark may be relaxing as the fishery is beginning to shift towards swordfish and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). No fishery information on the night shark is available for the eastern Atlantic, leading to an IUCN assessment of Data Deficient for that region.|$|E
