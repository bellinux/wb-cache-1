40|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the UK capital markets were marked by an absence of {{investor}} protection; by the end of the century, there was more extensive protection there than virtually anywhere else in the world. The UK therefore provides an exceptional laboratory for evaluating how regulation affects the development of securities markets and corporations. We investigate this question by tracing the ownership and board composition of firms incorporated around 1900 over the subsequent 100 years and comparing the pattern of ownership and control with a sample incorporated around 1960. We find that at the beginning of the century there were <b>active</b> <b>securities</b> markets, firms were able to raise substantial outside equity finance, and there was rapid dispersion of ownership even in the absence of investor protection. The introduction of investor protection in the second half of the century was not associated with greater dispersion of ownership but with more trading in share blocks.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} country specific determinants on multiple banking using a unique survey sample of 4959 SMEs from 19 European countries. Our data shows that (1) SMEs in countries with inefficient loan enforcement mechanisms {{are more likely to}} maintain multiple bank relationships, (2) the association between multiple banking and bank fragility is non-monotonous, being negative when the banking system is relatively stable and positive for high values of bank fragility, and (3) multiple banking is more likely for SMEs in countries with larger banking systems as well as smaller and less <b>active</b> <b>securities</b> markets. Overall, this evidence suggests that SMEs need multiple banking as a diversification mechanism to overcome expensive adverse selection that may arise within a country that suffers from an inefficient legal system and fragile banks, but also that movement towards a more market based financial system decreases the likelihood of multiple bank relationships for SMEs. These findings have important implications for policy makers in Europe when contemplating SME access to finance. SMEs; Relationship Lending; Banks...|$|E

The majority of these studies are based implicitly or explicitly on two assumptions: (A) there are no systematic cross-sectional or time-series differences in the probability of a trade occurring at the bid or at the ask, and (B) there are no systematic time-series movements in proportional bid-ask spreads.;In this thesis, I test the validity of these two Assumptions by testing four subsets of Assumption A, using LOGIT regressions and a single subset of Assumption B, using a SUR regression. The Canadian data include time and date stamped intraday bid-ask quotes, transaction prices, and volumes on every security listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) over the period January 1979 to December 1987.

Unconditional basic income is the cry of the day, curiously advocated in particular by, for example, employers in high-tech industries and modern financial or distributive services. In the name of freedom, liberty and flexibility they suggest a form of security without any institutional complexity. The hidden agenda in the remaining empty institutional black box, however, is the dream of freedom from any bureaucracy and painstaking negotiations between competing interests or even getting rid of any responsibility to the new risks related to the digital revolution.

40|$|International {{consultants}} on bank regulation, {{and supervision}} for developing countries, often base their {{advice on how}} their home country does things, for lack of information on practice in other countries. Recommendations for reform {{have tended to be}} shaped by bias rather than facts. To better inform advice about bank regulation, and supervision, and to lower the marginal cost of empirical research, the authors present, and discuss a new, and comprehensive database on the regulation, and supervisionof banks in a hundred and seven countries. The data, based on surveys sent to national bank regulatory, supervisory authorities, are now available to researchers, and policymakers around the world. The data cover such aspects of banking as entry requirements, ownership restrictions, capital requirements, activity restrictions, external auditing requirements, characteristics of deposit insurance schemes, loan classification and provisioning requirements, accounting and disclosure requirements, troubled bank resolution actions, and (uniquely) the quality of supervisory personnel, and their actions. The database permits users to learn how banks are currently regulated, and supervised, and about bank structures, and deposit insurance schemes, for a broad cross-section of countries. In addition to describing the data, the authors show how variables ay be grouped, and aggregated. They also show some simple correlations among selected variables. In a comparison paper ("Bank regulation and supervision: What works best") studying the relationship between differences in bank regulation and supervision, and bank performance and stability, they conclude that: 1) Countries with policies that promote private monitoring of banks, have better bank performance, and more stability. Countries with more generous deposit insurance schemes tend to have poorer bank performance, and more bank fragility. 2) Diversification of income streams, and loan portfolios - by not restricting bank activities - also tends to improve performance, and stability.

Attackers continue to expose new vulnerabilities and exploit them as quickly as new technologies, applications, and security strategies are developed. Today 2 ̆ 7 s security systems work in relative isolation with limited programmatic control and remediation is working at human reaction speed. <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> gives a fundamental architectural advantage to the network defender. <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> seeks to leverage all resources present throughout the infrastructure through a unified programming interface to protect existing infrastructure, interface {{with a variety of}} sensors, adjust the configuration at run-time, collect forensic data on-demand, and counter an attack. This makes a programmable network infrastructure and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) control key enablers of an <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> architecture. Today, digital forensics is commonly performed in response to an incident or anomaly after an attacker has succeeded and possibly cleaned up the crime scene. We argue that this deep well of useful information should be leveraged in our architecture immediately when an attack or anomaly is detected. In particular, we investigate host physical memory which is often lost or tampered prior to an investigation. SDN bears the banner of programmatic control and thrives in an infrastructure capable of granular programming. This requirement acts as a barrier to entry by enterprise organizations who neither have the funding nor the technical ability to upgrade their network to SDN control overnight. A new transition alternative is needed that allows SDN control today using the existing legacy equipment.

The control unit of all <b>security</b> modules (<b>active</b> <b>security</b> modules and passive security modules) is HOLTEK microchip. The paper focuses on the <b>active</b> <b>security</b> modules (mobile robots). Mobile robots are classified more and more teams according to the detection functions.

Each mobile robot has two variety interfaces, uses voice module to alarm users for event condition, and transmits the real-time event signals to the supervised computer and the other mobile robots via wireless RF interface. If the event occurs, the mobile robot can transmit the relation location (floor number) of the event to the supervised computer. The supervised computer decides {{the location of the}} event according the feedback signals from mobile robots, controls the other mobile robots moving to the event location, and recognizes the final decision output using Dempster-Shafter Evidence Theory. The belief value is over the threshold value and displays detection and decision output values on the monitor of the user interface.

30|$|Building {{a secure}} system atop the current {{computer}} architecture is fundamentally difficult. The fast-growing complexity in software inevitably leads to exploitable security vulnerabilities. IP (Intellectual Property) reuse and the separated ASIC manufacture procedure with multiple vendors {{make it impossible}} to thoroughly inspect the whole design and the manufacture procedures. Some architecture-level vulnerabilities are difficult to remove due to the conflicting interests between performance and security. In the meanwhile, attacks are constantly evolving with new means to outwit existing defenses. To meet this challenge, this paper proposes security-priority architecture, a concept which separates the security tasks from the normal tasks by physical isolation. In systems built based on this concept, traditional processors (i.e., Computation Processors) are monitored and protected by <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> Processors. The two types of processors execute on their own physically-isolated resources, including memory, disks, network and I/O devices. The physically isolated <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> Processors are a key component for security-first architecture, which are provided with dedicated tightly-coupled channels to access all the resources of the Computation Processors but not vice versa. This allows the <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> Processors to actively detect and tackle malicious activities in the Computation Processors with minimum performance degradation while protecting themselves from the attacks launched from the Computation Processors thanks to the resource isolation. This paper introduces three implementations of Security-first Architecture, and makes comparasions with other classic security mechanisms. Security-first Architecture can remedy the deficiencies of existing security mechanisms and provide a new direction worth exploring.|$|R
40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>security</b> {{is mainly}} {{concerned}} with performing {{one or more}} security functions when a host in a communication network is subject to an attack. Such security functions include appropriate actions against attackers. To properly afford <b>active</b> <b>security</b> actions a set of software subsystems should be integrated together {{so that they can}} automatically detect and appropriately address any vulnerability in the underlying network. This work presents integrated model for <b>active</b> <b>security</b> response model. The proposed model introduces Active Response Mechanism (ARM) for tracing anonymous attacks in the network back to their source. This work is motivated by the increased frequency and sophistication of denial-of-service attacks and by the difficulty in tracing packets with incorrect, or "spoofed", source addresses. This paper presents within the proposed model two tracing approaches based on: 1. Sleepy Watermark Tracing (SWT) for unauthorized access attacks. 2. Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM) in the network for Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. On the basis of the proposed model a cooperative network security tools such as firewall, intrusion detection system with IP tracing mechanism has been designed for taking a rapid active response against real IPs for attackers. The proposed model is able to detect network vulnerabilities, trace attack source IP and reconfigure the attacked subnetworks.
