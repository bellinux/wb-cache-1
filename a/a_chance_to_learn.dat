25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

Free creative play is an invaluable gift that children need to start properly relating to the outside world. Exploring, experiencing and imitating the world of grown-us through free play, children are given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> unconsciously <b>learn</b> and emotionally mature through their own games. Too much of today’s learning is structured, children are ‘directed’, ‘instructed’ and carefully ‘followed’ at all times, so {{they do not have}} <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> experience <b>learning</b> through unobstructed observation. Children have deep devotion to life and this devotion is beautifully expressed through the free play.”.

500|$|The {{following}} years saw Morrissey cast in two high-profile feature films; while filming the Brian Jones biopic Stoned (2005), {{he got an}} audition for psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass, the male lead in Basic Instinct 2 (2006). He was flown out to Los Angeles for a one-hour screen test with Sharon Stone. Their immediate rapport led to the screen test being extended by another hour and Morrissey's casting in the role. Morrissey had enjoyed the first film and liked the script for the sequel. He read up on psychiatry and worked out in a gym for the nudity scenes. The film was a box office and critical failure. The Washington Post criticised the film's focus on Morrissey's character and called the actor [...] "overmatched by Stone" [...] and [...] "a sad sack", and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called him [...] "a charisma-challenged non-entity". The same Washington Post critic later wrote in the Los Angeles Times that because Morrissey was not a film star, the chemistry between him and Stone had been spoiled. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that Morrissey had [...] "the charisma of beige wallpaper" [...] and that [...] "the producers could have replaced him halfway through shooting with a handsome mahogany coat rack and nobody {{would be able to}} tell the difference". The bad reviews depressed Morrissey, and he briefly considered giving up acting, but instead saw the role as <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Writing for The Buffalo News, Alan Pergament rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "moody" [...] but [...] "muddled and confusing". Pergament noted that [...] "the suspense of the premiere actually {{is enhanced by}} all the summer speculation about the future role of Gallagher", and felt that Morgan and Wong were [...] "trying to bring [...] "Millennium" [...] into [...] "X-File" [...] territory". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a A−, finding that it allows the series to [...] " [...] a corner, from a serial killer show with stained-glass window overtones, to a show that revels in those overtones, a show that plays in age-old symbols with a decided taste of the weird". VanDerWerff also felt that a monologue delivered by O'Quinn {{was an example of}} Morgan and Wong's best writing, and that the actor's delivery was the key to keeping the scene serious in tone. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that it [...] "starts Season 2 off in high style". Gibron found that the episode [...] "has a nice sense of internal adventure to it, giving us <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more about our main players while setting the groundwork for some certified surreality to come". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "The Beginning and the End" [...] two-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt that the episode had [...] "an overwritten quality", citing the Polaroid Man's dialogue as the main example of this; he also believed that the development of Catherine Black as a character seemed poorly executed, with the character lacking enough depth to [...] "retain the audience's sympathies".|$|E

2500|$|However, {{in a study}} called The Black Worker, Spero and Harris {{observe that}} more strikes [...] have been broken by white workers than by black workers. Most blacks were barred from {{membership}} in the AFL not because of their skin color, but because they never had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a skill, and [...] "most A.F. of L. unions did not admit unskilled mass-production workers." [...] While the AFL-CIO is the modern version of the AFL, {{it is much more}} open to membership by women, immigrants, and different nationalities.

2500|$|Elk Knob State Park is {{surrounded}} by several historic mountain communities. Meat Camp, Pottertown and Sutherland were once, according to Dr. Patricia Beaver of Appalachian State University, [...] "bustling, dynamic communities". Meat Camp was the location of Winebarger Grist Mill, which operated from the 1850s until 2005. Sutherland had a thriving cattle industry. Each community {{had at least one}} general store, post office, school and church. Faculty and students from Appalachian State have begun a process of preserving the history of the communities by hosting periodic community days, at Elk Knob State Park, where residents of the shrinking communities gather to pass down their history and share photos of earlier days. These gatherings have also given the students and young people of the region <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about sustainable agriculture practices that were commonplace throughout the history of Elk Knob.|$|E
2500|$|Punishment (in {{the form}} of prison time) may serve a variety of purposes. [...] First, and most obviously, the incarceration of criminals removes them from the general {{population}} and inhibits their ability to perpetrate further crimes. A new goal of prison punishments is to offer criminals a chance to be rehabilitated. [...] Many modern prisons offer schooling or job training to prisoners as <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a vocation and thereby earn a legitimate living when they are returned to society. [...] Religious institutions also have a presence in many prisons, with the goal of teaching ethics and instilling a sense of morality in the prisoners. If a prisoner is released before his time is served, he is released as a parole. This means that they are released, but the restrictions are greater than that of someone on probation.|$|E
