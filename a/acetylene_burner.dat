40|$|A low {{pressure}} reactor (Knudsen cell) coupled to molecular beam modulated mass spectrometry {{was used to}} study the heterogeneous kinetics of the following three systems: (1) NO 2 on amorphous carbon, (2) H 2 O vapor on ice and (3) gaseous HCl on ice. The first system was investigated at ambient temperature while the two last ones were investigated at temperatures typical of the stratosphere, that is roughly between 160 and 220 K. The solid phase samples correspond to model surfaces whose physicochemical properties come {{very close to the}} ones of atmospheric particulates. Firstly, we studied the interaction of gaseous NO 2 with three different commercial samples of amorphous carbon having widely differing physicochemical properties. Using in situ laser-induced fluorescence, the only major product was unambiguously determined to be NO with the oxidation product of carbon apparently remaining on the surface. Probing the gas phase with mass spectrometry (MS), both pulsed valve dosing and steady state experiments were performed and revealed a complex reaction mechanism for both the uptake as well as product formation. The initial uptake coefficient γo for NO 2 was (6. 4 ± 2. 0) · 10 - 2 and proved to be identical within experimental uncertainty for all three types of amorphous carbon. The initial NO 2 uptake rate was independent of the mass of the carbon sample and scaled with its external geometrical surface. Applying a simple chemical kinetic model to both pulsed dosing and steady state experiments resulted in an effective surface for uptake on amorphous carbon ranging between a factor of 2. 8 to 8. 4 larger than the geometrical surface area, but inversely proportional to the measured BET surface area of the three types of amorphous carbon. This means that the amorphous carbon with the highest BET surface (FW 2) had the lowest external surface for NO 2 adsorption. The chemical kinetic model included competing processes between Langmuir-type adsorption and inhibition controlling the adsorption kinetics of NO 2 and revealed that the NO generation rate differed greatly between the three carbon samples examined. All samples showed saturation effects of differing degree that were partially reversible through prolonged pumping at 10 - 4 Torr and/or heating. Virgin amorphous carbon samples did not take up H 2 O vapor at 20 mTorr, and no HONO and/or HNO 3 was detected in simultaneous NO 2 /H 2 O exposure experiments. CO and CO 2 were detected when a sample previously exposed to NO 2 was heated by an incandescent lamp. Moreover, upon heating such a sample, a MS signal m/e 62 originating from NO 3 and/or N 2 O 5 was detected. In addition to the experiments conducted on the three commercial carbon samples, we carried out uptake experiments of NO 2 on acetylene soot. Originating from the flame of an <b>acetylene</b> <b>burner,</b> this soot was freshly deposited on glass dishes before each experiment. The initial uptake coefficient γo for NO 2 was measured to be (3. 0 ± 1. 1) · 10 - 2 is smaller by a factor of two compared to γo observed in the uptake on commercial samples whose mass was a factor of 10 higher. In addition to NO, a net formation of HONO (m/e 47) was observed. This HONO formation is strongly dependent on the instantaneous water desorption from the sample {{as well as on the}} NO 2 partial pressure in the reactor. On the other hand, it is not enhanced by an external water flow which did not show any interaction with the carbon sample. Upon heating the sample using an incandescent lamp, significant amounts of water desorbed, suggesting that the water vapor had condensed into the micropores of the soot during combustion. No quantitative results are presented yet. However, as no correlation between HONO formation and NO partial pressure has been observed so far, we suggest a reaction mechanism that only involves NO 2 and H 2 O but no NO: 2 NO 2 (g) + H 2 O HONO + HNO 3 In a second study, the kinetics of condensation and evaporation of water on ice was determined in the temperature range of 170 to 220 K. The rate of evaporation Fev corresponds to the evaporation of 70 ± 10 monolayers of H 2 O per second at 200 K. The condensation rate constant kc has a negative activation energy of - 3. l± 1. 5 kcal/mol which is significantly larger than the one recently measured by Haynes et al. We report the first real time kinetic measurements of water condensation on ice at stratospherically relevant temperatures. At temperatures above 160 K, pulsed dosing experiments show a dose dependence of the condensation rate coefficient. For example, the condensation rate coefficient increases by a factor of five with a 1000 fold increase of the H 2 O dose from 1 · 1015 to 1 · 1018 molecules per pulse at 180 K. This pressure dependence of the condensation rate constant may be explained by an autocatalytic mechanism involving the competition of two condensation channels. These two channels feed two different surface species, one of which leads to autocatalytic condensation. This mechanism gives insight into the manner in which a gas phase molecule is stepwise incorporated into tetrahedrally coordinated bulk ice. In a third and ongoing study, the uptake kinetics of HCl on ice has been investigated by pulsed valve experiments in the temperature range of 180 to 210 K and are discussed as a function of the state of the surface. In fact, some of the pulsed valve experiments present a relaxation to a steady state level. It is shown that this level originates from the evaporation of a liquid solution corresponding to a temperature specific HCl concentration. The threshold of the injected dose leading to this solution layer is estimated to be 8 · 1014 molecules. This threshold corresponding to a fraction of a monolayer may be explained by the formation of small domains along grain boundaries or other lattice imperfections. Within detection limit, no difference in keff has been observed for pulses on the solution or on a previously exposed sample without formation of the solution. In the case of pulses forming a solution layer, a fraction of 20 ± 20 % of the injected molecules remains permanently adsorbed on the surface. In the temperature range from 210 to 180 K, the pulsed valve experiments yield values of keff roughly between 5 and 25 s- 1 and an activation energy of - 1. 6 ± 0. 7 kcal/mol which are consistent with the values observed by Flueckiger in steady state experiments using the 15 mm escape aperture (kuni varying from 12 to 23 s- 1 and an activation energy of - 1. 9 ± 0. 25 kcal/mol) ...|$|E
50|$|Soon, {{acetylene}} {{gas lighting}} was introduced during the procession. Double sided plywood placards with biblical quoatations formed by perforated letters covered with coloured tissue paper were added in later years. These shield-shaped placards, designed by Ġużè Schembri, {{general secretary of}} the society, are still known as skudi (shields). Mantel lamps and now camp gas replaced the <b>acetylene</b> <b>burners.</b> Today electricity, through the use of batteries and public address systems, makes the event more enjoyable and meaningful.|$|R
25|$|In January 1918 the {{lighthouse}} {{was the only}} structure {{on the island and}} the only aid to navigation to survive the 1918 Mackay cyclone. The lighthouse was automated around 1920. In 1991, the light source was still an open flame <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>burner.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1912, Beachey, Parmelee, and {{aviation}} pioneer Glenn Martin {{performed the}} first night flights in California with <b>acetylene</b> <b>burners,</b> fuses, and small noise making bombs dropped over Los Angeles. In 1913, Beachey took off inside the Machinery Palace on the Exposition grounds at the San Francisco World's Fair. He flew the plane at 60 mph and landed it, all inside {{the confines of the}} hall. His stunt speciality was the [...] "dip-of-death", where he would take his plane up to 5000 ft, and dive toward the ground at full speed with his hands outstretched. At the very last moment he would level the plane and zoom down the raceway, with his hands off of the controls, gripping the control stick with his knees. In a jest aimed at Blanche Stuart Scott, another member of the Curtiss exhibition team, Beachey dressed up as a woman and pretended to be out of control in a mock terror to hundreds of thousands.|$|R
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was originally}} manned, {{and a small}} cottage accommodated the keeper and his family. The last keeper was John Albert Edward Lawson. In March 1920 John Lawson was lost at sea when a small fishing boat capsized. This led to the decision to automate {{the operation of the}} lighthouse, and it was demanned in 1920. The light was converted to an automatic <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>burner</b> (carbide lamp).|$|R
50|$|On Sand Island, most of {{the younger}} {{generation}} moved away when they became adults, not just because farmingwas difficult, but because the entire way of life was difficult. The school on Sand Island closed in 1928.In 1921 an automatic <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>burner</b> was installed at the Sand Island light, making it the first automatedlighthouse in the Apostle Islands. A few years later the Sand Island lighthouse was leased to summer resident GertWellisch.|$|R
50|$|In 1900 a new cottage was {{constructed}} {{for the light}} keeper. In 1912 a report recommended that the lighthouse be automated, leaving the keeper only the signal duties. However, this recommendation {{was not to be}} taken for some time. In 1913 a wireless station was installed nearby and in 1915 the light, alone with all other coastal lights, was transferred to the control of the Commonwealth government. It was only in 1927 the lighthouse was finally automated, the light source was changed to an <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>burner,</b> and the station was demanned. The keeper's house and signal staff were destroyed about that time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is situated}} on a hillock. There are 70 masonry steps {{to reach the}} tower. The Lighthouse is an unattended station. A rain water tank and a rest room have been provided for the maintenance staff.A third order revolving optic, on a mercury trough with DA (dissolved <b>acetylene)</b> gas <b>burner</b> and gas motor to revolve the optic, all supplied by M/s BBT, Paris were installed inside the lantern house over the CI tower [...] The light was commissioned on 14 April 1969. Due to frequent failures of the rotation system, the revolving optic assembly was removed and a 500 mm cut-and-polished drum optic was placed in position in 1978. The DA gas burner {{was replaced by a}} DA gas flasher with sun valve. This reduced the consumption of DA gas but the intensity of the light went down.|$|R
