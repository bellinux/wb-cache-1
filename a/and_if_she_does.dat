25|$|Several {{months after}} her presumed death, Ryan {{receives}} a champagne flute from Greenlee. Realizing {{that no one ever}} actually identified the body, he comes to believe that Greenlee is still alive. In November 2009, Ryan discovers Greenlee's medical records on David's computer, who claims he was using them for research into Amanda Dillon's pregnancy. It is later revealed that David has been keeping Greenlee in Massachusetts while she recovers. Greenlee has been comatose for the past year and has no memory of the accident. Upon her awakening, David tells Greenlee that she is paralyzed <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have surgery to fix her spine, she will remain paralyzed {{for the rest of her}} life. She tells David that she wants to do the surgery, but if she dies during surgery, not to tell anybody that she was alive before her death. After successfully recovering from her injuries, Greenlee attempts to visit Ryan but is surprised to see him having sex with Erica Kane. Out for revenge, Greenlee asks David to bring her a hard-drive hidden in Ryan's house. She puts the hard-drive into Fusion's computer and it crashes all the files. Even with Fusion's files being lost, Erica is set out to build Fusion back up once again; during an interview, she tells reporters that whoever crashed Fusion's computers has not destroyed the company. Greenlee feels that she has not done enough and decides to stay in Pine Valley. Greenlee asks David to marry her, hoping that when she walks down the aisle at her wedding, everyone will be surprised, and that Ryan will be hurt.|$|E
2500|$|In many hospitals, {{women who}} are being {{discharged}} after giving birth are given discharge packs branded by a formula company that include [...] formula samples. Many breastfeeding experts argue that these commercial discharge packs decrease {{the likelihood that a}} woman will breastfeed <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> breastfeed, the length of time she will do so. Studies have found that marketing of infant formula in hospitals makes it likelier that a woman will breastfeed for a shorter amount of time due to the perceived convenience of bottle-feeding. Formula companies often offer these discharge packs, as well as a general supply of formula, to hospitals at no cost, which can place some facilities at an economic disadvantage if they choose to give up these benefits. However, not accepting free formula is one of the criteria that determine whether a facility can be certified as Baby-Friendly; thus, the economic burden of giving up access to formula for free can be a significant barrier for disadvantaged facilities that wish to achieve Baby-Friendly status.|$|E

60|$|MRS. G. I don't care. <b>She</b> shouldn't write, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> {{you ought}} to have shown me her letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss St. Just {{does not}} intrude into {{the secrets of}} her sister's married life; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> would not repeat them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Major, Asika {{never leave}} Bonsa Town, that against law, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> so, priests make another Asika and kill {{her when they}} catch her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My aunt {{thinks it}} an honour to my uncle's memory, {{to be able}} to use the {{language}} of his professional life, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> sometimes make mistakes that are absurd, it is with motives so respectable that no sailor should deride them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will do this. I {{will wait}} {{for a day or}} two longer--not longer than two days certainly; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not send to me in that time I will indeed send to her. I thought to have seen Wildeve here tonight. Is he from home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't value her a fig's hend," [...] said Eglantine. [...] "I'll {{treat her}} like {{the dust of}} the hearth. After that woman's conduct to me, I should {{like to see her}} have the haudacity to come here; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> you'll see how I'll serve her." ...|$|E
60|$|Amy said nothing; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not allow}} herself to avow that his absence was a relief, {{it was because}} she saw it was a grief and {{disappointment}} to Guy.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked her}} of the end and the object of that spirit. She {{answered}} darkly that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> would not say, but that these were very dreadful.|$|R
2500|$|Messalina tossing in the {{turbulence}} of her thoughts did not sleep at night; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> sleep, Morpheus slept at her side, prompting stirrings in her, robing and disrobing a thousand images that her sexual fantasies {{during the day}} had suggested ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{the book}} in which I read this,' said the Emperor, 'is sent me by His Great Majesty the Emperor of Japan; so it cannot be untrue, and I will hear the Nightingale! She must be here this evening! She has my gracious {{permission}} to appear, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not, the whole Court shall be trampled under foot after supper!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is fond {{of having}} other {{children}} noticed and caressed by the teachers, and those whom she respects; but this must not be carried too far, or she becomes jealous. She wants to have her share, which, if not the lion's, is the greater part; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not get it, she says, [...] "MY MOTHER WILL LOVE ME." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{will stay}} till {{you can go}} to Monkhams,--if Emily is not back before then. She knows all about Emily's affairs; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> come back,--which I doubt, poor thing,--Lady Milborough and {{you will be able to}} judge whether you should go to her." [...] So it was settled, and Nora's Bohemian Castle in the Air fell into shatters.|$|E
6000|$|... "A man {{threw up}} her window and climbed in. He demanded the packet. He searched the room. When {{he left her}} he {{declared}} that he should return at twelve to-night, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not hand it to him then he threatened her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know; not much." [...] John, however, remembered well, at this moment, {{all that}} the {{gardener}} had said to him. Did she know of that encounter between him <b>and</b> Crosbie? <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> know of it, in what light <b>did</b> <b>she</b> regard it? ...|$|R
6000|$|But to-night, {{while walking}} weary, [...] Near me seemed her shade, [...] Come as 'twere to upbraid This my mood in deeming dreary [...] Scenes {{that used to}} please; <b>And,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> come to me, Still solicitous, there may be [...] Good in going to these.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you begin}} to know her now, and value her as you ought. I think few would have done as she has, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> get ill and die, it will be our fault partly, because she'd go through fire and water to make us do her justice and receive her as we ought," [...] cried Rose, proud of an example which she longed to follow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tell you," [...] said Diana, [...] "we'll get Mother to ask Marilla. She'll be {{more likely}} to let you go then; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> we'll have the time of our lives, Anne. I've never been to an Exhibition, and it's so {{aggravating}} to hear the other girls talking about their trips. Jane and Ruby have been twice, and they're going this year again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! Going to see {{the lovely}} Beatrice, I suppose. You had better be careful, Geoffrey. That girl will get you into a mess, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{there are plenty of}} people who are ready to make an example of you. You have enemies enough, I can tell you. I am not jealous, it is not in my line, but you are too {{intimate}} with that girl, and you will be sorry for it one day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be a fool, Baroski!" [...] {{said the}} lady--(I can't help it if her {{language}} was not more choice, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not rise with cold dignity, exclaiming, [...] "Unhand me, sir!")--"Don't be a fool!" [...] said Mrs. Walker, [...] "but {{get up and}} let's finish the lesson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] Maria answered. [...] "You see, {{she had not}} {{fallen in}} love with you before she met him. But I do not know. Giulia seldom speaks of him when we are alone, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> you don't suppose I should tell you my sister's secrets, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{when you}} start, {{come to me}} for a ship, and the best I have is at your service; <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> not suit, command her to be fitted as you like best; and I, William Salterne, will pay for all which you shall command to be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{think she}} is. But--" [...] She paused, and waited a space before she continued. [...] "I 'm afraid I can't {{be of use}} to her any longer. She has lost {{confidence}} in me--It's important she should trust her physician." [...] Libby blushed, {{as he always did}} when required to recognize Grace in her professional quality. [...] "It's more a matter of nerves than anything else, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> n't believe in me I can't do her any good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must find}} me some task for this fine Princess which she cannot {{possibly}} do, for I mean to punish her, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not do what}} I order, {{she will not be}} able to say that I am unjust.' So the old Fairy said she would think it over, and come again the next day. When she returned she brought with her a skein of thread, three times as big as herself; it was so fine that a breath of air would break it, and so tangled that it was impossible to see the beginning or the end of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you're in earnest," [...] Hunterleys advised, [...] "you go to Washington and {{ask them}} about it some day. The time's coming, if it hasn't already arrived, when your country will have to develop a {{different}} class of politicians. You see, whether she wants it or not, she is coming into touch, through Asia and South America, with European interests, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> she'll have to adopt their methods more or less. Poor old Roche! There was something more he wanted to say, and if it's what I've been expecting, your country was in it." ...|$|E
60|$|His wife, a fair Ionian lady {{but half}} {{reclaimed}} from idolatry, though baptized and accredited {{as a member}} of the Christian church, still lingered lovingly on the confines of old heathenism, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not believe, still cherished with pleasure the poetic legends of Apollo and Venus, of Jove and Diana.|$|R
6000|$|Veronique only {{began to}} wail aloud at her mistress' obstinacy. Martin came up, and rudely silenced her, and said {{afterwards}} to his wife, 'Have a care! That girl has--I verily believe--betrayed her Lady once; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> {{not do so}} again, from pure pity and faintness of heart, I shall be much surprised.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Hush, {{you stupid}} child!” says miss, smothering her brother with kisses; {{and then she}} must come and kiss her mamma, looking all the while at Harry, over his mistress’s shoulder. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not kiss him, she gave him both her hands, and then took one of his in both hands, and said, “Oh, Harry, we’re so, so glad you’re come!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her face," [...] quoth the prince, [...] "was that of {{the full}} moon, her hair like a swarm of bees hanging from the {{blossoms}} of the acacia, {{the corners of her}} eyes touched her ears, her lips were sweet with lunar ambrosia, her waist was that of a lion, and her walk the walk of a king goose. [FN#53] As a garment, she was white; as a season, the spring; as a flower, the jasmine; as a speaker, the kokila bird; as a perfume, musk; as a beauty, Kamadeva; and as a being, Love. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not come into my possession I will not live; this I have certainly determined upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] said he, [...] "she {{can come}} to the table to-night and to-morrow morning, for, I suppose, if I object, she will go off and leave you again without anybody, but to-morrow she must be told that she cannot eat with us; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not like that, she must leave, and I will go to the city and get you a proper servant. The hay is in now, and there is no more {{important}} work to which I could give a day. Now do not be angry, little one, because I object to your domestic arrangements. We all have to make mistakes, you know, when we begin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it {{does not}} matter," [...] he said to himself, [...] "which way it happens. If she doesn't come I want him here, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> come, he {{is good enough for}} anybody, and perhaps she may be pleased." [...] And then he indulged in a little {{fragment}} of the dream which had come to him before; he saw two young people in a charming home, not at the toll-gate, and himself living with them. Plenty of money for all moderate needs, and all happy and satisfied. Then with a sigh he knocked the tobacco from his pipe and said to himself: [...] "If I hear she is coming, I will let her know he is still here, and then she must judge for herself." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Marlett {{did not ask}} Janey to {{say nothing}} about Margaret's inexplicable adventure. She {{believed}} that the girl would have sufficient sense and good feeling to hold her peace; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not do so of her own accord, no vows {{would be likely to}} bind her. In this favorable estimate of her pupil's discretion Miss Marlett was not mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Agnes!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Why, no sir; I expect <b>she's</b> at home; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{come here}} {{with the rest of}} the neighbors I didn't see her; for when I found out what had happened, sir, I was so weak that I sat down in the kitchen all of a lump, and have just had {{strength}} enough to come out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'May be {{you are in}} {{the right}} of it, sir; and I'd best let the stones alone till I can tell which is the true and which is the false. By the same token, little is the {{difference}} it would make to her, unless <b>she</b> knew it; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> she'd as soon I brought her a hair of the old dragon's bristles.' ...|$|R
