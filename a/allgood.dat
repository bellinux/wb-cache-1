To broaden his knowledge of working on stage, he joined the National Theatre. He supplemented his stage roles in the 1980s with television roles, appearing in comedies such as the aborted pilot episode of Blackadder, Chelmsford 123, The Lenny Henry Show and the first episode of Red Dwarf. In 1991, he won his first major television role playing Mark Taylor in Steven Moffat's semi-autobiographical BBC sitcom Joking Apart. Although only thirteen episodes were made between 1991 and 1995, the role remains Bathurst's favourite of his whole career.

25|$|In June 2009, concert {{promoter}} <b>Allgood</b> Entertainment, {{represented by}} Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million, {{claiming that the}} singer, through his manager Frank DiLeo, had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with The Jackson 5, as well as sister Janet Jackson. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented the singer from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the <b>Allgood</b> Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency. In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating {{that there was no}} evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed. The case was in limbo as of 2013.|$|E

This is symbolised by his re-acquisition of the Horn of Eld after the version covered in the Dark Tower series, implying that he has learned some of the true values of family and love (and patience); he has clearly taken the horn from Cuthbert <b>Allgood's</b> body as he wished rather than leaving it there as he did before.|$|R

It was a huge hit with audiences, coming in behind Sergeant York as the second-highest-grossing film {{of the year in the}} USA and taking almost $3million against its sizable budget of $1,250,000. Ford was also named Best Director by the New York Film Critics, and this was one of the few awards of his career that he collected in person (he generally shunned the Oscar ceremony).|$|E
500|$|Abismo Negro and {{the rest}} of Team AAA {{returned}} for the 2004 World X Cup Tournament where they now competed as [...] "Team Mexico". Abismo Negro remained undefeated until April 7, 2004, when his team lost to James Mason and Jason <b>Allgood</b> in one of the first matches of the World X Cup Tournament. Later in the night, Team Mexico defeated Team UK to even the score. The World Cup saw Team Mexico lose to Team USA, Team Canada (Eric Young and Bobby Roode), and Team Japan (Ryuji Hijikata and Mitsu Hirai, Jr.). Team Mexico tied in points with Team USA and Team Canada, which meant that a representative of each team met in an Ultimate X match to determine the winner of the tournament. Héctor Garza represented Mexico, but in the end Team USA's Chris Sabin won the match and the tournament.|$|E
500|$|Bathurst's {{professional}} stage debut {{came the}} next year {{when he joined the}} second cast of Michael Frayn's Noises Off at the Savoy Theatre.

He regards it as [...] "the most demoralising" [...] job he has ever had but was grateful for the theatre experience it gave him. The following year, he appeared at The Man In The Moon, a pub theatre in Chelsea, in Judgement, a two-hour monologue on cannibalism. The opening night audience was made up of three people but after good reviews in the national press the audience grew to an average of fifteen.|$|E

The role of Jules <b>Allgood</b> was written for her by writer–director Lisa Cholodenko, who felt that Moore was the right age, adept at both drama and comedy, and confident with the film's sexual content. The actress {{was drawn to the}} film's [...] "universal" [...] depiction of married life, and committed to the project in 2005. The Kids Are All Right was widely acclaimed, eventually garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The critic Betsy Sharkey praised Moore's performance of Jules, who she called an [...] "existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty", writing, [...] "There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera—sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally... and Moore plays every note perfectly." [...] The Kids Are All Right earned Moore a sixth Golden Globe Award nomination and a second BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.|$|E

2500|$|In that context, {{the protests}} against the Long Island {{hospital}} built with migrant labor can be seen for what they were: resistance outside of the Jim Crow South to black workers. During this time, complaints about black workers taking federal construction jobs appear sporadically through the legislation history of both prior bills that anticipated Davis-Bacon, and Davis-Bacon itself. On {{the floor of the}} House of Representatives, Congressman Upshaw said: [...] "You will not think that a southern man is more than human if he smiles over the fact of your reaction to that real problem you are confronted with in any community with a superabundance or large aggregation of negro labor."
