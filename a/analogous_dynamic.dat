40|$|We {{developed}} a stochastic lattice model {{to describe the}} vector-borne disease (like yellow fever or dengue). The model is spatially structured and its dynamical rules {{take into account the}} diffusion of vectors. We consider a bipartite lattice, forming a sub-lattice of human and another occupied by mosquitoes. At each site of lattice we associate a stochastic variable that describes the occupation and the health state of a single individual (mosquito or human). The process of disease transmission in the human population follows a similar dynamic of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model (SIR), while the disease transmission in the mosquito population has an <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamic</b> of the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model (SIS) with mosquitos diffusion. The occurrence of an epidemic {{is directly related to the}} conditional probability of occurrence of infected mosquitoes (human) in the presence of susceptible human (mosquitoes) on neighborhood. The probability of diffusion of mosquitoes can facilitate the formation of pairs Susceptible-Infected enabling an increase in the size of the epidemic. Using an asynchronous dynamic update, we study the disease transmission in a population initially formed by susceptible individuals due to the introduction of a single mosquito (human) infected. We find that this model exhibits a continuous phase transition related to the existence or non-existence of an epidemic.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{relationship}} between protein structure and flexibility is of utmost importance for deciphering the tremendous rates of reactions catalyzed by enzyme biocatalysts. It has been postulated that protein homologs have evolved similar dynamic fluctuations to promote catalytic function, a property that would presumably be encoded in their structural fold. Using one of the best-characterized enzyme systems of the past century, we explore this hypothesis by comparing the numerous and diverse flexibility reports available {{for a number of}} structural and functional homologs of the pancreatic-like RNase A superfamily. Using examples from the literature and from our own work, we cover recent and historical evidence pertaining to the highly dynamic nature of this important structural fold, as well as the presumed importance of local and global concerted motions on the ribonucleolytic function. This minireview does not pretend to cover the overwhelming RNase A literature in a comprehensive manner; rather, efforts have been made to focus on the characterization of multiple timescale motions observed in the free and/or ligand-bound structural homologs as they proceed along the reaction coordinates. Although each characterized enzyme of this architectural fold shows unique motional features on a local scale, accumulating evidence from X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that global dynamic fluctuations, such as the functionally relevant hinge-bending motion observed in the prototypical RNase A, are shared between homologs of the pancreatic-like RNase superfamily. These observations support the hypothesis that <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamic</b> residue clusters are evolutionarily conserved among structural and functional homologs catalyzing similar enzymatic reactions...|$|E
40|$|Enzyme {{catalysis}} can {{be described}} as progress over a multi-dimensional energy landscape where ensembles of interconverting conformational substates channel the enzyme through its catalytic cycle. We applied NMR relaxation dispersion to investigate the role of bound ligands in modulating the dynamics and energy landscape of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase to obtain insights into the mechanism by which the enzyme efficiently samples functional conformations as it traverses its reaction pathway. Although the structural differences between the occluded substrate binary complexes and product ternary complexes are very small, there are substantial differences in protein dynamics. Backbone fluctuations on the μs-ms timescale in the cofactor binding cleft are similar for the substrate and product binary complexes, but fluctuations on this timescale in the active site loops are observed only for complexes with substrate or substrate analog and are not observed for the binary product complex. The dynamics in the substrate and product binary complexes are governed by quite different kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. <b>Analogous</b> <b>dynamic</b> differences in the E:THF:NADPH and E:THF:NADP+ product ternary complexes are difficult to rationalize from ground-state structures. For both of these complexes, the nicotinamide ring resides outside the active site pocket in the ground state. However, they differ in the structure, energetics, and dynamics of accessible higher energy substates where the nicotinamide ring transiently occupies the active site. Overall, our results suggest that dynamics in dihydrofolate reductase are exquisitely “tuned” for every intermediate in the catalytic cycle; structural fluctuations efficiently channel the enzyme through functionally relevant conformational space...|$|E

In typical force spectroscopic setups the molecule is connected via linkers to a read-out device, forming a mechanically coupled dynamic network. Deconvolution of equilibrium distributions, filtering out the influence of the linkers, is a straightforward and common practice. We have developed an <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamic</b> deconvolution theory for the more challenging task of extracting kinetic properties of individual components in networks of arbitrary complexity and topology. Our method determines the intrinsic linear response functions of a given molecule in the network, describing the power spectrum of conformational fluctuations. The practicality of our approach is demonstrated for the particular case of a protein linked via DNA handles to two optically trapped beads at constant stretching force, which we mimic through Brownian dynamics simulations. Each well in the protein free energy landscape (corresponding to folded, unfolded, or possibly intermediate states) will have its own characteristic equilibrium fluctuations. The associated linear response function is rich in physical content, since it depends both on the shape of the well and its diffusivity [...] -a measure of the internal friction arising from such processes like the transient breaking and reformation of bonds in the protein structure. Starting from the autocorrelation functions of the equilibrium bead fluctuations measured in this force clamp setup, we show how an experimentalist can accurately extract the state-dependent protein diffusivity using a straightforward two-step procedure.

40|$|Interchange {{instability}} is {{an important}} dynamic mechanism in plasma physics and has been advanced as an explanation {{of a variety of}} phenomena in the magnetospheric physics. This work derives a new instability criterion for interchange motion in a plasma that connects to a finite-conductivity wall. The new criterion is for a arbitrary magnetic (ratio between thermal pressure and magnetic pressure averaged within flux tube) system, which contains background shear flow, whereas most classical criteria did not consider all of these conditions. Thus this new result is more appropriate to be applied in a real plasma system like the Earth's plasma sheet, which exhibits a wide range of values and background shear flow. Based on magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling theory and ideal MHD adiabatic theory in the inner plasma sheet, a theoretical model was constructed in the ionosphere region. A finite boundary layer was set up between two regions of uniform-content flux tubes, and a perturbation on the boundary layer was investigated. Both analytical and numerical approaches are used to study the stability of the plasma configuration. The flux tubes are interchange unstable when the angle between the gradient of flux tube volume, defined as V = dsB, and the gradient of adiabatic specific entropy PV 5 / 3 is larger than arccos 1 lnPV 5 / 3 1 ln V/ 21 + 5 / 6. Combining this new criterion with the statistical calculation of the plasma sheet characteristics by using the Tsyganenko magnetic field model (the 1996 version) and the Tsyganenko-Mukai plasma model, it is found that, in the Earth's inner plasma sheet, the angle between the two gradients is typically of the order of 15 °, which indicates that the statistical-average Earth's plasma sheet is interchange stable. This result is applicable to the study of interchange instability and plasma transport in the global-MHD and other large-scale magnetosphere simulations, and provides a theoretical base for the study of <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamic</b> processes in the magnetospheres of other planets like Jupiter...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of colloidal particles driven over optical potential energy landscapes is studied. Experiments are conducted using colloids driven by solvent flow or piezo-stage, optical tweezers, magnetic fields, and video-microscopy. Firstly, {{the properties of}} optical traps and potential energy landscapes are determined using driven colloidal particles and clusters. The trap stiffness and potential depth of single Gaussian traps are measured directly. It is shown {{that the nature of}} optical potential energy landscapes may be fully engineered and predicted using a sum of single Gaussian potentials. Next, the motion of colloidal particles driven by a constant force over a periodic optical potential energy landscape is considered. The average particle velocity is found {{as a function of the}} driving velocity, and the wavelength of the optical potential energy landscape, which is found to be sinusoidal at small trap spacings. The critical driving velocity required for a particle to move across the landscape is determined as a function of the wavelength. Brownian motion is found to have a significant effect on the critical driving velocity, but a negligible effect at high driving velocity. Subsequently, the dynamic mode locking caused by adding a modulation to the driving force is studied. This synchronisation manifests as a `Devil's staircase' in the average particle velocity as a function of driving velocity. The amplitude and frequency dependence of the mode locked steps are studied. Furthermore, particle trajectories are examined, and phase portraits show locked (unlocked) states as closed (open) loops in phase space. A state diagram of mode locked steps is constructed. Finally, driven systems of magnetically interacting colloidal particles are examined in potential energy landscapes. The critical driving velocity of a chain of coupled particles driven by a constant force is found to depend strongly on the chain length and the magnetic field. Secondly, a mobile density wave (kink) in an optically pinned chain of coupled particles is exposed to a constant and modulated drive. The kink is found to behave as a quasi-particle, exhibiting <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamic</b> mode locking behaviour to the single particle case. Finally, the mode locking of a finite mobile chain is considered, and found to be affected by the chain flexibility, which is a function of the magnetic field.

40|$|By {{coupling}} {{pairs of}} superconducting qubits {{through a small}} Josephson junction with a time-dependent flux bias, we show that arbitrary interactions involving any combination of Pauli matrices can be generated with {{a small number of}} drive tones applied through the flux bias of the coupling junction. We then demonstrate that similar (though not fully universal) results can be achieved in capacitively coupled qubits by exploiting the higher energy states of the devices through multi-photon drive signals applied to the qubits' flux degrees of freedom. By using this mechanism to couple a qubit to a detuned resonator, the qubit's rotating frame state can be non-destructively measured along any direction on the Bloch sphere. Finally, we describe how the frequency-converting nature of the couplings can be used to engineer a mechanism <b>analogous</b> to <b>dynamic</b> nuclear polarization in NMR systems, capable of cooling an array of qubits well below the ambient temperature, and outline how higher order interactions, such as local 3 -body terms, can be engineered through the same couplings.

40|$|AbstractIn Escherichia coli, the {{location}} of the site for cell division is regulated by the action of the Min proteins. These proteins undergo a periodic pole-to-pole oscillation that involves polymerization and ATPase activity of MinD under the controlling influence of MinE. This oscillation suppresses division near the poles while permitting division at midcell. Here, we propose a multistranded polymer model for MinD and MinE dynamics that quantitatively agrees with the experimentally observed dynamics in wild-type cells and in several well-studied mutant phenotypes. The model also provides new explanations for several phenotypes that have never been addressed by previous modeling attempts. In doing so, the model bridges a theoretical gap between protein structure, biochemistry, and mutant phenotypes. Finally, the model emphasizes the importance of nonequilibrium polymer dynamics in cell function by demonstrating how behavior <b>analogous</b> to the <b>dynamic</b> instability of microtubules is used by E. coli to achieve a sufficiently rapid timescale in controlling division site selection...|$|R
40|$|We {{have focused}} on the giant kelp Nereocystis luetkeana to examine the {{mechanical}} scaling of benthic marine organisms loaded in tension by hydrodynamic forces. If we consider simply the allometry of the kelp’s morphological characters, we conclude that their stipes are underscaled relative to the blade area they support (i. e. that the kelp do not maintain stress or elastic similarity as they grow). However, {{a closer look at the}} characteristics of these kelp in the field reveals (1) that they have different blade shapes (and hence drag coefficients) and stipe material properties in different hydrodynamic environments, and (2) that they show a decrease in drag coefficient as they become larger. One consequence of these adjustments of blade and stipe morphology is that the maximum stresses in N. luetkeana stipes, when the kelp are pulled by peak tidal currents in their respective habitats, are similar for kelp of different sizes and for kelp from different sites. Hence, sessile organisms such as these kelp can, via their growth responses in different mechanical environments, show a phenomenon <b>analogous</b> to <b>dynamic</b> strain similarity. In addition, N. luetkeana also maintain a constant environmental stress factor, the ratio of the stress required to break a component of an organism (in this case the stipe) at some stage in its life to the maximum stress normally encountered in the habitat by that component during that stage (in this case, stress due to the drag on a kelp exposed to the peak tidal currents typical of the site at which it lives), both between habitats and as they grow...|$|R

40|$|By {{extending}} the system theory under the (min,+) -algebra {{to the time}} varying setting, we {{solve the problem of}} constrained traffic regulation and develop a calculus for dynamic service guarantees. For a constrained traffic regulation problem with maximum tolerable delay d and maximum buffer size q, the optimal regulator that generates the output traffic conforming to a subadditive envelope f and minimizes the number of discarded packets is a concatenation of the g-clipper with g(t) = min[f(t+d), f(t) +q] and the maximal f-regulator. The g-clipper is a bufferless device which optimally drops packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelope g. The maximal f-regulator is a buffered device that delays packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelope f. The maximal f-regulator is a linear time invariant filter with impulse response f, under the (min +) -algebra. To provide dynamic service guarantees in a network, we develop the concept of a dynamic server as a basic network element. Dynamic servers can be joined by concatenation, "filter bank summation," and feedback to form a composite dynamic server. We also show that dynamic service guarantees for multiple input streams sharing a work conserving link can be achieved by a dynamic SCED (Service Curve Earliest Deadline) scheduling algorithm, if an appropriate admission control is enforced. To model more general network elements, such as routers and packetizers, we extend the time varying system theory to a general system theory, where the mapping from the input to the output is required to be sigma-additive under the (min,+) -algebra. <b>Analogous</b> to <b>dynamic</b> servers, network elements with the sigma-additive property can also be joined by concatenation, "filter bank summation," and feedback to form a composite network element...|$|R

We first show that competitive equilibrium is dynamically efficient {{if and only if}} the share of capital on total income is large enough while a steady state capital per capita above its Golden Rule level is not consistent with a binding liquidity constraint. We thus focus on the gross substitutability in consumption and on dynamic efficiency assumptions and show that, gathered together, they ensure the local determinacy of equilibrium and, as a consequence, rule out sunspot fluctuations. In addition, we prove that the unique steady state may change its stability from a saddle configuration to a source one (undergoing a flip bifurcation) for a capital intensive investment good as well as for a capital intensive consumption good, when the elasticity of the interest rate is set low enough. However, when the investment good is not too capital intensive, the flip bifurcation turns out to be compatible with high elasticities of the interest rate too. <b>Analogous</b> results within <b>dynamic</b> efficiency are found in the non-monetary model, the existence of a flip bifurcation requiring now a capital intensive investment good.

Two proposed methods {{are based on}} the simple principle that resonant frequencies in an acoustic tube are inversely proportional to the tube length in cases where the configuration is constant.

In the first method, which is referred to as "strict estimation method", we sought instances at which the gross structures of two vocal tracts are <b>analogous</b> by applying <b>dynamic</b> time-warping to formant-trajectories of common words that were uttered at different speeds.

Next, we examined a simplified method for estimating those ratios using all corresponding points of two formant-trajectories: it is the "direct estimation method". Estimation errors in the direct estimation were evaluated to be about /spl plusmn/ 0. 3 % at equal utterance-speeds and /spl plusmn/ 2 % at most, within 2. 0 of the ratios of "fast" to "slow".

40|$|Repetitive {{synaptic}} stimulation overcomes {{the ability}} of astrocytic processes to clear glutamate from the extracellular space, allowing some dendritic segments to become submerged {{in a pool of}} glutamate. This dynamic arrangement activates extrasynaptic NMDA receptors located on dendritic shafts. We used voltage-sensitive and calcium-sensitive dyes to probe dendritic function in this glutamate-rich location. An excess of glutamate in the extrasynaptic space was achieved either by repetitive synaptic stimulation or by glutamate iontophoresis onto the dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Two successive activations of synaptic inputs produced a typical NMDA spike, whereas five successive synaptic inputs produced characteristic plateau potentials, reminiscent of cortical UP states. While NMDA spikes were coupled with brief calcium transients highly restricted to the glutamate input site, the dendritic plateau potentials were accompanied by calcium influx along the entire dendritic branch. Once initiated, the glutamate-mediated dendritic plateau potentials could not be interrupted by negative voltage pulses. Activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in cellular compartments void of spines is sufficient to initiate and support plateau potentials. The only requirement for sustained depolarizing events is a surplus of free glutamate near a group of extrasynaptic receptors. Highly nonlinear dendritic spikes (plateau potentials) are summed in a highly sublinear fashion at the soma, revealing the cellular bases of signal compression in cortical circuits. Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors provide pyramidal neurons with a function <b>analogous</b> to a <b>dynamic</b> range compression in audio engineering. They limit or reduce the volume of loud sounds (i. e. strong glut. inputs) and amplify quiet sounds (i. e. glutamatergic inputs that barely cross the dendritic threshold for local spike initiation).
