5|$|The most {{significant}} current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development {{and maintenance of}} air transportation infrastructure, especially in remote areas.

For the first four weeks the flight was operated three times a week, after which it was increased to a daily flight. At the time of service commencement, Paro Airport consisted of the runway, a two-room air traffic control building (with the ground floor acting as the check-in counter) and a departure lounge on the lawn.

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} <b>airport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThese {{authors have}} {{somewhat}} neglected the potential {{effects of such}} processes on airport planning, and in particular, the capacity to built and develop major <b>airport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> throughout Europe. Indeed, airports have long been considered as mere tools in service of supporting the development of airlines, civil aviation industries and air traffic. This somewhat functionalist approach to <b>airport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and to their managing authorities, i. e. airport management authorities, underestimates their structuring role over policy-making dynamics in this sector. Indeed, whereas external factors such as internationalization, liberalization and European integration were considered as major explanations of policy change by political scientists, the study of internal factors such as territorial dynamics, social and political mobilizations, and devolution processes were abandoned to urban sociologists and social movement theorists. By contrast, we argue that the dynamics of airport planning, i. e. how, by whom and where airports are built, modernized and extended, also contribute to explaining processes of policy change in the air transport domain, and to a larger extent, evolving relationships between State and civil society in Europe...|$|R
