5|$|Standard Swedish, {{spoken by}} most Swedes, is the {{national}} language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established {{by the beginning of}} the 20th century. While distinct regional varieties descended from the older rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform <b>and</b> <b>standardized.</b>|$|E
5|$|To convey {{accurate}} information, it {{soon became}} necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds; this was achieved {{by means of a}} series of classifications first achieved by Luke Howard in 1802, <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> in the International Cloud Atlas of 1896.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{games are}} {{a type of}} action game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, even as the genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first fighting game, popularized <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> the conventions of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, but may also feature melee weapons.|$|E

5|$|In France, as in Italy, Spain and Portugal, organs were {{primarily}} designed to play alternatim verses rather than accompany congregational singing. The French Classical Organ, became remarkably consistent throughout France {{over the course}} of the Baroque era, more so than any other style of organ building in history, <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> registrations developed. It was elaborately described by Dom Bédos de Celles in his treatise L'art du facteur d'orgues (The Art of Organ Building).|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prominent}} <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the Manx and Dumbo. The Dumbo, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head, and was named for resemblance to the fictional Dumbo the Elephant. The Manx rat is tailless due to a genetic mutation, and was named for the Manx cat, which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to the same mutation.|$|E
5|$|Władysław's brother, John II Casimir, {{commanded}} {{one of the}} regiments in {{the relief}} army. Another notable commander was the Field Crown Hetman, Marcin Kazanowski. King Władysław IV, a great supporter of the modernization of the Commonwealth army, {{proved to be a}} good tactician, and his innovations in the use of artillery and fortifications based on Western ideas greatly contributed to the eventual Polish-Lithuanian success. He had replaced the old arquebusiers with musketeers, <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> the Commonwealth artillery (introducing 3- to 6-pounder regimental guns), both to great effect.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E
5|$|Major modern {{economic}} statistics, such as {{unemployment and}} GDP, were not compiled {{on a regular}} <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash of the stock market and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, the Serbian badnjak {{tradition}} {{has also been}} celebrated more publicly. Before World War I, soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia developed the custom of laying a badnjak on a fire in their barracks. In the succeeding Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was further elaborated <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> in army service regulations, but the tradition ended at the outbreak of World War II. Since the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve in which the badnjak plays a central role. Parishioners festively cut the sapling {{to be used as}} the badnjak and take it to their church, where it is consecrated by a priest before it is ceremonially placed on a fire built in the churchyard.|$|E

5|$|By the Hellenistic period, {{it became}} common for Greek states {{to finance the}} {{development}} and proliferation of ever more powerful torsion siege engines, naval ships, <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> designs for arms and armor. Under PhilipII and Alexander the Great, improvements were made to siege artillery such as bolt-shooting ballistae and siege engines such as huge rolling siege towers. E.W.Marsden and M.Y.Treister contend that the Macedonian rulers Antigonus I Monophthalmus and his successor Demetrius I of Macedon had the most powerful siege artillery of the Hellenistic world {{at the end of}} the 4thcenturyBC. The siege of Salamis, Cyprus, in 306BC necessitated the building of large siege engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of West Asia. The siege tower commissioned by DemetriusI for the Macedonian Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC) and manned by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine stories. It had a base of , eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots, three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire, and mechanically opened windows (shielded with wool-stuffed leather curtains to soften the blow of ballistae rounds) of different sizes to accommodate the firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts.|$|E
5|$|For printing, {{the mass}} {{production}} of paper for writing was already well established in China. The papermaking process had been perfected <b>and</b> <b>standardized</b> by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121) in 105, {{and was in}} widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century. The Song dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue paper-printed money—the banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Toilet paper had been in general use in China since the 6th century, paper bags for preserving the flavor of tea leaves by the 7th century, and by the Song dynasty government officials who had done a great service were rewarded by the court with gifts of paper-printed money wrapped in paper envelopes. During the Song dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed {{to meet the needs}} of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run mints and factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.|$|E

While Swedish as a written language is uniform <b>and</b> <b>standardized,</b> the spoken standard may vary considerably from region to region.
