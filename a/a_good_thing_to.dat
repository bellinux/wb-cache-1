25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{be friends}} with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself {{that they want to}} be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

500|$|It {{is truly}} a cruise which tested the crew's mettle and proved the skipper's tenacity. [...] More than that, however, it again proved to all who cared to listen that the US Navy could go anywhere, at any time, and do what ever was required. [...] It's a good sea story about doing {{what had to be}} done.

[...] However, in contrast to public and media dissent, the NSPCC's director of communications, John Grounds, praised the storyline for [...] "helping {{to raise awareness of}} the hidden nature of sexual abuse", deeming it to be [...] "vital in persuading people to take action to stop it and encouraging children to speak out." ...|$|E

According to Lawrence Wright, [...] "the entire base became paralyzed with anxiety about being thrown into the Hole. People were desperately trying to police their thoughts, but it was difficult to keep secrets when staff members were constantly being security-checked with E-Meters." [...] Wright reports that David Miscavige's statements were transcribed for the executives in the Hole, who would then have to repeatedly read them out loud to each other.|$|E
500|$|... "A lot {{of people}} think of Shane as a clear villain and that he did a bad thing. But if you really analyze that situation, he’s a good guy and has done the right thing at every turn. Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought that would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E

He also wrote three books: History of Morgan's Cavalry (1867), History of the Bank of Kentucky, 1792-1895 (1895), and Reminiscences of General Basil W. Duke (a collection of various magazine articles he wrote) (1911). [...] A prominent writer of the Southern experience, he neither advocated slavery, nor apologized for it; although thinking it <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have been abolished, he insisted that Northern claims of excessive abuse of slaves was exaggerated.|$|E
500|$|Portraying {{the head}} guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown {{was given the}} {{opportunity}} to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer, but declined believing it would not be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the Tales from the Crypt television series where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Morgan's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting [...] "fresh fish" [...] as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the Reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility.

500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police.

[...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops.
