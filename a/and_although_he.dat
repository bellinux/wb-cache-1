Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and {{according}} to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times {{described it as a}} smear campaign.|$|E
5|$|Czech {{national}} opera {{until this}} {{time had been}} represented only by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, {{was part of his}} quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms such as the polka and furiant, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong he neverthess created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit.|$|E

5|$|John Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> {{enjoyed the}} view, he conceded {{that it was}} best {{appreciated}} from below.

In 1893, the area was set aside as part of the Pacific Forest Reserve in order to protect its physical and economic resources, primarily timber and watersheds.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{returned}} {{to play for}} Victoria, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> struggled for runs, managing only three fifties for the season, wickets came regularly. He took match totals of 4/55 and 3/24 against Queensland, 4/55 against South Australia and 2/23 against Western Australia; Victoria won all four matches, and claimed the Sheffield Shield.

5|$|A {{member of}} the Breckinridge {{political}} family, in 1849 John C. Breckinridge became the first Democrat to represent Fayette County in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and in 1851, {{he was the first}} Democrat to represent Kentucky's 8th congressional district in over 20 years. A champion of strict constructionism, states' rights, and popular sovereignty, he supported Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the Mexican–American War. Considering his re-election to the House of Representatives unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> and Buchanan won the election, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration.|$|E

5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money <b>and,</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> was not a Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to {{involvement}} with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found {{to try to get}} rich, but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} a foot injury {{at the start}} of 1986–87, Gibbs was restricted to 18 appearances as his team finished the season 9th in the First Division. However, the departure of Graham Taylor and arrival of Dave Bassett the following season signalled a decline in the club's fortunes. Gibbs lost his place shortly before Bassett's departure in January, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> soon returned to the side under Steve Harrison, Watford were relegated in 1988. At the time of the club's relegation, Gibbs had made precisely 100 First Division appearances.|$|E

In 1912, Stojanović was inducted into Narodna Odbrana, an association founded in Serbia with the goal of organizing guerrilla resistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina's annexation by Austria-Hungary. Stojanović was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in July 1914, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment, he was pardoned in 1917. He graduated as a Doctor of Medicine after World War I, and in 1929, opened a private practice in the town of Prijedor.

5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E
5|$|At the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly {{resisted}} {{the advance of}} General Charles Cornwallis, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at Germantown. Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of Germantown. Because of their circuitous route to the battle, however, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from muskets and a fire set by the British in a dry buckwheat field when they arrived; eventually, they and the other colonial forces {{were lost in the}} smoke and retreated.|$|E

John made extensive use of Wallingford Castle during the First Barons' War between 1215 and 1216, reinforcing the fortifications and mobilising a substantial garrison to protect it.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{injured his}} hand during fielding {{practice}} before the Third Test, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> {{went on to}} play in that game (scoring 45 and 32), he opted out of batting in a state game – according to his autobiography, this cost him the New South Wales captaincy – and he missed the fourth Test. He returned for the final Test and top-scored with 71 in Australia's first innings, adding 30 in the second.|$|E
5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge studied {{education}} at a classical school operated by Dr. Louis Marshall, {{the brother of}} Chief Justice John Marshall, then followed his brothers, Cabell and John, to Princeton in 1817. His behavior problems continued there; in one year, he spent more than $1200. He was suspended for fighting, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> was later reinstated, the incident soured him on Princeton, and he was granted an honorable release. (The school later awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1832.) Breckinridge enrolled at Yale University, but after three months, discovered that a one-year residency was required for graduation. Unwilling to complete this requirement, he moved to Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1819.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> received multiple offers {{for the painting}} he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, {{in light of the}} fact that it was already being considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>he</b> lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
