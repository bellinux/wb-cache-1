25|$|Particle {{filters are}} often included, because in many cases, the {{hazardous}} materials {{are in the}} form of mist, which is captured already by the particle filter before entering the chemical <b>adsorber.</b> Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling asphyxiants, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving. Also, a gas mask does not protect against other hazards; for example, corrosive gases can damage the skin, requiring full-body protection.|$|E

Molecular <b>adsorbers</b> are characterized by an extremely large surface area, molecularly-porous substructure, and processing charged sites capable of retaining molecular contaminant species.

40|$|Granular {{activated}} carbon (GAC) <b>adsorbers</b> for drinking water treatment were operated for approx. 14 months and the breakthrough of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) and trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) was monitored. Effluent concentration profiles of gabapentin and valsartan acid increase already at throughputs of < 10, 000 BV. The corresponding breakthrough curves flatten out without reaching the influent concentration level. This strongly indicates biological degradation of these substances in the GAC <b>adsorbers</b> under aerobic conditions, contributing to a more efficient use of GAC. The observed biodegradation in pilot GAC <b>adsorbers</b> also confirms recent reports of biodegradation of gabapentin and valsartan acid during managed aquifer recharge. Oxypurinol is comparatively well adsorbed and no breakthrough was observed during the experimental period. Adsorption capacity and breakthrough characteristics of oxypurinol appear very similar to carbamazepine. Breakthrough of GAC <b>adsorbers</b> operated with drinking water was compared to those of groundwater-fed <b>adsorbers.</b> The results show, that it is generally advisable to use previously aerated influents for GAC fixed-bed <b>adsorbers</b> because this can substantially improve biological removal of otherwise poorly adsorbable compounds and ensure full GAC accessibility for adsorbates by avoiding the undesirable formation of inorganic precipitates on adsorption sites...|$|R

The gas is injected to the stack from the bottom in a low flow rate, and exits from the standpipe of each channel via an individual pipe. The moisture and temperature of the outlet gas is monitored; an increase of them is an indicator of a coolant leak.|$|E

Environment organizations criticized the decision as insufficient, while ACEA mentions it will be extremely difficult for automobile manufacturers to reach such a limit in such short period of time.

40|$|AbstractAdsorption {{refrigeration}} {{has attracted}} considerable efforts {{over the past}} few decades. Adsorption refrigeration is considered as green refrigeration technology, which is driven by low grade heat source. Intensified efforts were promoted to improve the adsorption chiller performance in recent years. Two stages with different adsorbents adsorption chiller working principle and test were proposed in this paper. The novel adsorption chiller contains 4 pieces <b>adsorbers</b> and evaporator and condenser. Zeolite and actived carbon were applied for adsorbents in the two-stage cycle and two <b>adsorbers</b> were packed with zeolite and other <b>adsorbers</b> with actived carbon. The two-stage cycle can be operated effectively with 50 °C, even with 45 °C. Coefficient of performance (COP) and volumetric cooling power (VCP) of two-stage adsorption chiller with different operation conditions were investigated in this paper. The results showed that VCP increases firstly and then decreases with increasing the elapsed time and the maximum of VCP with driving heat source temperature of 50 °C and cooling water temperature of 30 °C and chilled water temperature of 15 °C was about 0. 2 kW/L.

40|$|Metal-organic {{frameworks}} (MOFs) offer considerable {{potential for}} separating {{a wide variety}} of mixtures. For any given separation, there are several MOFs that could be employed. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} reliable procedures for screening and ranking MOFs with regard to their anticipated performance in fixed-bed <b>adsorbers,</b> commonly used in industry. Such fixed-bed <b>adsorbers</b> are invariably operated in a transient mode. The separation performance of fixed-bed <b>adsorbers</b> is governed by a number of factors that include adsorption selectivity, uptake capacity, and intra-crystalline diffusion limitations. We undertake a detailed analysis of the separations of several mixtures that include: C 2 H 2 /CO 2, CO 2 /N- 2, CO 2 /CH 4, H 2 S/CO 2 /CH 4, H- 2 /CO 2 /CO/CH 4 /N- 2, Xe/Kr, C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4, C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6, C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8, O- 2 /N- 2, N- 2 /CH 4, hexane isomers, xylene isomers, and styrene/ethylbenzene. For each separation, we compare the performance of a few carefully selected MOFs by using transient breakthrough simulations that are representative of practical operations. These case studies demonstrate that screening MOFs on the basis of adsorption selectivity alone, as is common practice, often leads to wrong conclusions as regards their separation capability in fixed-bed <b>adsorbers.</b> High uptake capacities often compensate for low selectivities. Conversely, low uptake capacities diminish the separation performance of MOFs with high selectivities. Intra-crystalline diffusion limitations lead to distended breakthroughs, and diminished productivities in a number of cases. We also highlight the possibility of harnessing intra-crystalline diffusion limitations to reverse the adsorption selectivity; this strategy is useful for selective capture of nitrogen from natural gas, and in air separations...|$|R

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of three}} single-component acid dyes onto activated carbon {{has been studied}} using fixed-bed adsorption. Conventional simplified design methods, namely, bed depth service time (BDST) and empty-bed residence time (EBRT) models, were applied to the experimental breakthrough curve data but failed to correlate these data. Consequently, modifications have been developed that enable modified BDST and EBRT models to be applied and to correlate the experimental data very accurately. The modification {{is based on an}} expression to correlate the residence time in the adsorption bed with the time-dependent fraction degree of saturation of the bed.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the coefficient of performance (COP), specific cooling power (Q(scp)) and exergy losses for a four-bed adsorption heat pump is presented. A composite adsorbent (SWS- 1 L) and water are the adsorption pair. An optimum cycle time, corresponding to a maximum specific cooling power, was found. This maximum specific cooling power increases almost linearly with the regeneration temperature. For the operation corresponding to the maximum specific cooling power at the regeneration temperature of 120 degrees C, using the SWS- 1 L composite adsorbent to substitute a regular-density silica gel in the <b>adsorbers,</b> the COP and Q(scp) values can be increased by 51 % and 38. 4 %, respectively. At the regeneration temperature of 100 degrees C and the mode operating time of 360 s, the second-law efficiency of the adsorption heat pump is 20. 4 %. The cycle exergy loss mainly occurs in the <b>adsorbers.</b> The exergy losses in the condenser and evaporator are small. Among the four processes in the <b>adsorbers,</b> the precooling and preheating processes result in 41. 55 % and 28. 96 % of the cycle exergy loss, respectively, while the adsorption and regeneration processes cause 8. 44 % and 18. 97 %, respectively. The exergy losses in the precooling and preheating processes mainly result from heat transfer through a significant temperature difference. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
