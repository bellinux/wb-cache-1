5|$|Several {{parallel}} {{ranges of}} hills dominate {{the interior of}} the Catlins, separated by the valleys of the Owaka, Catlins and Tahakopa Rivers, which <b>all</b> <b>drain</b> southeastwards into the Pacific Ocean. The most notable of these ranges is the Maclennan Range. Between them, these hills are often simply referred to as the Catlins Ranges. Their northwestern slopes are drained by several tributaries of the Clutha and Mataura Rivers, most notably the Mokoreta River, which flows mainly westwards, reaching the Mataura close to the town of Wyndham.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park <b>all</b> <b>drain</b> either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which <b>all</b> <b>drain</b> into the celiac nodes.|$|E

50|$|The Western Ghats are {{the source}} of all Deccan rivers, which include the through Godavari River, Krishna River and Kaveri River, <b>all</b> <b>draining</b> into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers {{constitute}} 20% of India's total outflow.|$|R
2500|$|The main rivers are the Orange River {{draining}} to the Atlantic Ocean, the Limpopo River, the Incomati River, the Maputo River, the Tugela River, the Olifants River (Limpopo), and the Breede River. The Incomati, Maputo, Thukela and Limpopo <b>all</b> <b>drain</b> to the Indian Ocean. South Africa's {{most important}} rivers are transboundary: The Orange River is shared with Botswana, Namibia and Lesotho, the [...] "water tower" [...] of Southern Africa. The Limpopo-Olifants river basin is shared with Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, which lies the furthest downstream. International commissions of all riparian {{countries have been}} set up to manage these transboundary water resources. Potential future water resources are seawater desalination or the transfer of water from the Zambezi River.|$|E

50|$|As with <b>all</b> <b>drains,</b> {{ventilation}} must {{be provided}} to allow the flowing waste water to displace the sewer gas in the drain, and then to allow air (or some other fluid) to fill the vacuum which would otherwise form as the water flows down the pipe.|$|R
50|$|Telchur {{teaches that}} while {{spring and summer}} bring life and cause it to flourish, winter always lies at the end, stilling life and {{preventing}} new life from emerging from the frozen soil.

Some parents abandon their obviously tainted offspring into the nearby Drakwald forest, leading to {{a rise in the}} number of beastmen present there.|$|R
50|$|Drainage {{facilities}} were constructed for about 700 acre of project land. The construction consists of 6.17 mi of drains including 1.4 mi of open outlet drains and 4.7 mi of closed lateral <b>drains.</b> <b>All</b> <b>drains</b> have a design depth of about 10 ft. The land requiring drains {{was identified as}} either drainage deficient {{at the time of}} investigation or likely to develop deficiencies after project development.|$|R

50|$|Bathurst Harbour is a large, rectangular, almost {{landlocked}} body {{of water}} located in {{the southwest corner of}} Tasmania.

50|$|Sewage {{disposal}} {{is another}} concern. Many {{of the lower}} income-communities in the city do not have adequate plumbing and must rely on refuse-collectors to haul out human waste. Not <b>all</b> <b>drains</b> are covered, causing a proliferation of disease causing flies and mosquitoes. Since Midnapore is drier than many other coastal and humid low-lying towns of West Bengal, this problem is not as acute as it.|$|R

Logan says: [...] "They've come back" [...] (hinting something about the four of them).|$|R
50|$|The Pibor, Baro, Gilo, and Akobo rivers <b>all</b> <b>drain</b> the Ethiopian Highlands. The Baro River {{is by far}} the largest, {{contributing}} 83% of {{the total}} water flowing into the Sobat River. During the rainy season, between June and October, the Baro River alone contributes about 10% of the Nile's water at Aswan, Egypt. In contrast, these rivers have very low flow during the dry season.|$|E

50|$|Geographically, the Lincolnshire Wolds are a {{continuation}} of the Yorkshire Wolds, which run up through the East Riding of Yorkshire. The Wolds as a whole were bisected by the erosion of the waters of the River Humber. The fenlands, which stretch down as far as Norfolk, are former wetlands, consisting both of peat bogs and tidal silt marshes. They were nearly <b>all</b> <b>drained</b> {{by the end of the}} 19th century, when Spilsby had its longest period of Victorian expansion.|$|R
50|$|The spring pygmy sunfish, Elassoma alabamae, is {{a species}} of pygmy sunfish endemic to the United States, where it is only known from a single spring system in Alabama.

Currently it occurs in Limestone County in the Beaverdam-Moss Spring/Swamp spring system. This species prefers waters with dense vegetation. It can reach 3.3 cm in total length, though most do not exceed 2 cm.|$|R
