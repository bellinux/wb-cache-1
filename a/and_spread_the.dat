5|$|Worrying {{that the}} {{rebellion}} might rapidly reignite <b>and</b> <b>spread,</b> <b>the</b> colonial authorities instigated arbitrary reprisals against the Nyasa population, including mass hut burnings. All weapons were confiscated and fines of 4 shillings per person were levied in the districts {{affected by the}} revolt, {{regardless of whether the}} people in question had been involved. The colonial government also begun attacking the rights of missionaries in Nyasaland and banned many independent churches, including Kitawala, from Nyasaland, and placed restrictions on other African-run churches. Public gatherings, especially those associated with African-initiated religious groups, were banned until 1919. Fear of similar uprisings in other colonies, notably Northern Rhodesia, also led to similar repression of independent churches and foreign missions beyond Nyasaland.|$|E
5|$|It is {{gradually}} revealed that Ruka's father Souya had {{become obsessed with}} helping complete a ritual dance that would purify the islanders of the Hidden Moon Disease, which required {{the construction of a}} special mask for the dancer. Ruka herself became infected, and was treated at the sanatorium along with the other girls and the dancer, Haibara's sister Sakuya. The ritual was a catastrophic failure, with Sakuya reaching the final stage of the Hidden Moon Disease and falling into a coma, while the other girls collapsed and had their memories wiped. Two years after Ruka and Sayaka left the island, Sakuya woke <b>and</b> <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> Hidden Moon Disease across the island, killing all the inhabitants including Souya. To lay her to rest, the ritual must be completed, and for that her mask must be restored. Ruka comes into possession of all the mask fragments, which reform into the complete mask. Confronting Sakuya atop the island's lighthouse, she manages to pacify her with a sacred tune communicated to her by Sayaka, then Chōshirō puts the mask on Sakuya, completing the ritual and allowing all the island's spirits to pass into the afterlife. Depending on the game's difficulty setting, Misaki's fate is either left unknown, or her illness is cured after she is saved by Madoka's spirit and she leaves the island with Ruka.|$|E

He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo.

5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge <b>and</b> <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position <b>and</b> <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E

The Master Chief is teleported into High Charity, where a civil war has broken out among the Covenant; In Amber Clad crashes into the city, and Cortana realizes that Gravemind used them as a distraction to infest In Amber Clad <b>and</b> <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> Flood. As the parasite overruns the city, consuming the Prophet of Mercy in the process, the Prophet of Truth orders Tartarus to take Keyes, Johnson, and Guilty Spark to Halo's control room and activate the ring.

5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated <b>and</b> <b>spread.</b> <b>The</b> Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread.

Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E
5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began to believe she might be a witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children <b>and</b> <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E
