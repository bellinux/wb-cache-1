40|$|PURPOSE: To compare visual acuity, aberrometry, and {{contrast}} sensitivity {{in patients who}} had a spherical intraocular lens (IOL) (SoFlex SE, Bausch & Lomb) implanted in one eye and an <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> (SofPort AO, Bausch & Lomb) implanted in the fellow eye during uncomplicated cataract surgery. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, double-blind study was performed. Forty patients (80 eyes) underwent bilateral phacoemulsification with implantation of a spherical IOL in one eye and an <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> in the fellow eye. Postoperatively, visual acuity, aberrometry, {{and contrast}} sensitivity tests were performed. Statistical analyses were performed using Student t and Wilcoxon tests, and mixed effects were used for each contrast condition situation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (30 women, 9 men; 78 eyes) {{with a mean age}} of 69. 3 +/- 6. 17 years (range: 51 to 82 years) completed the study. No statistical differences were found regarding visual acuity among eyes. Lower levels of higher order aberrations were achieved in the aspheric group. No statistical difference between groups under photopic conditions was noted. in low spatial frequencies, better performance was observed with the <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> under mesopic conditions. in high spatial frequencies, the spherical IOL produced better quality of vision. Comparing mesopic conditions with glare, visual performance was statistically better using the <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery results cannot be measured by means of visual acuity alone. Quality of vision must be considered, and implantation of IOLs with low levels of spherical aberrations and better contrast sensitivity are preferred. in this study, the <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> demonstrated better visual function, especially at night, when compared with spherical IOLs.

SETTING: Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. METHODS: An <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> was implanted in 1 {{eye and a}} spherical IOL in the other eye of patients with bilateral age-related cataract. Contrast sensitivity was measured using 2 computerized tests (vertical sine-modulated gratings and circular sine-modulated patterns) with cycloplegia and a 5. 0 mm artificial pupil under photopic conditions at optimum refractive correction and at several defocus levels. The depth of focus and the myopic shift (shift of optimum focus toward more myopic values at lower spatial frequencies) were determined.

40|$|Purpose:  Recently, {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) that possess an {{aspheric}} design, compensating for the spherical aberration (SA) of the cornea, have been developed. We designed {{this study to}} compare a group of patients who had undergone bilateral cataract surgery and had received one spherical IOL and one <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL,</b> to assess their ocular preference. Methods:  Patients were recruited from those who had undergone bilateral cataract surgery during the preceding six months (32 patients). Types of aspheric IOLs, which were used included: Tecnis ZA 9003, AcrysofIQ SN 60 WF and Akreos Adapt AO. Contrast acuity was measured using a CSV- 1000 CVA instrument and spherical aberration (SA) was measured using a Zywave aberrometer. Patients also answered a brief questionnaire, designed {{to determine whether they}} could detect any difference between their spherical and aspheric IOLs and whether they had an ocular preference. Results:  No differences were found between spherical and aspheric IOLs in contrast acuity. Total ocular spherical aberration was greater among eyes with spherical IOLs compared with aspheric IOLs (t = 6. 67; p < 0. 0001). Patients' ocular preference was unrelated to the presence of an <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> or the amount of spherical aberration, but was associated with the level of ametropia and visual acuity. Conclusions:  We were unable to find any impact on a patient's subjective visual quality from a reduction of spherical aberration by the presence of an <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL.</b> Ocular preference was determined by level of visual acuity and degree of ametropia post-operatively.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} visual {{outcomes}} of aspheric multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) compared with spherical multifocal IOL after cataract surgery. METHODS :Potential prospective controlled trials that comparing <b>aspheric</b> multifocal <b>IOL</b> implantation with spherical multifocal IOL group were {{extracted from the}} computer database. The statistical analysis was carried out using Stata 10 software. Standardized mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous variables. The pooled estimates were computed {{in the use of}} a random-effects model. RESULTS :A systematic review identified five prospective nonrandomized controlled trials, including 178 <b>aspheric</b> multifocal <b>IOL</b> and 164 spherical multifocal IOL. There {{was no significant difference in}} uncorrected distance visual acuity (95 %CI, - 0. 248 to 0. 152; P = 0. 641) and uncorrected near visual acuity (95 %CI, - 0. 210 to 0. 428; P = 0. 504) between <b>aspheric</b> multifocal <b>IOL</b> and spherical multifocal IOL. Statistically significant differences were detected less spherical aberration in <b>aspheric</b> multifocal <b>IOL</b> (95 %CI, - 1. 111 to - 0. 472; P ＜ 0. 001) when compared to spherical multifocal IOL.

50|$|Cataract surgery may be {{performed}} to correct vision problems in both eyes, {{and in these}} cases, patients are usually advised to consider monovision. This procedure involves inserting in one eye an intraocular lens that provides near vision {{and in the other}} eye an IOL that provides distance vision. Although most patients can adjust to having implanted monofocal lenses in both eyes, some cannot and may experience blurred vision at both near and far distances. IOLs that emphasize distance vision may be mixed with IOLs that emphasize intermediate vision in order to achieve a type of modified monovision. Bausch and Lomb developed in 2004 the first <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs</b> which provide better contrast sensitivity by having their periphery flatter than the middle of the lens. However, some cataract surgeons have debated the benefits of <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs,</b> because the contrast sensitivity benefit may not last in older patients.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{describe}} the individual virtual eye, {{a computer model}} of a human eye with respect to its optical properties. It is based on measurements of an individual person {{and one of its}} major application is calculating intraocular lenses (IOLs) for cataract surgery. MethodsThe model is constructed from an eye's geometry, including axial length and topographic measurements of the anterior corneal surface. All optical components of a pseudophakic eye are modeled with computer scientific methods. A spline-based interpolation method efficiently includes data from corneal topographic measurements. The geometrical optical properties, such as the wavefront aberration, are simulated with real ray-tracing using Snell's law. Optical components can be calculated using computer scientific optimization procedures. The geometry of customized <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs</b> was calculated for 32 eyes and the resulting wavefront aberration was investigated. ResultsThe more complex the calculated IOL is, the lower the residual wavefront error is. Spherical IOLs are only able to correct for the defocus, while toric IOLs also eliminate astigmatism. Spherical aberration is additionally reduced by aspheric and toric <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs.</b> The efficient implementation of time-critical numerical ray-tracing and optimization procedures allows for short calculation times, which may lead to a practicable method integrated in some device. ConclusionsThe individual virtual eye allows for simulations and calculations regarding geometrical optics for individual persons. This leads to clinical applications like IOL calculation, with the potential to overcome the limitations of those current calculation methods that are based on paraxial optics, exemplary shown by calculating customized <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs...</b>|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} optical {{performance}} of rigid spherical polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), foldable spherical, and foldable aspheric intraocular lenses (IOLs). METHODS: Measurements were obtained monocularly from pseudophakic {{patients with a}} PMMA IOL (Ophtec PC 265 y or Rayner 105 U), spherical AcrySof MA 30 IOL (Alcon Laboratories Inc), or aspheric Tecnis ZA 9003 IOL (Abbott Medical Optics). Contrast sensitivity was measured using the Holladay automated contrast sensitivity test with 5. 0 -mm artificial pupil at 3 and 6 cycles per degree at optimal focus and at several defocus levels. The myopic shift (shift of the optimal focus toward more myopic values at lower spatial frequencies) and depth of focus were determined. Wavefront aberrations were assessed with a Hartmann-Shack wavefront analyzer; straylight was measured using the C-Quant meter (Oculus Optikgerate GmbH). RESULTS: Nine patients with a spherical rigid PMMA IOL, 19 patients with a spherical foldable IOL, and 24 patients with an aspheric foldable IOL met the inclusion criteria. Eyes with an <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> showed less spherical aberration than eyes with other IOLs; {{no differences were found}} in overall higher order aberrations. No differences in contrast sensitivity at optimal focus and in straylight were found among the IOLs. Eyes with a PMMA IOL showed a larger depth of focus compared to eyes with an <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL.</b> Eyes with an <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> had a smaller myopic shift than eyes with other IOLs. CONCLUSIONS: Optical performance differences among the IOLs in this study are small, concurring with similar higher order aberrations found in the three groups.

40|$|To analyze {{internal}} {{spherical aberration}} in pseudophakic eyes that underwent aspheric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, and {{to investigate the}} relationships between biometric data {{and the effectiveness of}} <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> implantation. This retrospective study included 40 eyes of 40 patients who underwent implantation of an IOL having a negative spherical aberration of - 0. 20 μm (CT ASPHINA 509 M; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Germany). The IOLMaster (version 5. 0; Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) was used for preoperative biometric measurements (axial length, anterior chamber depth, central corneal power) and the measurement of postoperative anterior chamber depth. The spherical aberrations were measured preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively using the iTrace (Tracey Technologies, Houston, TX, USA) at a pupil diameter of 5. 0 mm. We investigated the relationships between preoperative biometric data and postoperative internal spherical aberration, and compared biometric measurements between 2 subgroups stratified according to internal spherical aberration (spherical aberration ≤ - 0. 06 μm vs. spherical aberration > - 0. 06 μm). The mean postoperative internal spherical aberration was - 0. 087 ± 0. 063 μm. Preoperative axial length and residual total spherical aberration showed statistically significant correlations with internal spherical aberration (p = 0. 041, 0. 002). Preoperative axial length, postoperative anterior chamber depth, IOL power, and residual spherical aberration showed significant differences between the 2 subgroups stratified according to internal spherical aberration (p = 0. 020, 0. 029, 0. 048, 0. 041 respectively). The corrective effect of an <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> is influenced by preoperative axial length and postoperative anterior chamber depth.

40|$|Cataract, {{a common}} cause of {{decreased}} vision, is caused by chemical changes in the crystalline lens, leading {{to a loss of}} transparency which is associated with a loss of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and increased disability glare. The cataractous lens can be replaced surgically with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL), restoring optical performance. Initially, IOL designs were spherical, increasing the spherical aberration; {{one of the most important}} aberrations of the human eye optics. In the crystalline lens the spherical aberration increases with age. Therefore, to optimize the optical performance of eyes to the level of young eyes, the <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> was designed. In this thesis, we compared the optical performance of eyes with spherical and aspheric IOLs. Implantation of the <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> succesfully lowered the spherical aberration of the eye optics to the level of young healthy eyes. Optical performance, however, did not differ significantly from eyes implanted with a spherical IOL. A possible explanation is that, besides spherical aberration, other aberrations could influence the optical performance. Furthermore, aberrations may have a major advantage; eyes with a spherical IOL tended to have a larger depth of focus. To decide in clinical practice which type of IOL should be preferred for a patient, future research has to reveal the essential characteristics of the eye. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of new intraocular lenses (IOLs), industry marketing {{to the public and}} patient expectations has warranted increased accuracy of IOL power calculations. Toric <b>IOLs,</b> multifocal <b>IOLs,</b> <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs,</b> phakic lenses, accommodative lenses, cases of refractive lens exchange and eyes that have undergone previous refractive surgery all require improved clinical measurements and IOL prediction formulas. Hence, measurement techniques and IOL calculation formulas are essential factors that affect the refractive outcome. Measurement with ultrasound has been the historic standard for measurement of ocular parameters for IOL calculation. However the {{introduction of}} optical biometry using partial coherence interferometry (PCI) has steadily established itself as the new standard. Additionally, modern optical instruments such as Scheimpflug cameras and optical coherence tomographers are being used to determine corneal power that was normally the purview of manual keratometry and topography. A number of methods are available to determine the IOL power including the empirical, analytical, numerical or combined methods. Ray tracing techniques or paraxial approximation by matrix methods or classical analytical ‘IOL formulas’ are actively used in for the prediction of IOL power. There is no universal formula for all cases – phakic and pseudophakic cases require different approaches, as do short eyes, long eyes, astigmatic eyes or post-refractive surgery eyes. Invariably, IOLs are characterized by different methods and lens constants, which require individual optimization. This review describes the current methods for biometry and IOL calculation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} whether implantation of an aspheric intraocular lens (IOL) results in reduced ocular aberrations and improved contrast sensitivity after cataract surgery and, therefore, changes on frequency-doubling technology (FDT) testing. Methods: The present prospective clinical study enrolled 25 patients with bilateral cataract (50 eyes), who randomly received either an aspheric (Akreos AO) or a spherical (Akreos Fit) IOL {{in one eye}} and the other IOL in the second eye. Assessment 12 months postoperatively included photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity testing. Higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were computed. FDT testing was divided into four areas to evaluate the variation of the values at different points. The median values of the local pattern thresholds (median area contrast sensitivity [MACS]) obtained with that division were calculated.

Linear regression models for the Zernike coefficients describing the ocular wavefront aberrations up till the fourth order were determined, with as independent variables the Zernike coefficients describing the corneal shape, the eye (right/left), IOL power, and axial length. Results: Linear regression equations with an explained variance (adjusted R-square) above 0. 50 were found for five Zernike aberration terms: defocus (z (2, 0); adjusted R-square 0. 90), the astigmatism terms (0. 81 for oblique astigmatism [z(2,- 2) ] and 0. 88 for regular astigmatism [z(2, 2) ]), vertical coma (z(3,- 1); 0. 52), and spherical aberration (z(4, 0); 0. 71). Conclusion: The defocus, astigmatism, vertical coma, and spherical aberration terms of the ocular wavefront are strongly associated with the corneal shape in pseudophakic eyes and may thus be predicted from the corneal shape and other eye characteristics...|$|E
40|$|IOL optics {{and quality}} of vision make in trying to attain this goal. The second trend is the {{advancement}} of diag-nostic and surgical technologies that are helping to tighten the standard deviation in cataract surgery, bringing more eyes to 20 / 20 or better visual acuity postoper-atively. As quantity of vision edges closer to the goal, {{it may be time}} for renewed emphasis on quality of vision. By considering important material and design features like refractive index, spherical and chromatic aberration, glistenings, and chromophores, we can make choices in clinical practice that improve both quantity {{and quality of}} vision. For this supplement, I have assem-bled a dynamic group of experts in the field to explore the principles of optics that contribute to high quality of vision and patient satisfaction. I n evaluating IOLs, surgeons typically think about the lens material and design from a structural perspective: How stable is the lens in the bag? Does the edge prevent lens epithelial cell migration? Less often, perhaps, do surgeons consider how the lens material and design affect image quality. Our attention was first drawn to image quality several years ago, when spherical aberration garnered a signifi-cant amount of attention. The result has been the popularization of <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs,</b> to the benefit of our patients. Two important trends are now changing how we think of cataract surgery. The first is presbyopia-correcting IOLs. The desire to achieve youthful vi-sion for a spectacle-independent lifestyle has raised expectations and increased awareness of the visual tradeoffs w...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{repeatability}} of an objective image analysis technique to determine intraocular lens (IOL) rotation and centration. SETTING: Six ophthalmology clinics across Europe. METHODS: One-hundred seven patients implanted with Akreos AO <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs</b> with orientation marks were imaged. Image quality was rated by a masked observer. The {{axis of rotation}} was determined from a line bisecting the IOL orientation marks. This was normalized for rotation of the eye between visits using the axis bisecting 2 consistent conjunctival vessels or iris features. The center of ovals overlaid to circumscribe the IOL optic edge and the pupil or limbus were compared to determine IOL centration. Intrasession repeatability was assessed in 40 eyes and the variability of repeated analysis examined. RESULTS: Intrasession rotational stability of the IOL was ± 0. 79 degrees (SD) and centration was ± 0. 10 mm horizontally and ± 0. 10 mm vertically. Repeated analysis variability of the same image was ± 0. 70 degrees for rotation and ± 0. 20 mm horizontally and ± 0. 31 mm vertically for centration. Eye rotation (absolute) between visits was 2. 23 ± 1. 84 degrees (10 %> 5 degrees rotation) using one set of consistent conjunctival vessels or iris features and 2. 03 ± 1. 66 degrees (7 %> 5 degrees rotation) using the average of 2 sets (P =. 13). Poorer image quality resulted in larger apparent absolute IOL rotation (r =- 0. 45,P<. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Objective analysis of digital retroillumination images allows sensitive assessment of IOL rotation and centration stability. Eye rotation between images can lead to significant errors if not taken into account. Image quality is important to analysis accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the clinical outcomes, safety, {{and efficacy of}} cataract surgery with the implantation of a toric intraocular lens (IOL) in eyes with stable pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD). Methods: Eleven eyes (eight patients) diagnosed as stable PMD and cataract underwent mini-incision 2. 2 mm cataract surgery followed by the implantation of hydrophobic toric <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> (AcrySof IQ Toric IOL, Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA). Perioperative variables of interest included uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities, manifest refraction, and corneal topography. Paired samples t-tests were used to analyze preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, astigmatism, and spherical equivalent (SE) parameters. Follow-up was 6 months. Results: The mean CDVA was 0. 62 ± 0. 26 logMAR preoperatively and 0. 07 ± 0. 07 logMAR postoperatively. The mean preoperative sphere and cylinder was - 3. 14 ± 3. 58 D and - 4. 84 ± 2. 02 D, respectively. The mean postoperative manifest refractive sphere and cylinder was - 0. 30 ± 0. 51 D and - 0. 81 ± 1. 51 D, respectively.

40|$|NoAspheric {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) are {{designed}} to correct spherical aberration in pseudophakic eyes. We predict the benefit from correcting spherical aberration based on simulations and aberrometry of pseudophakic eyes implanted with spherical IOLs. METHODS Ray tracing was performed through a model eye with an equi-biconvex spherical IOL and with a spherical aberration-correcting <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL.</b> The IOLs were increasingly tilted and/or displaced, and the resulting transverse aberrations of 169 rays were transformed into Zernike coefficients for different pupil sizes. The benefit from correcting spherical aberration at individual mesopic pupils was investigated by canceling in the sets of Zernike coefficients for 41 eyes implanted with a spherical IOL. RESULTS Both the model eye and the real eye data predict that age-related miosis reduces spherical aberration in the eye implanted with a spherical IOL to approximately 1 / 3 of the spherical aberration at a 6 -mm pupil. A reduction of similar magnitude occurs when spherical aberration-induced non-paraxial defocus is corrected by a spectacle lens. For natural mesopic pupils, canceling the Zernike coefficient improved the objective image quality at a rate similar to changing defocus by 0. 05 diopters. Average centration and tilt levels diminish the lead of aspheric IOLs over spherical IOLs, depending on the direction of decentration. CONCLUSIONS The benefit from correcting spherical aberration in a pseudophakic eye is limited for {{some or all of}} the following reasons: wearing glasses, age-related miosis, tilt and decentration of IOL, small contribution of spherical aberration to all aberrations, and intersubject variabilit...|$|E

Objective. To evaluate the postoperative visual quality of cataract patients with extreme myopia after implantation of aspheric intraocular lenses (IOLs). Methods. Thirty-three eyes were enrolled in this prospectivestudy. Eighteen eyes with an axial length longer than 28 mm {{were included in the}} extreme myopia group, and the other 15 eyes were included in the nonextreme myopia group. Phacoemulsification and <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> implantation were performed. Sixmonths after cataract surgery, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity, and wavefront aberrations were measured, and subjective visual quality was assessed. Results. The BCVA improved significantly after surgery for both groups, and patients in the nonextreme myopia group achieved better postoperative BCVA due to better retinal status of the eyes. The evaluation of contrast sensitivity without glare was the same in both groups, whereas patients in the nonextreme myopia group performed better at intermediate spatial frequencies under glare conditions. The two groups did not show a significant difference in high-order aberrations. With regard to subjective visual quality, the composite scores of both groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions. Aspheric IOLs provided good visual outcomes in cataract patients with extreme myopia. These patients should undergo careful evaluation to determine the maculopathy severity level before surgery. 1...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To compare spherical {{aberration}} and contrast sensitivity function following implantation of four different foldable posterior chamber intraocular lenses (IOLs), namely Sensar, Akreos AO, Tecnis, and AcrySof IQ. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 68 eyes of 68 patients with senile cataracts underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation with Sensar (n= 17), Akreos AO (n= 17), Tecnis (n= 17), or AcrySof IQ (n= 17). Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), {{spherical aberration}} and contrast sensitivity function (CSF) were compared among the study groups, 3 months after surgery. Results: There {{was no significant}} difference between the study groups in terms of age (P = 0. 21). Mean postoperative BSCVA with Sensar, Akreos AO, Tecnis, and AcrySof IQ was 0. 15 ± 0. 10, 0. 12 ± 0. 9, 0. 08 ± 0. 08, and 0. 08 ± 0. 07 logMAR, respectively (P= 0. 08). Spherical aberration measured over a 4 mm pupil was significantly higher with Sensar and Akreos AO than the two other IOLs. The difference between Tecnis and AcrySof IQ was significantly in favor of the former IOL. Over a 6 mm pupil, spherical aberrations were comparable with Sensar and Akreos AO, furthermore spherical aberration was also comparable among eyes implanted with Akreos AO, AcrySof IQ, and Tecnis. Sensar yielded significantly inferior results as compared to Acrysof IQ and Tecnis. CSF with Sensar was inferior to the three <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOLs</b> at the majority of spatial frequencies. Tecnis yielded significantly better mesopic CSF at 1. 5 and 3 cycles per degree spatial frequencies.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the visual quality of the AcrySof IQ SN 60 WF ® intraocular lens (IOL) when {{combined}} with different corneal profiles. Ten eyes of 10 participants with no prior history of refractive or cataract surgery were evaluated. An adaptive optics visual simulator was used to simulate the wavefront aberration pattern of an <b>aspheric</b> aberration-correcting <b>IOL</b> (AcrySof IQ SN 60 WF ®). Normal corneas (group A), low and high myopic corneal ablations (groups B and C, respectively) and low and high hyperopic corneal ablations (groups D and E, respectively) were also simulated. Monocular distance visual acuities at 100, 50 and 10 per cent of contrast were measured. At 100, 50 and 10 per cent contrast, no differences were found between groups A and B (p > 0. 06 for all contrasts). Group A obtained better values than groups C, D and E for all contrasts (p = 0. 031, p = 0. 038, p = 0. 032 at 100, 50 and 10 per cent of contrast, respectively). At the same time, group B obtained better values than groups C, D and E (p = 0. 041, p = 0. 042, p = 0. 036 at 100, 50 and 10 per cent of contrast, respectively). Within the five groups, the worst results were always obtained for group E (p = 0. 017, p = 0. 021 and p = 0. 025 at 100, 50 and 10 per cent of contrast, respectively). The results suggest that the <b>aspheric</b> aberration-correcting <b>IOL</b> studied provides comparable results, when it is combined with normal corneas and with corneas with simulated low myopic ablations. When negative amounts of residual spherical aberration after cataract surgery are expected to be achieved, IOLs with more positive spherical aberration should be considered. 1. 256 JCR (2013) Q 3, 40 / 58 Ophtalmolog...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{stability}} of the Akreos AO intraocular lens (IOL) platform with a simulated toric design using objective image analysis. Setting: Six hospital eye clinics across Europe. Methods: After implantation in 1 eye of patients, IOLs with orientation marks were imaged at 1 to 2 days, 7 to 14 days, 30 to 60 days, and 120 to 180 days. The axis of rotation and IOL centration were objectively assessed using validated image analysis. Results: The study enrolled 107 patients {{with a mean age of}} 69. 9 years ± 7. 7 (SD). The image quality was sufficient for IOL rotation analysis in 91 % of eyes. The mean rotation between the first day postoperatively and 120 to 180 days was 1. 93 ± 2. 33 degrees, with 96 % of IOLs rotating fewer than 5 degrees and 99 % rotating fewer than 10 degrees. There was no significant rotation between visits and no clear bias in the direction of rotation. In 71 % of eyes, the dilation and image quality was sufficient for image analysis of centration. The mean change in centration between 1 day and 120 to 180 days was 0. 21 ± 0. 11 mm, with all IOLs decentering less than 0. 5 mm. There was no significant decentration between visits and no clear bias in the direction of the decentration.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} quality of vision with {{aspheric}} and spherical intraocular lenses (IOLs) in pseudophakic patients after long-term follow-up. METHODS: Two hundred eyes of 100 patients with bilateral cataracts {{were randomly assigned to}} receive spherical (Acrysof SN 60 AT [Alcon Laboratories Inc] or Sensar AR 40 e [Advanced Medical Optics Inc]) or aspheric IOLs (Acrysof SN 60 WF [Alcon] or Tecnis Z 9000 [Advanced Medical Optics]). Ophthalmologic examination, including best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), pupil size, ocular dominance, contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions, and wavefront analysis, was performed 2 months and 1 and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences among the four groups in terms of age, pupil diameter, postoperative BSCVA, comeal spherical aberration, and posterior capsular opacification were noted. At all followup examinations, contrast sensitivity results showed {{no significant differences between the}} two aspheric IOLs at all spatial frequencies. Under photopic conditions, significant differences (P<. 05) between spherical and aspheric IOLs were detected for spatial frequencies of 12 and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) at 2 months and 2 years and 12 cpd at 1 year. Under mesopic conditions, significant differences (P<. 05) were detected between spherical and aspheric IOLs for all spatial frequencies at 2 months; all spatial frequencies except 18 cpd at 1 year; and spatial frequencies of 3, 12, and 18 cpd at 2 years.

40|$|PURPOSE: Monofocal {{aspheric}} {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) provide better visual outcome {{compared to other}} available IOLs following cataract surgery. However, the imported IOLs are expensive and are not affordable by all subset of patients in low- to middle-income countries like India. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the safety and efficacy of a relatively low cost indigenous IOL (Acriol EC) with an imported <b>aspheric</b> <b>IOL</b> (AcrySof IQ). METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care centre. Two hundred and five eyes of 137 patients > 45 years of age with uncomplicated age-related cataract were recruited. All cases underwent standard phacoemulsification and randomly assigned to one of the IOL implantations (Group I: AcrySof IOL; Group II: Acriol EC IOL). Primary outcome measure was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Secondary outcomes included visual function (VF) score, spherical equivalent, contrast sensitivity, optical aberrations, and posterior capsular opacification. Independent t-test to compare two means; Mann-Whitney test; Pearson's Chi-square test, and McNemar's test were used for analyzing the nonparametric data such as incidence of posterior capsule opacification. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean postoperative BCVA at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in either group (P > 0. 05). The contrast sensitivity, wavefront aberrations, VF score, and posterior capsular opacification were comparable between the groups except for higher-order aberrations and spherical aberration, which were higher in Group II.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} spherical and aspherical intraocular lenses on the postoperative visual quality of age-related cataract patients using Optical Quality Analysis System (OQAS). METHODS: Seventy-four eyes with age-related cataracts were randomly divided into spherical and aspherical lens implantation groups. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured preoperatively, one day, one week, two weeks, one month and two months after surgery. A biometric systems analysis using the OQAS objective scattering index (OSI) was performed. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} in visual acuity (P> 0. 05) before and after spherical and aspheric lens implantation. There was a negative linear correction between the OSI value and BCVA (r=- 0. 634, P= 0. 000), and positive corrections between the OSI value and the lens LOCUS III value of nucleus color (NC), nucleus opacity (NO), cortex (C) and posterior lens capsular (P) (r= 0. 704, P= 0. 000; r= 0. 514, P= 0. 000; r= 0. 276, P= 0. 020; r= 0. 417, P= 0. 000, respectively). OSI values of spherical vs aspherical lenses were 11. 5 ± 3. 6 vs 11. 8 ± 3. 4, 4. 1 ± 0. 9 vs 3. 3 ± 0. 8, 3. 5 ± 0. 9 vs 2. 7 ± 0. 7, 3. 3 ± 0. 8 vs 2. 6 ± 0. 7, 3. 2 ± 0. 7 vs 2. 5 ± 0. 8, and 3. 2 ± 0. 8 vs 2. 5 ± 0. 8 before and 1 d, 1, 2 wk, 1 and 2 mo after surgery, respectively.

Methods: 160 Consecutive eyes of cataract patients {{were divided into two}} groups. One group (20 patients, 40 eyes) received <b>aspheric</b> monofocal <b>IOLs</b> (Acrysof SN 60 WF). One group (60 patients, 120 eyes) was implanted with a diffractive <b>aspheric</b> multifocal <b>IOL</b> produced by different manufacturers: 20 patients with Acrysof RESTORE SN 6 AD 3 -with a + 4 sph addiction, 20 patients with Acrysof RESTORE SN 6 AD 1 with a + 3 sph addiction, and 20 patients with AMO Tecnis ZMA 00 with a + 4 sph addiction. Visual acuity and constrast sensitivity outcomes were evaluate after a 6 months follow up. Additionally reading performance (MN Read chart and REX test chart), a 42 item quality of life questionnaire (National Eye Institute Refractive Quality of Life questionnaire, NEI RQL- 42) and a similar 14 items questionnaire (VF 14) were determined. Results: Significant improvement after surgery in uncorrected (for MIOLs) and corrected distance and near visual acuity (for standar monofocal IOLs) was observed in both groups (p< 0. 05). The mean reading acuity with correction in the monofocal group was better than the multifocal groups without correction. In the latter, under mesopic light conditions, the Tecnis ZMA 00 reached better performances in terms of reading ability and contrast sensitivity than the two Acrysof MIOLs. The quality of life index related to uncorrected reading ability significantly improved n the MIOLs group compared to standard IOLs. The NEI-RLQ 42 and the VF- 14 questionnaires results indicated a better quality of life with multifocal IOLs. Conclusions: Overall satisfaction and spectacle independance were comparable in all MIOLs groups The improved reading performance in MIOLs groups had a positive effect on the patients quality of life postoperatively.
