40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a class of}} rings in which every nilpotent element <b>is</b> <b>central.</b> This class of rings generalizes so-called reduced rings. A ring R <b>is</b> called <b>central</b> reduced if every nilpotent element of R <b>is</b> <b>central.</b> For a ring R, we prove that R <b>is</b> <b>central</b> reduced {{if and only if}} R[x_ 1,x_ 2, [...] .,x_n] <b>is</b> <b>central</b> reduced if and only if R[[x_ 1,x_ 2, [...] .,x_n]] <b>is</b> <b>central</b> reduced if and only if R[x_ 1,x_ 1 ^- 1,x_ 2,x_ 2 ^- 1, [...] .,x_n,x_n^- 1] <b>is</b> <b>central</b> reduced. Moreover, if R <b>is</b> a <b>central</b> reduced ring, then the trivial extension T(R,R) <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} central Armendariz rings which are a generalization of Armendariz rings and investigate their properties. We show that the class of central Armendariz rings lies strictly between classes of Armendariz rings and abelian rings. For a ring R, we prove that R <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz {{if and only if}} the polynomial ring R[x] <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz if and only if the Laurent polynomial ring R[x; xn] <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz. Moreover, it is proven that if R is reduced, then R[x]=(xn) <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz, the converse holds if R is semiprime, where (xn) is the ideal generated by xn and n 2. Among others we also show that R is a reduced ring if and only if the matrix ring Tn- 2 n (R) <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz, for a natural number n 3 and k = [n= 2]...|$|R

5|$|Female {{friendship}}s <b>are</b> <b>central</b> {{to both of}} Wollstonecraft's novels, but it is {{the friendship}} between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman {{is one of the first}} moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.|$|E
5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, <b>are</b> <b>central</b> to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{proposals}} {{were made to}} remedy this problem, and in 1865, the mayor of Brussels, Jules Anspach, selected a design by architect Léon Suys to cover the river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings. The project faced fierce opposition and controversy, mostly due to its cost {{and the need for}} expropriation and demolition of working-class neighbourhoods. The construction was contracted to a British company, but control was returned to the government following an embezzlement scandal. This delayed the project, but it was still completed in 1871. Its completion allowed the construction of the modern buildings and boulevards which <b>are</b> <b>central</b> to downtown Brussels today.|$|E

5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered social norms <b>are</b> <b>central</b> to understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain {{to suggest that}} women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E
5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining {{words and phrases}} to make clauses and sentences. Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology <b>are</b> <b>central</b> to Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order). Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and word order frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as topic and focus.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} {{origin of}} the onion is uncertain because the wild onion is extinct and ancient records of using onions span western and eastern Asia. The first cultivated, farmed onions {{are the subject of}} much debate, but the two regions that many archaeologists, botanists, and food historians will point to <b>are</b> <b>central</b> Asia or Persia. They were probably simultaneously domesticated by peoples all over the world, as there are species of the onion found the world over. Food uses of onions date back thousands of years in China, Egypt and Persia.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose {{a higher}} risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells <b>are</b> <b>central</b> to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– <b>are</b> <b>central</b> to RNA interference. RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs {{can bind to}} other specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein. RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{administration}} {{in the second and}} third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy <b>are</b> <b>central</b> nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E

5|$|Allegorical stories <b>are</b> <b>central</b> to {{the poetic}} diction of many cultures, and were {{prominent}} in the West during classical times, the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aesop's Fables, repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 B.C., are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages. Other notables examples include the Roman de la Rose, a 13th-century French poem, William Langland's Piers Ploughman in the 14th century, and Jean de la Fontaine's Fables (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons <b>are</b> <b>central</b> to combat. They are {{acquired by the}} player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons can be stored in Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E
5|$|Croatia is {{traditionally}} divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders {{are not always}} clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognizable ones throughout the country <b>are</b> <b>Central</b> Croatia (also described as the Zagreb macro-region), Eastern Croatia (largely corresponding with Slavonia), and Mountainous Croatia (Lika and Gorski Kotar; {{to the west of}} Central Croatia). These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern littoral, between the general area of the city of Zadar and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the Croatian Littoral and Istria. The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions, and all of them encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.|$|E
