40|$|Errorless {{learning}} (EL) is {{a principle}} {{used to teach}} new information or skills to people with cognitive impairment. In people with dementia, EL principles have mostly been studied in laboratory tasks that have little practical relevance for the participants concerned, yet show positive effects. This is the first paper to exclusively review the literature concerning the effects of EL {{on the performance of}} useful everyday tasks in people with dementia. The role of factors such as type of dementia, <b>type</b> of <b>task,</b> <b>training</b> intensity, EL elements, outcome measures, quality of experimental design, and follow-up are discussed. The results indicate that, compared with errorful learning (EF) or no treatment, EL is more effective in teaching adults with dementia a variety of meaningful daily tasks or skills, with gains being generally maintained at follow-up. The effectiveness of EL is highly relevant for clinical practice because it shows that individuals with dementia are still able to acquire meaningful skills and engage in worthwhile activities, which may potentially increase their autonomy and independence, and ultimately their quality of life, as well as reduce caregiver burden and professional dependency. Suggestions for future research are given, along with recommendations for effective EL-based training programs, with the aim of developing a clinical manual for professionals working in dementia care...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a method of {{attention}} bias training, considering in particular its efficacy and usability in several mental disorders. The results of current meta-analyses and selected experiments indicate possible efficacy of training in case of some anxiety disorders (generalised anxiety disorder and social phobia), particularly in young individuals. Its efficacy in other previously tested disorders such as depression and addictions seems questionable. We analysed moderators of training efficacy considered in previous studies: subjects" age, <b>type</b> of <b>training</b> <b>task,</b> <b>type</b> and location of emotional stimuli, duration of training, awareness of test objective and place of testing (research laboratory or subjects" homes). It seems that greater efficacy of attention bias {{can be achieved by}} conducting longer trainings, located in a laboratory, rather than in-house, and using verbal rather than visual stimuli. It is not clear whether participants should be informed of the training objective or whether arranging stimuli vertically is more efficient than horizontally...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} held among {{cognitive}} aging researchers that older adults {{are at a}} disadvantage {{with respect to the}} division of attention between two or more concurrent tasks. Some researchers have attributed dual-task performance decrements to reduced processing speed with age while others have attributed declines in dual-task performance to the reduced efficiency of task coordination and control processes. Few researchers, however, have considered the possibility that age-related differences in dual-task performance may be related to underlying differences in the learning mechanisms supporting component task performance. Three studies were conducted which differed in the type of single-task training provided to young and old adult participants: Consistently mapped (CM), variably mapped (VM) and attenuated priority (AP) training. Skilled dual-task performance was then assessed as a function of both component task learning and age through a) the examination of initial and end-level skilled dual-task performance, b) transfer of learning to novel task combination and c) retention capability. It was predicted that <b>type</b> of component <b>task</b> <b>training</b> would moderate age-related differences in skilled dual-task performance. The results were confirmatory, however, were not completely consistent with initial predictions. Ph. D. Committee Member: unknow...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} demonstrations of air supremacy by the Western Allies over Europe occurred in early 1944, when Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle, who took command of the US 8th Air Force in January 1944, would only a few months later [...] "release" [...] the building force of P-51 Mustangs from their intended mission to closely escort the 8th Air Force's heavy bombers, after getting help from British aviators in selecting the best available <b>aircraft</b> <b>type(s)</b> for the <b>task.</b> The USAAF's Mustang squadrons were now tasked to fly well ahead of the bombers' combat box defensive formations by some 75-100 miles (120-160 km) to basically clear the skies, {{in the manner of a}} sizable [...] "fighter sweep" [...] air supremacy mission, of any defensive presence over the Third Reich of the Luftwaffe's Jagdgeschwader single-seat fighter wings. This important change of strategy also coincidentally doomed both the twin-engined Zerstörer heavy fighters and their replacement, heavily armed Focke-Wulf Fw 190A Sturmbock forces used as bomber destroyers, each in their turn. This change in American fighter tactics began to have its most immediate effect with the loss of more and more of the Luftwaffe's Jagdflieger fighter pilot personnel, and fewer bomber losses to the Luftwaffe as 1944 wore on.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Whereas {{research}} on usability predominantly employs universal {{definitions of the}} aspects that comprise usability, people experience their use of information systems through personal constructs. Based on 48 repertory-grid interviews, this study investigates how such personal constructs are affected by two factors crucial to the international development and uptake of information systems: cultural background (Chinese, Danish, or Indian) and stakeholder group (developer or user). We find that for the user group frustrating and useful systems are experienced similarly, whereas for the developers frustrating systems are experienced similarly to easy-to-use systems. Looking at the most characteristic construct for each participant we find that Chinese participants use constructs related to security, <b>task</b> <b>types,</b> <b>training,</b> and system issues, whereas Danish {{and to some extent}} Indian participants make more use of constructs traditionally associated with usability (e. g., easy-to-use, intuitive, and liked). Further analysis of the data is ongoing. Keywords: Cultural usability, Usage experiences, Repertory-grid technique. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study how}} {{processing}} states alternate during information search tasks. Inference {{is carried out}} with a discriminative hidden Markov model (dHMM) learned from eye movement data, measured in an experiment consisting of three task types: (i) simple word search, (ii) finding a sentence that answers a question and (iii) choosing a subjectively most interesting title {{from a list of}} ten titles. The results show that eye movements contain necessary information for determining the <b>task</b> <b>type.</b> After <b>training,</b> the dHMM predicted the task for test data with 60. 2 % accuracy (pure chance 33. 3 %). Word search and subjective interest conditions were easier to predict than the question-answer condition. The dHMM that best fitted our data segmented each <b>task</b> <b>type</b> into three hidden states. The three processing states were identified by comparing the parameters of the dHMM states to literature on eye movement research. A scanning type of eye behavior was observed {{in the beginning of the}} tasks. Next, participants tended to shift to states reflecting reading type of eye movements, and finally they ended the tasks in states which we termed as the decision states. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.
