40|$|How is the {{conflict}} between a protection of <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights</b> and economic, political and social interests in reforming the pension scheme resolved in different countries and regarding different kinds of pension schemes? What legal or political mechanisms exist to protect <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights</b> and to resolve this conflict? This thesis takes a comprehensive view on the pension situation of the individual, thus dealing both with statutory and occupational pension schemes from a protection of accrued rights-perspective. The research provides an extensive survey of legal {{as well as political}} solutions to the protection of <b>accrued</b> <b>rights</b> and its conflict with different interests to reform the pension schemes in the respective countries under investigation as well as under the European Convention of Human Rights. The thesis has two main parts. The first part deals with statutory pensions and the focus in this part is on constitutional law and the legal institutions of property and legitimate expectations. The second part dealing with occupational and company pension schemes concentrates on contractual protection but the concept of legitimate expectations is of great importance also in this part. The in depth survey and analysis of the protection of <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights</b> carried out in the two first parts of the thesis form an important and substantial part of the purpose with this research. In the third part of the thesis however the results of the first two parts are levitated to a more abstract level. The different solutions to {{the conflict}} between the interests to protect and the interests to reform are analysed in their societal and normative contexts. The public and constitutional law protections are compared with the private law protections in order to illustrate the difficulty in upholding the strict division between private law and public law in present society. By dissolving this division, solutions to {{the conflict between}} a protection of <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights</b> and different interests to reform the pension schemes can be resolved {{on the basis of the}} actual content of these schemes instead of according to the legal dogmatic sys- tematisation of law...|$|R

It is restrictively interpreted, because it limits {{the principle of}} freedom of contract. Cancellation of the contract and certain forms of waiver of rights (e.g. waiver of an <b>accrued</b> <b>right</b> arising from a breach of contract, datio in solutum, release of the debtor, and a pactum de non petendo) do not amount to variations. A non-variation clause is not enforced where its enforcement is against public policy or where estoppel can be raised.

Our main metric for these analysis is the notion of accrued to date pension rights, i. e. the pensions rights that would be due if the system were shut down today and all <b>accrued</b> <b>rights</b> under current legislation were honoured. Our analysis illustrates that partial reforms have limited effects, both in distributional and in fiscal terms. To achieve more substantial effects, a more comprehensive approach is needed.

40|$|Insight {{into the}} level and nature of taxes and social {{insurance}} contributions may be important for the perception of citizens about the costs of public provisions and – associated with this – for their behavioral responses. From the theoretical literature on tax illusion and from several empirical studies we conclude that when a clear relation is experienced between the payment of social contributions and <b>accrued</b> <b>rights,</b> employees perceive contributions more as prices than as taxes. Because of this these contributions will have fewer distorting effects on the labor market than general taxes. Reforms of social insurance programs that strengthen buildup elements, for instance through the introduction of social saving accounts, would therefore have favorable labor market effects.

3000|$|A {{key reason}} why {{inactivity}} is appealing in our benchmark scenario {{is because the}} individual pension value typically increases while the worker remains unemployed. This {{is a result of}} the automatic reduction in the early retirement penalties as retirement is delayed. In contrast, the value of the <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights</b> tends to diminish, but the former effect is typically greater. As a result, severing this link is a direct way of preventing voluntary inactivity. This can be achieved in a straightforward manner by making the early retirement penalty dependant on the age when the worker stops paying social contributions (rather than on the age when the individual claims the pension benefit for the first time, as is currently the case). This reform amounts to changing the replacement rate μ(a) in eq. (1) to μ(a−h). Let us consider, for example, somebody made redundant the day before his/her 60 th birthday. If ŵ_ 60 represents the value of their <b>accrued</b> pension <b>rights,</b> an immediate retirement would result in a pension benefit of 0.65 × ŵ_ 60. Delaying retirement by one year increases this value to 0.72 × ŵ_ 61. In contrast, under the new system the incentive to remain inactive while collecting unemployment benefits disappears: after one year, the pension replacement rate will still be 65 [...]...|$|R
