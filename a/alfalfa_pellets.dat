40|$|This article {{presents}} a comprehensive summary of research {{performed in the}} area of postharvest fractionation and processing of alfalfa crop. The aim was to develop alfalfa products that could cater to diverse demands of the market as well as improve their quality. A novel process of fractionation (separation of leaves and stems) was explored to improve dehydrated and sun-cured <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellet</b> and cube quality. Fractionation and dehydration of alfalfa was achieved by modifying a small-scale industrial three-pass rotary drum dryer. Fractionated leaves and stems were later combined in different proportions and densified to form pellets and cubes. Various physical characteristics such as density, hardness, durability and colour of pellets and cubes were determined. Regression equations were derived by considering these physical characteristics as dependent variables, while leaf content, grind size (for pellets), chop pre-heat temperature (for cubes), moisture content, applied pressure, die temperature and holding time were the independent variables. Studies were also conducted to determine volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during industrial drying of alfalfa crops as a function of drying temperature, time and specific plant fractions (leaf, stem or flower) ...|$|R

50|$|This yellow-footed {{tortoise}} eats {{many kinds}} of foliage. They are too slow to capture any fast animals. In the wild, their diets consist of grasses, fallen fruit, carrion, plants, bones, mushrooms, excrement, and slow-moving invertebrates such as snails, worms, and others {{they are able to}} capture. In captivity, they are fed oranges, apples, melons, endive, collard greens, dandelions, plantain, ribwort, clover, shredded carrots, insects, worms, cuttlebone, tortoise vitamins, edible flowers, and <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellets.</b> Each yellow-footed tortoise in the wild reaches the age of maturity at about 8-10 years. The fecundity of a female generally depends on her size; the bigger they are, the more eggs they can produce. On average, a female will create about six to 16 eggs per year, although some female individuals may not reproduce each year. The eggs have brittle shells and are elongated to spherical, about 3-6 cm in diameter. The egg size will increase with the body size of the tortoise. The young are self-sufficient from birth. The yellow-footed tortoise can live around 50-60 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a sheep model to {{investigate}} reproduction, transmission, and shedding of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in ruminants. In addition, we investigated the effect of diet change on these parameters. Six groups of twin lambs given oral inoculations of 10 (5) or 10 (9) CFU of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and their nondosed mothers were monitored for colonization by culture of fecal samples. A modified selective-enrichment protocol that detected E. coli O 157 :H 7 at levels as low as 0. 06 CFU per g of ovine feces was developed. Horizontal transmission of infection occurred between the lambs and most of the nondosed mothers. When animals were kept in confinement and given <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellet</b> feed, lambs receiving the higher dose shed the bacteria sooner and longer than all other animals. However, when the animals were released onto a sagebrush-bunchgrass range, every animal, regardless of its previous status (dosed at one of the inoculum levels tested or nondosed) shed E. coli O 157 :H 7 uniformly. Shedding persisted for 15 days, after which all animals tested negative. E. coli O 157 :H 7 reproduction and transmission and the combined effect of diet change and feed withholding were also investigated in a pilot study with experimentally inoculated rams. Withholding feed induced animals to shed the bacteria either by triggering growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7 present in the intestines or by increasing susceptibility to infection. Introduction of a dietary change with brief starvation caused uniform shedding and clearance of E. coli O 157 :H 7, and all animals then tested negative for the bacteria.

5000|$|Tagasaste or Tree Lucerne is used {{extensively}} by small scale Dairy farmers in East Africa, {{for its ability}} to enable commercial milk production levels on a small plot of land planted with a living fence of self replacing Tree Lucerne. It is seen as a low cost self grown alternative to Diary meal and <b>Alfalfa</b> <b>pellets.</b> Treelucerne is used as a boundary fence and hedgerow, acting as a windbreak aimed at stopping fire, wind and yielding privacy, fodder as well as firewood. Branches are typically lopped off by hand, and fed to grazing animals that may typically include 1-3 goats (milk and meat), half a dozen chickens (eggs), 1-2 calves (feedlot fattening) and 1-2 Dairy cows, all on one hectare of land. The Tree Lucerne may be used to fence the property and the house, with the cash crop grown between alleys of Tree Lucerne. Tree Lucerne is thus {{used extensively}} for purposes of biological fertilisation and soil improvement utilizing the alley crop method whereby vegetables, as well as cash crops such as tobacco and maize are planted in the interrow from year 3 onwards. As {{one of the fastest growing}} trees in East Africa the need for firewood for own consumption is a major driver for uptake, with the fodder and fence ability of secondary value. This is now changing due to the discovery that Tree Lucerne can fix up to 587 kg of Nitrogen per hectare per year, roughly half below ground by nitrogen fixation and roughly half when the plant is kept in a permanent juvenile state by lopping off alley crop branches at waist level and using it either as livestock feed (with manure then added as fertilizer and a nitrogen pathway) or with the branches put on top of the soil and covered with soil as a [...] "green manure". Over time substantial increases in crop yields have been achieved this way, in the order of raising 1 ton of Maize production to 8-10 tons, and 700 kg of Burley Tobacco to 3-3.5 tons, per hectare, per year. The level of Biological fertilisation achieved by Tree Lucerne is at the top end of that found in the legume family, and typically consist of about 30-50 grams of Nitrogen per meter of row. The use of Tree Lucerne for Terra Preta purposes was pioneered in Central East Africa on Oxisoil.|$|E

For an hour each morning, lambs were offered their ration(s) and intakes were measured. Lambs were maintained on an <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellet</b> or grass hay diet. Each trial lasted either five or six days. Whether or not lambs ate more when offered foods with different toxins depended on the kind and amount of toxin in the food.

Each period lasted 20 days. Fat supplements, except HESA, consistently decreased the in vitro DM disappearance of soybean meal as compared to control. In contrast to the effect of other treatments, crude protein degradation was greatest in the test tubes with inocula obtained from sheep fed diet with HESA. Fat supplements equally inhibited the DM and fibre breakdown of <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellet.</b> CS and HESA seemed to be less detrimental to in vitro fermentation of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) than BSA and SO.

40|$|Conditioning is an {{intermediate}} process in <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pelleting</b> {{designed to make}} alfalfa grind easier to bind. It {{is an important step}} because the quality of final pellets depends to a great extent {{on the quality of the}} conditioned mash. The mash pliability is in turn dictated by the fundamental characteristics of alfalfa grind such as its morphological attributes, thermal properties, rate of moisture diffusion, and equilibrium moisture relationship. There has so far been a lack of research pertinent to these characteristics imperative to the improvement of mash quality. This study was conceived for such a need, in which physical, morphological, thermal, moisture diffusion, and moisture equilibrium characteristics of alfalfa grind were scrutinized. The physical properties studied were the density of alfalfa grind as affected by particle size and moisture content, particle size distribution, and particle characterization. Models were developed to correlate the bulk and the solid densities to moisture content and particle size. The surface area of alfalfa grind particles based on sieving tests was much lower than that measured by nitrogen sorption. The difference was attributed to the pores, cracks and fissures in the particles that could trap nitrogen. The thermal properties in this study included specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and thermal diffusivity. The specific heat capacity of the alfalfa grind was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. A multiple regression model was developed to correlate the specific heat, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of alfalfa grind to moisture content and temperature. Moisture diffusion characteristics of alfalfa grind were studied in terms of moisture diffusivity. Based on the thin-layer kinetics, moisture diffusivity of whole dehy alfalfa grind was 3. 0310 - 8 m 2 /s. There was a significant difference in moisture diffusivity between the dehy and the sun-cured alfalfa grinds (α= 0. 05). From the "ring stack" diffusion tests, a mean diffusivity of 8. 5510 - 8 m 2 /s resulted for the whole dehy grind. It was found that the relationship between the moisture diffusivity of alfalfa grind and particle undersize could be best described by the Gaussian function. Moisture equilibrium characteristics of alfalfa grind included moisture sorption isotherms and hysteresis behavior. A hypothesis was proposed to account for the origin of sorption hysteresis. Based on the hypothesis, a mathematical model was developed to quantify the magnitude of the hysteresis loops. The applicability of the developed model has been verified by the hysteresis data of alfalfa grind. Pilot-scale steam conditioning tests of alfalfa grind have been conducted in this study. Semi-empirical models have beendeveloped for describing the meal tempersture and moisture content trends in a steam conditioner. The goodness-of-fit of the models was verified with the pilot-scale steam conditioning test results...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} of the independent effects of plant physical and chemical characteristics on foraging, but little {{has been done to}} determine how these traits interact to affect food selection. We determined if the nutritional state of lambs (Ovis aries) affected intake behavior and preference for foods with different ratios of protein/energy (alfalfa: high proportion protein/energy; barley: high proportion energy/protein), presented in different physical forms (whole or ground). Changes in nutritional state were induced by altering the nutritional composition of the basal diet (high [Ep] or low [eP] proportion of energy/protein). We determined preference for barley and alfalfa (whole or ground) when lambs were fed (1) a nutritionally balanced diet with a 15 -h (overnight) fast (Period 1), (2) an unbalanced diet (Ep or eP) with a 15 -h (overnight) fast (Period 2), and (3) an unbalanced diet without a fast (Period 3). Averaged across the three periods, all lambs preferred barley to alfalfa (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), and they spent more time feeding on barley than alfalfa (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Lambs also preferred whole to ground foods (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Nevertheless, the basal diet strongly affected preference for barley and alfalfa. During Period 2, lambs fed basal diet Ep ate less barley (142 vs. 232 g) and more alfalfa (71 vs. 9 g) than lambs fed basal diet eP (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), especially when <b>alfalfa</b> was <b>pelleted</b> and barley was ground or rolled. Lambs fed basal diet eP strongly preferred barley to alfalfa, even if barley was ground and <b>alfalfa</b> was <b>pelleted.</b> These differences were even more pronounced after a meal of basal diet Ep or basal diet eP in Period 3. Lambs fed basal diet Ep consumed less energy during preference tests than lambs fed basal diet eP (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Lambs fed the two unbalanced basal diets consumed similar amounts of protein during preference tests (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). These differences in intake of energy and protein by lambs fed the unbalanced diets led to a steady increase in the ratio of protein/energy selected by lambs fed the balanced basal diet and diet Ep during Periods 1, 2, and 3 (7. 9, 11. 7, 13. 9 g CP/MJ), and a constant ratio of protein/energy selected by lambs fed the balanced basal diet and diet eP during Periods 1, 2, and 3 (7. 6, 8. 1, 8. 1 g CP/MJ; P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Thus, lambs fed basal diet Ep selected barley and alfalfa in a way that achieved a higher ratio of protein/energy in their diet than lambs fed basal diet eP (12. 7 vs. 8. 2 g CP/MJ DE, P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Collectively, these results suggest that food structure and biochemical composition interacted with a lamb 2 ̆ 7 s nutritional state to determine preference. When a lamb 2 ̆ 7 s need for a particular macronutrient was high, a food 2 ̆ 7 s biochemical composition was more important than its structure in determining preference...|$|R

In 2009, there was no beneficial effect of any amendment on yield and nutrient uptake of pea, most likely due to fixation of N which is the most limiting nutrient in these soils. Intercropping of wheat or barley with pea produced greater seed yield and nutrient uptake per unit land area basis compared to wheat or barley grown as sole crops in most cases. In conclusion, our results suggest potential benefits in improving yield and nutrient uptake of wheat and barley from compost, <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellets</b> and possibly wood ash, most likely by preventing deficiencies of some nutrients, especially N, lacking in these soils under organic farming. Our findings also suggest the need for future research to determine the feasibility of rock phosphate, Penicillium bilaiae, MykePro, gypsum or other amendments in preventing P and/or S deficiency in organic crops using soils extremely deficient in these nutrients...|$|E
40|$|Previous work at {{this station}} (Circular 297. p. 45 - 47) {{and at the}} Fort Hays Branch Experiment Station (Circular 322, p. 1 - 6) {{indicates}} that beef calves wintered on a daily ration of 1. 75 - 2 pounds of ground sorghum grain, 1. 25 - 2 pounds of protein concentrate and wheat straw fed free-choice made average daily gains of only. 3 to. 6 pound. One pound of molasses substituted for 1 pound of grain and sprinkled on wheat straw increased consumption only. 22 pound per head dally but decreased gains. 08 pound per head dally. Also 1 pound of molasses had slightly less feeding value than 1 pound of grain in a wintering ration for steer calves with wheat straw roughage. The addition of 1 pound of dehydrated <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellets</b> increased the rate of gain and feed efficiency. Calves receiving dehydrated <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellets</b> also consumed more straw...|$|E
40|$|We studied how moving lambs to an {{unfamiliar}} environment affected their intake of novel and familiar foods. In the first experiment, half the lambs (n = 14) were conditioned {{to avoid a}} novel food (wheat) by pairing its ingestion with lithium chloride (LiCl); the other half (n = 14) received wheat but no LiCl. Half of the lambs that received LiCl and half that did not were moved to a location unfamiliar to the lambs. Lambs at both locations were offered wheat (familiar but aversive to half the lambs), oats (novel food), and <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellets</b> (familiar food). In the second experiment, one group of lambs (n = 16) remained at the familiar location; the other group (n = 16) was moved to a novel location. Both groups were offered <b>alfalfa</b> <b>pellets</b> (familiar food) with or without onion powder (novel flavor), wheat bran (novel food), and rye with 1...|$|E
40|$|Four {{previous}} tests (Kans. Agri. Expt. Sta. Bull. 507 : 7, 1967) at Colby, Garden City, Manhattan, and Mound Valley, using beef steers {{from the}} same herd and feeding the same feedstuffs, grown locally, produced differences in performance. What is the cause(s) of the differences? This test was designed as previous ones, except that all locations used the same feed, which was produced at Garden City. Sorghum silage was dehydrated and pelleted for easier transportation. The calves were wintered on the silage <b>pellets</b> and <b>alfalfa</b> hay. Silage <b>pellets</b> were gradually removed from the ration and sorghum grain added for finishing. Analyses of the feedstuffs {{are shown in table}} 12. Feedlot performance and carcass data are shown in table 13. Results were more nearly uniform than for any previous year. The test is being repeated. An Atomic Absorption Spectrometer has been obtained and a complete mineral analysis of feedstuffs and water from each location is planned...|$|R
40|$|Eight ruminally {{cannulated}} crossbred steers (1225 lb) {{were used}} to investigate the effects of 5 vs 10 % <b>alfalfa</b> hay or <b>pellets</b> on rumen characteristics during subacute acidosis. Alfalfa hay was obtained from one source, and alternate bales were either chopped (3 - to 4 -inch length) or ground and pelleted (3 / 8 -inch pellet). Intake during the recovery period after feed challenges tended (P=. 12) to be greater for diets containing 10 % alfalfa. Duration of rumen pH below 5. 5 was less for diets with chopped vs pelleted (P<. 10) or 10 vs 5 % (P<. 05) alfalfa. Total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations during the challenge ph ase and for the overall experimental period were increased (P<. 05) when steers were fed 5 vs 10 % alfalfa diets but were similar during the baseline and recovery periods. The higher pH and lower VFA concentration resulting from feeding 10 % alfalfa diets suggest that steers fed a moderate amount of roughage can withstand greater fluctuations in intake without developing acidosis...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 30 rabbits, bearing to 4 {{experimental}} goups were slaughtered then sectioned; {{after a period}} of deep freezing, the same cut was boiled or roasted. Roasted-meat, boiled -meat and boiling-water-extract was tested by a panel of 9 different aged-judges. Experimental thesis were: M, control, fed commercial diet alone; P, fed commercial diet + pelletted alfalfa-hay; PI, fed commercial diet + <b>pelletted</b> <b>alfalfa</b> -hay with vitamin-mineral premix; F, fed commercial pellet + alfalfa-hay cut 8 - 10 cm long. Every judge had to discover differences between each couple of sampl e of meat or water-extract in the orthogonal tests with the hidden controls. Results showed that ability to particularize samples depends on individual competence; no relatioship was detected between judges'age and ability; replicate- effect (timr of judgement) was highly significant, rabbits fed with the cut hay added to the commercial pellet were different from the others groups in higher percentage but, statistical differences were reached only between thesis Fvs M in roasted meat, and F vs P in boiled meat. The absence of difference between Pi, P and M suggested that the observed alfalfa effect gained subsistence only if the hay is not milled then pelletted...|$|R
