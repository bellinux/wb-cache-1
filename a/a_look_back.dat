500|$|David Van Reybrouck {{praised the}} speech as [...] "memorable", but {{argued that it}} damaged Lumumba's own legacy. Since Lumumba and his party {{represented}} {{only a third of}} Congolese popular opinion, Van Reybrouck accused Lumumba's claim to speak for all Congolese people [...] "divisive" [...] and questioned whether it was appropriate given the context: [...] "Lumumba's address contained more of <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> than a look forward, more rage and hope, more rancour than magnanimity, and therefore more rebellion than statesmanship". He also compared it to the Communist Julien Lahaut's republican heckling of Baudouin's corronation in 1950. Like Lumumba, Lahaut was subsequently murdered after he had [...] "claimed all the attention" [...] at the public event.|$|E

UK-based magazine Retro Gamer, in <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> to video gaming in January1989, made a similar comparison of the game to Rastan, [...] "with a lot of sword slashing and platform jumping".

500|$|Retro Gamer took <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at Ninja Gaiden in its March 2004 issue, in {{the midst}} of the release of the 2004 Xbox remake. They said that the game broke the mold of {{conventional}} video game titles by including a plot with cinematic cutscenes added between gameplay segments. They added that the concept of adding cinematics for a game's introduction, plot, and ending was a new concept which [...] "naturally impressed the gaming public". They noted the game's high difficulty level, saying that the game [...] "threw up an immense challenge even for the veteran gamer, and almost dared you to complete it mentally and physically intact". Chris Kohler, in his 2004 book , said, while it wasn't as far-reaching as Tecmo Bowl, [...] "it ended up revolutionizing video games with its courageous, unique, and trailblazing use of cinema scenes".|$|E

Players who own Final Fantasy XIII save data can unlock an additional wallpaper (PS3) or gamer picture (Xbox 360) for the save file. DLC released after the game contained additional weapons, costumes, and monsters. Post-release downloads also included [...] "Final Fantasy XIII Lost Report", which offers <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at Final Fantasy XIIIs story through the perspective of non-playable characters from the game, and three downloadable scenarios for other characters: [...] "Perpetual Battlefield", which reveals Snow's fate; [...] "Heads or Tails", which shows how Sazh came to 500 AF Academia; and [...] "Requiem of the Goddess", which shows Lightning's struggle against Caius and explains how she became crystallized in the main story's ending.|$|E
500|$|R.C. Pro-Am has {{appeared}} many times on various [...] "best games" [...] lists over the years. A {{survey conducted by}} GamePro in 1990 ranked the game as the 10th-best sports video game at that time. Game Informer put the game at number 84 on its [...] "Top100 Games of All Time" [...] list in August2001. Paste magazine placed it as the 8th greatest NES game ever, {{saying that it is}} [...] "way more fun than real remote-control cars, which never seemed to be equipped with missile capabilities". IGN listed the game as the 13th-best NES game of all time, citing its popularity amongst players as well as good sales. Executive Editor Craig Harris said {{that it was one of}} the first games to introduce the concept of vehicular combat, inspiring other titles such as Super R.C. Pro-Am, R.C. Pro-AmII, and the Mario Kart series. 1UP.com listed it as the 14th best NES title, citing the game's good graphics and gameplay elements, though it said that the difficulty level was too high. As with other retrospectives, the website staff listed the game as inspiration for future series such as Super Off Road and Rock n' Roll Racing.

Pro-Am as one of Rare's best games, calling the release [...] "one of Rare's finest moments". The NES version of R.C. Pro-Am is one of the 30 games selected for the upcoming Xbox One compilation Rare Replay.|$|E
