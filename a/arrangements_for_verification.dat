40|$|Addressing Britain's National Farmers' Union, Commissioner Fischler {{highlighted}} how 90 % of EU citizens believe ensuring {{food safety}} and food hygiene is an important function of agricultural policy. It is against this background that the EU has been adopting 'a range of measures to make legislation even stricter'. However, Commissioner Fischler highlighted the need for EU member states to ensure the new regulations were strictly enforced. Comment: In the short term, ACP exporters of food products will need to invest not only in meeting EU regulatory standards but also in ensuring that the administrative <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>verification</b> of compliance are efficient and comprehensive if new obstacles to ACP trade are not to emerge. In the medium term, ACP governments will need to launch {{a dialogue with the}} EU on how EU food safety concerns can be addressed without placing an undue economic burden on small scale ACP exporters, given the high fixed costs which compliance with SPS standards can impose.

40|$|A {{spatially}} multiplexed autostereoscopic 3 D display {{design with}} a strip barrier consisting of RGB-color filters is presented. The wavelength selective filter barrier emits {{the light from}} a display area larger than that of common autostereoscopic barrier displays. However, such construction is still used rather rarely. The time sequential operation mode is a supplemental option. Wavelength selective filter barrier arrangements exhibit characteristics different from common barrier displays with similar barrier pitch and ascent. In particular these constructions show strong angular luminance dependency under barrier inclination specified by correspondent slant angle. In time sequential implementation {{it is important to}} avoid that quick eye or eyelid movement lead to visible color artifacts. Those circumstances limit the possibility to find well working and usable display designs superior to usual barrier displays. The newly introduced design is usable as a multi user display as well as a single user system with user adaptive control. In case of tracked single user mode the adaption in x-z-direction is continuously. The design has been modelled with simulation software developed for that purpose. The modelling of wavelength-selective barriers was used to calculate the light ray distribution properties of that <b>arrangement.</b> <b>For</b> the experimental <b>verification</b> of the image separation and evaluation of image quality, commercially available display components were combined for a display demonstrator...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} {{significant}} progress in automated verification techniques based on model checking. However, scalable software model checking remains a challenging problem. We believe that this problem can be addressed using a design <b>for</b> <b>verification</b> approach based on design patterns that facilitate scalable automated verification. We have been investigating a design <b>for</b> <b>verification</b> approach based on the following principles: 1) use of stateful, behavioral interfaces which isolate the behavior and enable modular verification, 2) an assume-guarantee style verification strategy which separates verification of the behavior from the verification of the conformance to the interface specifications, 3) a general model checking technique <b>for</b> interface <b>verification,</b> and 4) domain specific and specialized <b>verification</b> techniques <b>for</b> behavior <b>verification.</b> So far we have applied this approach to verification of synchronization operations in concurrent programs and to verification of interactions among multiple peers in composite web services. The case studies we conducted indicate that scalable software verification is achievable in these application domains using our design <b>for</b> <b>verification</b> approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) are {{developing}} a Laser-Based Item Monitoring System (LBIMS) for advanced safeguards at nuclear facilities. LBIMS uses a low-power laser transceiver to monitor the presence and position of items with retroreflective tags. The primary advantages of LBIMS are its scalability to continuously monitor {{a wide range of}} items, its ability to operate unattended, its low cost of implementation, and its inherent information security due to its line-of-sight and non-broadcasting operation. The primary proposed safeguard application of LBIMS is described in its name: item monitoring. LBIMS could be implemented in a storage area to continuously monitor containers of nuclear material and the area in which they are stored. The system could be configured to provide off-site notification if any of the containers are moved or removed or if the area is accessed. Individual tags would be used to monitor storage containers, and additional tags could be used to record information regarding secondary storage units and room access. The capability to register small changes in tag position opens up the possibility of several other uses. These include continuously monitoring piping <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> design information <b>verification</b> or recording equipment positions for other safeguards systems, such as tracking the opening and closing of autoclaves as part of a cylinder tracking system or opening and closing valves on a sample or product take-off line. Combined with attribute tags, which transmit information from any kind of sensor by modulating the laser signal, LBIMS provides the capability to wirelessly and securely collect safeguards data, even in areas where radio-frequency or other wireless communication methods are not practicable. Four application types are described in this report: static item monitoring, in-process item monitoring with trigger tags, multi-layered integration with trigger tags, and line-of-sight data transfer with attribute tags. Field trials for each of these applications are described...|$|R
