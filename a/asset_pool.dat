25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of prepayment varies widely {{with the type of}} underlying <b>asset</b> <b>pool,</b> so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity. The PSA prepayment model is a well-known example.|$|E
25|$|Pass-through {{securities}} {{are issued}} by a trust and allocate the cash {{flows from the}} underlying pool to the securities holders on a pro rata basis. A trust that issues pass-through certificates is taxed under the grantor trust rules of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these rules, the holder of a pass-through certificate is taxed as a direct owner of {{the portion of the}} trust allocatable to the certificate. In order for the issuer to be recognized as a trust for tax purposes, there can be no significant power under the trust agreement to change the composition of the <b>asset</b> <b>pool</b> or otherwise to reinvest payments received, and the trust must have, with limited exceptions, only a single class of ownership interests.|$|E
25|$|For {{repayment}} of the Government loans, {{there was}} a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this <b>asset</b> <b>pool,</b> with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would have paid for a government guarantee for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar gilt-edged stocks. This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders {{to have to find}} their own investors to cover the first £15bn, which proved impossible, due to the credit crunch. The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers' deposits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the unique black markets of <b>asset</b> <b>pooling</b> and leasing services, which exposes {{the nature and}} extent of industry-specific threats. We explore how firms providing such services together with their network structures that constitute the foundations of <b>asset</b> <b>pooling</b> and leasing respond to the threat of black markets. We encapsulate detecting and encountering the threat of black markets through the theoretical lens of agility, which encompasses the elements of sensing and responding (Overby et al. 2006; Roberts and Grover 2012). This novel concept of responding to threats using the agility lens has not been adequately addressed by past studies on enterprise agility. Through a case study of a global <b>asset</b> <b>pooling</b> and leasing company, we reveal the criticality of network structures, the impracticality of IT and inadequate tracking mechanisms that challenge firms in minimizing such threats...|$|R

30|$|Defined as ‘an asset-backed {{security}} {{backed by}} a diversified pool {{of one or more}} classes of debt’ (Lucas et al., 2008 : 395), CDOs were introduced in 1987 in the US (Stefani, 2010). They gained prominence in the twenty-first century, creating a new source of demand for lower-rated ‘tranches’ of securities (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Based on the logic that pooling many bonds together reduces investors’ exposure to the failure of any one bond, and that ‘tranching’ will enable investors to pick their preferred levels of risk and return (Lucas et al., 2008), this innovation involved a complex process of purchasing (of assets to invest in), pooling (to obtain diversification benefits), tranching (to identify their place in the cash-flow waterfall), and selling (to investors) (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Historically, CDOs were composed of <b>asset</b> <b>pools</b> mainly including bank loans, corporate bonds, and emergency bonds. In response to the 1998 liquidity crisis, the composition of <b>asset</b> <b>pools</b> was expanded to include different kinds of securities {{backed by a}}ssets from various sectors (e.g. mortgages, mobile home loans, aircraft leases, and mutual fund fees). In 2002, when these ‘multi-sector’ CDOs performed poorly, the composition of CDO <b>asset</b> <b>pools</b> was reformed, focusing mainly on non-prime, mortgage-backed securities. Innovators argued that CDO managers understood this industry well, and it seemed to have good performance in terms of returns. This was further narrowed to residential mortgage-backed securities and non-agency mortgages (among others), which offered relatively stable collateral but introduced a lot of complexity into the system (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011).|$|R
40|$|We study daily {{money market}} mutual fund flows at the {{individual}} share class level during the crisis of September 2008. The empirical approach that we apply to this fine granularity of data brings new insights into the investor and portfolio holding characteristics that are conducive to run-risk in cash-like <b>asset</b> <b>pools,</b> as well as providing evidence on the time-series dynamics of runs and the equilibria that develop. We propose two identification approaches to test predictions of recent theoretical models with strategic complementarities and incomplete information. First, we study dynamic interactions between investors with differing levels of sophistication within the same money fund, thus holding constant the quality of the underlying portfolio. Second, we employ a novel quantile regression methodology to identify relationships between observable characteristics and tail outcomes. Our results provide considerable support for the theoretical predictions, providing some of the strongest empirical evidence to date on run-like behavior within intermediated <b>asset</b> <b>pools</b> during the financial crisis.

2500|$|Unlike {{conventional}} {{corporate bonds}} which are unsecured, securities created in a securitization are [...] "credit enhanced", meaning their credit quality is increased above {{that of the}} originator's unsecured debt or underlying <b>asset</b> <b>pool.</b> This {{increases the likelihood that}} the investors will receive the cash flows to which they are entitled, and thus enables the securities to have a higher credit rating than the originator. Some securitizations use external credit enhancement provided by third parties, such as surety bonds and parental guarantees (although this may introduce a conflict of interest).|$|E
2500|$|On January 16, 2009, Citigroup {{announced}} {{its intention to}} reorganize itself into two operating units: Citicorp for its retail and institutional client business, and Citi Holdings for its brokerage and asset management. Citigroup will continue to operate as a single company for the time being, but Citi Holdings managers will be tasked to [...] "take advantage of value-enhancing disposition and combination opportunities as they emerge", and eventual spin-offs or mergers involving either operating unit were not ruled out. Citi Holdings consists of Citi businesses that Citi wants to sell and are not considered part of Citi's core businesses. The majority of its assets are U.S. mortgages. It {{was created in the}} wake of the financial crisis as part of Citi's restructuring plan. It consists of several business entities including remaining interests in local consumer lending such as OneMain Financial, divestitures such as Smith Barney, and a special <b>asset</b> <b>pool.</b> Citi Holdings represents $156 billion of GAAP assets, or ~8% of Citigroup; 59% represents North American mortgages, 18% operating businesses, 13% special <b>asset</b> <b>pool,</b> and 10% categorized as other. Operating businesses include OneMain Financial ($10B), PrimeRe ($7B), MSSB JV ($8B) and Spain / Greece retail ($4B), less associated loan loss reserves.

2500|$|The issued {{securities}} {{are often}} split into tranches, or categorized into {{varying degrees of}} subordination. Each tranche has a different level of credit protection or risk exposure: there is generally a senior ("A") class of securities and one or more junior subordinated ("B", [...] "C", etc.) classes that function as protective layers for the [...] "A" [...] class. The senior classes have first claim on the cash that the SPV receives, and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more senior classes have been repaid. Because of the cascading effect between classes, this arrangement {{is often referred to}} as a cash flow waterfall. If the underlying <b>asset</b> <b>pool</b> becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities (e.g. when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims), the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches, and the upper-level tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches. The senior securities might be AAA or AA rated, signifying a lower risk, while the lower-credit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating, signifying a higher risk.|$|E

5000|$|To {{clean up}} after a bank failure, the {{government}} may set up a [...] "bad bank", which is a new government-run asset management corporation that buys individual nonperforming assets from one or more private banks, reducing the proportion of junk bonds in their <b>asset</b> <b>pools,</b> and then acts as the creditor in the insolvency cases that follow.
