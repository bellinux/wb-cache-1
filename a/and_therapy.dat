The Virginia Tech Review Panel report, also released in August 2007, placed this diagnosis in the spring of Cho's eighth-grade year, and his parents sought treatment for him through medication <b>and</b> <b>therapy.</b> In high school, Cho was placed in special education under the 'emotional disturbance' classification. He was excused from oral presentations and participation in class conversation and received 50 minutes a month of speech therapy. He continued receiving mental health therapy as well until his junior year, when Cho rejected further therapy.|$|E

In the next part I do research on coverage of Equine Assisted Activities <b>and</b> <b>Therapies</b> expenses by insurance companies not only in Czech, but also in Slovak Republic. The research also includes answers to the questions, what criteria should a patient meet to get hippotherapy care covered and what attitude to such care the insurance companies have.

5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis <b>and</b> <b>therapy,</b> {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E

He also oversaw {{an expansion of the}} Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.|$|E

5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs <b>and</b> <b>therapy</b> may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Hospitalization in {{pediatric}} {{patients may}} caused an anxiety and stress in all age levels. Several techniques {{can be applied}} to reduced hospitalization stress in children, such as playing <b>therapy</b> <b>and</b> music <b>therapy.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the difference of effectiveness between both therapies in reducing the hospitalization stress in 4 - 6 years old children. Method: A quasy-experimental pre-posttest design was used in this study. There were 18 respondents, divided into three groups, i. e. group one receiving playing therapy, group two receiving music <b>therapy</b> <b>and</b> the last group as control group. Data were collected by using observation sheet before and after intervention to recognize the hospitalization stress. Data were analyzed by using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and Mann Whitney U Test with significance level of α< 0. 05. Result: Result showed that playing <b>therapy</b> <b>and</b> music <b>therapy</b> had significant effect to reduce the hospitalization stress with p= 0. 027 for play therapy, p= 0. 024 for musical <b>therapy,</b> <b>and</b> p= 0. 068 for control. Mann Whitney U Test revealed that there were no difference in the effectiveness of play <b>therapy</b> <b>and</b> musical <b>therapy</b> in reducing the hospitalization stress with p= 0. 009 for play <b>therapy</b> <b>and</b> control group, p= 0. 012 for music <b>therapy</b> <b>and</b> control group, and p= 0. 684 for playing <b>therapy</b> <b>and</b> musical <b>therapy.</b> Discussion: It can be concluded that play <b>therapy</b> <b>and</b> musical <b>therapy</b> are equally effective to reduce the hospitalization stress in children.
