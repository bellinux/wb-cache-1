25|$|At the 2002 U.S. Open, a {{month before}} his 45th birthday, Faldo {{finished}} in a very creditable position of tied for 5th place. At the 2003 Open Championship at Royal St George's, Faldo shot a fine third round of 67 and was briefly in contention for the tournament during the final round. He closed to within two shots of the lead after <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> at the 5th hole {{in the final round}} before holing a 30-foot eagle putt on the 7th. However, his momentum stalled over the next three holes. <b>A</b> <b>birdie</b> at the 14th hole took him to level par and into fourth place. However, three successive bogeys on his subsequent three holes ended his challenge and he finished the tournament in a tie for eighth place. To date, Faldo has not had a top-10 finish in a major since this event.|$|E
25|$|At the 2013 U.S. Open, Mickelson {{entered the}} final round leading by one stroke after rounds of 67-72-70 (−1) over the first three days, but he started {{the final round}} by three-putting the 3rd and 5th holes for double-bogeys {{to fall out of}} the lead. He regained the lead at the par 4 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a {{misjudgment}} at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader Justin Rose. Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.|$|E
25|$|At {{the final}} {{event of the}} PGA Tour season, the 2016 Tour Championship, McIlroy overcame a {{two-shot}} deficit after the third round to force a playoff with Ryan Moore and Kevin Chappell, winning the competition at the fourth playoff hole with <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> 3 on the par4 16th. The result put McIlroy {{at the top of}} the FedEx Cup and won him the $10 million bonus pool.|$|E

25|$|On 18 June, {{during the}} U.S. Open's third round, {{he became the}} first player to reach 14-under par at the tournament by making <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> at the 15th hole, {{on his way to a}} 54-hole U.S. Open record of 199. In doing so, he also built an eight-stroke lead going into the final round. A final round of 69 allowed him to claim his first major {{championship}} setting the 72-hole record.|$|E
25|$|Watson was runner-up to Martin Kaymer at the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits, {{falling in}} the three-hole {{aggregate}} playoff that initially included Dustin Johnson, before he incurred a two-stroke penalty on the 72nd hole. Watson led the playoff after <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> on the first hole, but Kaymer birdied the par-3 second hole to tie, effectively turning the playoff into sudden-death. Watson's second shot found the water hazard and Kaymer bested him by a stroke to win the major championship.|$|E
25|$|At the 2016 Ryder Cup, McIlroy played five matches winning three points, {{all when}} paired with Thomas Pieters: the European duo {{overcome}} Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar, 3 and 2, in the Friday fourballs, Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson, 4 and 2, in the Saturday foursomes, and Brooks Koepka and Johnson, 3 and 1, in the Saturday fourballs. McIlroy paired with Andy Sullivan in the Friday foursomes, losing to Mickelson and Fowler, 1 up. In the Sunday singles, he lost to Patrick Reed,1 up, thanks to <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> by the American {{at the last}} hole.|$|E
50|$|Mallory missed <b>a</b> good <b>birdie</b> {{opportunity}} on 12 {{when she}} missed <b>a</b> 15-foot <b>birdie</b> putt {{so they are}} tied after one hole. Then Mark steps up the next hole by sinking <b>a</b> 20-foot <b>birdie</b> putt and took a one-shot lead when Mallory missed her 18 footer. They both par the 15th hole after missing the green. Then on the 16th hole, Mark made a fantastic up-and-down. He drove it into a bad lie in a fairway bunker, and his approach shot nearly went in the water but landed in another bunker. He splashed out to 7 feet and made the clutch par putt to beat Mallory who also {{had to settle for}} par after her approach landed 35 feet away.|$|R

25|$|Nicklaus turned 65 in January that year, {{which was}} the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player. He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round. After hitting his tee shot off the 18th tee in the second round, Nicklaus {{received}} a ten-minute standing ovation from the crowd. On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic Swilken Bridge. Soon afterwards, Nicklaus ended his career with <b>a</b> <b>birdie,</b> holing a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th green. Nicklaus missed the 36-hole cut with a score of +3 (147).|$|E
25|$|On 12 August, age 22, McIlroy won the 2012 PGA Championship by {{a record}} eight strokes, which {{was done with}} <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> on the final hole. The record stood since Jack Nicklaus won the 1980 PGA Championship by seven strokes. McIlroy started the final round with a three stroke lead and shot a bogey free 66 {{to run away from}} the field. With this win, McIlroy became, at that time, the {{youngest}} multiple major champion since Seve Ballesteros won the 1980 Masters Tournament, and at that time, the sixth youngest of all time. The win also helped McIlroy regain the world number one ranking.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of the Waste Management Phoenix Open, Mickelson tied his career low round of 60. He made seven birdies in his first nine holes and needed <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> on the 18th hole to equal the PGA Tour record of 59. However, his 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole lipped out, {{resulting}} in him missing out by a single shot on making only the sixth round of 59 in PGA Tour history. Mickelson led the tournament wire-to-wire and completed a four shot win over Brandt Snedeker for his 41st PGA Tour victory and 3rd Phoenix Open title. Mickelson's score of 28-under-par tied Mark Calcavecchia's tournament scoring record. He also moved back inside the world's top 10 after falling down as far as number 22.|$|E

On the second hole, Green missed <b>a</b> twelve-foot <b>birdie</b> putt to win the tournament {{but it would not}} matter. Goosen had to sink a nine-foot par putt to extend the playoff but he missed it, giving Green the victory.|$|R
25|$|Watson won the 2014 Masters Tournament {{by three}} shots, {{with a score}} of −8. He entered the final round tied for the lead with 20-year-old Masters rookie Jordan Spieth. Playing {{together}} in the final pairing, Spieth birdied the seventh hole for a two-stroke lead over Watson. However, the momentum turned on the par-5 eighth hole. Spieth had <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> putt, but ended up three-putting for bogey while Watson birdied to pull into a first-place tie. Then, on the ninth hole, Watson birdied again while Spieth bogeyed, and the four-shot swing over two holes gave Watson a lead that he never relinquished in a win over Spieth and Jonas Blixt. With the win, Watson became the 17th player to win the Masters two or more times. The win moved him again to number four in the Official World Golf Ranking.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy {{lost his}} number one ranking on 18 March to Luke Donald after Donald won the Transitions Championship. McIlroy was one stroke {{off of the}} lead going into the weekend at The Masters but {{struggled}} in his last two rounds and finished in a tie for 40th. He regained the top spot in the world rankings on 15 April but lost it to Donald again on 29 April. On 6 May, McIlroy was in contention at the Wells Fargo Championship {{and went to a}} playoff with Rickie Fowler and D. A. Points. Fowler won the tournament on the first playoff hole with <b>a</b> <b>birdie.</b> The runner-up finish put McIlroy back {{at the top of the}} Official World Golf Ranking. After the runner-up finish, McIlroy would later miss the cut in his next three events, and fell again from number one ranking.|$|E
25|$|Norman endured another setback at the 1987 Masters. In {{his final}} round on the 18th green, Norman had a 20-foot putt for <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> that {{would win the}} tournament. The ball trickled over the left lip of the cup, missing by millimetres. After Norman's par on the 72nd hole at Augusta, {{he found himself in}} a sudden-death playoff with Larry Mize and Seve Ballesteros. On the second playoff hole, with Ballesteros eliminated, Mize holed a 47-yard (140-foot) chip to win the tournament. Norman did, however, win the Australian Masters in February 1987 and the Australian Open later in the year by a record ten shots at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, beating the {{previous}} Australian Open record winning margin of eight strokes by Jack Nicklaus in 1971. Norman's 1987 victory at the Australian Open lifted him back above Seve Ballesteros {{to the top of the}} Official World Golf Ranking.|$|E

25|$|At the 1988 U.S. Open, Faldo ended 72 {{holes of}} {{regulation}} {{play in a}} tie for the lead with Curtis Strange. Faldo's even-par fourth round of 71 started with 14 consecutive pars. <b>A</b> <b>birdie</b> on the 15th hole gave him {{a share of the}} lead with Strange. However, on the 16th hole Faldo found himself with a difficult bunker shot to play. After backing away from his bunker shot to scold some photographers for talking, Faldo made his lone bogey. Strange dropped a shot on the 17th to leave the two rivals tied for the lead on the 18th tee. Faldo missed a 25-foot birdie putt on the 18th green which would have made him the first British player since Tony Jacklin in 1970 to hold both major national championships. The following day, Strange won the 18-hole Monday playoff by four strokes. Strange shot an even-par round of 71, while Faldo struggled with a round of 75.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus {{was also}} known for his course {{management}} skills. He would plan to hit each full shot to the optimal position, to best set up his next shot, usually aiming for level lies and clear approach lines, while favoring his preferred shot shapes. He would often hold back on power to achieve this, but had a power advantage over most rivals through the set, {{so that he could}} hit a 3-wood or 1-iron from the tee with increased accuracy to avoid trouble, with sufficient length {{to keep up with the}} drivers hit by most rivals. An exceptional example of this came in the final round of the 1966 Open Championship at Muirfield, on the 17th hole, a 530-yard par 5 hole. Nicklaus needed <b>a</b> <b>birdie,</b> but the hole was framed by tall fescue rough, and was playing downwind with very firm turf conditions. He used a 3-iron from the tee and hit the shot 290 yards, then hit a 5-iron 240 yards onto the green, two-putted for birdie, and parred the final hole to win the title.|$|E
25|$|While {{attending}} Ohio State University, {{he won the}} U.S. Amateur twice (1959, 1961), and an NCAA Championship (1961). In the 1959 U.S. Amateur, Nicklaus defeated two-time {{winner and}} defending champion Charles Coe in the final 36-hole match 1-up, with <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> on the final hole. This was significant {{not only because of}} Coe's proven ability as a player, but also because Nicklaus became the then-youngest champion in the modern era, second only to Robert A. Gardner, who won in 1909. In 1961, Nicklaus became the first player to win the individual title at the NCAA Championship and the U.S. Amateur in the same year. He was followed by Phil Mickelson (1990), Tiger Woods (1996), Ryan Moore (2004), and Bryson DeChambeau (2015). Nicklaus also won the NCAA Big Ten Conference Championship that year with a 72-hole aggregate of 283, while earlier claiming the Western Amateur in New Orleans. In his second and last U.S. Amateur win in 1961, Nicklaus convincingly defeated Dudley Wysong 8 & 6 at Pebble Beach in the 36-hole championship match. For the week, Nicklaus was 20 strokes under par, including 34 birdies and two eagles.|$|E

25|$|Woods's major {{championship}} streak was seriously threatened at the 2000 PGA Championship, when Bob May went head-to-head with Woods on Sunday at Valhalla Golf Club. However, Woods played the last twelve holes of regulation seven under par, {{and won a}} three-hole aggregate playoff over May with <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> on the first hole and pars on the next two. He joined Ben Hogan (1953) as the only other player to win three professional majors in one season. Three weeks later, he won his third straight start on Tour at the Bell Canadian Open, becoming only the second man after Lee Trevino in 1971 to win the Triple Crown of Golf (U.S., British, and Canadian Opens) in one year. By the end of Woods' 2000 campaign, he had won three consecutive majors, nine PGA Tour events, and had set or tied 27 Tour records. Of the twenty events he entered, he {{finished in the top}} three fourteen times. His adjusted scoring average of 67.79 and his actual scoring average of 68.17 were the lowest in PGA Tour history, besting his own record of 68.43 in 1999 and Byron Nelson's average of 68.33 in 1945. He was named the 2000 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, becoming the first athlete to be honored twice, a feat that was matched by LeBron James in 2016. Woods was ranked as the twelfth best golfer of all time by Golf Digest magazine just four years after he turned professional.|$|E
500|$|A {{controversial}} {{ending to}} the Masters occurred in 1968. Roberto De Vicenzo signed a scorecard (scored by playing partner Tommy Aaron) which incorrectly showed him as making a par 4 instead of <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> 3 on the 17th {{hole of the}} final round. By the rules of golf, if a player signs a scorecard (thereby attesting to its veracity) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole, the player receives the higher score for that hole. This extra stroke cost De Vicenzo {{a chance to be}} in an 18-hole Monday playoff with Bob Goalby, who won the green jacket. De Vicenzo's mistake led to the famous quote, [...] "What a stupid I am." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2003 tournament was won by Mike Weir, {{who became}} the first Canadian to win a men's major championship, and the first {{left-hander}} to win the Masters. The following year, another left-hander, Phil Mickelson, won his first major championship by making <b>a</b> <b>birdie</b> on the final hole to beat Ernie Els by a stroke. Mickelson also won the tournament in 2006 and 2010. In 2011, the tournament was won by South African Charl Schwartzel, who birdied the final four holes to win by two strokes. In 2012, Bubba Watson won the tournament on the second playoff hole. Watson's win marked the fifth time that a left-hander won the Masters in the previous ten tournaments. Prior to 2003, no left-hander had ever won the Masters. [...] The 2013 Masters was won by Adam Scott, the first Australian to win the tournament. Watson won the 2014 Masters by three strokes over Jordan Spieth and Jonas Blixt. It was his second Masters victory in three years. In 2015, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in just his second Masters.|$|E
