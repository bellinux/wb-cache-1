In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when I was putting people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question.

5000|$|Zhu Mei {{subsequently}} {{sent his}} officer Wang Xingyu, with 50,000 soldiers, {{to try to}} attack Xingyuan to capture Emperor Xizong. However, although Wang was initially able to defeat Tian's subordinate Yang Sheng (楊晟), he was subsequently repelled by Man Cun (滿存), {{and was unable to}} advance. He thus became fearful that Zhu would punish him for his failures. Further, the eunuch Yang Fugong, who had succeeded Tian by this point (as Tian had fled to Chengdu to be under the protection of his brother Chen Jingxuan the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu)), issued a declaration that anyone who killed Zhu would be given Jingnan Circuit. Wang therefore decided to turn against Zhu. Around the new year 887, he returned to Chang'an without first receiving permission from Zhu. Zhu, in anger, summoned him, stating, [...] "You returned without permission. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> commit treason?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I am not committing treason. I am trying to capture the treasonous Zhu Mei!" [...] He seized Zhu and executed him. Pei Che and Zheng Changtu escorted Li Yun and fled to Hezhong, hoping that Wang Chongrong would protect them, but Wang Chongrong instead executed Li Yun and arrested Pei and Zheng. Both Zhu's and Li Yun's heads were delivered to Xingyuan and presented to Emperor Xizong.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} debated {{whether or not}} Exodus belongs in the [...] "Big Five" [...] of thrash metal with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax, due to their {{involvement}} with the early 1980s thrash metal scene. VH1 stated, [...] "Much is made of Thrash's Big Four: Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. True devotees know, however, that Big Five is the actual proper figure and that Exodus is the band that completes the quintet." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian also stated that, [...] "People talk about the 'Big Four' all the time, but back then {{it was really the}} 'Big Five' because Exodus were just as important and just as influential as everybody else." [...] Megadeth founder Dave Mustaine said in a 1990 interview that the [...] "Big Four" [...] were Exodus, Slayer, Metallica and Megadeth, adding that [...] "Exodus are a much better band - I really like Exodus. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt are really great guitar players. I like Scott Ian, but anyone else in that band kind of bores me. Having a disco thing is not what I think having a metal band is all about, and that guy had the audacity to say that he and I should together! I felt like saying what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> do? Open a disco fashion shop?" [...] Along with Ian and Mustaine, Holt has agreed that Exodus {{should be included in the}} [...] "Big Five" [...] of thrash metal because they [...] "were there at the start of thrash metal with Metallica in the real early '80s.

Learning together is a good, practical handbook for that purpose, dealing with both practice and theory. One section deals with communication and best and worst practices. Another describes the various steps to define the need, content, planning and implementation of training. Links with agriculture and related issues cover participation, gender issues, local knowledge and cultural aspects. Taking these into account will heighten the impact of your training. Finally, while practical examples, tools, role-plays can be found throughout the entire book, there is also a concluding section dedicated to making your own materials. It includes making puppets, producing posters, ways to discuss animal anatomy and games for forming and warming up groups.

40|$|Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> study a {{business}} degree? For {{most of you}} the answer will relate to getting a job, or a better job, and to underpin your planned career, whatever that may be. This outcome of the degree, career enhancement, is fairly generic for most young people although in some areas, such as social work, religious studies and nursing {{there may also be}} altruistic objectives that motivate the career choice. There is research to support this with a Bachelor degree leasing to enhanced employment outcomes including better salaries and more success in finding the preferred job (Graduate Careers Australia [GCA], 2015 a). However it is an inescapable fact that in the twenty first century qualifications are critical for most people to get the hobs they want, and {{this is especially true in}} a discipline such as business. There are obviously the exceptions, who manage to build great careers without a supporting qualification but they are rare exceptions, and often emerge from other skill sets such as entrepreneurism. Given this overarching rationale to take {{a business}} degree it becomes even more important to make sure you manage your degree to make sure you come out as a winner when it comes to getting that really good job. This chapter will highlight the importance of certain activities, which extend beyond your discipline units an provides a rationale to make sure you gain a competitive advantage over your competitors...|$|E
