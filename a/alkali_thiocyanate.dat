40|$|ABSTRACT: Waiting time {{dependent}} rotational anisotropies of SCN − anions {{and water}} molecules in <b>alkali</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (XSCN, X = Li, Na, K, Cs) aqueous solutions at various concentrations were measured with ultrafast infrared spectros-copy. It {{was found that}} cations can significantly affect the reorientational motions of both water molecules and SCN− anions. The dynamics are slower in a solution with a smaller cation. The reorientational time constants follow the order of Li+> Na+> K+ ≃ Cs+. The changes of rotational time constants of SCN − at various concentrations scale almost linearly with the changes of solution viscosity, but those of water molecules do not. In addition, the concentration-dependent amplitudes of dynamical changes are much more significant in the Li+ and Na+ solutions {{than those in the}} K+ and Cs+ solutions. Further investigations on the systems with the ultrafast vibrational energy exchange method and molecular dynamics simulations provide an explanation for the observations: the observed rotational dynamics are the balanced results of ion clustering and cation/anion/water direct interactions.

It {{was found that}} cations can significantly affect the reorientational motions of both water molecules and SCN- anions. The dynamics are slower in a solution with a smaller cation. The reorientational time constants follow the order of Li+ > Na+ > K+ similar or equal to Cs+. The changes of rotational time constants of SCN- at various concentrations scale almost linearly with the changes of solution viscosity, but those of water molecules do not.

Further investigations on the systems with the ultrafast vibrational energy exchange method and molecular dynamics simulations provide an explanation for the observations: the observed rotational dynamics are the balanced results of ion clustering and cation/anion/water direct interactions. In all the solutions at high concentrations (> 5 M), substantial amounts of ions form clusters. The structural inhomogeneity in the solutions leads to distinct rotational dynamics of water and anions. The strong interactions of Li+ and Na+ because of their relatively large charge densities with water molecules and SCN- anions, in addition to the likely geometric confinements because of ion clustering, substantially slow down the rotations of SCN- anions and water molecules inside the ion clusters. The interactions of K+ and Cs+ with water or SCN- are much weaker. The rotations of water molecules inside ion clusters of K+ and Cs+ solutions are not significantly different from those of other water species so that the experimentally observed rotational relaxation dynamics are only slightly affected by the ion concentrations...|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} chemists {{in the early}} 1900s, {{including}} Staudinger and Pfenninger (1916), as well as Delepine (1920), {{were the first to}} prepare and report episulfides. [...] However, both of these accounts were isolated incidents on single substrates. It was not until 1934 that Dachlauer and Jackel devised the first general synthesis of episulfides from epoxides using <b>alkali</b> <b>thiocyanates</b> and thiourea, which {{is still one of the}} most common methods for preparing episulfides today.|$|R
40|$|Claude Bernard {{demonstrated}} the depressant {{action of the}} thiocyanate ion on the myocardium in 1857. Pauli (1) introduced the <b>alkali</b> <b>thiocyanates</b> into medi-cine as vasodilators in 1903. The use of simple routine methods to estimate the thiocyanate content of the blood was instrumental in creating renewed interest in thiocyanate therapy in hypertension (2). The success with thiocyanates {{in the treatment of}} hypertension {{has been the subject of}} much controversy. Their value in hypertension appears to be limited. Taubman (3) studied pharmacologically a number of organic thiocyanates in 1930. Many aliphatic thiocyanates, such as methyl, ethyl and propyl, were studied on a small number of rabbits. Taubman observed that the aliphatic thiocyanates in general produced a pharmacologic syndrome consisting of con-vulsions, fall in body temperature and centric respiratory stimulation. Popov (4) showed that in general, aryl thiocyanates were less toxic than the alkyl com-pounds. Taubman studied para-thiocyanoaniline and observed blood changes in animals similar to those produced by aniline...|$|R

The distribution of arsenic (III) between aqueous HC 1 solutions and [ [...] . ] ether has been studied. Arsenic chloride {{species have been}} proposed, equilibrium constants have been calculated relating these species in the aqueous solutions, and distribution constants have been calculated for each species. The data from the distribution experiments have been correlated with solubility and electromotive force data taken from the literature. A partial study {{has been made of}} the distribution of ferric thiocyanate and of KSCN and NaSCN between aqueous solutions and tributyl phosphate. Sufficient data were taken to indicate that the distribution of the <b>alkali</b> <b>thiocyanates</b> is strongly dependent on the ionic strength of the aqueous solutions and that species of ferric thiocyanate other than (Fe(SCN) [subscript 3]) [subscript x] are extracted by tributyl phosphate. A coulometric method for determining microgram quantities of bromate has been developed which made use of electrolytically generated cuprous copper as the intermediate. Optimum conditions for the titration were determined. Quantities of bromate ranging from 18 to 240 micrograms have been determined within 0. 3 microgram. A coulometric method for the determination of ammonia has been developed which made use of electrolytically generated bromine in alkaline solutions as the intermediate. The effects of pH and of certain metal ions on the titration were studied. Quantities of ammonia ranging from 14 to 230 micrograms have been determined within 0. 2 microgram...|$|R
40|$|Two xyloglucan {{fractions}} {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} cotyledons of resting white-mustard seeds, the first by extraction with hot EDTA, and the second by subsequent extraction with <b>alkali</b> or lithium <b>thiocyanate.</b> Although both appear to have the `amyloid' type of structure in which chains of (1 → 4) -linked β-d-glucopyranose residues carry d-xylose-rich side chains through position 6, these side chains are rather different in structure in the two polysaccharide fractions, and the second or `insoluble' xyloglucan has fewer of them. The side chains in both polysaccharides are also different from those in other seed amyloids, especially in having xylose linked through positions 3 and 4 (instead of through position 2 as usual) and in containing fucose residues. Both polysaccharides show the characteristic blue `amyloid' colour with iodine {{in the presence of}} sodium sulphate, and it is suggested that this arises by the interaction of iodine molecules and possibly iodide ions within the interstices between aggregated xyloglucan chains. `Soluble' xyloglucan is metabolized during germination and is presumed to have a reserve function. `Insoluble' xyloglucan is metabolized less completely over the period studied but its lack of turnover during cell-wall differentiation indicates that it also is a reserve. These and other β-(1 → 4) -linked reserve polysaccharides of seeds might also have a structural function which is of particular value for the survival of the dormant seed...|$|R
