40|$|Over {{the last}} few years coronagraphic and spectroscopic {{observations}} have demonstrated that small-scale eruptions, such as "jets," "narrow coronal mass ejections (CMEs)," "mini CMEs," "streamer puffs," "streamer detachments," and others, occur ubiquitously on the Sun. Nevertheless, the origin of small-scale eruptive events and how these are interrelated with larger scale CMEs have been poorly investigated so far. In this work, we study a series of small-scale side eruptions that occurred during and after a large-scale CME. Observations show that a CME can be associated not only with a single reconnection process, leading to the large-scale phenomenon, but also with many other side reconnections occurring at different locations and times around the main flux rope, possibly induced by the CME expansion in the surrounding corona. White light and EUV observations of a slow CME acquired by the SOHO/LASCO and SOHO/UVCS instruments are analyzed here to characterize the locations of side reconnections induced by the CME. The magnetic reconnection rate M has been estimated from the UVCS data from the ratio between the inflows and outflows observed around the reconnection region, and from the LASCO data from the observed <b>aperture</b> <b>angles</b> between the slow mode shocks (SMSs) associated with the reconnection. It turns out that M 0. 05 at the heliocentric distance of 1. 8 R, while between ~ 2. 5 and 5. 5 R, M values progressively decrease with time/altitude from M ~ 1 down to M ~ 0. 3. Such large values of M are theoretically acceptable only if flux pile-up reconnection is envisaged. The observed occurrence of multiple reconnections associated with a CME is verified by numerical simulations of an eruption occurring within multiple helmet streamers. The simulations confirm that small side reconnections are a consequence of CME expansion against the surrounding coronal streamers. The simulated and observed evolution of <b>aperture</b> <b>angles</b> between the SMSs are in good agreement as well. These results demonstrate the effect of the global coronal magnetic field in the occurrence of small-scale eruptions due to lateral reconnection in a preceding CME event. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the recent}} {{advances}} in cataract surgery is torsional phacoemulsification. It was developed to increase the efficacy of ultrasonic emulsification. In torsional phacoemulsification, the torsional movement of the tip is translated to side-to-side cutting action {{with the aid of}} bent phaco tips. Lens material is cut in both directions, rather than only during a forward stroke. The efficiency of this technique is further enhanced by an improvement in followability provided by the inherent non-repulsive nature of the side-to-side motion. Tip selection is very important for the efficiency of torsional phacoemulsification. Theoretically, there are 2 ways to enhance the cutting efficiency of the tip. First is the stroke length; the 22 -degree bent 30 -degree Kelman mini-flared tip cuts longer than the 12 -degree bent 30 -degree mini-flared Kelman tip. Second is the angulation or bevel; the higher the degree (45 degrees), the better cutting efficiency.

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} the methodology {{used in the}} design of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and puts forward one particular configuration suitable for Integrated Navigation Systems (INSs). The choice of the Extremely High Frequency band (EHF) is based on two fundamental reasons. Firstly, EHF waves range from 30 to 300 GHz, which makes possible high data transmission rates (up to 155 Mbps). Secondly, EHF waves suffer both high attenuation and low diffraction when they are propagating through indoor channels, which provides a good isolation and allows using narrow <b>aperture</b> <b>angles,</b> respectively. Both special modulation and spatial diversity techniques are needed to cancel the multipath effects mainly due to wave reflections as the wave is propagating through the indoor channel. A typical configuration for this kind of systems consists of a set of base stations, uniformly distributed through the ship, installed on the ceiling. Each base station defines a picocell through several data terminals are linked by radiowaves. The design of INSs based on WLANs is proposed as a novel research field whose results can reduce the installation and maintenance costs of these systems aboard ship.

We consider "flat" (or "disky") BLR models, and use BLR spectra calculated with the photoionization code CLOUDY, already used to investigate the emission and the absorption of high-energy photons in FSRQ. We characterize the energy-dependent optical depth of the process, τ(E), for different accretion disk luminosities, <b>aperture</b> <b>angles</b> of the BLR (α, as measured from the equatorial plane), and initial injection eighths of the high-energy photons, R_ o. We study in particular how the change of these parameters influences the spectral break at GeV energies, predicted if the emission occurs within the BLR. We found a well defined relation between the break energy and the post-break slope, both uniquely determined by α. We finally find that even a rather disk-like BLR (α∼ 25 ^∘) corresponds to important absorption (τ> 1) of photons above few tens of GeV produced within the BLR. We therefore conclude that the VHE emission detected from FSRQs occurs beyond the BLR. Comment: 8 pages, submitted to MNRA...|$|R
