Conventional DC resistivity sounding and horizontal profiling method is successful in resistivity survey but is weak in respect of spatial exposure. The 2 D multi-electrode resistivity technique is now fairly well established with respect to theory and practical applications. This paper presents laboratory model automatic switching 2 D multi-electrode electrical resistivity for horizontal profiling system designed using PIC 18 F 452 Microcontroller, 24 bit ADC and <b>analog</b> <b>multiplexers.</b> <b>Analog</b> <b>multiplexers</b> are used for switching the electrodes.

50|$|After validating and {{characterizing the}} process using a test pattern he designed, Federico Faggin {{made the first}} working MOS silicon gate {{transistors}} and test structures by April 1968. He then designed the first integrated circuit using silicon gate, the Fairchild 3708, an 8-bit <b>analog</b> <b>multiplexer</b> with decoding logic, that had the same functionality of the Fairchild 3705, a metal-gate production IC that Fairchild Semiconductor had difficulty making on account of its rather stringent specifications.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} devices called {{stabilizers}}, video stabilizers or enhancers available that filter out the Macrovision spikes and thereby defeat the system. The principle of their function lies in detecting the vertical synchronization signal, and forcing the lines occurring during the VBI to black level, removing the AGC-confusing pulses.

5000|$|Discrete {{digital inputs}} and outputs might be {{buffered}} from the microprocessor data bus only by an addressable latch, or might be operated by a specialized input/output IC, such as an Intel 8255 or Motorola 6821 parallel input/output adapter. Later single-chip micrcontrollers have input and output pins available. These input/output circuits usually do not provide enough current to directly operate devices like lamps or motors, so solid-state relays are operated by the microcontroller digital outputs, and inputs are isolated by signal conditioning level-shifting and protection circuits. [...] One or more analog inputs, with an <b>analog</b> <b>multiplexer</b> and common analog to digital converter, are found on some microcontroller boards. Analog outputs may use a digital-to-analog converter or, on some microcontrollers, may be controlled by pulse-width modulation. For discrete inputs, external circuits {{may be required to}} scale inputs, or to provide functions like bridge excitation or cold junction compensation.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{the most}} {{expensive}} part of an integrated circuit is the pins, because they make the package larger, and each pin has {{to be connected to}} the integrated circuit's silicon. To save pins, it is common for slow ADCs to send their data one bit at a time over a serial interface to the computer, with the next bit coming out when a clock signal changes state, say from 0 to 5 V. This saves quite a few pins on the ADC package, and in many cases, does not make the overall design any more complex (even microprocessors which use memory-mapped I/O only need a few bits of a port to implement a serial bus to an ADC). Commercial ADCs often have several inputs that feed the same converter, usually through an <b>analog</b> <b>multiplexer.</b> Different models of ADC may include sample and hold circuits, instrumentation amplifiers or differential inputs, where the quantity measured is the difference between two voltages.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, bipolar {{junction}} transistors were a hundred {{times as fast as}} the (p-channel) MOS transistors then used and were much more reliable, but they also consumed much more power, required more area, and demanded a more complicated manufacturing process. MOS ICs were considered interesting but inadequate for supplanting the fast bipolar circuits in anything but niche markets, such as low power applications. One {{of the reasons for the}} low speed was that MOS transistors had gates made of aluminum which led to considerable parasitic capacitances using the manufacturing processes of the time. The introduction of transistors with gates of polycrystalline silicon (that became the de facto standard from the mid-1970s to early 2000s) was an important first step in order to reduce this handicap. This new self-aligned silicon-gate transistor was introduced by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in early 1968; it was a refinement (and the first working implementation) of ideas and work by John C. Sarace, Tom Klein and Robert W. Bower (around 1966-67) for a transistor with less parasitic capacitances that could be manufactured as part of an IC (and not only as a discrete component). This new type of pMOS transistor was 3-5 times as fast (per watt) as the aluminum-gate pMOS transistor, and it needed less area, had much lower leakage and higher reliability. The same year, Faggin also built the first IC using the new transistor type, the Fairchild 3708 (8-bit <b>analog</b> <b>multiplexer</b> with decoder), which demonstrated a substantially improved performance over its metal-gate counterpart. In less than 10 years, the silicon gate MOS transistor replaced bipolar circuits as the main vehicle for complex digital ICs.|$|E

40|$|A Radio Frequency (RF) based {{digital data}} {{transmission}} scheme with 8 channel encoder/decoder ICs is proposed for surface electrode switching of a 16 -electrode wireless Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system. A RF based wireless digital data transmission module (WDDTM) is developed and the electrode switching of a EIT system is studied {{by analyzing the}} boundary data collected and the resistivity images of practical phantoms. An <b>analog</b> <b>multiplexers</b> based electrode switching module (ESM) is developed with <b>analog</b> <b>multiplexers</b> and switched with parallel digital data transmitted by a wireless transmitter/receiver (T-x/R-x) module working with radio frequency technology. Parallel digital bits are generated using NI USB 6251 card working in LabVIEW platform and sent to transmission module to transmit the digital data to the receiver end. The transmitter/receiver module developed is properly interfaced with the personal computer (PC) and practical phantoms through the ESM and USB based DAQ system respectively. It is observed that the digital bits required for multiplexer operation are sequentially generated by the digital output (D/O) ports of the DAQ card. Parallel to serial and serial to parallel conversion of digital data are suitably done by encoder and decoder ICs. Wireless digital data transmission module successfully transmitted and received the parallel data required for switching the current and voltage electrodes wirelessly. 1 mA, 50 kHz sinusoidal constant current is injected at the phantom boundary using common ground current injection protocol and the boundary potentials developed at the voltage electrodes are measured. Resistivity images of the practical phantoms are reconstructed from boundary data using EIDORS. Boundary data and the resistivity images reconstructed from the surface potentials are studied to assess the wireless digital data transmission system. Boundary data profiles of the practical phantom with different configurations show that the multiplexers are operating in the required sequence for common ground current injection protocol. The voltage peaks obtained at the proper positions in the boundary data profiles proved the sequential operation of multiplexers and successful wireless transmission of digital bits. Reconstructed images and their image parameters proved that the boundary data are successfully acquired by the DAQ system which in turn again indicates a sequential and proper operation of multiplexers {{as well as the}} successful wireless transmission of digital bits. Hence the developed RF based wireless digital data transmission module (WDDTM) is found suitable for transmitting digital bits required for electrode switching in wireless EIT data acquisition system.
