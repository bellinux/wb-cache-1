40|$|Sleep need is {{affected}} by developmental stage and neuronal plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The fragile X mental retardation gene Fmr 1, whose loss-of-function mutation causes {{the most common form}} of inherited mental retardation in humans, is involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, and its expression depends on both developmental stage and waking experience. Fmr 1 is highly conserved across species and Drosophila mutants carrying dFmr 1 loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations are well characterized: <b>amorphs</b> have overgrown dendritic trees with larger synaptic boutons, developmental defects in pruning, and enhanced neurotransmission, while hypermorphs show opposite defects, including dendritic and axonal underbranching and loss of synapse differentiation. We find here that dFmr 1 <b>amorphs</b> are long sleepers and hypermorphs are short sleepers, while both show increased locomotor activity and shortened lifespan. Both <b>amorphs</b> and hypermorphs also show abnormal sleep homeostasis, with impaired waking performance and no sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. An impairment in the circadian regulation of sleep cannot account for the altered sleep phenotype of dFmr 1 mutants, nor can an abnormal activation of glutamatergic metabotropic receptors. Moreover, overexpression of dFmr 1 throughout the mushroom bodies is sufficient to reduce sleep. Finally, dFmr 1 protein levels are modulated by both developmental stage and behavioral state, with increased expression immediately after eclosure and after prolonged wakefulness. Thus, dFmr 1 expression dose-dependently affects both sleep and synapses, suggesting that changes in sleep time in dFmr 1 mutants may derive from changes in synaptic physiology.

To better understand both agouti structure/function and the germline {{damage caused by}} chemicals and radiation, an allelic series of 25 recessive, homozygous-viable agouti mutations generated in specific-locus tests were characterized. Visual inspection of fur, augmented by quantifiable chemical analysis of hair melanins, suggested four phenotypic categories (mild, moderate, umbrous-like, severe) for the 18 hypomorphs and a single category for the 7 <b>amorphs</b> (null). Molecular analysis indicated protein-coding alterations in 8 hypomorphs and 6 <b>amorphs,</b> with mild-moderate phenotypes correlating with signal peptide or basic domain mutations, and more devastating phenotypes resulting from C-terminal lesions.

40|$|The {{integrin}} {{family of}} cell surface receptors mediates cell-substrate and cell-to-cell adhesion and transmits intracellular signals. In Drosophila {{there is good}} evidence for an adhesive role of integrins, but evidence for integrin signalling has remained elusive. Each integrin is an alphabeta heterodimer, and the Drosophila betaPS subunit forms at least two integrins by association with different alpha subunits: alphaPS 1 betaPS (PS 1) and alphaPS 2 betaPS (PS 2). The complex pattern of PS 2 integrin expression includes, but is more extensive than, the sites where PS 2 has a known requirement. In order to investigate whether PS 2 integrin is required at these additional sites and/or has functions besides mediating adhesion, a comprehensive genetic analysis of inflated, the gene that encodes alphaPS 2, was performed. We isolated 35 new inflated alleles, and obtained 10 alleles from our colleagues. The majority of alleles are <b>amorphs</b> (36 / 45) or hypomorphs (4 / 45), but five alleles that affect specific developmental processes were identified. Interallelic complementation between these alleles suggests that some may affect distinct functional domains of the alphaPS 2 protein, which specify particular interactions that promote adhesion or signalling.

40|$|The {{formation}} of a solar system such as ours {{is believed to have}} followed a multi-stage process around a protostar and its associated accretion disk. Whipple first noted that planetesimal growth by particle agglom-eration is strongly influenced by gas drag, and Cuzzi and colleagues have shown that when midplane particle mass densities approach or exceed those of the gas, solid-solid interactions dominate the drag effect. The size dependence of the drag creates a “bottleneck ” at the meter scale with such bodies rapidly spiraling into the central star, whereas much smaller or larger particles do not. Independent of whether the origin of the drag is angular momentum exchange with gas or solids in the disk, successful planetary accretion requires rapid planetesimal growth to km scales. A commonly accepted picture is that for collisional velocities Vc above a certain threshold value, Vth ∼ 0. 1 - 10 cm s− 1, particle agglomeration is not possible; elastic rebound over-comes attractive surface and intermolecular forces. However, if perfect sticking is assumed for all ranges of interparticle collision speeds the bottleneck can be overcome by rapid planetesimal growth. While previous work has dealt with the influences of collisional pressures and the possibility of particle fracture or penetration, the basic role of the phase behavior of matter–phase diagrams, <b>amorphs</b> and polymorphs–has been neglected.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the physical {{properties of the}} macrolide antibiotics: Erythromycin dihydrate (EM-DH), Roxithromycin monohydrate (RM-MH) and Azithromycin dihydrate (AZM-DH). The abovementioned hydrate compounds were investigated {{in terms of the}} hydrate-anhydrate crystal structure stability, dehydration and observed polymorphism under controlled temperature heating programs. Identified hydrate and anhydrate polymorphs were subjected to physical stability testing during controlled storage. EM-DH was characterized by thermal analysis (DSC, TGA), X-ray diffraction, FTIR and microscopy. Dehydration of EM-DH at temperatures of 100, 157 and 200 °C (followed by supercooling to 25 °C) produced the form (I) anhydrate (Tm = 142. 9 °C), form (II) anhydrate (Tm = 184. 7 °C) and <b>amorph</b> (II) (Tg = 118 °C) respectively. The attempts to produce <b>amorph</b> (I) from melting (in vicinity of form (I) melt over temperature range 133 °C to 144 °C) and supercooling was unsuccessful due to the high crystallization tendency of the form (I) melt. Brief humidity exposure and controlled temperature (40 °C) / humidity storage for 4 days (0 - 96 % RH) revealed hygroscopic behaviour for the anhydrate crystal (forms (I) and (II)) and <b>amorph</b> (II) forms. Form (II) converted to a nonstoichiometric hydrate where extent of water vapour absorption increased with increased storage humidity (2. 1 % absorbed moisture from recorded TGA at 96 % RH). <b>Amorph</b> (II) exhibited similar trends but with greater water absorption of 4. 7 % (recorded with TGA) at 96 % RH. The pulverization and sieving process of <b>amorph</b> (II) (at normal environmental conditions) was accompanied by some water vapour absorption (1. 1 %). A slightly lower absorbed moisture content of 3. 3 % (from TGA) after controlled 4 days storage at 40 °C/ 96 % RH was recorded. This suggested some physical instability (crystallization tendency) of <b>amorph</b> (II) after pulverization. The thermally induced dehydration of RM-MH by DSC-TG was evaluated structurally (SCXRD), morphologically (microscopy) and by kinetic analysis. Various kinetic analysis approaches were employed (advanced, approximation based integral and differential kinetic analysis methods) in order to obtain reliable dehydration kinetic parameters. The crystal structure was little affected by dehydration as most H-bonds were intramolecular and not integral to the crystal structure stability. Kinetic parameters from thermally stimulated dehydration indicated a multidimensional diffusion based mechanism, due to the escape of water from interlinked voids in crystal. The hygroscopicity of the forms RM-MH, Roxithromycin-anhydrate and <b>amorph</b> glass (Tg = 81. 4 °C) were investigated. Roxithromycinanhydrate (crystalline) converted readily to RM-MH which were found to be compositionally stable over the humidity range 43 - 96 %RH. Amorphous glass exhibited increased water vapour absorption with increasing storage humidity (40 °C/ 0 - 96 % RH). TG analysis suggested a moisture content of 3. 5 % at 96 % RH after 4 storage days. DSC and powder XRD analysis of stored pulverised amorphous glass indicated some physical instability due to water induced crystallization. Commercial AZM-DH and its modifications were characterized by thermal analysis (DSC, TGA), SC-XRD and microscopy. Thermally stimulated dehydration of AZM-DH occurred in a two-step process over different temperature ranges. This was attributed to different bonding environments for coordinated waters which were also verified from the crystal structure. Dehydration activation energies for thermally stimulated dehydration were however similar for both loss steps. This was attributed to similarities in the mode of H- bonding. Different forms of AZM were prepared by programmed temperature heating and cooling of AZM-DH. The prepared forms included amorphous glass (melt supercooling), amorphous powder (prepared below crystalline melting temperature), crystalline anhydrate and crystalline partial dehydrate. Humidity exposure indicated hygroscopic behaviour for the amorphous, crystalline anhydrate and crystalline partial dehydrate modifications. Both the crystalline anhydrate and partial dehydrate modifications converted to the stoichiometric dihydrate form (AZM-DH) at normal environmental conditions at ambient temperature. Both the <b>amorph</b> glass and <b>amorph</b> powder exhibited increased moisture absorption with increased humidity exposure. TG analysis of the pulverised <b>amorph</b> glass indicated a moisture content of 5. 1 % at 96 % RH after 4 storage days.
