5|$|The Badami cave temples {{represent}} some of {{the earliest}} known examples of Hindu temples in the Deccan region. They along with the temples in Aihole transformed the Malaprabha River valley into <b>a</b> <b>cradle</b> of temple architecture that influenced the components of later Hindu temples elsewhere in India.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match at}} Victory Road to air live on PPV was a twenty-man Gauntlet match, {{consisting}} of wrestlers who compete in TNA's X Division. In this particular match, wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown {{over the top}} rope {{and down to the}} floor until there were two left in the ring. Those two men had a standard match until one was pinned or made to submit. The final two participants were Kazarian and Héctor Garza. Kazarian tried to pin Garza with <b>a</b> <b>Cradle,</b> but Garza countered the maneuver with a roll-up for the win.|$|E
5|$|The four hymns Bach {{inserted}} in the Magnificat for the Christmas vespers had a tradition in Leipzig. A setting by Bach's predecessor Kuhnau in a Christmas cantata is extant. They can be connected to scenic display of the Christmas story, representing the annunciation to the shepherds, first by one angel (A, B), then by the multitude (C), finally <b>a</b> <b>cradle</b> song (Kindleinwiegen, D). In Bach's autograph, the four movements are grouped {{at the back of}} the volume. They are written in older musical styles than most of the Magnificat movements.|$|E

5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{were also}} pioneers {{in the field}} of engineering, {{launching}} large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as <b>a</b> <b>cradle</b> of civilization.|$|E
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to <b>a</b> <b>cradle.</b> It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E
25|$|The {{languages}} {{spoken by}} the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little since the 11th century among the common people who inhabited the city. Italian and Venetian would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became <b>a</b> <b>cradle</b> of Croatian literature.|$|E
30|$|The cradles {{of large}} mass are {{required}} to be lifted off a freight train whilst empty and replaced with <b>a</b> loaded <b>cradle.</b> To allow this loading and unloading of such heavy goods, automation is necessary. An option {{that would be very}} suitable is the use of a gantry crane. A gantry crane allows <b>an</b> empty <b>cradle</b> to be removed and replaced with <b>a</b> loaded <b>cradle</b> with ease.|$|R

The SS-66K is a self-contained phone, but features a rather unusual ball antenna.|$|E
25|$|The GT-1 {{was derived}} from the GB-1 series of glide bombs, {{developed}} by Aeronca for the United States Army Air Forces. The weapon's airframe was inexpensive and simply designed, with a basic wing and twin tails attached to <b>a</b> <b>cradle</b> for carrying the payload. The flight path of the GT-1 was determined by a preset autopilot that kept the weapon on a steady course after release.|$|E

Each epoxy-coated steel strand is carried inside the cradle in a one-inch (2.54cm) steel tube. Each strand acts independently, allowing for removal, inspection, and replacement of individual strands. The first two such bridges are the Penobscot Narrows Bridge, completed in 2006, and the Veterans' Glass City Skyway, completed in 2007.|$|E

25|$|The area {{downstream}} of the Volga, {{widely believed}} to have been <b>a</b> <b>cradle</b> of the Proto-Indo-European civilization, was settled by Huns and other Turkic peoples in the first millennium AD, replacing the Scythians. The ancient scholar Ptolemy of Alexandria mentions the lower Volga in his Geography (Book 5, Chapter 8, 2nd Map of Asia). He calls it the Rha, which was the Scythian name for the river. Ptolemy believed the Don and the Volga shared the same upper branch, which flowed from the Hyperborean Mountains.|$|E
