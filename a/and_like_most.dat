5|$|In 2012, Switzerland's {{population}} slightly exceeded eight million. In {{common with}} other developed countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990. Growth has since stabilised, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> of Europe, Switzerland faces an ageing population, albeit with consistent annual growth projected into 2035, due mostly to immigration and a fertility rate close to replacement level.|$|E
5|$|In February 1916, Wilson enlisted as {{a private}} in the Maryland National Guard and was posted to Company H, 5th Maryland Infantry. This unit was called to active duty at Laurel, Maryland in June 1916 for service on the Mexican border. It was based at Eagle Pass, Texas, <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> National Guard units, {{supported}} but did not directly participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition, although it did occasionally cross the border into Mexico. Wilson was soon promoted to corporal, and later sergeant. The 5th Maryland Regiment returned to Maryland in February 1917.|$|E
5|$|Some bivalves, {{including}} the true oysters, the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the thorny oysters and the kitten's paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> bivalves, are filter feeders.|$|E

5|$|The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter. It was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1905. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog washerwoman who lives in a tiny cottage in the fells of the Lake District. A child named Lucie happens upon the cottage and stays for tea. The two deliver freshly laundered clothing to the animals and birds in the neighbourhood. Potter thought the book would be best enjoyed by girls, <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> girls' books of the period, it is set indoors with a focus on housework.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E
5|$|As one of Harun's younger sons, Abu Ishaq was {{initially}} of little consequence, {{and did not}} figure {{in the line of}} succession. During the civil war between his elder half-brothers al-Amin (r. 809–813) and al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) he remained in Baghdad, <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> members of the Abbasid dynasty and the Abbasid aristocracy (abnāʾ al-dawla), he supported the anti-caliph Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi in 817–819. Al-Tabari records that Abu Ishaq led the Hajj pilgrimage in 816, accompanied by many troops and officials, among whom was Hamdawayh ibn Ali ibn Isa ibn Maham, who had just been appointed to the governorship of the Yemen and was on his way there. During his stay in Mecca, his troops defeated and captured a pro-Alid leader who had raided the pilgrim caravans. He also led the pilgrimage in the next year, but no details are known.|$|E

He {{is part of a}} band with Slim and Zeb mostly because it is something to do and his friends are involved. Chaz is a flirt and a party-guy. He also lives with Jordan and regularly finds himself trying to be big brother to a girl who already has too many brothers.|$|R
5|$|The fossa has {{the most}} {{widespread}} geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry deciduous forests, the eastern rainforests, and the southern spiny forests, it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests. This may be because the reduced canopy in dry forests provides less shade, and also because the fossa seems to travel more easily in humid forests. It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision <b>and</b> (<b>like</b> <b>most</b> nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E

50|$|Broadly speaking, {{it can be}} {{inferred}} that phytosaurs were largely oviparous <b>and</b> superprecocial, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> sauropsids. However, Mystriosuchus has a pelvis {{similar to that of}} the later metriorhynchids, which could imply vivipary.|$|R

25|$|The {{ecological}} {{requirements of}} many of the species, are those of the laurel forest <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> of their counterpart laurifolia in the world, they are vigorous species with a great ability to populate their preferred habitats.

25|$|Although basil grows best outdoors, it can {{be grown}} indoors in a pot <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill.

It can, however, be grown even in a basement, under fluorescent lights.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the other}} Amesha Spentas also, Ameretat is already attested in the Gathas, the oldest {{texts of the}} Zoroastrianism and {{considered}} to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. <b>And</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> other principles, Ameretat is not unambiguously an entity in those hymns. Unlike four of the other Amesha Spentas, Ameretat {{does not have a}} standing epithet that in later Avesta texts becomes an element of her proper name.|$|E
25|$|Sport is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} and spectator activity in Launceston <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>most</b> of the state cricket and Australian rules football are popular sports.

He also advocated and voted against feudalism and slavery.|$|E
