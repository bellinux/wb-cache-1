No systematic method has been proposed so far for defining a boundary to separate flows into two distinct classes. We consider four single-feature classification methods and examine network-level prefix traces collected from a Tier- 1 backbone.

To avoid reclassifi-cation due to short term fluctuations we propose a two fea-ture classification method that incorporates a metric, called latent heat, that is a function of the difference in elephant bandwidth and the class separation threshold over a num-ber of time intervals. Our first contribution is to illustrate the volatility of elephants and hence the difficulty in isolat-ing them for traffic engineering purposes, especially if one wants to achieve consistency with respect to load, number and duration of elephant flows.

40|$|In {{a supply}} chain {{handling}} fast moving consumer goods {{one of the most}} commonly followed material ordering process involves releasing supply orders whenever inventory level falls below a predefined re-order level. There are two difficulties in modelling this process in system dynamics parlance. Firstly events in this process occur discretely whereas system dynamics emphasises continuous change. Secondly the time elapsed between occurrence of two successive events depend on inflow pattern. This violates an assumption that is implicit in the delays that are commonly used in system dynamics models. Delays in System Dynamics are modelled as k–th order Erlang functions which are characterised by two parameters i. e. the average time spent in the delay and the order of the delay. The order is actually the ratio between the square of <b>average</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> and the variance of holding time. One of the important assumptions made here is that the <b>average</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> remains independent of the inflow pattern. In many situations these provide a good representation of the reality. However in the material ordering process described the flow is delayed on number and the assumption does not hold. In this paper we have tried to find a representation for the process that would not require making compromises either on the modelling accuracy or on the philosophical foundations of the methodology. Based on analysis of behaviour we have demonstrated that the re-order-level based ordering is equivalent to an Erlang process of order equal to the re-order-level. As a result it can also be modelled as an exponential delay. The average length of delay has to be kept as a variable to represent reality. The work attains importance because of its utility in modelling supply chains where there has been a renewed interest in using system dynamics. In analysing the delays we have used a framework that is commonly used to analyse stochastic processes. Similar method of analysis could be applied to analyse other kind of processes.

Understanding user behaviors in such a setting is hence an important step for system modelling and optimization. Previous studies on user behavior on video services were on either live TV or VoD.

40|$|Three typical {{types of}} traffic demands in a core WDM network are assumed in this work, {{requiring}} single wavelength services, guaranteed-bandwidth IP services or best-effort IP services respectively. Each {{type of traffic}} is characterized by <b>average</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> and average bandwidth. We considered the following two wavelength-routing (augmented with traffic grooming) approaches. The first approach is single-hop optical circuit-switching (or SHOCS) where any data (IP packets) is only groomed at its ingress node, and then routed to its egress node directly over one lightpath. The second approach we considered, called two-hop OCS (or THOCS), tries to facilitate more edge grooming via a two-hop routing. More specifically, it routes most of the data from its source to some intermediate nodes over existing lightpaths in the first step (hop), and then from an intermediate node to the final destination over another lightpath in the second step (hop). The third approach we consider, called Polymorphous Optical Burst Switching (or POBS) [3], grooms different types of traffic differently by using an integrated signaling framework to seamless support both OCS and OBS. It emulates OCS, and in particular SHOCS, for the wavelength services and guaranteed-bandwidth IP services by using traffic grooming at the source and establishing direct lightpaths to destinations. On the other hand, it emulates OBS for the best-effort IP services by assembling packets having the same destination into bursts and transmitting them without setting up a lightpath {{in an attempt to}} reduce signaling delay and achieve statistical multiplexing gains.

The models on which our investigations were performed are the basic model proposed by A. Dragulescu and V. Yakovenko [1], the model with uniform saving rate developed by A. Chakraborti and B. K. Chakrabarti [2], and its extended model with diverse saving rate [3]. The velocity of circulation {{is found to be}} inversely related with the <b>average</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> of money. In order to check the nature of money transferring process in these models, we demonstrated the probability distributions of holding time. In the model with uniform saving rate, the distribution obeys exponential law, which indicates money transfer here is a kind of Poisson process. But when the saving rate is set diversely, the holding time distribution follows a power law. The velocity can also be deduced from a typical individual's optimal choice. In this way, an approach for building the micro-foundation of velocity is provided. In order to expose the dynamic mechanism behind the distribution in microscope, we examined the mobility by collecting the time series of agents' rank and measured it by employing an index raised by economists. In the model with uniform saving rate, the higher saving rate, the slower agents moves in the economy. Meanwhile, all of the agents have the same chance to be the rich. However, it is not the case in the model with diverse saving rate, where the assumed economy falls into stratification. The volatility distribution of the agents' ranks are also demonstrated to distinguish the differences among these models. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{past year}} has seen {{explosive}} growth in internet traffic. Currently, the most common way of accessing the internet is via the switching systems and the interoffice trunk facilities of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The PSTN was designed to carry voice calls that have an <b>average</b> call <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> of about 3 minutes. The nominal 3 minute call assumption pervades all aspects of telco equipment design such as switch engineering, line concentration ratios, and trunk group sizes. However, internet calls violate this fundamental assumption and have a mean <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> {{of the order of}} 20 minutes with some calls lasting for many hours. This long <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> traffic severely taxes the PSTN. It requires additional equipment to be provisioned, without compensating revenues, and potentially affects service performance for all users. Internet traffic, which is packet data in nature, can in principle be carried much more efficiently on data networks. However, since the PSTN currently represents the only nearuniversal access method, any long term solution necessarily involves a staged migration from the present mode of operation towards some packet network solution. This paper reviews the impacts of internet traffic on the PSTN. It summarizes the impact of internet traffic on transmission and switching equipment, the need for comprehensive revisions to existing engineering and planning algorithms, and the implications of these issues for operational practices and operations support systems. It also provides analysis of the cost of supporting internet traffic on the PSTN. Finally, it describes a number of possible solutions. In each case the current barriers to implementing the solution are discussed. I...|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{technology}} has already evolved through its {{first and second}} generations. Currently {{it is on the}} verge of the third generation, characterized by the addition of different types of data transmission techniques. In the near future, optimization of radio resource allocation with different kinds of traffic sources having different quality of services will be one of the main challenging problems. This thesis intends to find few solutions to optimize the air interface of current cellular systems with both kinds of traffic, current voice and low speed data traffic and future different types of data traffics. Nowadays, GSM, TDMA  136, IS- 95 and PDC are the most successful second-generation cellular systems. The random access part and the traffic channel part are utilized, respectively, for call reaching in the base transceiver station and information transmission in the uplink direction of a wireless cellular network such as the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). Optimization of the random access part and the traffic channel part are studied, respectively, in the first part and the second part of the thesis. Overall radio interface optimization considering these two parts together is studied in the third part of the thesis. Suitable cases are confirmed by simulations. Some form of Slotted ALOHA is used in all current digital cellular networks. The multiple power level transmission system in the original Slotted ALOHA concept, has one inherent problem. It exhibits a throughput-collapse phenomenon whereby the throughput decreases exponentially to zero as the mean number of aggregate transmission attempts increases beyond optimum. Few throughput-collapse preventing algorithms are presented first in this thesis. The random access protocol with the retransmission cut-off scheme is used in the access channel for initial access into the TDMA based traffic channel. The analysis of the random access channel accompanied by retransmission cut-off and its optimization is devised. The number of slots occupied by a terminal can be changed dynamically in the newly developed General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) system. An analysis of the GPRS transmission system with and without RLC/MAC block (radio packet) dropping is carried out. A call is either rejected or blocked depending on its inability to succeed either in the random access part or in the traffic channel part. It is shown that the number of random access slots provisioned in the wireless access system has a significant impact on the overall call set up probability and traffic channel efficiency. The number of random access slots at optimum performance is derived considering four parameters: average call arrival rate, number of retransmissions, number of traffic channels and <b>average</b> call <b>holding</b> <b>time.</b> The results show that the number of random access slots at optimum performance depends on the average call arrival rate and the number of retransmissions. Moreover, it is independent of the number of traffic channels and <b>average</b> call <b>holding</b> <b>time.</b> The models presented in this thesis could be used as a guideline for the optimization of radio resource allocation in the future evolution of cellular networks. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and {{antimicrobial}} resistance (AMR) associated with various pig transit and <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> were investigated at slaughter plants. Changes {{in the relative}} abundance of two biotypes of Streptococcus faecium were associated with transit and holding of pigs, although approximately 20 % of the isolates were unidentified. The greatest variety of coliforms was isolated from porcine feces after short transit (2 h) or <b>holding</b> (3 h) <b>times</b> and was qualitatively similar to those from pigs on farms. Isolates from pigs with longer <b>average</b> transit or <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> were almost all Escherichia coli (four biotypes). Streptococcal resistance to most antimicrobial agents was significantly greater (P less than 0. 05) in isolates from live pigs at slaughter plants than in those from pigs at farms and was apparent after a short transit time (2 h). Streptococci from pigs held an average of 15 h were less resistant to most antimicrobial agents than those from pigs held 3 or 43 h. When compared with short transit times, moderate transit times (6 h) were associated with significantly decreased (P less than 0. 05) coliform resistance and decreased resistance transfer but a greater diversity of AMR patterns. Holding pigs overnight (14 h) was associated with lowered coliform resistance to several antimicrobial agents, compared with the resistance of isolates from pigs held 3 or 39 h. A substantial increase (18 to 48 %) {{in the ability to}} transfer streptomycin resistance was demonstrated in coliforms from pigs held 39 h, when compared with those from pigs held 3 h.

40|$|Previous {{performance}} {{studies of}} PCS channel allocation assumed that call <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> have an exponential distribution. The exponential call <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> assumption is justified for existing cellular systems, where wireless calls are charged {{based on the}} length of the call <b>holding</b> <b>time.</b> Future PCS systems may exercise flat rate billing, and consequently a more general distribution is desirable to model the call <b>holding</b> <b>times.</b> This paper models the call <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> by the Erlang distribution (a generalization of the exponential distribution) to investigate the effect of the variance of the call <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> on the call completion probability. Our analysis indicates that the call completion probability decreases as the variance of the call <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> decreases. This effect becomes more pronounced as the variance of the cell residence times decreases...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{recrystallization}} annealing was operated in 3 %(mass fraction) Si CGO steels. Different annealing <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> {{was set up}} in experiments. Microstructure, dislocations and texture distribution were analysed by OM, TEM and EBSD techniques. Evolution of microstructure and texture in primary recrystallization was studied. Results indicate that as the annealing <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> prolongs, recovery and recrystallization occur gradually. When the <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> increases to 300 s, recrystallization is almost fully realized and grains are equiaxed. With the extension of <b>holding</b> <b>time,</b> the dislocation density decreases. Primary recrystallization texture is affected by <b>holding</b> <b>time.</b> As the <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> extends, { 111 } texture and { 110 } texture are weakened and Goss texture is strengthened. { 111 } texture is reduced firstly and then increases. The intensity of cube texture and rotated cube texture is stable. When <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> is short, grains are dominated by small angle grain boundaries with the existence of a large amount of subgrains. As the <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> prolongs, large angle grain boundaries increase...|$|R
