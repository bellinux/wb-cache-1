5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, <b>and</b> <b>desire.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following Fear <b>and</b> <b>Desire,</b> Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear <b>and</b> <b>Desire,</b> it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E

In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E

40|$|The {{touchscreen}} smartphone {{platform is}} inherently flexible, {{giving it the}} potential {{to meet the needs}} <b>and</b> <b>desires</b> of individuals diverse in age and ability. Despite universal design research efforts providing industry with guidance to address this opportunity, current designs fall short. The disconnect stems from differing priorities in design and development and opposing approaches to defining and grouping the user population. The research presented in this dissertation aims to remove these issues from the process of discovering touchscreen smartphone design opportunities. It focuses on users' prior <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> customizations rather than ability- or market-factors. Data were collected on participants' devices' out-of-the-box, current <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> device states along with related stories about their actual <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> device modifications. Template and image analyses identified patterns in the data, which also revealed an underlying structure for organizing and presenting participants' needs <b>and</b> <b>desires</b> associated with smartphone touchscreen customizations. The needs <b>and</b> <b>desires</b> suggest opportunities for industry to shift towards universal design. The structure offers an approach to addressing the gaps between the ability-centered and market-driven approaches to the design of consumer technology.

5|$|Sappho was a {{prolific}} poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines.

5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E
5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination <b>and</b> <b>desire.</b> The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, <b>and</b> <b>desire.</b> She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E

5|$|In February 1956 Khrushchev denounced Stalin's cult of {{personality}} at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and {{embarked on a}} reform course. The de-Stalinization of official Soviet ideology left Poland's Stalinist hardliners in a difficult position. While unrest <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers was beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (the veteran hardliner chief was attending the Soviet party's congress) exacerbated an existing split in the Polish party. In March Bierut was succeeded by Edward Ochab as first secretary. As the 20th Congress launched also a process of partial democratisation of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve living standards.|$|E

5|$|In early 1947 the French {{administration}} {{instituted a}} new rule that increased {{the weight of}} the French vote over the Malagasy vote in selection of candidates, and three PADESM candidates favored by French conservatives were successfully elected to the Conseil de la Republique. The results of the election and popular discontent with French interference served to intensify widespread frustration against the colonial authority <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> for Malagasy self-governance across the island. These factors finally erupted in a nationalist uprising that began on the evening of 29 March 1947 with attacks against a police camp and several French plantations in the eastern rainforest carried out by militant Malagasy nationalists, chief among them the members of the nationalist secret societies Vy Vato Sakelika (VVS) and Jiny.|$|E
