At the end of the game, Aloha returns to Little Muu, but is disowned by all the Muu Muus, who now resent him for teaming with Kabuki (who had tried to destroy them all) and trying to destroy Robbit, who had saved their lives. They throw him out of the bar <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> never come back.|$|E

25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E

500|$|IGN writer Cindy White {{enjoyed the}} episode, but criticized the ending {{for being too}} similar to a scene in the series finale of the {{original}} version of The Office in which David Brent, after a successful blind date, tries to jump into a conversation with traveling salesman Chris Finch at a Christmas party. Finch makes a rude comment about his date which makes David stand up to him <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> [...] "fuck off". Despite this, she spoke highly of Jim and Dwight's storyline, writing that [...] "I wish their final ruse had been a bit more original, but it served the purpose {{of getting rid of}} Packer". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode.|$|E

In the third scene, a group of older boys try to lure young children into their [...] "special club"; they lead one young boy to a secluded, wooded area and try to convince him to remove his clothes. In the last role-playing scene, Sophie's father offers her a secret bubble bath; afterwards, he tells her not to tell anyone because he would go to jail and it would be her fault.|$|E

Jeremy Glick called his wife at 09:37:41 from row27 and told her the flight was hijacked by three dark-skinned men who looked [...] "Iranian", wearing [...] and wielding knives. Glick remained connected {{until the end of the}} flight. He {{reported that the}} passengers voted whether to [...] "rush" [...] the hijackers. The United air traffic control coordinator for West Coast flights, Alessandro [...] "Sandy" [...] Rogers, alerted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Herndon Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, that Flight93 was not responding and was off course. A minute later, the transponder was turned off, but the Cleveland controller continued to monitor the flight on primary radar. The Herndon Center relayed information on Flight93 to FAA headquarters. Joseph DeLuca called his father at 09:43:03 from row26 to inform him the flight had been hijacked. Todd Beamer attempted to call his wife from row32 at 09:43:48, but was routed to GTE phone operator Lisa D. Jefferson. Beamer told the operator that the flight was hijacked and that two people who he thought were the pilots were on the floor dead or dying. He said one of the hijackers had a red belt with what looked to be a bomb strapped to his waist. When the hijackers veered the plane sharply south, Beamer briefly panicked, exclaiming, [...] "We're going down! We're going down!" [...] Meanwhile, Dahl continued to struggle in the cockpit, refusing to allow a hijacker to engage the autopilot and thereby set its coordinates for their target, Washington, D.C. The hijackers were heard to say [...] "Inform them, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> talk to the pilot; bring the pilot back", possibly referring to Homer (CVR transcripts). A United employee in San Francisco, California, sent an ACARS message to the flight at 09:46, [...] "Heard report of incident. Plz confirm all is normal."

[...] When asked if an idea is on paper, he responded, [...] "If you asked each of us {{what we wanted to}} do, you'll get three different answers, which is how the first film was.

2500|$|This {{coincided with}} a [...] {{determined}} effort by the British Raj to discredit the movement {{with the assistance of}} mullahs and ulema allied with the British.

The Mullahs were told that in case of good progress they would also be considered for government pension. A Cunningham policy note of 23 September 1942 reads: 'Continuously preach the danger to Muslims of connivance with the revolutionary Hindu body. Most tribesmen seem to respond to this', while in another paper he says about the period 1939–43: 'Our propaganda {{since the beginning of the}} war had been most successful.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, the ICC began trialling a {{challenge}} system in International Matches. This works as follows; When a {{decision has been made}} by the on-field umpire (either out or not-out), then either the batsmen or fielding player (depending on which way the decision went), can decide to refer the decision to the Third Umpire. This is signalled by making a [...] "T" [...] symbol with the arms. The Third Umpire can then use only basic technology to judge whether there is any reason to overrule the on-field umpires decision. If the Third Umpire decides that the on-field umpire made an incorrect decision then he will inform the on-field umpire, via headsets, of what he has seen <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> either change his decision or to stay with his original decision. This system is normally only used for LBW (to determine if the delivery meets all the LBW criteria) or close catch decisions (to determine if the ball had made contact with the bat or gloves and thus been [...] "hit" [...] and that the ball was caught cleanly).|$|E
2500|$|In May 2013, Farage was {{interrupted}} by protesters during {{a press conference in}} the Canon's Gait pub on Edinburgh's Royal Mile.

Farage made attempts to leave by taxi but was prevented from doing so, and was eventually taken away in an armoured police van while protesters continued to shout. He was trying to raise the profile of UKIP in Scotland ahead of the Aberdeen Donside by-election; the party at that point had no representation in the country, and took 0.91 per cent of the vote in the previous election though it won its first Scottish MEP the following year. During an interview with BBC's Good Morning Scotland radio show, Farage labelled the protesters [...] "yobbo fascist scum" [...] before hanging up, stating that the questions regarding the incident in Edinburgh were insulting and unpleasant.|$|E
