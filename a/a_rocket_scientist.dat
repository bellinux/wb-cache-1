5|$|Fifteen {{characters}} are playable in Crash Team Racing, although only {{eight of them}} are playable from the start. Crash Bandicoot, the main protagonist of the series, is an all-round racer with balanced acceleration, top speed and handling. Doctor Neo Cortex, Crash's archenemy, is a mad scientist who wants to stop Nitros Oxide so that he may conquer the world himself. Like Crash, his kart is an all-round performer. Coco Bandicoot, Crash's younger sister, is a computer genius who installed computer chips into her kart to increase its acceleration prowess. Doctor N. Gin is <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> who, like Coco, added custom parts to his kart to improve its acceleration. Pura and Polar pilot karts with low speed but improved handling, allowing them to navigate tight corners.

5|$|Attending Middleton High School {{alongside}} Ron, {{her best}} female friend Monique and rival schoolmate Bonnie Rockwaller, Kim {{lives with her}} family: father James, <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist,</b> and Ann, a brain surgeon, {{as well as her}} younger brothers, identical twins Jim and Tim, both of whom possess genius-level intellect. Fully aware of their daughter's occupation, Kim's parents remain completely supportive of her crime-fighting endeavors so long as she continues to obey curfew, but tend to be more-so concerned about the character's performance in school, as well as her love life. Lacking a secret identity, Kim is world famous and her profession, although accepted by her peers, is seldom acknowledged by her schoolmates or teachers. Captain of her high school's cheerleading squad, Kim Possible also explores the highs and lows of Kim's life as a high school student attempting to navigate dating, academics, homework, exams and eventually learning to drive, all the while striving to maintain a healthy work-life balance; fighting crime typically comes to Kim more naturally than the more standard components of adolescence.|$|E

His mother, Emmy von Quistorp (1886–1959), could trace her ancestry through both parents to medieval European royalty and was a descendant of Philip III of France, Valdemar I of Denmark, Robert III of Scotland, and Edward III of England. Von Braun had an older brother, the West German diplomat Sigismund von Braun, who served as Secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the 1970s, and a younger brother, also named Magnus von Braun, who was also <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> and later a senior executive with Chrysler.|$|E

500|$|The book {{criticizes the}} {{so-called}} Merchants of Doubt, some predominantly American science key players, above all Bill Nierenberg, Fred Seitz, and Fred Singer. All three are physicists: Singer was <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist,</b> whereas Nierenberg and Seitz {{worked on the}} atomic bomb. They have been active on topics like acid rain, tobacco smoking, global warming and pesticides. The book claims that these scientists have challenged and diluted the scientific consensus in the various fields, as {{of the dangers of}} smoking, the effects of acid rain, the existence of the ozone hole, and the existence of anthropogenic climate change. Seitz and Singer have been involved with institutions such as The Heritage Foundation, Competitive Enterprise Institute and George C. Marshall Institute in the United States. Funded by corporations and conservative foundations, these organizations have opposed many forms of state intervention or regulation of U.S. citizens. The book lists similar tactics in each case: [...] "discredit the science, disseminate false information, spread confusion, and promote doubt".|$|E
500|$|In Pasadena, Cameron {{ran into}} a former colleague, who invited her to visit the large American Craftsman-style house where he was {{currently}} lodging, 1003 Orange Grove Avenue, also known as [...] "The Parsonage". The house was so-called because its lease was owned by Jack Parsons, <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> {{who had been a}} founding member of the JPL and who was also a devout follower of Thelema, a new religious movement founded by English occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904. Parsons was the head of the Agape Lodge, a branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Unbeknownst to Cameron, Parsons had just finished a series of rituals using Enochian magic with his friend and lodger L. Ron Hubbard, all with the intent of attracting an [...] "elemental" [...] woman to be his lover. Upon encountering Cameron with her distinctive red hair and blue eyes, Parsons considered her to be the individual whom he had invoked. After they met at The Parsonage on January 18, 1946, they were instantly attracted to each other and spent the next two weeks in Parsons' bedroom together. Although Cameron was unaware of it, Parsons saw this as a form of sex magic that constituted part of the Babalon Working, a rite to invoke the birth of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth in human form.|$|E
500|$|Kim {{is raised}} in a nuclear family. Unlike popular {{animated}} sitcoms such as The Simpsons and Family Guy, both of Kim's parents are intelligent, accomplished and attractive; Kim's own intelligence is often attributed {{to the fact that}} she is born to <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> father and neurosurgeon mother. Kim's inherent confidence is a Possible family trait; her father James, who views women as equals, proudly reiterates the phrase [...] "Nothing is impossible for a Possible" [...] on numerous occasions. In her younger years, Kim's grandmother [...] "Nana" [...] Possible fought crime much like Kim herself. Kim Possible approaches the subject of the friend zone via Kim and Ron's relationship, discussing male-female friendship in a manner reminiscent to that of the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally... (1989). According to Sarah Freymiller of Bustle, the protagonists friendship evokes that of Batman and the Joker, [...] "Kim holds the functional and social power, while Ron exerts more of a calming, occasionally slapstick influence on the show ... he is the intelligent, kind chaos in her highly-organized life." [...] Kim and Ron are solely platonic friends for the show's first three seasons and remain best friends even after they start dating in Season 4, defying the popular belief that [...] "being romantically involved is worth more than being in a friendship." [...] The series avoids the popular [...] "Will they or won’t they?" [...] trope often used in television shows, keeping them as a couple for the remainder of the series. Having grown up together and learned from each other's mistakes, Kim and Ron ultimately make up for each other's shortcomings. According to Feminist Fairytales, [...] "Ron has a very relaxed attitude towards life which often provides a balance to Kim's assertive nature and perfectionism, while Kim helps Ron become much more independent and self-reliant." [...] Freymiller also believes Ron might have been conceived because [...] "the creators sensed that television would only be able to accept a strong female character if she had a male counterpart," [...] eliminating fears Kim might be perceived as too bitchy, complementing her actions as opposed to dominating.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Norman Davies, von Braun {{was only}} able {{to pursue a career}} as <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> in Germany due to a [...] "curious oversight" [...] in the Treaty of Versailles which did not include rocketry in its list of weapons forbidden to Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Goddard's {{concerns}} about secrecy led to criticism {{for failure to}} cooperate with other scientists and engineers. His approach {{at that time was}} that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support. George Sutton, who became <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> working with von Braun's team in the late 1940s, said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of Goddard or his contributions, and that they would have saved time it they had known the details of his work. Sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for Goddard's patents and depending on the German team for knowledge and guidance; he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the U.S. at that early period, though Germany and the Soviet Union had copies of them. (The Patent Office did not release rocket patents during World War II.) Interestingly, however, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, an offshoot of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech (GALCIT), filed two patent applications in Sep 1943 referencing Goddard's [...] for the multistage rocket.|$|E
