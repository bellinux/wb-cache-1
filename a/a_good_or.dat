5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the definition of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> (<b>or</b> service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would {{tend to have a}} relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E
5|$|Price {{elasticity}} of demand (PED or Ed) {{is a measure}} used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service {{to a change in}} its price, ceteris paribus. More precisely, it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus).|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria's {{relations}} with the Russian Federation are currently on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> fair level. Both countries have had centuries-long interactions, sharing a common heritage. The Cyrillic alphabet originated during 9th century and it was created by Clement and Naum, who were the students of Cyril and Methodius, which later accepted the Orthodox Slavic countries as their standard letter. Relations between Russia and Bulgaria have dated {{back as far as}} the 19th century. Both nations had the tradition of calling monarchs tsars, a Slavic word for caesar or emperor. The Russian Empire was the first country to recognize Bulgaria, and greatly helped Bulgaria in its war of independence from Ottoman Empire in 1908. During the Cold War, Bulgaria became an ally of the Soviet Union as a satellite state. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations between Bulgaria and Russia still share many different opinions, such as the two World Wars when Bulgaria both joined German side against Russia, and the problem over the history.|$|E

25|$|Promotional pricing is a {{temporary}} measure that involves setting prices at levels lower than normally charged for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service.

25|$|For {{reasons of}} tractability, {{it is often}} assumed in neoclassical {{analysis}} that goods and services are continuously divisible. Under this assumption, marginal concepts, including marginal utility, may be {{expressed in terms of}} differential calculus.

25|$|Some {{argue that}} it is {{impossible}} to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the Three Mile Island effect. Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.|$|E

Nine-tailed foxes appear in Chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, in which, depending on the tale can be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> a bad omen.

There can be black markets, where a good is exchanged illegally, for example markets for goods under a command economy despite pressure to repress them, and virtual markets, such as eBay, in which buyers and sellers do not physically interact during negotiation. A market can be organized as an auction, as a private electronic market, as a commodity wholesale market, as a shopping center, as a complex institution such as a stock market, and as an informal discussion between two individuals.|$|E
