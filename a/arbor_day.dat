5|$|Eli Roth's {{contribution}} is a promo for the slasher opus Thanksgiving. Produced {{in the style}} of holiday-themed slasher films like Halloween, Silent Night, Deadly Night, April Fool's Day and My Bloody Valentine, the trailer starred Jeff Rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a pilgrim; Jordan Ladd, Jay Hernandez, and Roth himself as his intended victims; and Michael Biehn as the Sheriff. The design for the titles in Thanksgiving was based on a Mad magazine slasher parody titled <b>Arbor</b> <b>Day.</b> Excerpts of the score from Creepshow were used in the faux trailer.|$|E

60|$|It {{was nearly}} three {{when at last}} I came back into my father's garden. No one had missed me from my room {{and the house was}} all asleep, but I could not get in because I had closed a latch behind me, and so I stayed in the little <b>arbor</b> until <b>day,</b> {{watching}} the day break upon long beaches of pale cloud over the hills towards Alfridsham. I slept at last with my head upon my arms upon the stone table, until the noise of shooting bolts and doors being unlocked roused me to watch my chance and slip back again into the house, and up the shuttered darkened staircase to my tranquil, undisturbed bedroom.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} or three October days when the sea was blue and silver, sharply and brightly {{outlined}} against the far skyline where the deep blue heavens modulated to a filmy turquoise. Gulls followed the furrows of the breakers. Father and Mother paced {{the edge of the}} cliff or sat sun-refreshed in the beloved <b>arbor.</b> Then a <b>day</b> of iron sea, cruelly steel-bright on one side and sullenly black on the other, with broken rolling clouds, and sand whisking along the dunes in shallow eddies; rain coming and the breakers pounding in with a terrifying roar and the menace of illimitable power. Father gathered piles of pine-knots for the fire, whistling as he hacked at them with a dull hatchet--trimming them, not because it was necessary, but because it gave him something energetic to do. Whenever he came into the kitchen with an armful of them he found Mother standing at the window, anxiously watching the flurries of sand and rain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of dietary anise seeds supplementation on growth performance, immune response, some blood parameters and carcass traits of broiler chickens. Two hundred and seventeen <b>Arbor</b> Acre one <b>day</b> old broiler chicks were randomly allotted into 7 groups (31 per each) of mixed sex. Anise seed was supplemented to the basal diet at 0. 0 (control), 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25 and 1. 5 g/kg diet (groups 2 - 7), respectively and the trail was lasted for 6 weeks. The analysis of variance of the data indicated that anise supplementation at 0. 5 and 0. 75 g/kg of diet (groups 3 and 4) significantly (p < 0. 05) improved body weight gain, performance index and relative growth rate of broiler chicken, while had no significant effect on feed intake and feed conversion ratio when compared with the control. Moreover the highest inclusion level of anise (1. 5 g/kg diet) of broiler chicken diet (group 7) reduced growth performance. On the other hand anise supplementation at 0. 5 g/kg (group 3) of broiler diet improve blood picture (RBCs counts, WBCs count, HB and PCV%) clearly than other anise supplementation levels and significantly (p < 0. 05) increased lymphocytes when compared with the control, while anise supplementation in broiler chickens diets increased serum albumin, decreased globulin concentration, increased albumin/globulin ratio, non significantly reduced serum GOT and the lower levels of anise (groups 2 and 3) reduced serum concentration of GPT, glucose, cholesterol while had no effect of seru...|$|R

5000|$|Swarthout was refused for the Army's Officer Candidate School {{because he}} was {{underweight}} at 117 pounds, so the couple both {{went to work at}} Willow Run, the new bomber plant outside of Ann <b>Arbor.</b> Working long <b>days</b> as a riveter on B-24s, he wrote his first novel at night in six months. Willow Run, a story about people working in a bomber factory, was published after a rewrite to mediocre reviews. He always acknowledged his first fiction as his training novel.He was fit enough for an infantry company, however, as the war wore on, and he enlisted in the Army and shipped for Naples as a replacement for the 3rd Division, Audie Murphy's already war-weary outfit. Awaiting the Anzio breakout on the beach in Italy, he was called out of the line, for his Army identification labeled him a [...] "writer" [...] and division headquarters was looking for one. The 3rd Division moved out of Anzio and captured Rome, and Swarthout later landed in the second wave at St. Tropez and saw his only combat for six days with the battle patrol, the advance, probing scout troops of the division, getting eyewitness statements for a couple of posthumous Medals of Honor as the unit moved rapidly north into France. When the 3rd Division was about to invade Germany, Swarthout ruptured a disc in his spine while unloading a truck. He was shipped home a Sergeant and eventually discharged without surgery. Glendon suffered back pain {{for the rest of his}} life and received military disability. He eventually had back surgery in Arizona in his fifties on two imploded spinal discs.|$|R
30|$|For an {{initiative}} {{to be successful}} in Africa like elsewhere, there is first need to understand the society in which it is to be implemented and incorporate it. Good practices can be taken from Egypt where informal sector is working on facilitating the formalising process [5]. This has made it easier for policies to be implemented especially the brown agenda policies. Addis Ababa has also incorporated the poor along with the rich in dealing with greening issues and this can be credited for the success the greening agenda in the housing sector. The poor make up the majority of populations of the cities, {{and the quality of the}} urban economy and environment are shaped by people with middle to low incomes. Given the numbers and needs of the lower income population, it is imperative that they play a central role in planning and implementing urban greening as shown by the initiatives of Addis Ababa Ethiopian and Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development (EiABC) of developing green building codes. Attitudes towards the environment and socio-demographic factors such as age, education determine the success of city greening. These determinants are mainly through the interaction of the households and the environments (i.e. household behaviour and water use, waste generation and recycling and willingness to pay for “environmental” goods). Strengthening people and open space interaction has been a practice that has made the greening a success story in cities of South Africa. To achieve this there are capacity building and empowerment programmes and environmental theme days (Water Week, Wetlands <b>Day,</b> <b>Arbor</b> Week, and Environment Week) [3]. It is critical that a part of any urban greening investment goes toward building local institutional capacity.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} part of 20th century and {{especially}} the period during and after World War II and the Korean War, much of the existing Korean forests were cut down, which led to problems with flooding and soil erosion. Combination of reforestation efforts (e.g. <b>Arbor</b> <b>day</b> was celebrated as a national holiday starting in 1949) and policies designed to reduce use of firewood as a source of energy (e.g. restriction of inflow of firewood into Seoul and other major cities starting in 1958) helped to spark a recovery in the 1950s. Comprehensive reforestation programs starting in the 1970s and continuing into the late 1990s aided in an acceleration of forest volume increase, and the forest cover reached a peak of 65% of national land area in 1980 as opposed to a low of 35% in 1955.|$|E

500|$|With [...] "Trees", Kilmer {{was said}} to have [...] "rediscovered {{simplicity}}", and the simplicity of its message and delivery is a source of its appeal.

The students pointed to [...] "how true the poem is", and it appealed to both her students' [...] "romantic attitude towards nature" [...] and their appreciation of life, nature, solace, and beauty because of its message that [...] "the works of God completely overshadow our own feeble attempts at creation". Considering this sentiment, the enduring popularity of [...] "Trees" [...] is evinced by its association with annual <b>Arbor</b> <b>Day</b> observances and the planting of memorial trees as well as the several parks named in honor of Kilmer, including the Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness and Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest tracts within the Nantahala National Forest in Graham County, North Carolina.|$|E
