5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
25|$|Apparently taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the {{critical}} reception of this novel, and {{the critical}} outcry when {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the next six years before his death.|$|E

25|$|The {{attitude}} of Soviet soldiers was ambiguous. Many committed atrocities, most notably rape and murder, {{and did not}} always distinguish between Poles and Germans, mistreating them equally. Other Soviets, were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the brutal treatment of the German civilians and tried to protect them.|$|E
25|$|Many {{fans of the}} {{original}} Squad Leader game who had looked forward to improvements to the system {{with the release of}} Advanced Squad Leader were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the need to replace the four modules they had bought; only the mapboards of the earlier series were compatible with the new game.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to the U.S., Miller became rabbi of Congregation Agudath Shalom in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Initially, the community was taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> Miller's audacious pedagogy, and {{the sheer volume of}} his Torah presentations, attempting in vain to restrain his unconventional approach. Within a few years however, the community had changed their minds, desiring for Miller to stay longer.|$|E

6000|$|If Polly had {{suddenly}} boxed his ears, Tom {{could n't have}} looked more taken <b>aback</b> than <b>by</b> that burst. He looked at her excited face, seemed to {{understand the meaning of}} it, and remembered all at once {{that he was trying to}} hide behind a girl. He turned scarlet, said shortly, [...] "Come back, Polly," [...] and walked straight out of the room, looking as if going to instant execution, for poor Tom had been taught to fear his father, and had not entirely outgrown the dread.|$|R
25|$|In 1975, CHS {{became the}} first {{alternative}} school in Michigan to receive accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Accreditation officials, according to news reports, were mildly taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the school's eccentricities, questioning {{the lack of any}} non-smoking area within the school and some students' practice of bringing their pets to school.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Nixon {{arranged}} {{an interview}} with British journalist David Frost {{in the hopes of}} improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968, he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lee, {{who was in}} {{his private}} cabin {{at the time of}} the incident, {{immediately}} rushed to the bridge. After a short period, all the ship's mates and helmsmen arrived there as well. Around this time, the chief engineer stopped the engines, although it is unknown whether it was on his own volition or following an order from Captain Lee. At 8:50, the chief engineer ordered an evacuation of the engine room through a call to the assistant engineer. During this time, Park was crying, as she was taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the sudden incident; this lasted until at least 9:06a.m.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} answer--I tell you, sir, I could not answer, so taken <b>aback</b> was I <b>by</b> the {{assurance}} of the woman.

60|$|Stunned {{and terrified}} though poor Mrs Foster was, as she rushed {{about the room}} in search of water and scent-bottles, she was taken <b>aback</b> {{somewhat}} <b>by</b> the warmth of these expressions, which Bax, in {{the strength of his}} feelings, and the excitement of the moment, uttered quite unconsciously. Guy was utterly confounded, for the truth {{now for the first time}} flashed upon him, and when he beheld his friend tenderly press his lips on the fair forehead of the still insensible Amy, it became clear beyond a doubt. Lucy was also amazed, for although she was aware of Amy's love for Bax, she had never dreamed that it was returned.|$|R
5000|$|In the Classic Albums {{documentary}} about the making of A Night at the Opera, Brian May stated that the band was somewhat taken <b>aback</b> at first <b>by</b> the bitterness of Mercury's lyrics, and described by Mercury as being [...] "so vindictive that he May felt bad singing it". After the song came together, {{it was agreed that}} the [...] "author should have his way", and the song was recorded as written.|$|R
25|$|Some {{relatives}} of the victims in the case were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the announcement of a Crown appeal, especially because Attorney-General Wally Oppal had said {{a few days earlier}} that the prosecution would likely not appeal. Although Pickton had been acquitted on the first-degree murder charges, he was convicted of second-degree murder and received the same sentence as he would have on first-degree murder convictions. The {{relatives of}} the victims expressed concern that the convictions would be jeopardized if the Crown argued that the trial judge had made errors. Opposition critic Leonard Krog criticized the Attorney-General for not having briefed the victims’ families in advance.|$|E
25|$|Josh and Babe become close friends. On October 31, 2005, Josh tells Babe that he cannot deny it anymore: he {{is falling}} for her, {{and he wants}} her {{to be happy and}} to enjoy her life and not worry about JR or Jamie anymore. During this talk, they share a kiss. Babe is taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> Josh's declaration. Although she is flattered, she tells him she simply is not ready to be in another romantic relationship. Babe later becomes romantically {{involved}} with JR again, however, which later leads to a murder attempt made on her by JR when he has an extreme mental breakdown.|$|E
25|$|To bring Fanny to her senses, Sir Thomas {{sends her}} for a visit to her parents in Portsmouth, hoping that the {{contrast}} will awaken her {{to the value of}} Henry's offer. She sets off with William and sees him in his first berth as a commissioned officer. At Portsmouth, she develops a firm bond with her younger sister, Susan, but is taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the contrast between her dissolute surroundings — noise, chaos, unpalatable food, crude conversation, and filth everywhere — and the harmonious environment at Mansfield. Henry visits her there. Although Fanny still refuses him, her attitude begins to soften, particularly as Edmund and Mary seem to be moving toward an engagement.|$|E
6000|$|The {{scene at}} Manchester {{last night was}} really magnificent. I had had the {{platform}} carried forward to our [...] "Frozen Deep" [...] point, and my table and screen built in with a proscenium and room scenery. When I went in (there was a very fine hall), they applauded in the most tremendous manner; {{and the extent to}} which they were taken <b>aback</b> and taken <b>by</b> storm by [...] "Copperfield" [...] was really a thing to see.|$|R
6000|$|Chauvelin had {{undoubtedly}} for {{the moment}} lost his presence of mind. He did not even think of calling to his picked guard, so completely taken <b>aback</b> was he <b>by</b> this unforeseen move {{on the part of}} Sir Percy.

Had he not caused the town-crier to loudly proclaim throughout the city that if ONE female prisoner escaped from Fort Gayole the entire able-bodied population of Boulogne would suffer? ...|$|R
6000|$|Tim Rokens was {{for once}} in his life {{completely}} taken <b>aback.</b> He was <b>by</b> nature a stolid man, and not easily put out. He was a shrewd man, too, and did not often commit himself. When he did, he was wont to laugh at himself, and so neutralise the laugh raised against him. But here was a question that was too serious for laughter, and yet one which he could not answer without being self-condemned. He looked gravely in the doctor's face for two minutes without speaking; then he heaved a deep sigh, and said slowly, and with a pause between each word-- ...|$|R
25|$|Doehring, who had {{discounted}} {{the growing}} discontent and longing for peace during the war, was taken completely <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the people's revolutionary riots of 1918. In his {{condemnation of the}} January strikes, Doehring spoke of betrayal {{and may have been}} the first to evoke the stab-in-the-back legend, which held that Germany lost the First World War not for military reasons but due to unpatriotic elements at home. Doehring blamed the subsequent defeat in the war and the following November Revolution and claimed that these events were caused by the decline in Germany's Christian faith and values. For him, most of the blame lay with the Catholic Church and the socialist labor movement. He envisioned a reformation along the lines of Luther's as a solution for Germany.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Stax {{was located}} in Memphis, Tennessee, which was still a {{segregated}} city, where Martin Luther King, Jr., {{a leader of the}} civil rights movement, was assassinated in 1968. Whilst there was much racism around the artists, the Stax recording studio seemed to be an escape from the turmoil of the real world. When the artists got into the studio, they were there for one reason only, and that was to make hit music, some of which had the social consciousness that became a soundtrack for the civil rights movement. On their 1967 tour in Europe, some of the Stax artists were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the welcome that they received, enjoying a better reception in parts of Europe than in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|According to Think Progress, a {{progressive}} news site, conservative blogs say Rowling's revelation about Dumbledore vindicates Jerry Falwell's attacks on homosexuality in children's media that were lambasted by the mass media. [...] "What's stopping her from saying that [...] Neville grows {{up to be}} a paedophile?" [...] said David Baggett, an associate philosophy professor at Falwell's Liberty University's School of Religion. Baggett, who coauthored the book Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts, says he was taken <b>aback</b> not only <b>by</b> Rowling's announcement, but {{by the fact that it}} came on the heels of her confirming many Potter fans' belief that the series had Christian themes.|$|R
50|$|Their {{relationship}} would be {{challenged by the}} news that Steve had a wife. While taken <b>aback</b> and hurt <b>by</b> the news, Kayla continued the relationship. Then Kayla's boyfriend, Jack, shows up. Jack is madly in lovely with Kayla but Kayla does not return the feelings. Jack hopefully pursued Kayla because he thought eventually he would win her over. The Deveraux Family hired Kayla to be Jack's private nurse when {{he was diagnosed with}} Hodgkin's Disease and quite ill. Steve learned the truth that Jack was his own brother, Billy. When he did, he shunned Kayla, hoping she would end up with Jack so his brother would have someone special with whom to spend his seemingly final days. Believing Steve was no longer interested in her, Kayla accepted a marriage proposal from Jack.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George is so entirely {{overcome}} {{at first}} by this prospect that he resists the proposed honour with great earnestness. Being overborne, however, {{by his brother}} and his nephew--concerning whom he renews his protestations that he never could have thought {{they would have been}} half so glad to see him--he is taken home to an elegant house in all the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture of the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their children. Here Mr. George is much dismayed by the graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are and by the beauty of Rosa, his niece that is to be, and by the affectionate salutations of these young ladies, which he receives in a sort of dream. He is sorely taken <b>aback,</b> too, <b>by</b> the dutiful behaviour of his nephew and has a woeful consciousness upon him of being a scapegrace. However, there is great rejoicing and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment, and Mr. George comes bluff and martial through it all, and his pledge to be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received with universal favour. A whirling head has Mr. George that night when he lies down in the state-bed of his brother's house to think of all these things and to see the images of his nieces (awful all the evening in their floating muslins) waltzing, after the German manner, over his counterpane.|$|R
25|$|Another {{featured}} {{character is}} Erin Silver (who goes by her last name), Kelly Taylor and David Silver's half sister and Naomi's former best friend, until Silver's father's affair is revealed by Naomi, although she eventually reconciles her friendship with Naomi. She quickly befriends Annie and starts dating Dixon, who is somewhat taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> her not-so-90210 lifestyle, {{as she is}} a virgin who doesn't care about popularity. In a multi-episode arc that culminated in a very special episode, it is revealed that Silver has bipolar disorder. Kelly Taylor is now a guidance counselor at West Beverly and has a son named Sammy. Kelly becomes Silver's guardian after their mother proves to be an inadequate caretaker for Silver due to her alcoholism. Kelly briefly dates Ryan, but discovers that he also slept with Brenda, re-creating the rift between the two friends. Following Brenda's discovery that she cannot have children, however, the women are drawn together in an accord once again.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer {{by signing}} {{a number of}} English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, {{although}} Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig's Sussex team on 7–10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig's house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he was taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> {{the severity of the}} condemnation and vitriol that poured in his direction. His central role in the organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance and surely conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.|$|E
25|$|The book {{created a}} {{reaction}} in China, sparking follow-up essays by Chinese writers who were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the Phan's description of Vietnamese life under French colonial rule. It generated gloomy pieces by Chinese writers who predicted that their nation would suffer {{a similar fate}} if they failed to modernize. One such Chinese response later became a teaching text at the Tonkin Free School in Hanoi, a school run by Phan's contemporaries to promote the independence movement. However, Phan did not receive much of a reaction in terms of aid towards his independence efforts, since the book made Chinese readers worry about their own future. The book had a much better reception among Vietnamese readers. Phan and a colleague, Đặng Tử Kính, left Japan {{for the first time}} in August 1905, carrying 50 copies of the book that were to distributed throughout Vietnam, of which further copies were made inside the country. Phan's direct writing style, without the use of allegories, upset traditionalists but made the book more accessible to literate people who had not been trained in classical literature.|$|E
5000|$|He {{is widely}} {{well known for}} signing, developing, and {{nurturing}} the careers of Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Gloria Estefan, Destiny's Child, Anastacia, Shakira, the Dixie Chicks, etc., and for releasing digitally remastered compact discs of the older recordings made by Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Andy Williams, among others. He also is credited with creating the [...] "Latin Explosion" [...] in popular music by championing such Sony artists as Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. He also worked with Michael Jackson {{from the time he}} began recording his [...] "Dangerous" [...] (1991) album. During the promotion of [...] "Invincible" [...] (2001), Jackson would later state that his relationship with Mottola dissolved based on corruption in Mottola's working practices, and once charged him with being a [...] "racist who exploited black talent". Jackson has stated later on that, [...] "The recording companies really, really do conspire against the artists." [...] Al Sharpton told the New York Post shortly after that, “I have known Tommy for 15 or 20 years, and never once have I known him to say or do anything that would be considered racist". He admitted he was “taken <b>aback</b> and surprised” <b>by</b> the verbal assault. “In fact, he’s always been supportive of the black music industry,” Sharpton said. “He was the first record executive to step up and offer to help us with respect to corporate accountability, when it comes to black music issues.” ...|$|R
60|$|This {{singular}} {{conversation was}} interrupted by a toast, and the rising of one of the guests to answer it. Several other toasts of routine succeeded; one of which, being to the honor of the old founder of the Hospital, Lord Braithwaite, as his representative, rose to reply,-- which he did in good phrases, in a sort of eloquence unlike that of the Englishmen around him, and, sooth to say, comparatively unaccustomed as he must have been {{to the use of the}} language, much more handsomely than they. In truth, Redclyffe was struck and amused with the rudeness, the slovenliness, the inartistic quality of the English speakers, who rather seemed to avoid grace and neatness of set purpose, as if they would be ashamed of it. Nothing could be more ragged than these utterances which they called speeches; so patched, and darned; and yet, somehow or other--though dull and heavy as all which seemed to inspire them--they had a kind of force. Each man seemed to have the faculty of getting, after some rude fashion, at the sense and feeling that was in him; and without glibness, without smoothness, without form or comeliness, still the object with which each one rose to speak was accomplished,--and what was more remarkable, it seemed to be accomplished without the speaker's having any particular plan for doing it. He was surprised, too, to observe how loyally every man seemed to think himself bound to speak, and rose to do his best, however unfit his usual habits made him for the task. Observing this, and thinking how many an American would be taken <b>aback</b> and dumbfounded <b>by</b> being called on for a dinner speech, he could not but doubt the correctness of the general opinion, that Englishmen are naturally less facile of public speech than our countrymen.|$|R
60|$|Sir Francis, when {{he found}} himself alone, shook himself, as it were, as he rose from the sofa, and looked about the room in amazement. It was quite true that she was gone--gone, {{as far as he}} was concerned, for ever. It did not occur to him for a moment that there could be any {{reconciliation}} between them, and his first feeling undoubtedly was one of amazed disappointment. Then, standing there in Mrs. Holt's drawing-room, he began to bethink himself what could have been the cause of it. Since the first week of his engagement he had begun and had continued to tell himself what great things he was about to do for Cecilia Holt. With her beauty, her grace, her dignity, and her accomplishments he was quite satisfied. It was expedient that he should marry, and he did not know that he could marry much better. Cecilia, when her mother died, would have twenty thousand pounds, and that in his eyes had been sufficient. But he was about to make her Lady Geraldine, and the more that he thought of this, the more grateful it had appeared to him that she should be to him. Then by degrees, while he had expected from her expressions of gratitude, she had rebelled against him! Of the meaning of this he had not been quite conscious, but had nevertheless felt it necessary that he should dominate her spirit. Up to the moment in which this interview had begun he had thought that he was learning to do so. She had not dared to ask him questions which would have been so natural, or to demand from him services to which she was entitled. It was thus that he had regarded her conduct. But he had never feared for a moment but that he was on the road to success. Up to the moment at which he had entered the room he had thought that he was progressing favourably. His Cecilia was becoming tame in his hands, as was necessary. He had then been altogether taken <b>aback</b> and surprised <b>by</b> her statement to him, and could not for some moments get over his feeling of amazement. At last he uttered a low whistle, and then walked slowly out of the house. At the front door he found his horse, and, mounting it, rode back into Exeter. As he did so he began to inquire of himself whether this step which the girl had determined to take was really a misfortune to him or the reverse. He had hardly as yet asked himself any such question since the day on which he had first become engaged to her. He had long thought of marrying, and one girl after another had been rejected by him as he had passed them in review through his thoughts. Then had come Cecilia's turn, and she had seemed to answer the purpose. There had been about her an especial dignity which had suited his views of matrimonial life. She was a young woman as to whom all his friends would say that he had done well in marrying her. But by degrees there had come upon him a feeling of the general encumbrance of a wife. Would she not interfere with him? Would she not wish to hinder him when he chose to lead a bachelor's life? Newmarket for instance, and his London clubs, and his fishing in Norway,--would she not endeavour to set her foot upon them? Would it not be well that he should teach her that she would not be allowed to interfere? He had therefore begun to teach her,--and this had come of it! It had been quite unexpected, but still he felt as though he were released from a burden.|$|R
