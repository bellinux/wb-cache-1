INTRODUCTION: The objective of this analysis was to explore the potential association between jaw surgery (as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> for osteonecrosis <b>of</b> the jaw) and the use of oral bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women. METHODS: A claims database was used to identify female patients > or = 45 years of age with jaw surgery claims from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005. Four controls (patients with no claims for jaw surgery) were matched to each jaw surgery case. Additional patient data collected included oral bisphosphonate prescriptions (including alendronate, risedronate, or ibandronate) and comorbid conditions. RESULTS: A total of 697 jaw surgery cases and 2, 808 controls were identified. Of those jaw surgery cases, 96 (13. 8 %) received at least one prescription for an oral bisphosphonate. After adjustment for confounding variables, receiving at least one oral bisphosphonate prescription was not shown to significantly increase the risk of jaw surgery (odds ratio(adjusted) = 0. 91; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 70 - 1. 19). When bisphosphonate use was stratified by duration on therapy, no significant increases in the risk of jaw surgery were observed in any group.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Monitoring and {{preserving}} adequate perfusion and oxygen balance {{is a primary}} objective of critical care. This prospective observational study aimed to assess the relationship between global haemodynamic parameters and variables reflecting tissue oxygen-ation during the early period following corrective cardiac surgery in neonates and infants. The postoperative time course of oxygen deliv-ery and consumption was evaluated. <b>As</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> oxygen balance, the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) and venoarterial PCO 2 difference (PvaCO 2) were thoroughly investigated. METHODS: Thirteen children < 1 year of age who underwent open-heart surgery were prospectively enrolled. In addition to conventional postoperative monitoring, transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) was used to monitor cardiac output and calculate oxygen delivery and consumption. In parallel with each TPTD measurement, arterial and central venous blood gas values were recorded. Global haemodynamic parameters and oxygenation measurements were compared with weighted linear regression statistics and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Data from 145 TPTD measurements and 304 blood gas samples were recorded. The early postoperative period was characterized by a supply-dependent oxygen consumption, {{as demonstrated by the}} direct correlation between the change in oxygen delivery and con-sumption (r = 0. 62, P < 0. 001). Regarding haemodynamic parameters, none of the heart rate, mean arterial pressure or cardiac index corre-lated with the measured ScvO 2.

40|$|Background: Diabetic {{nephropathy}} (DN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important complications of diabetes mellitus. Now-a-days, cystatin C (CysC) is introduced as a new <b>marker</b> for diagnosis <b>of</b> renal damages; however, use <b>of</b> this <b>marker</b> in clinical laboratories is still controversial. The present study was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum CysC for early detection or monitoring treatment of kidney damages in the Kurdish people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Materials and Methods: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Serum CysC and urine microalbumin were also measured in 126 diabetic and healthy subjects. Blood glycated hemoglobin (Hb) also measured in all healthy and diabetic patients. Two independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, one-way ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis test, as well as Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficient statistical tests were used as appropriate. Results: Serum CysC was higher (1312. 41 ng/ml) in diabetic patients with GFR < 60 ml/min than other subjects (993. 25 ng/ml) (patients with normal kidney function and healthy subjects). A borderline significant correlation between CysC and estimating GFR (rs = − 0. 16, P = 0. 05) but highly significant with microalbumin (rs = 0. 22, P = 0. 014) was observed. Serum CysC sensitivity, negative and positive predictive values were 100 and 4 %. Conclusion: CysC cover variation of GFR and urine microalbumin, but it cannot be used as <b>a</b> <b>surrogating</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> glycated Hb. According to our results, it seems that serum CysC is a useful <b>marker</b> for screening <b>of</b> DN; but it cannot be used for monitoring of treatment in diabetic patients...|$|R
