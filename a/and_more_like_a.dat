25|$|Public {{transportation}} is currently {{served by the}} commuter boat ferry service from the Hingham Shipyard to Rowes Wharf in downtown Boston, the MBTA's Bus Route 220, with Route 222 also passing through a small section of town, and the MBTA Commuter Rail to Boston South Station. Commuter rail has been restored along the Greenbush Line through Hingham. Trains stop at two stations in town; West Hingham and Nantasket Junction. As part of the MBTA's agreement to restore train service, a tunnel has been built to carry the commuter trains under historic Hingham Square. There were disputes in Hingham about whether to allow the train {{to pass through the}} town. Some people felt that Hingham is becoming less like a town <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small city. Others felt that the line will benefit the town. Ferries also run from Hingham Shipyard to several islands in Boston Harbor during the summer as well as to Pemberton Point, Hull. There is no air service in the town; the nearest airport is Logan International Airport in Boston as well as smaller public airports in Norwood and Marshfield.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to many of}} {{the other}} depictions of Arthur's story, the Alliterative Morte Arthure is a {{relatively}} realistic version of events. There are few of the fantastical elements which often surround the legend and the story focuses more on Arthur's skill as a warrior king. The stress placed on chivalric duty in the contemporary Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is in the Morte Arthure of a more practical nature and {{has more to do with}} personal loyalty. Also the Morte Arthure is less clearly part of the romance genre than Sir Gawain and other Arthurian poems <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chronicle of the times. It contains little of the magic and symbolism of these other works, with no mention of Merlin, although it does use the literary device of the dream vision common in courtly romance and Chaucer. (In this case, however, the dream vision of a dragon (representing Arthur) fighting a monster is more clearly derived from the Dream of Mordecai in one of the longer Greek versions of the Book of Esther.) Arthur is a more political and also flawed ruler, the story is not just based in a small realm but is always placed within a wider European situation and this Arthur is more clearly Christian than other versions. Arthur also has two legendary swords, the first being Excalibur (referred to as Caliburn, an earlier name of the sword), and the second one being Clarent, a formal sword, stolen by the evil Mordred, with which Arthur receives his fatal blow close to the banks of the Tamar.|$|E

500|$|During {{his final}} years, Nielsen {{produced}} a short book of essays entitled Living Music (1925), followed in 1927 by his memoir Min Fynske Barndom. In 1926 {{he wrote in}} his diary [...] "My home soil pulls me more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> long sucking kiss.

500|$|Hadropithecus stenognathus {{has been}} {{estimated}} to have weighed between [...] and to have been roughly as large as Archaeolemur, although more gracile. Newer subfossil finds, however, suggest that Hadropithecus {{may have been more}} robust, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gorilla than a baboon. It may also have been less agile than Old World monkeys. Both lemurs were quadrupedal (walked on four legs). There is no evidence of cursoriality (adaptations specifically for running) in either species, and although Hadropithecus could have climbed trees, it lacked adaptations for leaping or suspension.|$|E
500|$|Farr saw the 1946 colour version as poorer {{than the}} black and white original; he said it had lost its [...] "vibrancy" [...] and [...] "atmosphere", and that the new {{depiction}} of the Congolese landscape was unconvincing <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> European zoo than the [...] "parched, dusty expanses of reality". Peeters took a more positive attitude towards the 1946 version, commenting that it contained [...] "aesthetic improvements" [...] and [...] "clarity of composition" [...] because of Hergé's personal development in draughtsmanship, as well as an enhancement in the dialogue, which had become [...] "more lively and fluid." ...|$|E

500|$|The multitudinous {{allusions to}} {{well-known}} and lesser-known books, movies and sayings cause contradicting receptions. While Heinz Gerstinger and Ingrid Reichel explicitly highlight the comical {{effect of the}} insinuations, the German critic Steffen Roye regards them as sometimes [...] "exaggerated" [...] and says, [...] "As the story develops, it becomes more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> revue." [...] The numerous expressions in foreign languages, especially in Latin, remain untranslated in the first edition. In her review, Ingrid Reichel invites the publisher to add a glossary to a new edition. The author subsequently released such a glossary on his own website.|$|E
500|$|Shane Black {{described}} {{his take on}} the film as not being [...] "two men in iron suits fighting each other," [...] <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Tom Clancy thriller," [...] with Iron Man fighting real-world type villains. Drew Pearce added that they would avert magic and space, with Iron Man 3 being [...] "a techno-thriller set in a more real world than even The Avengers." [...] The duo spent some time discussing themes and images and ideas before starting the script. While writing, the focus was to avoid scenes of pure exposition, making every moment propel other narrative points forwards. Some elements from the comics were used even if in different connotations, such as making Rhodes wear Norman Osborn's Iron Patriot armor, and naming some characters with names from unrelated people in the Marvel Universe, such as Eric Savin and Jack Taggart.|$|E
500|$|McDiarmid's {{performance}} as Palpatine was generally well received by critics. Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "Entertaining {{from start to}} finish and even enthralling at times, 'Sith' has some acting worth writing home about, specifically McDiarmid's dominant turn as the mastermind of the evil empire." [...] A reviewer for The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Ian McDiarmid's unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life." [...] Still, his performance was not without detractors; David Edelstein of Slate critiqued, [...] "McDiarmid isn't the subtlest of satanic tempters. With his lisp and his clammy little leer, he looks like an old queen keen on trading an aging butt-boy (Count Dooku) for fresh meat [...] which leaves Anakin looking more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 15-watt bulb." [...] McDiarmid had expressed interest in reprising the role of Palpatine in the planned [...] TV series, which remains unproduced.|$|E

500|$|Victor {{was noted}} for his {{controversial}} relationship {{with both of}} his sons' ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), with whom he initially had a [...] father-daughter relationship. In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss, causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to [...] "find herself". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011. Case stated that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor [...] "in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hero", also stating that Victor is Sharon's [...] "security blanket". The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011, and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after. However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps In Depth that he was [...] "always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad", and that [...] "there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger". Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating that, [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{three to}} four months of Lucas {{beginning}} the writing process, Chiang and his design team started a two-year process of reviewing thousands of designs for the film. Chiang stated that Lucas intended Episode I to be stylistically different from the other Star Wars films; it would be [...] "richer <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> period piece, since it was the history leading up to A New Hope". The three planets on which the story takes placesome with varied environments such as the human and Gungan cities of Naboo and three buildings in Coruscant. With the exception of the Gungan city, which had an art nouveau-inspired visual, these locations would be given distinctive looks with some basis in the real world. The concept drawings of Ralph McQuarrie for the original trilogy served as the basis for Mos Espawhich was also inspired by old Tunisian hotels and buildings and had touches such as a market place to differentiate it from A New Hopes Mos Eisleyand Coruscant, in particular a metropolis design which became the basis for the Senate. Bocquet would later develop the work of Chiang's team and design the interiors, translating the concepts into construction blueprints with environments and architectural styles that had some basis in reality [...] "to give the audience something to key into". Some elements were directly inspired by the original trilogy; Lucas described the battle droids as predecessors to the Stormtroopers. Chiang uses that orientation to base the droids on the Imperial soldiers, only in the same style of stylized and elongated features seen in tribal African art.|$|E
500|$|Carl Swanson of New York {{magazine}} was {{amazed by the}} ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that [...] " [...] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras {{as well as those}} of the feverishly Instagramming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it." [...] However, he noticed a bit of [...] "vulnerability" [...] in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as [...] "borderline gibberish", adding that: [...] "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to something bigger than herself, something less evanescent than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that [...] "nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness." [...] Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the [...] "underwhelming display" [...] of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about [...] "changing the world" [...] with the album and the technology were [...] "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> farce, [...] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'." ...|$|E
