5|$|The minimum central {{pressure}} of these storms is, {{for the most}} part, estimated from satellite imagery using the Dvorak technique. In the case of Kenna, Ava, <b>and</b> <b>Patricia,</b> the central pressure was measured by hurricane hunter aircraft flying into the storm. Because of the estimation of central pressures, {{it is possible that}} other storms more intense than these have formed.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} {{estimating}} the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) {{is the fact}} that most of these storms did not threaten land. As Kenna <b>and</b> <b>Patricia</b> were threatening land, their pressures were measured by Hurricane Hunters using dropsondes. While Hurricane Ava never threatened land, it too was flown into by Hurricane Hunters to test equipment and conduct research.|$|E

5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul <b>and</b> <b>Patricia</b> Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Guillermo's central {{pressure}} of 919mbar (hPa; 27.14inHg) established {{it as the}} second most intense Pacific hurricane on record behind Hurricane Ava of 1973. However, later in the 1997 season, Hurricane Linda set a new intensity record, and in subsequent years hurricanes Kenna, Ioke, Rick, Marie, Odile <b>and</b> <b>Patricia</b> all achieved lower pressures, leaving Guillermo in ninth place. Guillermo persisted for 16.5 days from its classification as a tropical depression to its transition into an extratropical storm, making it the sixth longest-lasting storm in the basin.|$|E

5|$|Hurricanes {{have reached}} Category5 {{intensity}} during every month from June to October. The earliest Category5 {{to form in}} a season is 1973's Hurricane Ava, which formed on June7. The latest Category5 to form in a season is Hurricane Kenna, which reached peak intensity on October 24. Hurricanes Ava, Gilma, Ioke, Linda, <b>and</b> <b>Patricia</b> are the most intense storms to form in their respective months. There have been no May, November, or off-season Category5 hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|In Islam: The Untold Story, Holland {{deals with}} {{the origins of the}} {{religion}} Islam. Travelling to Saudi Arabia, he visits Arabian Bedouins to hear their orthodox Islamic accounts of the religion's origins. Holland then talks to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a practising Muslim who teaches Islamic studies at the George Washington University, Washington D.C., <b>and</b> <b>Patricia</b> Crone, a non-Muslim historian of Islamic history at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. The former defends the orthodox Islamic account of the faith's history, citing its development within oral history, but Crone challenges the reliability of oral history, and therefore the traditional account.|$|E
5|$|Late on October23, {{dramatic}} weakening ensued <b>and</b> <b>Patricia</b> made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with {{winds of}} 150mph (240km/h). This {{made it the}} strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly, faster than it had intensified, as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico. Within 24hours of moving ashore, Patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter, late on October24.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland <b>and</b> <b>Patricia</b> Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
