For example, sales returns and allowance and sales discounts are contra revenues with respect to sales, as the balance of each contra (a debit) is the opposite of sales (a credit).

Incorporation with limited liability enabled companies to ‘lock-in’ their financial capital’ and then invest in the long-term, highly specific investments on which the modern industrial economy would be based. The level of benefit varied from country to country, according to the way that the concept of capital lock-in, or maintenance, was defined in the legal systems concerned. In the UK, the concept was not well defined in early company legislation and challenges were raised through the courts during the late nineteenth century. Some of these, the ‘dividend cases’, have been quite widely considered in the literature but direct reductions of share capital, or capital reduction schemes, have received far less attention, even though they raised fundamental issues concerning long-term dividend positions, the accounting treatment of <b>accumulated</b> losses, <b>depreciation</b> and asset values and had important effects {{on the development of the}} capital maintenance doctrine and on shareholder class rights.

5000|$|... ===Accumulated {{depreciation}}=== While {{depreciation expense}} is recorded on {{the income statement}} of a business, its impact is generally recorded in a separate account and disclosed on the balance sheet as <b>accumulated</b> <b>depreciation,</b> under fixed assets, according to most accounting principles. <b>Accumulated</b> <b>depreciation</b> {{is known as a}} contra account, because it separately shows a negative amount that is directly associated with another account.|$|E
50|$|Without an <b>accumulated</b> <b>{{depreciation}}</b> account on {{the balance}} sheet, depreciation expense is usually charged against the relevant asset directly. The values of the fixed assets stated {{on the balance}} sheet will decline, even if the business has not invested in or disposed of any assets. The amounts will roughly approximate fair value. Otherwise, depreciation expense is charged against <b>accumulated</b> <b>depreciation.</b> Showing <b>accumulated</b> <b>depreciation</b> separately on the balance sheet {{has the effect of}} preserving the historical cost of assets on the balance sheet. If there have been no investments or dispositions in fixed assets for the year, then the values of the assets will be the same on the balance sheet for the current and prior year (P/Y).|$|E

For Section 1250 assets (real estate), Recaptured Depreciation is defined as [...] "Additional Depreciation" [...] in IRS Publication 544 (see column 3 on page 30 of the 2016 version of this publication). Additional Depreciation is the portion of <b>Accumulated</b> <b>Depreciation</b> in excess of straight line.

Prior to 1971, these deductions could be computed in a variety of manners over a wide range of lives, under old Bulletin F. In 1971, Congress introduced the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) system in an attempt to simplify calculations and provide some uniformity. Under ADR, the IRS prescribed lives for classes of assets based on the nature or use of the asset. Such classes included general classes (such as office equipment) and industry classes (such as assets used in the manufacture of rubber goods). Taxpayers could use their choice of several methods of depreciating assets, including straight line, declining balance, and sum of years digits. Asset costs and <b>accumulated</b> <b>depreciation</b> were tracked by “vintage accounts” consisting of all assets within a class acquired in a particular tax year.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a conceptual framework}} for an accounting of the municipal real property, and defines a respective system of indicators. The development of this framework {{is seen as an}} important prerequisite for the efficient property management. It aims to overcome the lack or poor accessibility of the information, and thus to ensure the successful municipal real property management in a strategic context. The developing of the applied approach implies that accounting indicators are divided into three main groups – values, revenues, and costs. Beside the above mentioned classification, the municipal revenues and costs are classified also as existing and proposed. The existing indicators are defined by International Accounting Standards in public sector, {{and some of them are}} considered as being appropriate for the inclusion in the financial analysis as accounting system entries. The proposed indicators are perceived as appropriate to carry out a detailed analysis of the municipal property at a lower level of desegregations. The first two paragraphs explain the main bases for the municipal property valuation - historical cost, current price, market value, present value, with a special emphasis on the use of the historical value, and the types of valuation respectively. The next three paragraphs are concentrated mainly on the accounting indicators for the municipal property assessment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} normative capital maintenance model for depreciable assets during a time of inflation. This model is developed on a stipulated physical capital maintenance concept that <b>accumulated</b> <b>depreciation</b> {{at the end of an}} asset 2 ̆ 7 s useful life should be equal to the funds required to replace the asset with a new one of comparable capacity. The soundness of this stipulation is supported by analyses of widely publicized theoretical models and promulgations of standards setting bodies in several countries. A key innovative factor in the model is provision for backlog depreciation as a charge against income. Backlog depreciation is the difference between the depreciation charges that would otherwise be made over the life of the asset and its net replacement cost. The model is developed first for a simple situation where depreciable assets are purchased from a local market. This permits demonstration of the efficacy of backlog depreciation and other somewhat innovative factors. Cognizance is then taken of the following features of the international trade for depreciable assets: (a) the country that is self-sufficient in depreciable assets does not exist in contemporary economic life, (b) different countries experience different inflation rates, and (c) the exchange rates between currencies fluctuate through time. The model is, accordingly, extended to cope with depreciable assets purchased from a foreign country by adding: (1) the price increase of the asset in a foreign market, and (2) the changes in the exchange rates between currencies as two vital dimensions in the model. Each of the following situations involving foreign exchange and acquisition of depreciable assets from another country is analyzed under the extended model: (1) forward exchange rate with fixed or certain prices, (2) forward exchange rate with uncertain changing prices, and (3) current spot trade with uncertain changing prices. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Earnings Management (EM) is {{an effort}} {{performed}} by company management as financial report issuer on purpose to influence the readers and stakeholders behavior who rely on financial reports as their primary information source, in accordance with firm managements’ direction.   EM motivations may vary, from remuneration reason, merger and acquisition event, to comply with particular requirement and regulation, to initial public offering (IPO) motivation. This study revealed EM effort in IPO event due to management motivation to demonstrate good performance to public before and during such activity. This study took 50 IPO firms listed at Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) within 1998 - 2002. EM detection adopted Modified Jones Model as a powerful model to detect EM. Test result proved that EM was occurred on JSX IPO firms as stated by positive discretionary accruals (DA).                  Further study tried to reveal accounts used as EM tools. This study utilized linear regression with DA as fixed variable to indicate EM and predicted accounts on financial reports used as way to do EM as explanatory variables. Such explanatory variables are account receivable, account payable, inventory, accrued liability, <b>accumulated</b> <b>depreciation,</b> expenses (selling and general administrative) and other income (expense). Test result showed that only two variables statistically significant to dependent variable, i. e. DA, they were account receivable and account payable. This result supports a study by Marquardt and Wiedman (2002) who found that EM during IPO activity was influenced by account receivable in positive direction. However, this study does not support Wiedyaningdyah (2001) who concluded IPO activity in JSX during 1994 - 1997 was significantly influenced by liability (leverage). This study recommends investors or any other parties who rely on firm financial report during IPO activity on JSX to behave more conservative on net income as reported by related firms and considers account receivable and account payable as accounts need to be reviewed prior to any economical decision making related to the financial reports.
