5|$|During Milhail Kogălniceanu's lifetime, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; {{in his speech}} to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> exact birth date as present in a register kept by his father. It was also then that he mentioned his godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and {{was the mother of}} Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu's would-be protector and foe).|$|E
5|$|Game {{one took}} place at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana, Cuba, on March 28, 1999. Tickets were {{distributed}} by invitation only. Angelos, Selig, and Castro sat together in box seats. One hundred schoolchildren from the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area also traveled to Cuba on a plane chartered by Angelos. Before the game, players and coaches on both teams engated in a flag ceremony. Castro greeted the Orioles on the field, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> Cuban team a pep talk. Cuban baseball legend Conrado Marrero threw out the first pitch.|$|E

5|$|Louis VIII died in 1226, {{leaving his}} 12-year-old son, Louis IX, to inherit the throne, {{supported}} by a regency government. The young French King was in a much weaker position than his father, and faced opposition {{from many of the}} French nobility who still maintained their ties to England, leading to a sequence of revolts across the country. Against this background, in late 1228 a group of potential Norman and Angevin rebels called upon Henry to invade and reclaim his inheritance, and Peter de Dreux, the Duke of Brittany, openly revolted against Louis <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> homage to Henry.|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila {{told him that}} he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 1942, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C.

Somervell, now the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, and Styer drew up a plan for a new, overarching logistics command initially known as the Services of Supply. Their proposal was accepted, and the new command was created on 28 February 1942.|$|E

The Argives sent ambassadors to both kings, beseeching them to respect the city's neutrality. Antigonus agreed to the Argives' terms <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> son as a hostage in order to demonstrate his sincerity. While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos, he failed to give a pledge {{and as a result}} was regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Smetana was {{naturally}} gifted as a composer, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> {{first public}} {{performance at the}} age of 6. After conventional schooling, he studied music under Josef Proksch in Prague. His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising, in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for Sweden, where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg, and began to write large-scale orchestral works. During this period of his life Smetana was twice married; of six daughters, three died in infancy.|$|E
5|$|The US Chief of Army Staff, General Martin Dempsey, said Pakistan's {{anger was}} {{justified}} {{as it had}} {{a reason to be}} furious given the loss of life. However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying he did not know enough about the incident and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> condolences over the deaths of soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Desha {{returned}} to Kentucky after the congressional session. He responded to Governor Isaac Shelby's call for volunteers {{to serve in}} William Henry Harrison's campaign into Upper Canada. He was commissioned a major general and given command of the 2nd Division of Kentucky militia. The 3,500-man division, composed of the 2nd and 5th Brigades and the 11th Regiment, assembled on the Ohio River at Newport, Kentucky. They joined Harrison in forcing the British retreat from Detroit and held the Indian allies of the British off his left flank during the American victory at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813. According to historian Bennett H. Young, Desha's old friend William Whitley had a premonition of his own death {{the night before the}} battle <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> rifle and powderhorn to Desha, asking him to convey it to his widow, along with a message of his affection. Whitley was indeed killed in the fighting the following day.|$|E
5|$|Early in his minor hockey years, Crosby began {{attracting}} {{media attention}} for his play <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> first newspaper interview at age seven. When Crosby was 13, Nova Scotia's Minor Hockey Council {{refused to allow}} him to play midget, a level of minor hockey designated for 15- to 17-year-olds. His family sued but lost. The following year, he entered the midget level with the triple-A Dartmouth Subways and went on to score a combined 217 regular season and playoff points, leading Dartmouth to a second-place finish at the 2002 Air Canada Cup. He was named the MVP and Top Scorer awards at the national tournament at the tournament banquet held after the preliminary round and he finished the tournament with 24 points (11 goals and 13 assists) in 7 games. Crosby was called up as a 14-year-old to play two games with the Maritime Junior A Hockey League's Truro Bearcats that season. Crosby had been drafted by the Bearcats in the 2001 MJAHL Draft as a 13-year-old.|$|E
5|$|In {{his reelection}} as the Second District congressman, Jennings {{supported}} tariff protection and internal improvements {{and vowed to}} support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for {{a victory in the}} next election.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the asked-for legate for Cappadocia had arrived, in {{the person}} of Lucius Caesennius Paetus, the consul of the {{previous}} year (61 AD). The army was divided between him and Corbulo, with IV Scythica, XII Fulminata, the newly arrived V Macedonica and the auxiliaries from Pontus, Galatia and Cappadocia going to Paetus, while Corbulo retained III Gallica, VI Ferrata and X Fretensis. Because of their antagonism for glory, the relations between the two Roman commanders were strained from the beginning. It is notable that Corbulo kept the legions he had spent the past few years campaigning with, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> colleague, who after all was expected to conduct the main campaign, the more inexperienced units. The total Roman force arrayed against the Parthians was nevertheless considerable: the six legions alone totaled some 30,000 men. The exact number and disposition of auxiliary units is unclear, but there were seven cavalry alae and seven infantry cohorts in Syria alone, comprising a force of 7-9,000 troops.|$|E
5|$|Remaining at Rhodes {{during the}} 1940 {{academic}} year, Smith secretly {{made plans to}} leave for military service {{in spite of his}} instructions to finish studying. In June 1940, during the mid-year break from studies, he quietly travelled to the Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, to tell the colony's director of manpower, William Addison, that he wanted to join the air force; to avoid being barred from enlistment, Smith did not mention his university attendance, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> Selukwe address. During his Christmas vacation at the end of 1940, Smith went to Salisbury again, and was successful in a second interview with an air force official and a physical examination. Early in 1941, having received his pilot course call-up papers, Smith underwent a final interview, during which it emerged that he was a university student; the interviewer briefly demurred, but accepted Smith when he insisted that he wanted to sign up.|$|E

Leaving South Africa in secret via Bechuanaland, on his way Mandela visited Tanganyika and met with its president, Julius Nyerere. Arriving in Ethiopia, Mandela met with Emperor Haile Selassie I, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> speech after Selassie's at the conference. After the symposium, he travelled to Cairo, Egypt, admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{and then went to}} Tunis, Tunisia, where President Habib Bourguiba gave him £5,000 for weaponry. He proceeded to Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal, receiving funds from Liberian President William Tubman and Guinean President Ahmed Sékou Touré. Leaving Africa for London, England, he met anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians. Returning to Ethiopia, he began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa by the ANC's leadership.|$|E

5|$|Walsingham's younger {{daughter}} Mary died aged seven in July 1580; his elder daughter, Frances, married Sir Philip Sidney on 21 September 1583, despite the Queen's initial {{objections to the}} match (for unknown reasons) earlier in the year. As part of the marriage agreement, Walsingham agreed to pay £1,500 of Sidney's debts <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> daughter and son-in-law {{the use of his}} manor at Barn Elms in Surrey. A granddaughter born in November 1585 was named Elizabeth after the Queen, who was one of two godparents along with Sidney's uncle, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. The following year, Sidney was killed fighting the Spanish in the Netherlands and Walsingham was faced with paying off more of Sidney's extensive debts. His widowed daughter gave birth, in a difficult delivery, to a second child shortly afterward, but the baby, a girl, was stillborn.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was four}} years old, Gustav {{discovered}} his grandparents' piano and took to it immediately. He developed his performing skills sufficiently {{to be considered a}} local Wunderkind <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> first public performance at the town theatre when he was ten years old. Although Gustav loved making music, his school reports from the Iglau Gymnasium portrayed him as absent-minded and unreliable in academic work. In 1871, in the hope of improving the boy's results, his father sent him to the New Town Gymnasium in Prague, but Gustav was unhappy there and soon returned to Iglau. On 13 April 1875 he suffered a bitter personal loss when his younger brother Ernst (b. 18 March 1862) died after a long illness. Mahler sought to express his feelings in music: {{with the help of a}} friend, Josef Steiner, he began work on an opera, Herzog Ernst von Schwaben ("Duke Ernest of Swabia") as a memorial to his lost brother. Neither the music nor the libretto of this work has survived.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{visited the}} {{president}} at the White House {{for the first time}} as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before Roosevelt's third swearing-in. The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie, and she would have done so herself had she been aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>his</b> former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, Winston Churchill. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie's mission. He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22.|$|E
