40|$|Most {{applications}} for the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> EPICS are developed for UNIX and X-Windows. They are independent from each other, have a different look and feel, {{and it is difficult}} to exchange data. To solve these problems, the <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> Studio (CSS) is under development. CSS is a common platform for new <b>control</b> <b>system</b> applications and provides developers with management infrastructure and a centralised connection to external data sources like JDBC-databases, JMS-, LDAP-servers, etc. CSS defines interfaces to avoid dependencies on special implementations. This design makes sure that an application can easily be integrated or exchanged. Another important feature is the accessibility of data through all applications via CSS-data types defined in CSS. The Data Access Layer (DAL) assures the transparent access to <b>any</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> protocol. Thus CSS is not only a platform for EPICS but for <b>any</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> protocol that implements the DAL.
