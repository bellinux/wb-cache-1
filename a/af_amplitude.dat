40|$|International audienceThe {{accurate}} {{extraction of}} the atrial fibrillation (AF) {{signal from the}} ECG is a challenging task. The performance of its frequency analysis is based on this accuracy. When the atrioventricular node modelling is addressed, the precision of the <b>AF</b> <b>amplitude</b> estimation plays an important role. In this work, we propose an AF estimator based on a bayesian approach. The a priori knowledge necessary to achieve good estimation performances is shown to be weak. The presented method is compared to classical ones such as the Average Beat Substraction (ABS) but also to modern one that is the Blind Source Separation (BSS) technic. The performances of the methods are illustrated on a small set of examples. The conclusion is that the proposed method gives an accurate global estimation of the AF signal but also locally since our results do not exhibit spurious oscillations at the time location of the R wave...|$|E
40|$|We study {{geometrical}} {{objects on}} the borderline between standard Euclidean forms and fractals. The length (or area) increases with an additive rather than multiplicative constant, upon reducing the ruler length by a fixed rescaling factor. This {{leads to a}} logarithmic law {{instead of the usual}} power law for fractals. The fractal dimension D-F equals the topological dimension D-T and a fractal <b>amplitude.</b> <b>A(F)</b> is proposed for characterizing the objects. We introduce a model for the random deposition of debris consisting of a hierarchy of fragments with a hyperbolic size distribution (similar to meteors in space) that fall onto a D-dimensional surface (D = 1 or 2). The deposition takes place in air or another Viscous medium so that the fragments hit the surface in order of size, the large ones first. Employing both numerical simulation and analytic solution we verify that the rough landscape after impact is a logarithmic fractal for both D = 1 and 2, and determine the <b>amplitude</b> <b>A(F)</b> {{as a function of the}} probabilities P for piling up hills, and Q for digging holes, with P + Q less than or equal to 1.

30|$|In this study, {{we assumed}} that the source <b>amplitude</b> <b>A(f)</b> depends only on frequency, {{although}} A(f) also depends on the azimuthal relationship between the source and station due to the inhomogeneous radiation patterns of seismic source. However, Takemura et al. (2009) showed that scattering due to small-scale heterogeneity in the crust masks the radiation pattern at frequencies higher than 5  Hz. Taking the relatively strong crustal heterogeneities in volcanic areas (e.g., Yamamoto and Sato 2010) into consideration, our assumption that source amplitudes have no azimuthal dependency is reasonable for frequencies higher than 5  Hz. In this study, we used 5 – 10  Hz filtered waveforms to satisfy this assumption. Signal-to-noise ratio of 5 – 10  Hz was high to be reliable location estimation (Fig.  4).|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} Bessel kernel based time {{frequency}} distribution technique for identification and tracking of spectrum of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) in ECG. The algorithm shows a good frequency resolution {{and a low}} RMS error even when the noise dominates the signal which is critical for detecting the low <b>amplitude</b> <b>AF</b> activity within the ECG. In comparison with other time frequency distributions, the Bessel kernel reduces cross terms between frequencies in the multi-component ECG signal. Superiority of the Bessel kernel method over the short time Fourier transform (STFT) is demonstrated using a frequency modulated sinusoidal model and using real AF data. At {{low signal to noise}} levels the Bessel distribution outperforms the STFT and at an SNR of- 5 dB the RMS error is reduced from 1. 8 Hz to 0. 8 Hz. Also it achieves a frequency resolution of 0. 5 Hz at an SNR of 0 dB which is four times better than that of the STFT...|$|R
40|$|By {{recognizing}} and characterizing {{conditions under which}} atrial fibrillation (AF) is likely to terminate spontaneously or be sustained, improved treatment of sustained AF may result and unnecessary treatment of self-terminating AF avoided. Time-frequency measures that characterize AF, such as fibrillatory frequency, amplitude, and waveform shape (exponential decay), are extracted from the residual ECG following QRST cancellation. Three complexity measures are also studied, characterizing the degree of organization of atrial activity. All measures are analysed using a training set, consisting of 20 recordings of AF with known termination properties, and a test set of 30 recordings. Spontaneous termination was best predicted by a low and stable fibrillatory frequency and a low exponential decay. Using these predictors, 90 % of the test set was correctly classified into terminating and sustained <b>AF.</b> Neither fibrillation <b>amplitude</b> nor the complexity measures differed significantly between the two sets.

40|$|Introduction Intravenous {{ibutilide}} is used {{to convert}} atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm (SR) due to its Class III antiarrhythmic mechanisms. However, the effects of ibutilide on local electrograms (EGMs) during AF have not been elucidated. Methods and Results We used EGM analysis techniques to characterize how ibutilide administration changes the frequency, morphology, and repeatability of AF EGM signals, thereby providing insight into ibutilide's antiarrhythmic mechanism of action. AF recordings were collected from 21 patients with AF, {{both before and after}} ibutilide administration. The effects of ibutilide on the following AF EGM parameters were assessed: (1) dominant frequency (DF), (2) variations in EGM amplitude and overall morphology, (3) repetition of EGM patterns, and (4) complexity of the AF frequency spectra. When comparing pre- versus post-ibutilide administration EGMs, DF decreased from 5. 45 Hz to 4. 02 Hz (P < 0. 0001). There was an increase in the variability of both <b>AF</b> EGM <b>amplitudes</b> (P = 0. 003) and overall AF EGM morphologies (P = 0. 003). AF EGM pattern repetitiveness decreased (P = 0. 01), and the AF frequency spectral profile manifested greater complexity (P = 0. 02). Conclusions Novel EGM signal analysis techniques reveal that ibutilide administration causes increased complexity in the atrial electrical activation pattern with decreasing rate. These findings may be explained by the progressive destabilization of higher frequency, more homogeneous primary drivers of AF over the course of ibutilide administration, and/or less uniform propagation of atrial activation, until AF maintenance becomes more difficult and either transforms to atrial tachycardia or terminates to SR...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} interaction between an acoustic wave and the charged microparticles stored in a linear electrodynamic trap is presented. The linear electrodynamic trap consists of four bar electrodes equidistantly spaced, supplied by a high ac voltage V 0 cos 2 pif 0 t, and two endcap disc electrodes. The output beam of a low power laser module {{is focused on the}} longitudinal axis of the linear trap. A fraction of the radiation scattered by the stored microparticles is received by an integrated photodetector, directed normal to the linear trap axis, and converted into an electrical voltage. One of the dominant harmonics is due to the so-called “micromotion ” at frequency f 0 of the ac supply voltage. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>A(f</b> 0) of the photodetector output voltage harmonic component at frequency f 0 is measured using a synchronous detection technique. Supplementary force field acting on the stored microparticles is produced using an acoustic wave generated by a loudspeaker. Effects of the acoustic wave are studied observing the tim...|$|R
40|$|The signal-based {{acoustic}} emission (AE) {{characterization of}} concrete fracture process utilizing home-programmed AE monitoring system was performed for {{three kinds of}} static loading tests (Cubic-splitting, Direct-shear and Pull-out). Each test was carried out to induce a distinct fracture mode of concrete. Apart from monitoring and recording the corresponding fracture process of concrete, various methods were utilized to distinguish the characteristics of detected AE waveform to interpret the information of fracture behavior of AE sources (i. e. micro-cracks of concrete). Further, more signal-based characters of AE in different stages were analyzed and compared in this study. This research focused {{on the relationship between}} AE signal characteristics and fracture processes of concrete. Thereafter, the mode of concrete fracture could be represented in terms of AE signal characteristics. By using cement-based piezoelectric composite sensors, the AE signals could be detected and collected with better sensitivity and minimized waveform distortion, which made the characterization of AE during concrete fracture process feasible. The continuous wavelet analysis technique was employed to analyze the wave-front of AE and figure out the frequency region of the P-wave & S-wave. Defined RA (rising <b>amplitude),</b> <b>AF</b> (average frequency) and P-wave & S-wave importance index were also introduced to study the characters of AE from concrete fracture. It was found that the characters of AE signals detected during monitoring could be used as an indication of the cracking behavior of concrete...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{state of}} (TMTTF) (2) SbF 6 was {{investigated by the}} H- 1 and C- 13 NMR measurements. The temperature dependence of T- 1 (- 1) in H- 1 NMR {{shows a sharp peak}} associated with the antiferromagnetic transition at T-AF = 6 K. The temperature dependence of T- 1 (- 1) is described by the power law T- 2. 4 below T-A. This suggests the nodal gapless spin wave excitation in antiferromagnetic phase. In 13 C NMR, two sharp peaks at high temperature region, associated with the inner and the outer carbon sites in TMTTF dimer, split into four peaks below 150 K. It indicates that the charge disproportionation occurs. The degree of charge disproportionation Delta rho is estimated as (025 +/- 0. 09) e from the chemical shift difference. This value Delta rho is consistent with that obtained from the infrared spectroscopy. In the antiferromagnetic state (AFI), the observed line shape is well fitted by eight Lorentzian peaks. This suggests that the charge order with the same degree still remains in the AF state. From the line assignment, the <b>AF</b> staggered spin <b>amplitude</b> is obtained as 0. 70 mu(B) and 0. 24 mu(B) at the charge rich and the poor sites, respectively. These values corresponding to almost 1 mu(B) per (timer are quite different from 0. 11 mu(B) of another AF (AFII) state in (TMITF) (2) Br with effective higher pressure. As a result, it is understood that the antiferromagnetic staggered spin order is stabilized on the CO state in the AFI phase of (TMTTF) 2 (S) bF(6) ...|$|R
