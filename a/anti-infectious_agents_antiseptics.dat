Antitreponemal antibodies were detected in 87 % of PNG sera versus 0 - 6 % of controls (P < 0. 0001).

The outstanding high rate of antitreponemal antibodies detected in Kitavans possibly represents prior yaws disease. A low prevalence of cardiovascular disease was previously documented in Kitavans and has been attributed, in addition to their diet, to the high prevalence of natural cardioprotective autoantibodies (the IgM-antiphosphorylcholine antibodies) in this population. Treponemal infection has been shown to induce the appearance of antiphosphorylcholine antibodies. These protective autoantibodies may cross-react with the pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Currently {{not much}} is known {{regarding}} the environmental factors involved in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). It {{is even more}} unclear which factors may determine the subgroup (i. e., AMA status) of patients with PBC. We thus tested AMA+and AMA- PBC patients' sera for antibodies (Abs) against multiple infectious agents. METHODS: Sera from 69 patients with PBC (49 AMA+and 20 AMA-) and 100 matched controls were screened for IgG-Abs against Toxoplasma gondii, Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C utilizing the BioPlex 2200 and ELISA kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). RESULTS: The prevalence of four <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> Abs was significantly elevated among PBC patients when compared with controls, namely anti-T. gondii (ATxA; 71 % vs. 40 %, p< 0. 0001), EBV early antigen (EA; 44 % vs. 12 %, p< 0. 0001), H. pylori (54 % vs. 31 %, p< 0. 01), and CMV (90 % vs. 75 %, p< 0. 05) Abs, respectively. The co-occurrence of these four <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> Abs was highly common in PBC, whereas this infection burden was rare in healthy subjects (20 % vs. 3 % respectively, p< 0. 0001). Furthermore, specific infections interactions possibly increasing PBC risk were noted as well. Seropositivity of ATxA was inversely associated with cirrhosis among PBC patients (p< 0. 05).

CONCLUSIONS: We note the association of ATxA and PBC, with the possibility of a milder disease manifestation.

Moreover, the strong correlation between the trypanocidal and anti-leishmanial activities indicates that this mechanism is likely shared between the two species. EC 50 values were unaffected by the disabling of pyrimidine biosynthesis in T. brucei, showing that these uridine analogues do not act directly on the enzymes of pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism.

Five different extracts from Olea europaea, mastic gum, and Inula viscosa were tested against ten bacteria and one Candida albicans strain. The extraction protocols were conducted according to established experimental procedures. Two antimicrobial assays—the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assay—were applied. The screened extracts were found to be active against each of the tested microorganisms. O. europaea presented MIC and MBC ranges of 0. 07 – 10. 00 [*]mg[*]mL− 1 and 0. 60 – 10. 00 [*]mg[*]mL− 1, respectively. The mean MBC values for mastic gum and I. viscosa were 0. 07 – 10. 00 [*]mg[*]mL− 1 and 0. 15 – 10. 00 [*]mg[*]mL− 1, respectively. Extracts were less effective against C. albicans and exerted bactericidal effects at a concentration range of 0. 07 – 5. 00 [*]mg[*]mL− 1 on strict anaerobic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Parvimonas micra). Ethyl acetate I. viscosa extract and total mastic extract showed considerable antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms and could therefore be considered as alternative natural <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
