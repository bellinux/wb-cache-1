50|$|Endrin {{regularly}} {{enters the}} environment {{when applied to}} crops or when rain washes it off. It {{has been found in}} water, sediments, atmospheric air and biotic environment, even after uses have been stopped. Organochlorine pesticides strongly resist degradation, are poorly soluble in water but highly soluble in lipids, which is called lipophilic. This leads to bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of organisms, mainly those dwelling in water. A high bioconcentration factor of 1335-10,000 has been reported in fish. Endrin binds very strongly to organic matter in soil and aquatic sediments due to their high <b>adsorption</b> <b>coefficient,</b> making it less likely to leach into groundwater, even though contaminated groundwater samples have been found. In 2009, EPA released data indicating that the endrin in soil could last up to 14 years or more. The extent of endrin's persistence depends highly on local conditions. For example, high temperature (230 °C) or intense sunlight leads to more rapid breakdown of endrin into endrin ketone and endrin aldehyde, however, this breakdown is less than 5%.|$|E

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of SVE, that is, the rate {{and degree of}} mass removal, depends {{on a number of}} factors that influence the transfer of contaminant mass into the gas phase. The {{effectiveness of}} SVE {{is a function of the}} contaminant properties (e.g., Henry’s Law constant, vapor pressure, boiling point, <b>adsorption</b> <b>coefficient),</b> temperature in the subsurface, vadose zone soil properties (e.g., soil grain size, soil moisture content, soil permeability, soil carbon content), subsurface heterogeneity, and the air flow driving force (applied pressure gradient). As an example, a residual quantity of a highly volatile contaminant (such as trichloroethene) in a homogeneous sand with high permeability and low carbon content (i.e., low/negligible adsorption) will be readily treated with SVE. In contrast, a heterogeneous vadose zone with one or more clay layers containing residual naphthalene would require a longer treatment time and/or SVE enhancements. SVE effectiveness issues include tailing and rebound, which result from contaminated zones with lower air flow (i.e., low permeability zones or zones of high moisture content) and/or lower volatility (or higher adsorption). Recent work at U.S. Department of Energy sites has investigated layering and low permeability zones in the subsurface and how they affect SVE operations.|$|E

The agreement between calculated values and experimental re-sults indicates that a phenomenological equation {{can be used to}} predict boron adsorption on clays as a function of both of these variables. For the solution-to-clay ratios examined, the water content does not affect he boron-surface interaction as expressed by the above adsorption parameters. Because the affinity of clays for B(OHL- is much stronger than for B(OH) 3, the adsorption maximum was obtained only under alkaline conditions at approximately pH 9. 0 to 9. 7.
