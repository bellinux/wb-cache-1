40|$|Generic airspace, or <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>sectors</b> {{with similar}} {{operational}} characteristics, is an operational concept being proposed {{as a means}} of increasing staffing flexibility and reducing training times as part of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) Next Generation (NextGen) <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) modernization efforts. A key need for implementing generic airspace is identifying groups of similar sectors with respect to training required for controllers to make transitions between those sectors. Through the development and validation process of the studies performed in this thesis, a structure-based classification scheme was found to be an effective way to classify sectors in order to support a minimal differences training approach to generic airspace. The resulting classes of sectors are expected to have fewer transition barriers and support increased staffing flexibility. In order to assess similarities of airspace sectors, factors affecting how easily a controller makes a transition from one sector to another were identified using semi-structured interviews with experienced <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers. The most important factors appear to reflect familiarity with types of operations and common traffic patterns, providing a basis for classifying groups of sectors. The controllers identified some techniques that are easily transferable as well. Some factors that are very specific to transitions were identified as well, such as “knowing the neighbor sectors” and “coastal area” factors. Based on the most important factors, traffic patterns in 404 high-altitude National Airspace System (NAS) sectors were examined for common traffic patterns. These traffic patterns were used as the basis for two classification approaches, a holistic classification approach and a decompositional classification approach. These approaches are used to classify current <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>sectors</b> into classes with common structural characteristics. The results identify existing sectors with near-term potential as being generic sectors that support a minimal differences training approach to generic airspace. Further analysis with the sector classification results identified that the number of factors incorporated in the classification methods are directly associated with the method's effectiveness. In order to examine the validity of the developed classification methods and to assess the relative importance of the factors involving transitions identified by the interviews, an online survey was conducted with 56 <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers. The results indicated that the classification methods developed support controllers' perception of airspace similarities. Some qualitative data gained from the survey provides an insightful aspect for future steps continuing this study such as additional important factors to be considered.

Some of these additional factors were found to be more feasible to be incorporated into future classification schemes than other factors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAir {{traffic in}} European {{airspace}} is coordinated centrally by the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> flow management services – Network Management Operation Centre (NMOC). Their main {{task is to}} compare resources (number and capacity of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>sectors)</b> and needs (size of the planned and actual traffic). If {{it is found that}} the planned traffic exceeds the capacity of available airspace, corrective actions should be carried out. They consist in changing the takeoff time, or changing aircraft routes so as to avoid congested sectors or even cancelling the flight. Unfortunately, determining only the traffic volume is not sufficient to identify the needs, because very important are also: aircraft trajectories, manoeuvres performed, types of aircraft, their speed and other restrictions. Indeed, these factors determine the possibility to <b>control</b> the <b>traffic</b> by <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers. This makes it necessary to seek another indicator characterizing the traffic that must be handled. The paper proposes to use the notion of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> smoothness as a new, universal measure for characterizing the quality of <b>air</b> <b>traffic.</b> It can also serve as a measure of the traffic volume in the <b>control</b> <b>sector</b> or even as a traffic safety measure. The concept of smoothness is easier to use than the notion of the traffic complexity, which is increasingly being used, e. g. in the assessment of the capacity of the sector. The paper presents a new method for determining the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> smoothness, which uses both flight plans, their current implementation and the so-called favourable flight plans. On the basis of the measured data it is shown how to calculate the traffic smoothness for selected sectors. Indicating directions of further planned research, calculations were made to determine the relationship between the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> smoothness and its volume, which in turn may allow the use of the concept of smoothness to determine the capacity of <b>control</b> <b>sectors</b> and supporting <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> flow management services...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of aviation's {{contribution}} to the global problem of climate change is increasingly likely in the near term, but the method agreed upon by most economists-a multi-sectoral market-based approach such as a cap and trade system-is opposed by industry stakeholders. An efficient economy-wide policy would determine the optimal level of sectoral emissions reductions, but industry groups have instead proposed independent aviation-sector goals for carbon mitigation and technology adoption. This thesis asks the question: how much should airlines reduce their emissions, and which technologies {{will be necessary to}} achieve those reductions. In order to comprehend the problem of mitigation costs and outcomes {{within the context of the}} global economy, I introduce an aviation-resolved version of the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis model; a computable general equilibrium model of the global economy. In EPPA-A, the social accounting matrix is re-balanced to include aviation, a non-unity income elasticity of demand is introduced, and substitution elasticity parameters are estimated. Additionally, I include an additional module to analyze the potential non-market impacts of government infrastructure on aviation emissions by explicitly modeling an advanced <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>sector.</b> Several policy scenarios are applied to the model including: an idealized economywide cap and trade system in each developed nation or region, and an aviation-sectoronly cap within an economy-wide cap, both with and without trading enabled between the aviation cap and the economy-wide cap. Each policy scenario is compared to a business-as-usual case, and relative welfare loss under each policy is calculated. The business-as-usual and economy-wide cap policies are also run with the advanced Air Traffic Control module enabled, and the efficacy is determined. I find that in the context of total economic welfare, the method of aviation regulation is of little significance; the differences in results among the different policy scenarios are very small (on the order of 0. 002 % in the U. S.). However, the price of aviation and sector output are more responsive. When trading between an aviationsector- only cap and the economy-wide cap is enabled, outcomes are practically identical. When trading is not allowed, the price of aviation increases 21. 8 %, and output falls 32. 8 % compared to the economy-wide policy-only case. I find that national welfare outcomes are sensitive to international trade, and border adjustments for aviation emissions are important. Finally, the efficacy of advanced Air Traffic Control infrastructure, and the economic welfare gained or lost, is sensitive to the parameter estimates which exhibit high uncertainty. I find that the low-efficacy parameters result in slightly lower fuel intensity, but are also net-welfare decreasing, while the high parameter estimates increase welfare, but result in an infeasible reduction in sectoral energy intensity. by Christopher Whittlesey Gillespie.

40|$|Abstract — Currently, airspace-related {{activities}} in <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> Centers (ATCC) are dispatched between the Flow Management Position (FMP) operators {{and the control}} room manager, and take place in two different time frames. The first activity (FMP) is the planning, 2 days ahead, of airspace usage and anticipated overloads, using coarse-grain and relatively inaccurate workload prediction metrics. The second activity (control room manager) is the day-to-day operation, where workload is re-assessed in real-time and where airspace may be re-configured according to the actual traffic of the day. In previous works, a workload model relying on relevant <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> complexity metrics was proposed, using a neural network trained on past sector operations. This workload prediction model was combined with tree search algorithms, in order to compute optimal partitions of the airspace in <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) <b>sectors.</b> This method provides more accurate airspace configuration forecasts than today, thus improving the overall predictability of the <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Management (ATM) /ATC system.

40|$|The MIT Extensible Air Network Simulation (MEANS) is a {{tool that}} has been {{designed}} to assist airline schedulers and <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> managers in predicting flight delays for given <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> scenarios. One aspect of the simulation, the determination of flight times, has received criticism from the MEANS users as being too simplistic for their needs. Currently, MEANS predicts flight times based on a historical distribution of observed flight times between city pairs. This system ignores the effects of flight level winds and airspace congestion, two major determiners of flight time. The replacement flight time model presented divides the airspace into discrete sectors based on existing divisions in <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control.</b> Each <b>sector</b> has its own wind conditions and capacity limitations which affect passing flights. Results show that, after some calibration, the new flight time model produces accurate flight times when the airspace is divided into ARTCC domains and does not introduce additional errors into other parts of the simulation. Additionally, test scenarios show that the new system is capable of modeling airspace capacity events, such as a radar failure. Comparative results reveal that the old, distribution model produces surprisingly accurate flight times for typical wind conditions and airspace utilization. by Colin J. Whittaker. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|When {{designing}} <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) <b>sectors</b> and procedures, traffic {{complexity and}} workload are important issues. For predicting ATC workload, metrics {{based on the}} Solution Space Diagram (SSD) have been proposed. This paper studies the effect of sector design on workload and SSD metrics. When considering the SSD in evaluation of a sector, each aircraft within the sector introduces a zone of conflict, the Forbidden Beam Zone (FBZ), on the SSD. The properties of these FBZ are systematically studied to increase understanding of the SSD usability in assessing workload and sector complexity. The effects of sector design variables on <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Controller (ATCo) workload and also SSD properties were evaluated. Example of sector properties are, number of streams to be merged, the merge angle, the proximity of incoming aircraft and the variability of traffic mix of small and large aircraft.

40|$|Cognitive {{complexity}} mitigation {{strategies are}} methods and approaches utilized by users {{to reduce the}} apparent complexity of problems thus making them easier to solve. These strategies often effective because they mitigate the limitations of human working memory and attention resources. Such cognitive complexity mitigation strategies are used throughout the design, development and operational processes of complex systems. Thus, {{a better understanding of}} these strategies, and methods that leverage them, can help improve the efficiency of such processes. Additionally, changes in the use of these strategies across various environments can identify cognitive differences in operating and developing across these contexts. This knowledge can help improve the effectiveness of cross-context user transfers by suggesting change management processes that incorporate the degree of cognitive difference across contexts. In order to document cognitive complexity mitigation strategies and the change in their usage, two application domains are studied. Firstly, cognitive complexity mitigation strategies used by designers during the engineering design process are found through an ethnographic immersion with a participating engineering firm, followed by an analysis of the designer's logbooks and validation interviews with the designers. Results include identification of five strategies used by the designers to mitigate design complexity. These strategies include Blackbox Modeling, Whitebox Modeling, Decomposition, Visualization and Prioritized Lists. The five complexity mitigation strategies are probed further across a larger sample of engineering designers and the usage frequency of these strategies is assessed across commonly performed engineering design activities which include the Selection, Configuration and Parametric activities. The results indicate the preferred use of certain strategies based on the engineering activity being performed. Such preferential usage of complexity mitigation strategies is also assessed with regards to Original and Redesign projects types. However, there is no indication of biased strategy usage across these two project characterizations. These results are an example of a usage-frequency based difference analysis; such analyses help identify the strategies that experience increased or reduced usage when transferring across activities. In contrast to the first application domain, which captures changes in how often strategies are used across contexts, the second application domain is a method of assessing differences based on how a specific strategy is used differently across contexts. This alternative method is developed through a project that aims to optimize the transfer of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers across different airspace sectors. The method uses a previously researched complexity mitigation strategy, knows as a structure based abstraction, to develop a difference analysis tool called the Sector Abstraction Binder. This tool is used to perform cognitive difference analyses between <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>sectors</b> by leveraging characteristic variations in how structure based abstractions are applied across different sectors. This Sector Abstraction Binder is applied to two high-level airspace sectors to demonstrate the utility of such a method...|$|R
40|$|In today's <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> operations, <b>sectors</b> {{that have}} traffic demand below {{capacity}} are combined so that fewer controller teams {{are required to}} manage <b>air</b> <b>traffic.</b> Controllers in current operations are certified to control a group of six to eight sectors, known as an area of specialization. Sector combinations are restricted to occur within areas of specialization. Since there are few sector combination possibilities in each area of specialization, human supervisors can effectively make sector combination decisions. In the future, automation and procedures will allow any appropriately trained controller to control any of a large set of generic sectors. The primary benefit {{of this will be}} increased controller staffing flexibility. Generic sectors will also allow more options for combining sectors, making sector combination decisions difficult for human supervisors. A sector-combining algorithm can assist supervisors as they make generic sector combination decisions. A heuristic algorithm for combining under-utilized air space <b>sectors</b> to conserve <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> resources has been described and analyzed.

The controller participants managed a busy Oakland <b>air</b> route <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>sector</b> with mixed commercial/general aviation and manned/UAS traffic, providing separation services, miles-in-trail restrictions and issuing traffic advisories. Controllers filled out post-scenario and post-simulation questionnaires, and metrics were collected on the acceptability of procedural options and temporal thresholds. The states of aircraft were also recorded when controllers issued traffic advisories. Subjective feedback indicated a strong preference for pilots to request maneuvers to remain well clear from intruder aircraft rather than deviate from their IFR clearance. Controllers also reported that maneuvering at 120 seconds until closest point of approach (CPA) was too early; maneuvers executed with less than 90 seconds until CPA were more acceptable. The magnitudes of the requested maneuvers were frequently judged to be too large, indicating a possible discrepancy between the quantitative UAS well clear standard and the one employed subjectively by manned pilots. The ranges between pairs of aircraft and the times to CPA at which traffic advisories were issued were used to construct empirical probability distributions of those metrics. Given these distributions, we propose that UAS pilots wait until an intruder aircraft is approximately 80 seconds to CPA or 6 nmi away before requesting a maneuver, and maneuver immediately if the intruder is within 60 seconds and 4 nmi.

This {{has been especially}} important due to the increased pressure on the industry following September 11 th 2001, because airlines see regional jets as {{a major part of}} their financial recovery plan. The increase in regional jets represents a significant change from traditional <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns and airline business models. To investigate the possible impacts of this change, this study analyzed the economic characteristics of regional jets, and well as the emerging flight patterns and performance of regional jets compared to traditional jets and turboprops. It was found that regional airlines have lower crew costs per number of block hours and take offs, but higher crew cost per ASMs and RPMs. As a result, the revenues at regional airlines are more susceptible to changes in crew cost. It was also observed that regional jets operate differently then traditional jets. Regional jets increase the number of operations at airports and in the take off tracks around airports, which may result in increased congestion. Regional jets were also observed to exhibit lower climb rates than traditional jets, which may negatively impact <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> handling and <b>sector</b> design. Given the possible economic and operational problems associated with regional jets, their growth may pose unanticipated problems. Mozdzanowska, Hansman...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration {{is trying}} to make its <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> {{management}} system more responsive {{to the needs of the}} aviation community by exploring the concept of 'free flight' for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules. A logical first step toward free flight could be made without significantly altering current <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) procedures or requiring new airborne equipment by designing a ground-based system to be highly responsive to 'user preference' in en route airspace while providing for an orderly transition to the terminal area. To facilitate user preference in all en route environments, a system based on an extension of the Center/TRACON Automation System (CTAS) is proposed in this document. The new system would consist of two integrated components. An airspace tool (AT) focuses on unconstrained en route aircraft (e. g., not transitioning to the terminal airspace), taking advantage of the relatively unconstrained nature of their flights and using long-range trajectory prediction to provide cost-effective conflict resolution advisories to sector controllers. A sector tool (ST) generates efficient advisories for all aircraft, with a focus on supporting controllers in analyzing and resolving complex, highly constrained traffic situations. When combined, the integrated AT/ST system supports user preference in any <b>air</b> route <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> center <b>sector.</b> The system should also be useful in evaluating advanced free-flight concepts by serving as a test bed for future research. This document provides an overview of the design concept, explains its anticipated benefits, and recommends a development strategy that leads to a deployable system...|$|R
40|$|As it {{is defined}} in ATM 2000 + Strategy (Eurocontrol 2001), {{the mission of the}} <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Management (ATM) System is: “For all the phases of a flight, the ATM system should {{facilitate}} a safe, efficient, and expedite traffic flow, through the provision of adaptable ATM services that can be dimensioned in relation to the requirements of all the users and areas of the European air space. The ATM services should comply with the demand, be compatible, operate under uniform principles, respect the environment and satisfy the national security requirements. ” The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a methodology designed to evaluate the status of the ATM system in terms of the relationship between the offered capacity and traffic demand, identifying weakness areas and proposing solutions. The first part of the methodology relates to the characterization and evaluation of the current system, while a second part proposes an approach to analyze the possible development limit. As part of the work, general criteria are established to define the framework in which the analysis and diagnostic methodology presented is placed. They are: the use of <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) <b>sectors</b> as analysis unit, the presence of network effects, the tactical focus, the relative character of the analysis, objectivity and a high level assessment that allows assumptions on the human and Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) elements, considered as the typical high density <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> resources. The steps followed by the methodology start with the definition of indicators and metrics, like the nominal criticality or the nominal efficiency of a sector; scenario characterization where the necessary data is collected; network effects analysis to study the relations among the constitutive elements of the ATC system; diagnostic by means of the “System Status Diagram”; analytical study of the ATC system development limit; and finally, formulation of conclusions and proposal for improvement. This methodology was employed by Aena (Spanish Airports Manager and Air Navigation Service Provider) and INECO (Spanish Transport Engineering Company) in the analysis of the Spanish ATM System in the frame of the Spanish airspace capacity sustainability program, although it could be applied elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAirlines are {{increasingly}} using regional jets to better match aircraft size to high value, but limited demand markets. This {{has been especially}} important following increased financial pressure on the industry after September 11 th 2001. The increase in regional jets represents a significant change from traditional <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns. To investigate the possible impacts of this change, this study analyzed the emerging flight patterns and performance of regional jets compared to traditional jets and turboprops. In addition, a comparison between regional jet flight patterns in the United States and Europe was conducted. Regional jet operations generally cluster in the regions with high traditional jet operation density, implying {{a high level of}} interaction between the two aircraft types. The regional jets were observed to fly shorter routes than traditional jets, with few transcontinental flights. However, the gap between regional and narrow body traditional jet stage lengths appears to be closing. In addition, regional jets were observed to exhibit lower climb rates than traditional jets, which may impact <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> handling and <b>sector</b> design. It was also observed that regional jets cruise at lower altitudes than traditional jets possibly due to their shorter flight routes. Finally, it was observed that regional jets cruise at a lower Mach number than traditional jets, except on specific high density routes where the regional jets are either slowing down the traditional jet traffic or flying above their optimum cruise speed. Since the composition and utilization of the national fleet is changing, this will pose potential problems for <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management. In particular, it may cause serious congestion issues when demand increases during an economic recovery...|$|R
