This research project is intended {{to contribute to the}} body of research on pragmaticsby examining the single and joint effects of apology components on the victim'sperception of transgressors. 現有探討「道歉」此一言談行為的相關研究為數不少。但多數學者檢視特定語言所用以表達道歉的策略種類或比較探討不同語言間表達道歉的策略差異。雖然這部份的研究發現，對於增進我們對不同語言文化之間表達道歉的差異了解有非常大的幫助，但要清楚了解「道歉」此一言談行為，除了知道「表達道歉者」使用什麼策略道歉之外，也應探究每一類的道歉策略或不同的道歉策略組合，所傳達的道歉誠意，對於「接受道歉者」而言，是否有差異。然而，現有探討道歉語的相關研究，多數收集表達資料(production data) ，分析道歉策略的使用差異，或收集認知資料（perception data）針對道歉情境冒犯嚴重程度、需要道歉的必要性、被冒犯者會接受道歉的可能性等認知差異做比較，從「表達道歉者」的角度探討「道歉」此一言談行為；少有學者從「被冒犯者」（亦即：接受道歉者）的角度，探討每一類的道歉策略或不同的道歉策略組合，所傳達的道歉誠意，對於「接受道歉者」而言，是否有差異。本專題計劃案擬從「被冒犯者」的角度，檢視探討每一類的道歉策略或不同道歉策略組合或同一種道歉策略但不同的內容，所傳達的道歉誠意的是否有別。並查驗其認知是否有年齡或性別的差異...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the law of}} {{criminal}} evidence, a confession is a statement by a suspect in crime which is adverse to that person.

Under Miranda v. Arizona, evidence obtained by police during interrogation of a suspect before he has been read his Miranda rights is inadmissible. Here, however, the defendant had been indicted in court, and thus his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had automatically attached. At issue was whether a voluntary <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> incriminating <b>facts</b> in response to police statements constituted a waiver of this right to counsel.|$|R

On the other hand, although he denounces this environment throughout the song, the narrator concludes, taking leave of the caller and telling him that he must get on his way home, which can be interpreted as an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fact</b> he himself belongs to the middle class, or at least is close to.|$|R

6000|$|Your Lordships will {{remark that}} there is nowhere a clear and {{positive}} denial <b>of</b> the <b>fact.</b> Promising a defence, I will admit, does not directly and ex vi termini suppose that a man may not deny the fact, because it is just compatible with the defence; but it does by no means exclude the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fact,</b> because the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fact</b> may be attended with a justification: but when a man says that he will explain his conduct with regard to a fact, then he admits that fact, because {{there can be no}} explanation <b>of</b> a <b>fact</b> which has no existence. Therefore Mr. Hastings admits the fact by promising an explanation, and he shows he has no explanation nor justification to give by never having given it. Goaded, provoked, and called upon for it, in the manner I have mentioned, he chooses to have a feast of disgrace, (if I may say so,) to have a riot of infamy, served up to him day by day for a course of years, in every species of reproach that could be given by his colleagues, and by the Court of Directors, [...] "from whom," [...] he says, [...] "I received nothing but opprobrious and disgraceful epithets," [...] and he says [...] "that his predecessors possessed more of their confidence than he had." [...] Yet for years he lay down in that sty of disgrace, fattening in it, feeding upon that offal of disgrace and excrement, upon everything that could be disgustful to the human mind, rather than deny the fact and put himself upon a civil justification.

40|$|This is an {{excellent}} handbook for lawyers and judges in the newly developed art of pre-trial. Over {{the last fifteen years}} there has been a steadily increasing interest in pre-trial conferences. Conducted by the judge with counsel before the actual trial, such conferences are geared to settle various matters which, in actuality, are not or need not be contested, and to strip the case {{to the heart of the}} precise dispute between the parties. Thus, simplification of the issues, amendment of the pleadings where necessary, <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and <b>of</b> documents as exhibits to avoid unnecessary proof, settlement of items of damage (such as hospital bills), limitation of the number of expert witnesses [...] all these and other matters formerly the subject of courtroom wrangling or haggling [...] are settled in advance with a minimum of friction and maximum of gain in trial expedition and efficiency. An important by-product, though properly approached more as a desirable consequence than as a compelled objective, is the settlement of the case without trial. Thus the system has proven a boon to courts facing overcrowded calendars and to litigants desiring the prompt and discriminating disposition of their disputes. This book shows, with a wealth of examples, how the courts most successful in operating this modern device proceed to make it work...|$|R
5000|$|In law, a {{dispositive}} {{motion is}} a motion seeking a trial court order entirely disposing of {{all or part}} of the claims in favor of the moving party without need for further trial court proceedings. [...] "To dispose" [...] of a claim means to decide the claim in favor of one or another party. As a lawsuit may comprise numerous claims made by and against numerous parties, not every dispositive motion seeks to dispose of the entire lawsuit. In the U.S., the most common type of dispositive motions seeking to dispose of the entire lawsuit are those for summary judgment. Many U.S. state jurisdictions also provide for a [...] "partial summary judgment" [...] or motion for [...] "summary adjudication of issues" [...] which only seeks to dispose of part of a lawsuit. See, e.g., California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(f)(1). Regardless whether the dispositive motion is for summary judgment or adjudication, the motion must be supported by declarations under oath, excerpts from depositions which are also under oath, <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> by the opposing party and other discovery such as interrogatories, as well as a legal argument (points and authorities). The other party may respond with counter-declarations, discovery responses, and legal arguments attempting to show that these issues were [...] "triable issues of fact." [...] If there is any question as to whether there is conflict on the facts on an issue, the summary judgment or adjudication must be denied regarding that matter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic charge}} {{against all the}} accused was one of [...] "Conspiracy to wage war against the King". [...] "A careful {{scrutiny}} of the first charge" [...] said the judgement, [...] "shows that it relates to a conspiracy alleged by prosecution to have come into being for overthrowing the Government established by law in Pakistan by means of criminal force or show of criminal force." [...] Other allegations, though punishable offences in themselves, were [...] "either {{the consequences of this}} conspiracy or merely means to achieve the object for which it was stated to have been entered into." [...] The judgement was, therefore, directed mainly to examine whether the evidence produced by the prosecution was sufficient to establish [...] "(i) the existence of conspiracy and if that is found established, (ii) who are proved to have been parties to it?" [...] The evidence led by the prosecution to prove its case was both documentary and oral. The latter was of [...] "persons, who, without being either parties or willing parties to it, either deposed to the existence of the conspiracy or stated facts which might lead a court to draw a conclusion in favour of its existence; and (of) persons who were either, on their own statements, or on account <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> made by them, or due to existence of other reasonable grounds, held to be willing parties to the conspiracy." ...|$|R

It is also at a proportionately lower level than the settlements the Commission reached with all the other defendants. Importantly, it is also reached without any <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> liability. The <b>fact</b> that the Commission was prepared to settle for substantially less than the full claim and without any <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> liability no doubt reflects the Commission’s recognition that it faced a risk of losing if the claim went to trial.” ...|$|R

40|$|There are {{essentially}} two statistical paradigms, the Bayesian and frequentist. Despite their obvious differences {{the two approaches}} have certain points in common. In particular both are density (or likelihood) based and neither has a concept of approximation. By a concept of approximation we mean some formal <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fact</b> that the statistical models are not true representations of the data. We argue {{that the relationship between}} the data and the model is a fundamental one which cannot be reduced to either diagnostics or model validation. We argue further that a concept of approximation must be formulated in a weak topology different from the strong topology of densities. For this reason there can be no density or likelihood based concept of approximation. The concept of approximation we suggest goes back to [Donoho, D. L. (1988). One-sided inference about functionals of a density. Annals of Statistics, 16, 1390 – 1420] and [Davies, P. L. (1995). Data features.

But {{it is a fact}} not to be disputed, and to which we must reconcile ourselves, that man is subject to the same organic laws as inferior creatures.

And a candid <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> this <b>fact</b> is not without its reward: namely, that the generalisations established by observation and experiment on brutes, become available for human guidance. Rudimentary as is the Science of Life, it has already attained to certain fundamental principles underlying the development of all organisms, the human included.
