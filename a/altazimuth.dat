25|$|The New Technology Telescope (NTT) is an <b>altazimuth,</b> 3.58-metre Ritchey-Chrétien telescope, inaugurated in 1989 and {{the first}} in the world with a {{computer-controlled}} main mirror. The flexible mirror's shape is adjusted during observation to preserve optimal image quality. The secondary mirror position is also adjustable in three directions. This technology (developed by ESO and known as active optics) is now applied to all major telescopes, including the VLT and the future ELT.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1835 Airy was {{appointed}} Astronomer Royal {{in succession to}} John Pond, and began his long career at the national observatory which constitutes his chief title to fame. The condition of the observatory {{at the time of}} his appointment was such that Lord Auckland, the first Lord of the Admiralty, considered that [...] "it ought to be cleared out," [...] while Airy admitted that [...] "it was in a queer state." [...] With his usual energy he set to work at once to reorganise the whole management. He remodelled the volumes of observations, put the library on a proper footing, mounted the new (Sheepshanks) equatorial and organised a new magnetic observatory. In 1847 an <b>altazimuth</b> was erected, designed by Airy to enable observations of the moon to be made not only on the meridian, but whenever it might be visible. In 1848 Airy invented the reflex zenith tube to replace the zenith sector previously employed. At the end of 1850 the great transit circle of 203mm (8inch) aperture and 3.5m (11ft 6in) focal length was erected, and is still the principal instrument of its class at the observatory. The mounting in 1859 of an equatorial of 330mm (13inch) aperture evoked the comment in his journal for that year, [...] "There is not now a single person employed or instrument used in the observatory which was there in Mr Pond's time"; and the transformation was completed by the inauguration of spectroscopic work in 1868 and of the photographic registration of sunspots in 1873.|$|E
50|$|The {{horizontal}} {{coordinate system}} is sometimes {{also called the}} az/el system, the Alt/Az system, or the <b>altazimuth</b> system, from {{the name of the}} <b>altazimuth</b> mount for telescopes, whose two axes follow altitude and azimuth.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>altazimuth</b> mount {{does have}} its own limitations. Un-driven <b>altazimuth</b> mounted telescopes need to be [...] "nudged" [...] every few minutes along both axes to {{compensate}} for the rotation of the Earth to keep an object in view (as opposed to one axis for un-driven equatorial mounts), an exercise that becomes more difficult with higher magnifications. The <b>altazimuth</b> mount does not allow for the use of conventional setting circles to help in aiming the telescope at the coordinates of known objects. They are known for being difficult to point at objects near the zenith, mainly because a large movement of the azimuth axis is needed to move the telescope pointing by even a small amount. <b>Altazimuth</b> mounts are also not well suited for astrophotography.|$|E

50|$|Each Keck Observatory {{telescope}} sits on an <b>altazimuth</b> mount. Most current 8-10 m class telescopes use <b>altazimuth</b> designs due to {{the reduced}} structural requirements compared to older equatorial designs. This mounting style provides the greatest strength and stiffness for {{the least amount of}} steel, which, for Keck Observatory, totals about 270 tons per telescope. The total weight of each telescope is more than 300 tons. Two of the proposed designs for the next generation 30 and 40 m telescopes use the same basic technology pioneered at Keck Observatory, a hexagonal mirror array coupled with an <b>altazimuth</b> mounting.|$|E

50|$|<b>Altazimuth</b> mount: An {{equatorial}} telescope mount with clock drive was {{left out of}} the design. Equatorial mounts tend to be massive (less portable), expensive, complicated, and have the characteristics of putting the eyepiece of Newtonian telescopes in very hard to access positions. <b>Altazimuth</b> mounts cut the size, weight and cost of the total telescope and keep the eyepiece in a relatively easy to access position {{on the side of the}} telescope. The <b>altazimuth</b> mount design used in Dobsonian designs also adds to simplicity and portability; there is no added mass or need to transport counter weights, drive components, or tripods/pedestals. Setting up for hard tube dobs simply involves placing the mount on the ground, and setting the tube on top of it. The weight of the Dobsonian style <b>altazimuth</b> mount is distributed over large simple bearing surfaces so the telescope can move smoothly under finger pressure with minimal backlash.|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} about the instrument to which the name was originally applied. Some identify the early theodolite as an azimuth instrument only, while others specify it as an <b>altazimuth</b> instrument. In Digges's book, the name [...] "theodolite" [...] described an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only. He also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he called a topographicall instrument [...] Thus the name originally applied only to the azimuth instrument and only later became associated with the <b>altazimuth</b> instrument. The 1728 Cyclopaedia compares [...] "graphometer" [...] to [...] "half-theodolite". Even {{as late as the}} 19th century, the instrument for measuring horizontal angles only was called a simple theodolite and the <b>altazimuth</b> instrument, the plain theodolite.|$|E

An <b>altazimuth</b> mount also reduces the cost in the dome structure covering the telescope since the simplified motion of the telescope means the structure can be more compact.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Altazimuth,</b> {{altitude}}-azimuth, or alt-az mounts allow telescopes to {{be moved}} in altitude (up and down), or azimuth (side to side), as separate motions.

This meant until recently it was normally used with inexpensive commercial and hobby constructions. Since the invention of digital tracking systems, <b>altazimuth</b> mounts have come to be used in practically all modern large research telescopes. Digital tracking has also made it a popular telescope mount used in amateur astronomy.|$|E

One of his areas of study was that of the <b>altazimuth</b> or horizontal coordinate system, as well as bring one of the four observers of the transit circle and <b>altazimuth.</b> In 1875, Downing was elected as a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, contributing 75 papers dealing primarily with correcting errors in the star catalogues and the computation of the motions of astronomical bodies. In one paper, he worked with George Johnstone Stoney on the perturbations of the Leonid meteors, predicting and explaining the spareness of the 1899 shower.|$|E
