5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E

40|$|We present space-efficient {{algorithms}} for computing the {{convex hull}} of <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> polygonal line in-place, in linear time. It {{turns out that}} the problem is as hard as stable partition, i. e., if there were <b>a</b> truly <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> then stable partition would also have <b>a</b> truly <b>simple</b> <b>solution,</b> and vice versa. Nevertheless, we present <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> self-contained <b>solution</b> that uses O(log n) space, and indicate how to improve it to O(1) space with the same techniques used for stable partition. If the points inside the convex hull can be discarded, then there is <b>a</b> truly <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> that uses <b>a</b> single call to stable partition, and even that call can be spared if only extreme points are desired (and not their order). If the polygonal line is closed, then the problem admits <b>a</b> very <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> which does not call for stable partitioning at all...|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> is {{assuming}} a viscosity {{much larger than}} the magnetic diffusivity in the disk. However, numerical simulations, and theoretical models, show that the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity have almost the same order of magnitude in magneto-rotationally turbulent disks. Some other factors may possibly affect the advection/diffusion rate: reduced turbulent magnetic diffusion on the surface layers; reduction of the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity by magnetic fields; and the generation of large scale fields by small scale MHD turbulence –a large scale dynamo.|$|E
25|$|While Ka {{measures}} {{the strength of}} an acidic molecule, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which {{is a function of}} the concentration of hydronium ions in solution. The pH of <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> of an acid in water is determined by both Ka and the acid concentration. For weak acid solutions, it depends on the degree of dissociation, which may be determined by an equilibrium calculation. For concentrated solutions of strong acids with a pH less than about zero, the Hammett acidity function is a better measure of acidity than the pH.|$|E

500|$|At {{the peak}} of its production, 350 animators, artists and {{technicians}} were working on Atlantis at all three Disney animation studios: Walt Disney Feature Animation (Burbank, California), Disney Feature Animation Florida (Orlando), and Disney Animation France (Paris). The film {{was one of the}} few Disney animated features produced and shot in 70mm anamorphic format. The directors felt that a widescreen image was crucial, as a nostalgic reference to old action-adventure films presented in the CinemaScope format (2.35:1), noting Raiders of the Lost Ark as an inspiration. Because switching to the format would require animation desks and equipment designed for widescreen to be purchased, Disney executives were at first reluctant about the idea. [...] The production team found <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> by drawing within a smaller frame on the same paper and equipment used for standard aspect ratio (1.66:1) Disney-animated films. Layout supervisor Ed Ghertner wrote a guide to the widescreen format for use by the layout artists and mentioned that one advantage of widescreen was that he could keep characters in scenes longer because of additional space to walk within the frame. Wise drew further inspiration for the format from filmmakers David Lean and Akira Kurosawa.|$|E

500|$|At the episode's {{conclusion}} {{an alliance}} {{of many of the}} Doctor's enemies appear: the Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans, Judoon, Autons, Sycorax, Hoix, Silurians, and Roboforms. The Alliance was made up of the [...] "very best" [...] costumes and props they still had in good condition and of the most iconic monsters. So many enemies standing side-by-side had never been seen in the show before. The episode also features Amy battling a Cyberman; Gillan stated she [...] "really wanted" [...] to work with the iconic monster. As the Cyberman had been guarding the Pandorica for a long time, Haynes wanted to make it look [...] "rusted, creaky, and old" [...] and compared its behavior to Frankenstein. The Cyberman was originally played by an amputee with one arm, but the production team was dissatisfied with the camera angle and decided to reshoot the scene from a different angle, but a different actor who had both arms did the part as the amputee was unavailable. <b>A</b> <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> was devised to cover his arm with a green sleeve made of the same material as a greenscreen, and the final sequence is a combination of both shots. The Cyberman is killed by Rory, who is unaware he is an Auton; this was meant to signify that there was something different about Rory, as he would have normally panicked in that situation. At the end of the episode Rory is overcome by the Nestene Consciousness's control and shoots Amy, which reflected Moffat's belief that all good love stories end in tragedy.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{experts and}} major reports advise against relying on climate {{engineering}} techniques as <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> to global warming, {{in part due}} to the large uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects.
