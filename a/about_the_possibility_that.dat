Also cited as an influence on the fictional Deep Throat was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. In the film, Sutherland's X reveals information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the assassination of John F.

In particular, we study the question of whether a coalition among these agents can achieve a given goal by following the contract. We define a generalised weakest precondition semantics for contracts that permits us to compute the initial states from which a coalition has a winning strategy to reach their goal. Notions of correctness and refinement with respect to coalitions are introduced, together with proof rules for correctness and principles for refinement and equivalence transformations. We illustrate the framework with a three agent contract, showing how one can reason <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> different coalitions of agents have for reaching specific goals...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of the work presented here is to make innovative research output in the agronomy and forestry domain accessible to end-users, {{so that it can}} be practically applied. We have developed an approach that consists of three key-elements: an ontology with domain knowledge, a set of documents that have been annotated and meta-annotated, and a system (ask-Valerie) that is based on a dialogue to represent the interaction between end user and system. We show that the dialogue-metaphor is a good way of modelling the interaction between user and system. The system helps the user in formulating his question and in answering it in a useful way. Meta-annotations of key-paragraphs in the document-base turn out to be relevant in assessing in one glance what the content of a document is.
