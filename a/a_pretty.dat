For the previous six years they had lived in <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities.

She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E
