25|$|After {{recovering}} from her broken arm, Krasner {{began working on}} bright and decorative <b>allover</b> painting which are less aggressive than her Earth Green Series and Umber Series paintings. Often, these images recall calligraphy or floral ornamentation which are not blatantly related to Krasner's emotional state. Floral or calligraphic shapes dominate the canvas, connecting variable brushwork into a single pattern.|$|E
25|$|The Afshar {{people are}} a {{semi-nomadic}} group of Turkic origin, principally located in the mountainous areas surrounding the modern city of Kirman in southeastern Iran. They produce mainly rugs in runner formats, and bags and other household items with rectilinear or curvilinear designs, showing both central medallions and <b>allover</b> patterns. Colours are bright and pale red. The flat-woven ends often show multiple narrow stripes.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Sarouk {{design was}} distinguished by a round-star medaillon with surrounding pendants. The traditional {{design of the}} Sarouk rug was modified by the weavers towards an <b>allover</b> design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours. Feraghan carpets are less finely woven thsn Sarouk. Often the Herati pattern is seen all over. Medaillons, if they occur, show more geometrical designs. A corroding green dye is typical for Feraghan carpets.|$|E
25|$|The {{legitimacy}} of the subcell structure came from the recruitment process, originally by the case officer {{and then by the}} cell leaders. Sometimes, the cell leader would propose subcell member names to the case officer, so the case officer could have a headquarters name check run before bringing the individual into the subcell. In principle, however, the subcell members would know ALPINE, and sometimes {{the other members of the}} ALPINE cell if they needed to work together; if ALPINE-1 and ALPINE-2 had independent assignments, they might not know each other. ALPINE-1 and ALPINE-2 certainly would not know ALASTAIR or anyone in the ALTITUDE or <b>ALLOVER</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|Tabriz is {{the market}} {{center for the}} Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the {{symmetric}} knot. Heriz is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an <b>allover</b> design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of Sarab produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. Bakshaish carpets with a shield-shaped large medaillon, less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of Bakhshayesh. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.|$|E
25|$|Although Pollock {{is closely}} {{associated}} with Action Painting because of his style, technique, and his painterly touch and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's <b>allover</b> canvasses to the large-scale Water Lilies of Claude Monet done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic Michael Fried, and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his drip paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and {{are related to the}} mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic drip painting period of 1947-1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City Pollock showed Number 12, 1952, a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by Nelson Rockefeller for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.|$|E
500|$|This {{was painted}} {{at the apex}} of Lichtenstein's use of {{enlarged}} dots, cropping and magnification of the original source. [...] Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum curator Diane Waldman notes that Lichtenstein made Drowning Girl a cornerstone of his career because of [...] "his extraordinary sense of organization, his ability to use a sweeping curve and manipulate it into an <b>allover</b> pattern". According to The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists, the work is [...] "a mix of cliché, melodrama, pathos, and absurdity..." [...] The result is described by art scholar Jonathan Fineberg as [...] "a remarkably impassive style". The image is typical of Lichtenstein's depiction of comic subjects responding to a situation in a clichéd manner.|$|E
500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 14th century, money that had {{previously}} been spent on luxury goods like lavish embroidery was redirected to military expenditure, and imported Italian figured silks competed with native embroidery traditions. [...] Varieties of design in textiles succeeded each other very rapidly, and they were more readily available than the more leisurely produced needlework. [...] The work produced by the London workshops was simplified {{to meet the demands of}} this deteriorating market. [...] The new techniques required less work and smaller quantities of expensive materials. [...] Surface couching replaced underside couching, and <b>allover</b> embroidery was replaced by individual motifs worked on linen and then applied to figured silks or silk velvets. Increasingly, designs for embroidery were derived directly from woven patterns, [...] "thus losing not only their former individuality and richness, but also their former ... story-telling interest." ...|$|E

Initially, during the 1940s, he {{explored}} the then-current style of [...] Action Painting. His later work, from the 1950s through the 1970s is often characterized as Abstract Impressionist - largely because he constructed his <b>allover</b> compositions with multiple, repetitive, and close-valued brushstrokes, {{in the manner of}} Claude Monet in the famous Waterlilies series.

2500|$|In {{preservation}} the Craven coaches had to {{be given}} a paint scheme that was different to the IÉ colours of orange and black, which at the time was still in use on Irish Rail's Mark 2 and Mark 3 fleets, to avoid confusing passengers. The first 2 Cravens, 1529 and 1539, [...] had a green colour applied between the windows and the bogies, whilst 1541 ran for one trip in a grey undercoat before returning to Inchicore to be repainted by volunteers into a new <b>allover</b> blue livery with a yellow stripe below the window. A yellow box stripe and the RPSI crest on the side were also added. While this was progressing, all RPSI Cravens had the letters “RPSI” in white applied to the doors on both sides to identify them in both Inchicore and on the rail network. Two more Cravens received the <b>allover</b> blue treatment before Iarnród Éireann took over the repainting of the carriages in 2014. Today, all the Cravens except for 1539 have been outshopped in a new RPSI livery of blue and cream, complete with two RPSI crests on the side of each carriage. It can be noted that snack bar carriage No. 1508 is the only carriage in the set that has been repainted into the new colour scheme by the RPSI Dublin carriage crew, as she was being extensively rebuilt and repaired by the team, who wanted to do the full job themselves.|$|E
2500|$|I'd place Pollock {{along with}} Hofmann and Morris Louis {{in this country}} among the very {{greatest}} painters of this generation. I actually don't think there was anyone in the same generation in Europe quite to match them. Pollock didn't like Hofmann's paintings. He couldn't make them out. He didn't take the trouble to. And Hofmann didn't like Pollock's <b>allover</b> paintings, nor could most of Pollock's artist friends make head or tail out of them, {{the things he did}} from 1947 to '50. But Pollock's paintings live or die in the same context as Rembrandt's or Titian's or Velázquez's or Goya's or David's or ...or Manet's or Ruben's or Michelangelo's paintings. There's no interruption, there's no mutation here. Pollock asked to be tested by the same eye that could see how good Raphael was when he was good or Piero when he was good.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1946, Krasner {{began working}} on her Little Image series. She created around forty {{of these types of}} {{paintings}} until 1949. They are commonly categorized as mosaic, webbed, or hieroglyphs depending on the style of the image. The mosaic images were created through the thick buildup of paint while her webbed paintings were made through a drip technique in which the paintbrush was always close {{to the surface of the}} canvas. Since she used a drip technique in creating her webbed images, many critics believed upon seeing this work for the first time that she reinterpreted Pollock's chaotic paint splatters. Her hieroglyph paintings are gridded and look like an unreadable, personal script of Krasner's creation. These works demonstrate her anti-figurative concerns, <b>allover</b> approach to the canvas, gestural brushwork, and disregard of naturalistic color. They have little variation of color but are very rich in texture due to the buildup of impasto and also suggest space continuing beyond the canvas. [...] These were her first successful images she created while working from her own imagination rather than a model. The relatively small scale of the images can be attributed to the fact she painted them on an easel in her small studio space in an upstairs bedroom at The Springs.|$|E
