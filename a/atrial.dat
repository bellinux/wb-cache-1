5|$|File:Digoxin.svg|Digoxin is used {{to treat}} <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, <b>atrial</b> flutter and {{sometimes}} heart failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{therapy has}} also been {{investigated}} {{for use in the}} treatment of peripheral vasculature stenosis and considered for the treatment of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation.|$|E
5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the heart, including <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and valvular disease, and after a heart operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral anticoagulants is often given simultaneously, because of an increased risk of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Anoaʻi {{was hospitalized}} due to {{congestive}} heart failure (with {{which he had been}} diagnosed years earlier) and <b>atrial</b> fibrillation. He died on April 17, 2017, 10 days after his 47th birthday, in Pensacola, Florida, due to {{congestive heart failure}} related to his weight problem.|$|E
5|$|Myosin {{regulatory}} {{light chain}} 2, ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform (MLC-2) {{also known as}} the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYL2 gene. This cardiac ventricular RLC isoform is distinct from that expressed in skeletal muscle (MYLPF), smooth muscle (MYL12B) and cardiac <b>atrial</b> muscle (MYL7).|$|E
5|$|Study of diaries kept by Eric Marshall, {{medical officer}} to the 190709 expedition, {{suggests}} that Shackleton suffered from an <b>atrial</b> septal defect ("hole in the heart"), a congenital heart defect, {{which may have}} been a cause of his health problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right <b>atrial</b> appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left <b>atrial</b> appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E
5|$|The left atrium {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left <b>atrial</b> appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|E
5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify <b>atrial</b> fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 2007, Cheney {{was treated}} for deep-vein {{thrombosis}} in his left leg at George Washington University Hospital after experiencing pain in his left calf. Doctors prescribed blood-thinning medication and allowed {{him to return to}} work. CBS News reported that during the morning of November 26, 2007, Cheney was diagnosed with <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and underwent treatment that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|While loss-of-function {{mutations}} in KCNE1 cause Long QT syndrome, gain-of-function KCNE1 mutations {{are associated with}} early-onset <b>atrial</b> fibrillation. A common KCNE1 polymorphism, S38G, is associated with altered predisposition to lone <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and postoperative <b>atrial</b> fibrillation. <b>Atrial</b> KCNE1 expression was downregulated in a porcine model of post-operative <b>atrial</b> fibrillation following lung lobectomy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atrial</b> {{contraction}} must {{be present}} for production of an S4. It is absent in <b>atrial</b> fibrillation {{and in other}} rhythms in which <b>atrial</b> contraction does not precede ventricular contraction.|$|E
25|$|Post-operative <b>atrial</b> {{fibrillation}} and <b>atrial</b> flutter.|$|E
25|$|Once {{dilation}} of the atria has occurred, this {{begins a}} chain of events that leads to the activation of the renin aldosterone angiotensin system (RAAS) and subsequent increase in matrix metalloproteinases and disintegrin, which leads to <b>atrial</b> remodeling and fibrosis, with loss of <b>atrial</b> muscle mass. This process is not immediate, and experimental studies have revealed patchy <b>atrial</b> fibrosis may precede the occurrence of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and may progress with prolonged durations of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Left <b>atrial</b> flutter {{is common}} after {{incomplete}} left <b>atrial</b> ablation procedures.|$|E
25|$|ANP is {{also called}} <b>atrial</b> natriuretic factor (ANF), <b>atrial</b> natriuretic hormone (ANH), cardionatrine, cardiodilatin (CDD), and atriopeptin.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{enlargement}} {{of both the}} left and right atria is associated with long-standing <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and, if noted at the initial presentation of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, suggests that the <b>atrial</b> fibrillation is likely to be of a longer duration than the individual's symptoms.|$|E
25|$|High risk: <b>atrial</b> {{fibrillation}} and paroxysmal <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, rheumatic {{disease of}} the mitral or aortic valve disease, artificial heart valves, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, sick sinus syndrome, sustained <b>atrial</b> flutter, recent myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction together with ejection fraction <28 percent, symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction <30 percent, dilated cardiomyopathy, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, Marantic endocarditis, infective endocarditis, papillary fibroelastoma, left <b>atrial</b> myxoma and {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{indications}} for digoxin are <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and <b>atrial</b> flutter with rapid ventricular response, though beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers are often preferred.|$|E
25|$|The ostium secundum <b>atrial</b> septal defect is {{the most}} common type of <b>atrial</b> septal defect, and {{comprises}} 6–10% of all congenital heart diseases.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that screening for <b>atrial</b> fibrillation in those 65 years and older increases the number of cases of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation detected.|$|E
25|$|AV node {{blockers}} {{should be}} avoided in <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and <b>atrial</b> flutter with WPW or history of it; this includes adenosine, diltiazem, verapamil, other calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. They can exacerbate the syndrome by blocking the heart's normal electrical pathway (therefore favoring 1:1 <b>atrial</b> to ventricle conduction through the pre-excitation pathway, potentially leading to unstable ventricular arrhythmias).|$|E
25|$|Those with <b>atrial</b> {{fibrillation}} have a 5% a year risk of stroke, {{and this}} risk {{is higher in}} those with valvular <b>atrial</b> fibrillation. Depending on the stroke risk, anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin or aspirin is useful for prevention. Except in people with <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, oral anticoagulants are not advised for stroke prevention —any benefit is offset by bleeding risk.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also some}} vagal {{innervation}} of the <b>atrial</b> muscle, {{and to a}} much lesser extent, the ventricular muscle. Vagus activation, therefore, results in modest reductions in <b>atrial</b> contractility (inotropy) and even smaller decreases in ventricular contractility.|$|E
25|$|Thromboembolism {{in later}} stages when the left <b>atrial</b> volume is {{increased}} (i.e., dilation). The latter leads to increase risk of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, {{which increases the}} risk of blood stasis (motionless). This {{increases the risk of}} coagulation.|$|E
25|$|Antiarrhythmic agents, {{also known}} as cardiac {{dysrhythmia}} medications, are a group of pharmaceuticals {{that are used to}} suppress abnormal rhythms of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias), such as <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, <b>atrial</b> flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Once {{someone is}} found to have an <b>atrial</b> septal defect, a {{determination}} of {{whether it should be}} corrected is typically made. If the <b>atrial</b> septal defect is causing the right ventricle to enlarge a secundum <b>atrial</b> septal defect should generally be closed. If the ASD is not causing problems the defect may simply checked every two or three years. Methods of closure of an ASD include surgical closure and percutaneous closure.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} with WPW {{experiences}} episodes of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, the ECG shows a rapid polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de pointes). This combination of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and WPW is considered dangerous, and most antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|Emboli most {{commonly}} {{arise from the}} heart (especially in <b>atrial</b> fibrillation) but may originate from elsewhere in the arterial tree. In paradoxical embolism, a deep vein thrombosis embolizes through an <b>atrial</b> or ventricular septal defect in the heart into the brain.|$|E
25|$|The P wave {{represents}} <b>atrial</b> depolarization.|$|E
25|$|Digoxin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Lanoxin among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat various heart conditions. Most frequently it is used for <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, <b>atrial</b> flutter, and heart failure. Digoxin is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|In general, an {{extended}} evaluation {{is not necessary}} for most individuals with <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and is performed only if abnormalities are noted in the limited evaluation, if a reversible cause of the <b>atrial</b> fibrillation is suggested, or if further evaluation may change the treatment course.|$|E
25|$|Tikosyn (dofetilide) for <b>atrial</b> {{fibrillation}} and flutter.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} new cases each year of <b>atrial</b> {{fibrillation}} increases with age. In individuals {{over the age of}} 80 it affects about 8%. In developed countries, the number of patients with <b>atrial</b> fibrillation is likely to increase during the next 50years, owing to the growing proportion of elderly individuals.|$|E
25|$|Chest X-ray {{may also}} assist in diagnosis, showing left <b>atrial</b> enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Keeping blood {{pressure}} below 140/90 mmHg is recommended. Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic strokes. Among people with nonvalvular <b>atrial</b> fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an embolic stroke. Stroke prevention treatment for <b>atrial</b> fibrillation is determined {{according to the}} CHA2DS2–VASc score. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients with nonvalvular <b>atrial</b> fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring.|$|E
