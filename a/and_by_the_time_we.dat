25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained [...] "That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> got around {{to the point where}} we were going to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of the whole thing is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E
500|$|Lazenby said he {{experienced}} difficulties during shooting, not receiving any coaching despite {{his lack of}} acting experience, and with director Hunt never addressing him directly, only through his assistant. Lazenby also declared that Hunt also asked {{the rest of the}} crew to keep a distance from him, as [...] "Peter thought the more I was alone, the better I would be as James Bond." [...] Allegedly, there also were personality conflicts with Rigg, who was already an established star. However, according to director Hunt, these rumours are untrue and there were no such difficulties—or else they were minor—and may have started with Rigg joking to Lazenby before filming a love scene [...] "Hey George, I'm having garlic for lunch. I hope you are!" [...] Hunt also declared that he usually had long talks with Lazenby before and during shooting. For instance, to shoot Tracy's death scene, Hunt brought Lazenby to the set at 8 o'clock in the morning and made him rehearse all day long, [...] "and I broke him down until he was absolutely exhausted, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> shot it at five o'clock, he was exhausted, and that's how I got the performance." [...] Hunt said that if Lazenby had remained in the role, he would also have directed the successor film, Diamonds Are Forever, and that his original intentions were concluding the film with Bond and Tracy driving off following their wedding, saving Tracy's murder for the pre-credit sequence of Diamonds Are Forever. The idea was discarded after Lazenby quit the role.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1952, I {{was flying}} down south {{with my wife}} Hope, and we left a bit later than usual <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> got over the Hamersley Ranges, the clouds had formed and the ceiling got lower and lower. I got into the Turner River, knowing full well if I {{followed}} it through, I would come out into the Ashburton.

2500|$|Another {{significant}} new family-member is Arthur's half-sister Morgause, {{the daughter of}} Gorlois and Igerna and mother of Gawain and Mordred in the French romances (replacing Geoffrey of Monmouth's Anna in this role). In the Vulgate Mort Artu we find Mordred's relationship with Arthur once more reinterpreted, as he is made the issue of an unwitting incestuous liaison between Arthur and this Morgause, with Arthur dreaming that Mordred would grow up to kill him. [...] This tale is preserved in all the romances based on the Mort Artu, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> reach Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur Arthur has started to plot, Herod-like, to kill all children born {{on the same day}} as Mordred in order to save himself from this fate. A third half-sister, Elaine, is also added at this time. Through his sisters, Arthur is given further nephews (Gareth, Gaheris, Agravain, Ywain, and Galeschin) who become Knights of the Round Table.|$|E
2500|$|Buechner recalls of {{his accomplishments}} at Exeter: [...] "All told, {{we were there}} for nine years with one year's leave of absence tucked in the middle, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> left, the {{religion}} department had grown from only one full-time teacher, namely myself, and about twenty students, to four teachers and something in the neighborhood, as I remember, of three hundred students or more." [...] Among these students was the future author John Irving, who included a quotation from Buechner in the preface of his book A Prayer for Owen Meany. One of Buechner's biographers, Marjorie Casebier McCoy, describes the effect of his time at Exeter as follows: [...] "Buechner in his sermons had been attempting {{to reach out to}} the [...] "cultured despisers of religion." [...] The students and faculty at Phillips Exeter had been, for the most part, just that when he had arrived at the school, and it had been they who compelled him to hone his preaching and literary skills to their utmost in order to get a hearing for Christian faith." ...|$|E
