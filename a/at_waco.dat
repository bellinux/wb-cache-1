25|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the events of}} April 19, 1993 when Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) special agents served a warrant on the Branch Davidian compound <b>at</b> <b>Waco,</b> Texas was ongoing during Freeh's tenure. While the event had taken place before he became Director, a highly controversial investigation ensued, including allegations of a cover-up by the FBI, and tensions developed between Freeh and Janet Reno, then-Attorney General. Reno, who had herself been blamed for mishandling of the confrontation and investigation, sent United States Marshals to FBI headquarters to seize Waco-related evidence.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, the HRT {{has been}} {{involved}} in many of the FBI's most high-profile cases, executing numerous operations involving domestic militant groups, terrorists, and violent criminals. The first test of the teamâ€™s capabilities came in the summer of 1984, when the team deployed to Los Angeles as part of the security buildup prior to the 1984 Summer Olympic Games. Some cases have brought the HRT a lot of attention. The HRT came under increased public and Congressional scrutiny, along with federal law enforcement in general, due to what some saw as heavy-handed tactics used <b>at</b> <b>Waco</b> and Ruby Ridge.|$|E

The new parent unit {{consisted of}} the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron and the 2nd Medium Tank Battalion, both part of the 36th Infantry Division. On 15 March 1963, the 124th Armor was reorganized and redesignated as the 124th Cavalry, also a CARS parent regiment. The unit included the 1st Squadron, part of the 36th Division, and the 2nd Squadron, part of the 49th Armored Division. On 15 January 1968, the 124th was reorganized to consist of Troop A, part of the 71st Airborne Brigade; Troop E, part of the 36th Infantry Brigade; and Troop F, part of the 72nd Infantry Brigade. On 1 November 1973, the regiment was reorganized to consist of the 1st Squadron, part of the 49th Armored Division. It was withdrawn from CARS on 4 March 1987 and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System with headquarters <b>at</b> <b>Waco.</b>|$|E
500|$|McVeigh's later {{response}} to the range of casualties was: [...] "I didn't define {{the rules of engagement}} in this conflict. The rules, if not written down, are defined by the aggressor.

500|$|W. E. B. Du Bois was incensed by {{news of the}} attack, saying [...] "any talk of {{the triumph}} of Christianity, or the spread of human culture, is idle twaddle {{as long as the}} Waco lynching is {{possible}} in the United States". After receiving Freeman's report, he placed an image of Washington's body on the cover of an issue of The Crisis, the NAACP's newsletter, which discussed the event. The issue was titled [...] "The Waco Horror" [...] and was published as an eight-page supplement to the July edition. Du Bois popularized [...] "Waco Horror" [...] as a name for Washington's lynching; the Houston Chronicle and the New York Times had previously used the word [...] "horror" [...] to describe the event. In 1916, The Crisis had a circulation of about 30,000, {{three times the size of}} the NAACP's membership. Although the paper had campaigned against lynching in the past, this issue was the first that contained images of an attack. The NAACP's board was initially hesitant to publish such graphic content, but Du Bois insisted on doing so, arguing that uncensored coverage would push white Americans to support change. In addition to images, the issue included accounts of the lynching that Freeman obtained from Waco residents. Du Bois wrote The Crisis article on the lynching; he edited and organized Freeman's report for publication, although she was not named in the issue. The article concluded with a call to support the anti-lynching movement. The NAACP distributed the report to hundreds of newspapers and politicians, a campaign that led to wide condemnation of the lynching. Many white observers were disturbed by the southerners who celebrated the lynching. The Crisis included more images of lynchings in subsequent issues. Washington's death received continued discussion in The Crisis. Oswald Garrison Villard wrote in a later edition of the paper that [...] "the crime <b>at</b> <b>Waco</b> is a challenge to our American civilization".|$|E

They would have argued that his bombing of the Murrah building was a justifiable response to what McVeigh believed were the crimes of the U.S. government <b>at</b> <b>Waco,</b> Texas, where the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian complex resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians.

2500|$|McVeigh's anti-government rhetoric {{became more}} radical.

[...] He began changing his answering machine greeting {{every couple of weeks}} to various quotes by Patrick Henry such as [...] "Give me liberty or give me death." [...] He began experimenting with pipe bombs and other small explosive devices. The government also imposed new firearms restrictions in 1994 that McVeigh believed threatened his livelihood.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866, Waco's leading {{citizens}} {{embarked on}} an ambitious project to build the first bridge to span the wide Brazos River. They formed the Waco Bridge Company to build the [...] brick Waco Suspension Bridge, which was completed in 1870. The company commissioned a firm owned by John Augustus Roebling in Trenton, New Jersey, to supply the cables and steelwork for the bridge, and contracted with Mr. Thomas M. Griffith, a civil engineer based in New York, for the supervisory engineering work on the bridge. The economic effects of the Waco bridge were immediate and large. The cowboys and cattle-herds following the Chisholm Trail north, crossed the Brazos River <b>at</b> <b>Waco.</b> Some chose to pay the Suspension Bridge toll, while others floated their herds down the river. The population of Waco grew rapidly, as immigrants now had a safe crossing for their horse-drawn carriages and wagons. Since 1971, the bridge has been open only to pedestrian traffic {{and is in the}} National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

Amid a growing mob, a chain was wrapped around Washington's neck, and he was stripped and beaten as he was taken to city hall.
