40|$|As {{environmental}} concerns increase, scientists, politicians, and laypersons {{are looking for}} ways to decrease our footprint on the earth. One method is to reduce the amount of waste produced. This study utilizes the Reasoned Action Model (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010) to predict intentions to use <b>a</b> singular <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> Results support the validity of the model for accurately predicting intentions. To investigate the validity of the model for predicting behavior, past power towel usage was used as a proxy to future behavior. Personal norms and intentions combined to account for the most variance in <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> usage. Additionally, participants were randomly assigned to watch a persuasive video on using <b>a</b> single <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> or <b>a</b> control video.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> has {{the same}} {{purposes}} as conventional towels such as drying hands, wiping windows, dusting, cleaning up spills. However, paper towels can only be used once after they blot wet surfaces. A school teacher in Ashland, Ohio, named Kurt Klier, gave students individual paper squares, so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs. When Arthur Scott, head of the Scott Paper Company heard about it, he {{decided to try to}} sell a load of paper that had been made too thick to use as toilet paper.|$|E
2500|$|Dana Kennedy, a {{journalist}} and correspondent, profiled Cosby for the Associated Press (AP) in 1992, noting that even though Cosby was {{at the height of}} his success and did not have any measurably negative publicity, he went on at length about [...] "why he mistrusts the press", saying he likes to [...] "control" [...] his interviews. The AP piece reflected more on how uncomfortable the interview was than the substance of the interview itself. In 2014, Kennedy recalled that after the critical AP piece ran, Cosby sent her a cryptic package with a withered piece of fruit wrapped up in <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> She noted that despite her interviews with some of the most notorious celebrities, it was Cosby—during the time of his highest popularity—who stood out as having a [...] "scary" [...] persona, recalling the mysterious package as something that [...] "has always given" [...] her [...] "the creeps". It was her remembrance of [...] "how intimidating and menacing" [...] Cosby was during that experience that led her to believe the stories of the women who were accusing Cosby.|$|E
2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel)</b> and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E

40|$|Cellulose, {{which is}} one of the most-abundant and -renewable natural resources, has been {{extensively}} explored as an alternative substance for electrode materials such as activated carbons. Here, we demonstrate a new class of coffee-mediated green activation of cellulose as a new environmentally benign chemical-activation strategy and its potential use for all-paper flexible supercapacitors. <b>A</b> piece of <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> is soaked in espresso coffee (acting as a natural activating agent) and then pyrolyzed to yield paper-derived activated carbons (denoted as EK-ACs). Potassium ions (K+), a core ingredient of espresso, play a viable role in facilitating pyrolysis kinetics and also in achieving a well-developed microporous structure in the EK-ACs. As a result, the EK-ACs show significant improvement in specific capacitance (131 F g- 1 at a scan rate of 1. 0 mV s- 1) over control ACs (64 F g- 1) obtained from the carbonization of <b>a</b> pristine <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> All-paper flexible supercapacitors are fabricated by assembling EK-ACs/carbon nanotube mixture-embedded <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> (as electrodes), poly(vinyl alcohol) /KOH mixture-impregnated <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> (as electrolytes), and polydimethylsiloxane-infiltrated <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> (as packaging substances). The introduction of the EK-ACs (as an electrode material) and the <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> (as <b>a</b> deformable and compliant substrate) enables the resulting all-paper supercapacitor to provide reliable and sustainable cell performance as well as exceptional mechanical flexibility. Notably, no appreciable loss in the cell capacitance is observed after repeated bending (over 5000 cycles) or multiple folding. The coffee-mediated green activation of cellulose and the resultant all-paper flexible supercapacitors open new material and system opportunities for eco-friendly high-performance flexible power sources...|$|R

50|$|Macromolecule {{blotting}} is {{a process}} performed after gel electrophoresis. An alkaline solution is prepared in a container. A sponge is placed into the solution and an agaros gel is placed {{on top of the}} sponge. Next, nitrocellulose paper is placed on top of the agarose gel and <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> are added on top of the nitrocellulose paper to apply pressure. The alkaline solution is drawn upwards towards the <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> During this process, the DNA denatures in the alkaline solution and is carried upwards to the nitrocellulose paper. The paper is then placed into a plastic bag and filled with a solution full of the DNA fragments, called the probe, found in the desired sample of DNA. The probes anneal to the complementary DNA of the bands already found on the nitrocellulose sample. Afterwards, probes are washed off and the only ones present are the ones that have annealed to complementary DNA on the paper. Next the paper is stuck onto an x ray film. The radioactivity of the probes creates black bands on the film, called an autoradiograph. As a result, only similar patterns of DNA to that of the probe are present on the film. This allows us the compare similar DNA sequences of multiple DNA samples. The overall process results in a precise reading of similarities in both similar and different DNA sample.|$|R
