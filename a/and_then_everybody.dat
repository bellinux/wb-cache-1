5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] shrieked the girls, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> but Hans {{set up a}} laugh. The German youth looked suspiciously {{out from}} under the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're from everywhere. And some of 'em {{are pretty}} streaked, I can tell you; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{the rest of}} us has got to suffer; throws {{suspicion}} on all of us. One fellow gets to stealin' fares, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody's</b> got to wear a bell-punch. I never hear mine go without thinkin' it says, 'Stop thief!' Makes me sick, I can tell you." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....We're {{talking about}} my {{personal}} story and his personal story, and there's also a layer of pop culture that {{plays a role in}} the lyrics of the song. For example, people build up a certain celebrity or musician or actor or whatever and they're popular one minute and the next thing, you know either they've done something wrong or they've done nothing wrong and there's just a bad rumor that goes around about them <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody's</b> attacking that person. That's just the way things are. We've actually lived through that as a band. All that stuff plays a role.|$|R
5000|$|Deflection {{has been}} {{described}} as a wrap-up smear: [...] "You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> you say, <b>everybody</b> is writing about this charge".|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's true!" [...] shouted all together, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> gave three cheers for Ol' Mistah Buzzard before {{starting}} off {{to attend to}} their own private affairs.|$|E
60|$|So it {{was agreed}} that all would be on hand at sun-up the next morning, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> started for home to think over the things they had learned.|$|E
60|$|It was Rob Dow who spoke. All saw he {{had been}} drinking, or they might have {{wondered}} at his vehemence. As it was, everybody looked at every other body, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> sighed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, this, father. When we {{had eaten}} the {{marriage}} feast, {{but before we}} past before priest, suddenly we hear a thunder and see a pillar of fire shoot up into sky, and {{sitting on top of}} it head of Harmac, which vanish into heaven <b>and</b> stop there. <b>Then</b> <b>everybody</b> jump up <b>and</b> say: ...|$|R
5000|$|We played {{four nights}} at The Tea Party, <b>and</b> by <b>then</b> {{we had an}} hour and a half's music to play; we played four and a half hours on the last night - we played the act twice, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> did <b>everybody</b> else's act with Who, Rolling Stones and Beatles numbers. Peter hugged us {{at the end of the}} gig, picked all four of us up at once. We knew we were {{actually}} going to make it.|$|R
6000|$|They {{were trying}} children, that's the truth. First, they wouldn't sing {{when they were}} asked; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>everybody</b> fully {{believed}} they wouldn't, they would. 'If you serve us so any more, my love,' said Mrs. Alicumpaine to a tall child, with {{a good deal of}} white back, in mauve silk trimmed with lace, 'it will be my painful privilege to offer you a bed, and to send you to it immediately.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must hunt to-morrow. Indeed {{there is}} nothing else to do. Chiltern has taken such a dislike to shooting-men, that he won't shoot {{pheasants}} himself. We don't hunt on Wednesdays or Sundays, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> lies in bed. Here is Mr. Maule, he lies in bed on other mornings as well, and spends the rest of his day riding about the country looking for the hounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|WILLIS: 'And {{then you}} say, [...] "Well, {{this is the}} most {{remarkable}} coincidence I ever heard of. I didn't get my own watch from the fellow, but I got yours, Mr. Bemis;" [...] and then you hand it over to him and say, [...] "Sorry I had to break the chain in getting it from him," [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> laughs again, and--and that ends it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Janet blushed, Anne said {{something}} polite and conventional, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> {{sat down and}} made talk. It was hard work, even for Anne, for nobody seemed at ease except old Mrs. Douglas, who certainly {{did not find any}} difficulty in talking. She made Janet sit by her and stroked her hand occasionally. Janet sat and smiled, looking horribly uncomfortable in her hideous dress, and John Douglas sat without smiling.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no; no! Everybody {{would be}} against you. If you take her {{off in a}} {{spirited}} sort of way <b>and</b> <b>then</b> marry her, <b>everybody</b> will be with you. That's what you want. The father and mother will be sure to come round, if--' ...|$|R
2500|$|The first candidates' forum {{was held}} on March 19 in Cypress Park, Los Angeles, {{sponsored}} by the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. Only Cedillo, Chu, and Pleitez were invited. By late March, Cedillo and Chu had each raised {{several hundred thousand dollars}} and were widely viewed as the frontrunners. A fellow of the Rose Institute of State and Local Government characterized the contest by saying: [...] "When people talk about this race, there's Cedillo <b>and</b> Chu, <b>then</b> there's Pleitez, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> there's <b>everybody</b> else." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{bystanders}} waited motionless, {{and none}} of them made a bet, for any stakes they could offer would be trifles now; but they glanced at the lad who stood tensely still, while Witham watched the face of the man at {{the table in front of}} him. For a moment he saw a flicker of triumph in his eyes, and that decided him. Again, one by one, the cards went down, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>everybody</b> waited in strained expectancy, the lad seemed to grow limp suddenly and groaned.|$|R
6000|$|The next Sunday {{the seat}} of Zephaniah Pennel was vacant in church. According to custom, a note was put up asking prayers for his safe return, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> {{knew that he was}} gone to the Banks; and as the roguish, {{handsome}} face of Moses was also missing, Miss Roxy whispered to Miss Ruey, [...] "There! Captain Pennel's took Moses on his first voyage. We must contrive to call round on Mis' Pennel afore long. She'll be lonesome." ...|$|E
6000|$|Whereupon some fat {{old lady}} remarks that [...] "it's strange how {{children}} take a dislike to any one." [...] "Oh, they know," [...] replies another mysteriously. [...] "It's a wonderful thing," [...] adds a third; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> looks sideways at you, convinced {{you are a}} scoundrel of the blackest dye; and they glory in the beautiful idea that your true character, unguessed by your fellow-men, has been discovered by the untaught instinct of a little child.|$|E
6000|$|Lord George still {{continued}} his plea for Mr. Nappie. [...] "There's something in that, certainly; but, still, I agree with Mrs. Carbuncle. If {{it had happened}} to me, I should--just have committed murder and suicide. I can't conceive anything so terrible. It's all very well for your noble master to talk of being civil, and hoping that the horse had carried him well, and all that. There are circumstances in which a man can't be civil. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> laughed at him! It's {{the way of the}} world. The lower you fall, the more you're kicked." ...|$|E
60|$|The Law of the Jungle, {{which never}} orders {{anything}} without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man {{except when he}} is killing to show his children how to kill, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he must hunt outside the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe. The real {{reason for this is}} that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets <b>and</b> torches. <b>Then</b> <b>everybody</b> in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.|$|R
60|$|When {{they reached}} {{the edge of the}} Fog Bank, the Pinkies all halted to put on their raincoats, and Button-Bright put up his {{umbrella}} and held it over himself <b>and</b> Trot. <b>Then,</b> when <b>everybody</b> was ready, they entered the Fog and Rosalie the Witch made a signal to call the Frog King and his subjects to aid them as they had done before.|$|R
60|$|My {{surprise}} at {{finding that the}} man had spoken the literal truth was almost, if not quite, equaled by my astonishment at finding myself face to face with Arthur Holliday as soon as I entered the bedroom. It was no time then for giving or seeking explanations. We just shook hands amazedly, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> I ordered <b>everybody</b> but Arthur out of the room, and hurried to the man on the bed.|$|R
6000|$|No {{more was}} said then, {{for the rest}} of the world was collecting, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> went out their several ways. Some tin tacks were wanted for the dolls' house, and there were reports that Wattlesea possessed a doll's grate and fire-irons. The {{children}} were wild to go in quest of them, but they were not allowed to go alone, and it was pronounced too far and too damp for the elder sister, so that they would have been disappointed, if Clarence--stimulated by Martyn's kicks under the table--had not offered to be their escort. [...] When Mrs. Fordyce demurred, my mother replied, 'You may perfectly trust her with Clarence.' ...|$|E
60|$|A horn called shrilly; a few whip-cracks {{rang out}} like pistol-shots; {{and the dogs}} took the water, {{swimming}} slowly here and there. Men scrambled along the bank. Some, entering the river, reinforced the line spread out across the head rapid while others joined the second row wading steadily up-stream and splashing about as they advanced with iron-tipped poles. Nothing rewarded their efforts. The dogs suddenly turned and went down-stream; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> ran or waded toward the tail outflow. A clamor of shouting and baying broke out; and floundering men and swimming dogs went down the stream together in a confused mass. There was a brief silence. The hounds came out and trotted to and fro along the bank; and dripping men clambered after them.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the twelve}} sacred krisses had great virtue. And, when any {{sickness}} {{appeared in a}} village {{one of them was}} sent for; and sometimes the sickness went away, and then the sacred kris was taken back again with great Honour, and the head men of the village came to tell the Rajah of its miraculous power, and to thank him. And sometimes the sickness would not go away; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> was convinced {{that there had been a}} mistake in the number of needles sent from that village, and therefore the sacred kris had no effect, and had to be taken back again by the head men with heavy hearts, but still, with all honour--for was not the fault their own? ...|$|E
50|$|The man in monk clothes, who {{is called}} ”the priest” (Il Santo) objects that killings {{were not part}} of the agreement. Jarret’s plan, however, is to await an Indian guide who knows the way through the desert, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> kill <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> burn the town to get rid of witnesses. However the guide does not arrive - because he was killed earlier in a fight with the Priest who had tried to pay him not to come. The Priest {{secretly}} continues a liaison with Jarret’s woman Mara (the woman on the wagon) and plans to take the gold. He thus supports Jarret against gang members who want it to be divided at once.|$|R
500|$|Manson {{stated that}} {{eliminating}} the corporate pressure and indifference, {{as well as}} the band having a relaxed approach to the making of the record was pivotal for a healthy regroup, writing and recording process. [...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves. So we did two weeks <b>and</b> <b>then</b> we'd take some time off <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>everybody</b> felt ready we'd get back in [...] again. As a result, I think everybody really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in", she remarked. Never much enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|R
5000|$|Others - who {{reject the}} {{accepted}} {{account of the}} September 11 attacks are not proposing specific theories, but try {{to demonstrate that the}} U.S. government's account of the events is wrong. This, according to them, would lead to a general call for a new official investigation into the events of September 11, 2001. According to Jonathan Kay, managing editor for comment at the Canadian newspaper National Post and author of the Among the Truthers: A Journey Through America's Growing Conspiracist Underground, [...] "They feel their job is to show everybody that the official theory of 9/11 is wrong. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>everybody</b> is convinced, <b>then</b> the population will rise up and demand a new investigation with government resources, and that investigation will tell us what actually happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|Chatterer flirted {{his tail}} in the saucy way he has, {{and his eyes}} twinkled. Here was just the best chance ever to boast and brag. He could tell Tommy Tit how smart he had been--smart enough {{to get away from}} Farmer Brown's boy. Tommy Tit would tell the other little people, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>{{everybody}}</b> would think him just as smart as Unc' Billy Possum; and you know Unc' Billy really was smart enough to get away from Farmer Brown's boy after being caught. Everybody knew that he had been a prisoner, and now that he was free, everybody would believe whatever he told them about how he got away. Was there ever such a chance to make his friends and neighbors say: [...] "What a smart fellow he is!" ...|$|E
6000|$|That I {{believed}} as implicitly as {{the tale}} of a destroyer attack some months ago, the object of which was to flush Zeppelins. It succeeded, for the flotilla was attacked by several. Right {{in the middle of the}} flurry, a destroyer asked permission to stop and lower dinghy to pick up ship's dog which had fallen overboard. Permission was granted, and the dog was duly rescued. [...] "Lord knows what the Hun made of it," [...] said my informant. [...] "He was rumbling round, dropping bombs; and the dinghy was digging out for all she was worth, and the Dog-Fiend was swimming for Dunkirk. It must have looked rather mad from above. But they saved the Dog-Fiend, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> swore he was a German spy in disguise." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} boat the captain went ashore. He {{considered}} it wise {{to land the}} treasure {{as fast as it}} could be taken out of the hold, for no one could know at what time, whether on account of wind from shore or waves from the sea, the vessel might slip out into deep water. This was a slower method than if everybody had worked at getting the gold on deck, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> had worked at getting it ashore, but it was a safer plan than the other, for if an accident should occur, if the brig should be driven off the sand, they would have whatever they had already landed. As this thought passed through the mind of the captain, he could not help a dismal smile.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, indeed. He {{has been}} so good; and it has made me wretched {{to see that he}} has been disturbed. He has been as anxious that you should be settled well, as though you had been his own. And this will be to be settled well. I am told that M. Urmand's house is one of those which look down upon the river from near the church; the very best {{position}} in all the town. And it is full of everything, they say. His father spared nothing for furniture when he was married. And they say that his mother's linen was quite a sight to be seen. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> Marie, <b>everybody</b> acknowledges that he is such a nice-looking young man!' ...|$|R

60|$|It was Maria who jeeringly told us {{the story}} of the priest, who shrugged her {{shoulders}} to imply that he was a contemptible figure. Paolo sat with the abstract look on his face, as of one who hears and does not hear, is not really concerned. He never opposed or contradicted her, but stayed apart. It was she who was violent and brutal in her ways. But sometimes Paolo went into a rage, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Maria, <b>everybody,</b> was afraid. It was a white heavy rage, when his blue eyes shone unearthly, and his mouth opened with a curious drawn blindness of the old Furies. There was something of the cruelty of a falling mass of snow, heavy, horrible. Maria drew away, there was a silence. Then the avalanche was finished.|$|R
