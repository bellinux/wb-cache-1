5|$|The Hamden tornado {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tornado of this family, and possibly the most damaging of the entire outbreak. It touched down at 5:38pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway. Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> houses, as well as an industrial park, were flattened. The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45. The damage path was only five miles long, stopping just short of the city of New Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures in its path.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, industrial landscape of factories <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} examples of Ottoman architecture in Istanbul are the Anadoluhisarı and Rumelihisarı fortresses, which assisted the Ottomans during their siege of the city. Over {{the next four}} centuries, the Ottomans made an indelible impression on the skyline of Istanbul, building towering mosques and ornate palaces. The largest palace, Topkapı, includes a diverse array of architectural styles, from Baroque inside the Harem, to its Neoclassical style Enderûn Library. The imperial mosques include Fatih Mosque, Bayezid Mosque, Yavuz Selim Mosque, Süleymaniye Mosque, Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque), and Yeni Mosque, {{all of which were}} built {{at the peak of the}} Ottoman Empire, in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the following centuries, and especially after the Tanzimat reforms, Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles. An example of which is the imperial Nuruosmaniye Mosque. Areas around İstiklal Avenue were filled with grand European embassies <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> buildings in Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoğlu—including churches, stores, and theaters—and official buildings such as Dolmabahçe Palace.|$|E

25|$|Though {{modestly}} sized, Mehtar Mahal {{dated to}} 1620 {{is one of}} the most elegant structures in the fort; the entry gate in particular has been built in Indo-Saracenic style. The façade has three arches, which depict exquisite “cornice supported on carved corbels”. A gateway leads to the Mehtar mosque, which is a three-storey building. It has two slender minarets that are covered with delicately carved birds <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> swans. The carvings are in Hindu architectural style, in the form of brackets supporting the balconies and stone trellis work. The building has a flat roof and minarets have rounded top.|$|E

25|$|Another site {{to explore}} the deeply rooted Chinese culture in George Town is the Khoo Kongsi, a large Chinese clan house at Cannon Square. Originally built as a meeting place for the Khoo clan, the Khoo Kongsi still retains its {{authentic}} Chinese architecture, with its granite-paved courtyard surrounded by an intricately-built association building, a theatre stage <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> smaller houses inhabited by the clan members in the past. The Khoo Kongsi is {{actually one of the}} numerous clan houses that are scattered in the city, which were built by separate surname-based clan associations established to assist the newly arrived Chinese immigrants in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|For Neff's {{office at}} Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set {{designer}} Hal Pereira conspired {{to create a}} little in-house joke, typical of Billy Wilder. In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles off the elevator {{on his way to}} his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking rows <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink and stares down for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.|$|E
25|$|The listed train {{shed roof}} which is 105 metres wide between {{platforms}} 1 and 12, has four spans, two spans 185 metres in length over {{the eastern part}} of the station date from the 1860s while the other two at the western side measuring 150 metres long were built in the early 1880s. The roof is supported by masonry walls with round-headed windows alongside platforms 1 and 12 <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> cast iron columns. The roof spans have wrought iron trusses with cast iron struts on girders between the columns. The original roof was covered with slates with some glazing. The slates were subsequently replaced with boarded felt. Between 1997 and 1999 the roof was refurbished and 10,000 panes of toughened glass 'float' above the wrought iron trusses.|$|E

25|$|The Dragon and Phoenix carpet lacks his {{original}} borders, {{and seems to}} be cut off at the right side. Its field is parted into two rectangular sections, each containing a yellow-groud octagon in which a Chinese dragon and a phoenix are opposed to each other in combat. Both animals are stylized in geometrical form. Their blue colours, outlined in red, contrasts well with the yellow ground of the octagon. The design of the upper octagon appears to be somewhat more compressed than the lower. The corners between the octagon and the rectangular field are filled in with red triangles <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> white hooks on red ground, creating a reciprocal hook design. The rectangular fields are surrounded by a small guardian border showing a row of pearls in different colours. The main border has red floral tendrils composed of identical, S-like ornaments on a brown ground.|$|E
25|$|In winter, {{the coat}} is usually of a dirty-brownish grey or dirty grey colour. The hairs of the mane are light grey or white at the base, and black or dark brown at the tips. The muzzle is dark, greyish brown, brownish-grey or black, while {{the top of}} the head and cheeks are more lightly coloured. The ears are almost black. A large black spot is present on the front of the neck, and is {{separated}} from the chin by a light zone. A dark field ascends from the flanks ascending to the rear of the cheeks. The inner and outer surface of the forelegs are covered with small dark spots and transverse stripes. The flanks have four indistinct dark vertical stripes <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> diffused spots. The outer surface of the thighs has 3–4 distinct vertical or oblique dark bands which merge into transverse stripes in the lower portion of the legs. The tip of the tail is black with white underfur.|$|E
25|$|The beaches at Jacob Riis Park {{consists}} of 14 bays numbered east-to-west on the Atlantic coast. The main beach occupies the western {{half of the}} park, or Bays 6 through 14, {{at the mouth of}} the Central Mall. Bays 1 through 5 lie on the eastern half in front of Neponsit Beach Hospital and the park bathhouse. Bay 1 is directly in front of the hospital, while the bathhouse feeds into Bay 4. The main beach features a distinctive crescent shape opening towards the Atlantic Ocean. The eastern half of the beach is much more narrow than the western half. Each bay is separated by reinforced concrete jetties, boulders, <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> wooden pilings which extend into the ocean. The jetties also stabilize the sand of the beach. Until the 1950s, Bays 1 and 2 were part of the Neponsit Hospital property. Adjacent to the east of Bay 1 is Rockaway Beach, another public beach which stretches from Neponsit to Far Rockaway at the east end of the peninsula. A fence separates the two beaches.|$|E

25|$|Velvet worms are {{segmented}} {{animals with}} a flattened cylindrical body cross-section <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> unstructured body appendages known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20cm (.2 to 8in), {{with the average}} being about 5cm (2 in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin s, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only a little differently from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.|$|E
500|$|The {{scales on}} the body of the snake are called the dorsal or costal scales. Sometimes there is a special row of large scales {{along the top of the}} back of the snake, i.e., the {{uppermost}} row, called the vertebral scales. The enlarged scales on the belly of the snake are called ventral scales or gastrosteges. The number of ventral scales can be a guide to the species. [...] In [...] "advanced" [...] (Caenophidian) snakes, the broad belly scales <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> dorsal scales correspond to the vertebrae, allowing scientists to count the vertebrae without dissection.|$|E
