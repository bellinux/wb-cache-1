5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{estimate of}} the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> of 5–6K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> of 3.18K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8K in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Actinium metal {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> between 1100 and 1300°C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile.|$|E

5|$|All air well designs {{incorporate}} a substrate with <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> sufficiently low so that dew forms. Dew {{is a form}} of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from fog, in that fog is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E
5|$|Although blue phases are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> range of more than 60K including room temperature (260–326K) has been demonstrated. Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times {{of the order of}} 10−4s.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E

5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient.|$|E
5|$|Because no ammonia was {{initially}} {{found in the}} vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an antifreeze, it was thought such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> of at least , because pure water requires more energy to melt.|$|E
5|$|Carrots can {{be stored}} for several months in the {{refrigerator}} or over winter in a moist, cool place.

5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> {{rise of the}} gas, {{proportional}} to the pressure increase.

5|$|Cubzac's {{climate is}} oceanic, {{part of the}} Dfb group in the Köppen climate classification. Periodically, the river Dordogne causes flooding. Nowadays Cubzac is {{protected}} by a dam, but is still vulnerable to flooding during high tides and strong winds. Flooding occurred last in the 1999 Martin and 2010 Xynthia storms. The 1999 storm destroyed many trees from the Terrefort castle park. In 1708, <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> extremum of -15°C caused the river and vineyards to freeze.|$|E

5|$|The James Webb Space Telescope {{will have}} 18 {{hexagonal}} beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST will face <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> of 33 K, the mirror {{is made of}} gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures. For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.|$|E
5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process {{was based on the}} discovery by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and later Charles Soret in 1879, that when <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient is maintained in an originally homogeneous salt solution, after a time, a concentration gradient will also exist in the solution. This is generally known today as the Soret effect. David Enskog in 1911 and Sydney Chapman in 1916 independently developed the Chapman–Enskog theory, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through <b>a</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F.W. Dootson in 1916.|$|E
