5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|Though rare, TBI is {{a serious}} condition; it may cause {{obstruction}} of the airway with resulting life-threatening respiratory insufficiency.

5|$|<b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{who lost}} their lives on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E

Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most of whom had been held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> recovered from the Bangkok area.

5|$|The Historia Ecclesiastica was copied {{often in}} the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts {{containing}} it survive. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> are located on the European continent, {{rather than on the}} British Isles. Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's Historia come from the northern parts of the Carolingian Empire. This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at Strasbourg, France. Modern historians have studied the Historia extensively, and a number of editions have been produced. For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the Historia, but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the Historia was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{scintillation}} {{produced in}} the charge avalanches in GEM holes as signal amplification and readout is investigated for xenon.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the differences in}} the decomposition rate and fungal biomass in the litter of Hylocomium splendens among forests under different climatic conditions. The samples were collected from one boreal forest in Canada, three subalpine forests on Mt. Fuji and one cool temperate forest on Mt. Tsurugi, Shikoku in Japan. The decomposition rate in the cool temperate forest was much faster than those in the boreal and subalpine forests. Ergosterol, which is a component of fungal cell membranes, was used as an indicator of fungal biomass. Ergosterol was detected not only from brown moss litter but also from green shoots of the moss. In spite of the faster decomposition rate, ergosterol content of the moss litter of the cool temperate forest was <b>about</b> one <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the boreal and subalpine forests.

Also, the A-4 Skyhawk force were dependent on the two available KC-130 tankers, limiting the amount of aeroplanes that could attack simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The {{transformation}} of Mu Ban Samaki into the Wapi Project {{was based on}} explicitly linking the newly offered civic services to a militia effort to defend them. The Wapi Project was offered to a population <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 120,000. <b>Half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> were estimated to be communist sympathizers; however military intelligence reported only 300 communist guerrillas among them. Even pro-communist village leaders were swayed by such improvements as agricultural cooperatives. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) cooperated in the effort. This made it among the first integrated civic aid projects in Indochina, and it ran at a relatively low cost. The ADC training camp opened at a site dubbed PS 18 in November 1965; it would train militia for a year. One of the three CIA case agents assigned to the ADC effort had experience dealing with Lao Theung from a previous assignment with Operation Pincushion.|$|R

25|$|The Ministry of Education (MoE) {{provides}} some indication of achievements {{in the five years}} from 2008/9 to 2012/13 although statistics do depend upon the accuracy of data collected. Primary school enrolment has increased substantially but only <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> enrolled manage to complete both cycles. There are a large number of over-age children enrolling for grade 1 although this has been declining. This is shown by the difference between gross intake rate (GIR) and net intake rate (NIR).

About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. Adolescents were generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape did {{they have a chance to}} avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years.

25|$|Elderly {{and very}} ill {{patients}} can possibly suffer apnea or cardiac arrest. Concomitant {{use of other}} central nervous system depressants increases this risk.

Doses of diazepam are recommended to be <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> given to younger people, and treatment limited to a maximum of two weeks. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam are not recommended for the elderly. Diazepam can also be dangerous in geriatric patients owing to a significant increased risk of falls.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the H 2 - and 03 -treatments of the natural {{graphite}} on the adsorbability of N 2 and Ar was investigated by measuring the adsorption isotherm of both gases. The H 2 -treatment redueed the surface heterogeneity and promoted crystallization of the graphite. The succeeding 03 -treament of the hydrogenated graphite again enhanced the surface heterogeneity to some extent. As a result, the phenomena stated below was observed: the amounts of N 2 and Ar adsorbed on the hydrogenated or ozonized graphite in the mediurn pressure range are reduced to <b>about</b> a <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> on the natural graphite; the BET plots of N 2 on the treated graphites give two linear portions; every adsorption isotherm shows a remarkable step at a relative pressure of O. 4; a prominent hysteresis appears in every adsorption isetherm.
