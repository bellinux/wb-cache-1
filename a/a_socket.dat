5|$|The market {{cross in}} Bath Street {{dates from the}} 15thcentury, with the shelter having been rebuilt in 1834. It has a central {{octagonal}} pier, <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> raised on four steps, a hexagonal shelter with six arched four-centred openings, shallow two-stage buttresses at each angle, and an embattled parapet. The shaft is crowned by an abacus with figures in niches, probably from the late 19thcentury, although the cross is now missing. It was rebuilt by Thomas, Marquis of Bath. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Somerset County No21) and GradeII* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with <b>a</b> <b>socket.</b> The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E

50|$|The 15 ampere (<b>A)</b> <b>sockets</b> were {{generally}} given a dedicated 15 A circuit. Multiple 5 <b>A</b> <b>sockets</b> {{might be on}} a 15 A circuit, or each on a dedicated 5 A circuit. Lighting circuits fused at 5 A {{were generally}} used to feed the 2 <b>A</b> <b>sockets.</b> Adaptors were available from 15 A down to 5 A and from 5 A down to 2 A so in practice {{it was possible for}} an appliance with the smallest size of flex to be protected only by a 15 A fuse. This is a similar level of protection to that seen for portable appliances in other countries, but less than the protection offered by the BS 1363 fused plug.|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>socket</b> may be {{surrounded}} by a decorative or protective cover called a wall plate, face plate, outlet cover, socket cover, or wall cover. In some designs this is an integral piece with the socket itself, bought and installed as a single unit.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{towns and}} garrisons in the United Kingdom between 46 BC and 400 AD had complex sewer {{networks}} sometimes constructed out of hollowed-out elm logs, which were shaped {{so that they}} butted together with the down-stream pipe providing <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> for the upstream pipe.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>socket</b> wrench, more {{commonly}} referred to as a ratchet, is a type of wrench, or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners, most commonly nuts and bolts. The ratchet wrench was invented by J.J. Richardson of Woodstock, Vermont, receiving a patent for the ratchet wrench from the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 18, 1863.|$|E
25|$|The 5-amp {{version of}} BS 546 is {{sometimes}} used for lamps {{controlled by a}} central switch or dimmer. They may {{also be used for}} other specialist purposes. It is therefore, not advisable to connect an appliance to such <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> outlet and tourists should not use adaptors to connect to them if they are present in hotel bedrooms. They are exclusively for lighting or specialist purposes.|$|E
25|$|A {{torque wrench}} {{is a tool}} used to {{precisely}} apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt. It is usually {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> wrench with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Charles Bahr in 1918. However, it wasn't until much later on March 16, 1937, that Bahr received U.S. patent #2,074,079 for the invention of the torque wrench.|$|E
50|$|The sending of UDP {{broadcasts}} on {{a network}} are always enabled on <b>a</b> datagram <b>socket.</b> In order to receive broadcast packets, <b>a</b> datagram <b>socket</b> should be bound to the wildcard address.

25|$|There {{was also}} {{provision}} for the attachment of beaching wheels: Each float had a watertight transverse tube, {{to which a}} mainwheel could be fitted, and there was <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> for a detachable swivelling tailwheel {{at the rear of}} the tailfloat, just forward of the taxying rudder. A side view photograph of the Sporting Type (taken at Olympia in July 1920), showing the port beaching-wheel in place, was published in Flight Magazine.|$|E
25|$|Most {{electronic}} keyboards {{also have}} <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> at the back, into which a foot switch can be plugged. The most common {{function is to}} simulate the sustain on a piano by turning {{on and off the}} MIDI control which adds sustain to a note. However, since they are also simple MIDI devices, foot switches can usually be configured to turn on and off any MIDI control, such as turning of one of the DSP effects, or the auto-harmony.|$|E
25|$|The Criminal Investigations Division (CID) was tasked by {{the head}} of the Manpower Directorate with finding Israeli MIAs, {{estimated}} at about 900 at the time. They did so by getting testimonies, following the Arab media for news of POWs, searching for clues at the battle sites, as well as physical searches. As a lesson from the difficulty of the searches, the CID recommended that army boots be produced with <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> for an additional dog tag, a recommendation accepted and practiced ever since.|$|E
50|$|If a three-conductor plug is {{connected}} to <b>a</b> two-conductor <b>socket,</b> normally the result is to leave the ring of the plug unconnected (open circuit). In the days of vacuum tubes this was also potentially dangerous to equipment but most solid-state devices tolerate this condition well. <b>A</b> three-conductor <b>socket</b> could be wired as <b>an</b> unbalanced mono <b>socket</b> to ground the ring in this situation, but the more conventional wiring is to leave the ring unconnected, exactly simulating <b>a</b> mono <b>socket.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because it was pin-compatible {{with the}} 8088 and {{relatively}} inexpensive, the V20 {{was also a}} popular end-user upgrade for systems with <b>a</b> <b>socketed</b> processor, including the original IBM PC and XT.|$|R
5000|$|On the Île Agois a 76m high rock stack {{north of}} Jersey remains of 25 hut {{structures}} were found containing 7th or 8th century objects including <b>a</b> <b>socketed</b> axe and glass beads.|$|R
25|$|Polarization is {{maintained}} by the shape, size, or position of plug pins and socket holes and socket recesses {{to ensure that a}} plug fits only one way into <b>a</b> <b>socket.</b> Lamps with screw bases will connect the shell of the lamp socket to the neutral conductor. Similarly, the single-pole switch of the appliance is connected in series with the energized wire. However, due to the uncertainty, in practice, of which conductor is the neutral, some appliances contain dual-pole switches which interrupt both conductors.|$|E
25|$|In some multi-standard sockets the {{aperture}} size for NEMA plugs {{is the same}} for both Line (Hot) and Neutral (see second picture), which may defeat the polarization of NEMA 1 plugs. In <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> designed to accept both NEMA and BS 1363 plugs, the lower right contact (in the orientation shown in the picture) should be connected to the Line wire for BS 1363 plugs, but the Neutral wire for NEMA plugs, so safe wiring of these devices for universal use is not possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Wang marketed a PC-compatible {{based on}} the Intel 80386SX processor, which they called the Alliance 750CD. It was clocked at 25MHz and had <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> for an 80387 math coprocessor. It came with 2 {{megabytes}} of installed RAM, and was expandable to 16 megabytes using SIMM memory cards (a Wang invention that became an industry standard). It had a 1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive, an internal 80 megabyte hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. Five expansion slots were built-in. It came with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 operating systems.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a 3-way 2-circuit switch is {{incorporated}} together with <b>a</b> regular <b>socket,</b> {{to be used}} as the main lamp <b>socket</b> in <b>a</b> lamp with a night light. In this configuration, the switched lamp one live terminal for the night light socket is exposed externally on the base of the socket, to be wired to the remote candelabra socket. Hence, this type of <b>socket</b> has <b>a</b> Hot terminal, a Neutral terminal, and a switched Hot terminal. This creates a confusing situation in which <b>a</b> keyed 3-way <b>socket</b> (which has <b>a</b> 3-contact <b>socket</b> at the top of it) has only two terminal screws, while <b>a</b> night-light <b>socket</b> (which does not have <b>a</b> 3-contact <b>socket</b> at the top) has three terminal screws on the base.|$|R

The 10 A three-pin earthed rear entry plug is {{designated}} CEI 23-50 S11 (there are also two side-entry versions, SPA 11 and SPB 11). The 10 A two-pin unearthed plug is designated CEI 23-50 S10. The 10 <b>A</b> three-pin earthed <b>socket</b> is designated CEI 23-50 P11, and the 10 <b>A</b> two-pin unearthed <b>socket</b> is designated CEI 23-50 P10. Both 10 <b>A</b> <b>sockets</b> also accept Europlugs.|$|R
30|$|The {{data in the}} Table 5 {{show the}} {{difference}} in performance between the RMI <b>an</b> <b>Sockets.</b> The RMI is optimized for parameter passing what is common for method evocation, but are less efficient for passing large amounts of data.|$|R
25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into <b>a</b> <b>socket.</b> Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections {{at the base of}} the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray capacitance between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.|$|E
25|$|Although {{designs and}} {{construction}} vary between brands, basic {{components of a}}ll ballpoint pens are universal. Standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating ball itself (distributing the ink on the writing surface), <b>a</b> <b>socket</b> holding the ball in place, small ink channels that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained ink reservoir supplying ink to the ball. In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity. Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points, then housed in a brass socket.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main EBPVD configurations, {{electromagnetic}} alignment, electromagnetic focusing and the pendant drop configuration. Electromagnetic alignment and electromagnetic focusing use evaporation {{material that is}} in the form of an ingot, while the pendant drop configuration uses a rod. Ingots are enclosed in a copper crucible or hearth, while a rod will be mounted at one end in <b>a</b> <b>socket.</b> Both the crucible and socket must be cooled. This is typically done by water circulation. In the case of ingots, molten liquid can form on its surface, which can be kept constant by vertical displacement of the ingot. The evaporation rate may be on the order of 10−2 g/(cm2·s).|$|E

50|$|CPU sockets {{are used}} on the {{motherboard}} in desktop and server computers. As they allow easy swapping of components, they are also used for prototyping new circuits. Laptops typically use surface-mount CPUs, which take up less space on the motherboard than <b>a</b> <b>socketed</b> part.|$|R
