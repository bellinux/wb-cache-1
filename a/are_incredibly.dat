25|$|Most of the {{specimens}} {{collected from}} a corpse at {{a crime scene}} are maggots. Insects found in this immature stage of development <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> difficult to identify because all maggots have the same appearance when in this stage. It is because of this that most live specimens collected are reared into their adult stage where identification is increasingly easier.|$|E
25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> specific for SLE, with studies quoting nearly 100%, and {{are therefore}} used in the diagnosis of SLE. Higher titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies are more suggestive of SLE and lower titres {{can be found in}} people without the disease. In contrast to the high specificity, estimates of 25-85% have been observed for the sensitivity of anti-dsDNA in SLE. Therefore, presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies are suggestive of SLE, however an absence of the antibodies does not rule out the disease.|$|E

25|$|M94, also {{classified}} as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms {{and a bright}} core. The outskirts of the galaxy <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> luminous in the ultraviolet because of a ring of new stars surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are not sure what has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a bar that is thus far invisible.|$|E
25|$|The anime/manga Deadman Wonderland {{features}} two albinos named Chan and En as bodyguards to {{the main}} antagonist of the series, the director of Deadman Wonderland named Hagire Rinichirou. They are twin brother and sister, and <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> loyal to Hagire, seeing him as a father figure and killing people who merely insult him. There is also a third albino, {{one of the main}} characters, named Shiro, who appears an innocent and complacent young girl, but has a cruel and psychopathic alter ego knows as the Wretched Egg, which is Hagire's lifetime obsession.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} a drug {{are a result of}} their binding {{selectivity}} with macromolecule properties of an organism, or the affinity with which different ligands bind to a substrate. More specifically, the specificity and selectivity of a ligand to its respective receptor provides researchers the opportunity to isolate and produce specific drug effects through the manipulation of ligand concentrations and receptor densities. Hormones and neurotransmitters are essential endogenous regulatory ligands that affect physiological receptors within an organism. Drugs that act upon these receptors <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> selective in order to produce required responses from signaling molecules.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{studies in}} the New World that tie Book of Mormon places and peoples to real world {{locations}} and civilizations <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> difficult since there are generally no landmarks defined in the Book of Mormon that can unambiguously identify real world locations. Generally non-Mormon archaeologists do not consider there to be any authentic Book of Mormon archaeological sites. Various apologists have claimed that events in the Book of Mormon {{took place in a}} variety of locations including North America, South America, Central America, and even the Malay Peninsula. These finds are divided into competing models, most notably the Hemispheric Geography Model, the Mesoamerican Limited Geography Model, and the Finger Lakes Limited Geography Model.|$|E
25|$|All transcriptomic methods require RNA {{to first}} be {{isolated}} from the experimental organism before transcripts can be recorded. Although biological systems <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> diverse, RNA extraction techniques are broadly similar and involve: mechanical disruption of cells or tissues, disruption of RNase with chaotropic salts, disruption of macromolecules and nucleotide complexes, separation of RNA from undesired biomolecules including DNA, and concentration of the RNA via precipitation from solution or elution from a solid matrix. Isolated RNA may additionally be treated with DNase to digest any traces of DNA. It is necessary to enrich messenger RNA as total RNA extracts are typically 98% ribosomal RNA. Enrichment for transcripts can be performed by poly-A affinity methods or by depletion of ribosomal RNA using sequence-specific probes. Degraded RNA may affect downstream results, for example, mRNA enrichment from degraded samples {{will result in the}} depletion of 5’ mRNA ends and uneven signal across the length of a transcript. Snap-freezing of tissue prior to RNA isolation is typical, and care is taken to reduce exposure to RNase enzymes once isolation is complete.|$|E
25|$|The frills of ceratopsians <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> diverse. They {{may have}} been used for {{protective}} purposes as the frill sometimes splays over the neck. However, some say that the frill would have provided little protection from other large dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus. Other possible functions include intraspecific communication for mating purposes or as a visual display of territorial protection, as seen in many common day organisms such as red-breasted robins. The frills also could have been used for species recognition purposes, as they seem to develop fairly early in life. There has also been evidence that ceratopsians care for their young, as bone-beds have been found of adult individuals with a nest of juveniles, although some refute this as viable evidence of care for young. There have also been bone-beds found with hundreds of adult ceratopsians, indicating herd activity. A few specimens have been found with puncture wounds, supporting the use of horns as protective or combative weapons. Other research examining juvenile ceratopsians reveals a change in horn morphology over time, suggesting frills and horns could have been used for intraspecific communication of age. Horns also could have been used for thermoregulation as indicated by isotope analysis, as aid in knocking down vegetation, or for horn-locking agonistic behavior.|$|E

500|$|Financial {{concerns}} {{were raised in}} 2009 over {{the cost of the}} new leisure complex, and because of a change in the source of student funding from the Learning and Skills Council to Local Education Authorities. The college was facing a shortfall of at least £500,000 in 2009 and its auditors expressed doubt about RNC's ability to continue as a going concern. In response Ian Pickford said that much of thePoint4's costs had been paid for through donations and that the shortfall issue was being addressed through cutbacks, including some redundancies. Of the auditors' concerns he said; [...] "I think post the banking crisis a lot of auditors <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> nervous about making bland statements in terms of the future of organisations and therefore they frequently now put those sort of caveats in to protect their position going forward." ...|$|E
500|$|Funes {{speculates that}} a decipherable message from {{extraterrestrial}} intelligence could initiate an interstellar exchange {{of knowledge in}} various disciplines, including whatever religions an extraterrestrial civilization may host. Billingham further suggests that an extremely advanced and friendly extraterrestrial civilization might {{put an end to}} present-day religious conflicts and lead to greater religious toleration worldwide. On the other hand, Jill Tarter puts forward the view that contact with extraterrestrial intelligence might eliminate religion as we know it and introduce humanity to an all-encompassing faith. Vakoch doubts that humans would be inclined to adopt extraterrestrial religions, telling ABC News [...] "I think religion meets very human needs, and unless extraterrestrials can provide a replacement for it, I don't think religion is going to go away," [...] and adding, [...] "if there <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> advanced civilizations with a belief in God, I don't think Richard Dawkins will start believing." ...|$|E

Bramwell called the graphics [...] "unchanged and increasingly antiquated" [...] and criticized {{the presence of}} [...] "sharp, angular character models, eerily unrealistic lighting and odd little moments when the player is trying to turn round and ends up banging into a curb". Knutson, meanwhile, was positive regarding the graphics, art, and animation: he called them [...] "nearly flawless" [...] and praised the realism they brought to the inherently fantastical skateboarding genre. Williams said that [...] "THUGs cityscapes <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> well designed" [...] and singled out the GameCube version of Underground as exceptionally well rendered. Rybicki called the levels [...] "big and beautiful". Knutson commended the soundtrack's large size and the sound effects' realism. Perry appreciated the [...] "hilariously hurtful" [...] injury sounds and the extensive song list. By contrast, IGN's Craig Harris praised the graphics of the Game Boy Advance version but was more mixed on the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{continued}} his provocative approach to journalism, and {{on more than}} one occasion had run-ins with powerful politicians. During Tony Blair's visit to Israel in 2006 to discuss the Lebanon War, journalists were asked not to bring up the ongoing rift with Gordon Brown. Bradby, then the ITV political editor, asked a question on the subject but was told it was [...] "disrespectful". Robinson then followed on the same topic, asking a difficult question on the feud between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was criticised for distracting from the main issue of the conference, but he argued that [...] "I'm paid to ask questions... particularly at a time when there <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> serious allegations... I react very badly to organised attempts to stop journalists asking questions." [...] Robinson later criticised Blair's announcement of his intention to stand down. He explained how he considered the setup [...] "stage management", and how no journalists were allowed to ask questions.|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} {{production}} of season ten in 1998, these six main voice actors were paid $30,000 per episode. In 1998, a salary dispute {{between them and the}} Fox Broadcasting Company arose, with the actors threatening to strike. Fox went as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but an agreement was soon made and their salaries were raised to $125,000 per episode. Groening expressed his sympathy for the actors in an issue of Mother Jones a while after the salary dispute had been settled. He told the magazine: [...] " [...] <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> talented, and they deserve a chance to be as rich and miserable as anyone else in Hollywood." [...] The show also made a change for the writers to become signatories to the Animation Guild. Most writers in animation belong to the guild, but The Simpsons as well as other animated shows on Fox were different. Scully commented that [...] "everyone expected a big fight with the studio" [...] and continued that [...] "it never materialized, because they conceded that prime-time animation was successful and everyone was benefiting." ...|$|E
