To investigate the utility of Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) for estimating the spatial and temporal variability of zooplankton stocks in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, acoustic data from a moored array of ADCPs were used in conjunction with sea truth zooplankton samples. As part of the DeSoto Canyon Eddy Intrusion Study, twelve Broadband ADCPs were moored along four cross-margin lines in the DeSoto Canyon area of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. These upward-looking ADCPs were moored at approximately 90 -m depth and deployed March 1997 through April 1999. To obtain sea truth for the backscatter data, net tows were made during spring, summer, and fall of 1998 as well as spring 1999. Results of this combined physical and biological research show that <b>acoustic</b> backscatter <b>intensity</b> data recorded by ADCPs do represent a biological signal that serves as an approximation for zooplankton standing stocks in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that sonochemistry is less {{efficient}} at high <b>acoustic</b> <b>intensities.</b> Many authors have attributed this effect to decoupling losses and shielding of the acoustic wave. In this study we investigate both phenomena for a 20 kHz ultrasound field with an intensity ranging from 40 to 150 W/cm 2. Visualization of the bubble cloud has demonstrated that the void fraction below the ultrasound horn increases more than proportional with increasing power input. Nevertheless, the energy coupling between the horn and the liquid remains constant; this implies that decoupling losses are not reinforced for larger bubble clouds. On the contrary, microphone measurements have shown that due to the larger bubble cloud a substantial part of the supplied energy is lost at high power inputs. In striving towards more efficient sonochemistry, reduction of shielding appears as one of the major challenges...|$|R
