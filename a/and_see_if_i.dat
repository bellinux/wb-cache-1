He first {{learned of the}} film after meeting with Lee: [...] "He said {{he wanted me to}} read the script <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be involved. Spike asks so many people to come back and work with him in {{different}} capacities and as different types of characters." ...|$|E
500|$|The actor opted against {{watching}} the 2011 Academy Award nominees' being announced (where {{he was a}} top contender) in favor of attending class. [...] "I'm not gonna miss class to go and presume that I'm going to be nominated, {{but if you want}} to bring out a camera crew to Yale and wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get nominated, I'd be happy to step out of class and say I'm very grateful", he commented.|$|E
2500|$|... "My initial purpose {{really was}} to take a {{headache}} off his shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could get the theatres {{to a point where}} they could be sold for a reasonable sum. But in the meantime I found it was a fascinating business and money could be made at it. One of the big differences between running Honeywell and Jujamcyn was that theatrical decisions, such as closing a play, could be made much more quickly than major corporate moves" [...] – Binger in a 1987 interview with The Associated Press ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, madam," [...] {{said the}} young man, casting {{his eyes on}} the floor, [...] "it would be far beyond my power to write {{anything}} more wonderful than what <b>I</b> have known <b>and</b> <b>seen!</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> may tell you some of the things which have happened to me, you will understand why I have become convinced that in this world of realities imagination must always take a second place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would depend}} on how badly it was wounded," [...] {{answered}} Jack. [...] "Just wait a minute, <b>and</b> I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can't find its trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pity {{for your}} lot, yes, and {{my love for}} you that eats my heart out, caused me to seek your father's leave to visit you <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> perchance <b>I</b> could not soften your wrath against me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Alistair Cooke wrote, [...] "He [...] had {{one last}} hour of glory. He offered {{to fly to}} Korea and {{entertain}} the troops hemmed in on the United Nations precarious August bridgehead. The troops yelled for his appearance. He went down on his knee again and sang 'Mammy', and the troops wept and cheered. When he was asked what Korea was like he warmly answered, 'I am {{going to get back}} my income tax returns <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> paid enough.'" [...] Jack Benny, who went to Korea the following year, noted that an amphitheater in Korea where troops were entertained, was named the [...] "Al Jolson Bowl." ...|$|E
2500|$|Norwood {{eventually}} {{decided to}} scrap {{most of the}} project, and instead enlisted Timbaland, with whom the couple had previously worked on Kiley Dean's unreleased Simple Girl album, as the album's main contributor. Impressed by Timaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, she had missed on Full Moon and its technical priority. [...] "I made the change because I needed to evolve. I needed to explore my talent and versatility <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had another side to me, another sound," [...] she said about collaborating. [...] "I wanted to do my own thing, and I've always {{wanted to work with}} Timbaland [...] and see how my voice would sound over his tracks. It was an edgier Brandy, a sassier sound, but still with a lot of heart and a lot of passion." [...] With the help of Timbaland protégés such as Candice Nelson, Steve [...] "Static" [...] Garrett, and co-producer Walter Millsap III the pair worked on what was tentatively titled B-Rocka — a nickname actually given to her by Jerkins — and originally planned for a Christmas 2003 release. Their first collaboration, 1990s tribute [...] "Turn It Up", was leaked onto the internet in autumn 2003, and soon released as a promotional buzz track.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will see}} this thing through," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "And I will have it all square <b>and</b> ship-shape; <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't! Are you going to bring that lamp, {{you son of a}} {{crippled}} mud-turtle? I am waiting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it wasn't {{so heavy}} {{we might be}} able to swing the safe around away from the wall," [...] said Dick. [...] "But wait, hold that light closer, Tom, <b>and</b> I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can find out {{anything}} from the inside." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} anybody {{of the name}} of Sarah, Mr. Barker?" [...] she gasped, and then they all laughed {{together}} till Statira said, [...] "Well, I shall surely die! Now, 'Manda Grier, it's your turn. <b>And</b> you <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't pay you up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What word can I {{carry to}} her from you? I'm going to go <b>and</b> <b>see</b> her. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> could take a word from you, I know she {{would come back to}} the table. Shall I tell her you feel to blame?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Filmmaker Judd Apatow said, [...] "Whenever I write a screenplay, I {{take out}} his book <b>and</b> reread it...to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> screwed {{anything}} up." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you stay}} here, master, I will go round <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{can find a}} place. I am more {{accustomed}} to these villages than you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not afeard, father," [...] said Jim; [...] "but I ain't quite springy in {{my heart}} to-night. Stand again <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't do it right off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] said Hetty, with {{a little}} playful pout, taking the rose out of her hair. [...] "I'll put one o' Dinah's caps on when we go in, <b>and</b> you'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> look better in it. She left one behind, so I can take the pattern." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Ratcliffe, [...] "we maun {{just try}} Madge; <b>and</b> I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can get her keepit in ony better order.

6000|$|... "Oh! I am {{not afraid}} of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go <b>and</b> <b>see</b> her <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could have the carriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{let me go}} <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can hunt up this Carlos Martine. I can {{at least}} have a talk with him, and learn how matters stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then fear no more. But good-night. Come to-morrow <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{am going}} on right. This renewal of {{acquaintance}} touches me. I have already a friendship for you." ...|$|E

60|$|Walk {{slowly around}} the ward, observing, <b>and</b> to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can do anything.
