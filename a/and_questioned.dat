40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of question search. In question search, given a question as query, we are to return questions semantically equivalent or close to the queried question. In this paper, we propose to conduct question search by identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus. More specifically, we first summarize questions in a data structure consisting of <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus. Then we model <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus in a language modeling framework for search. We also propose to use the MDLbased tree cut model for identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus automatically. Experimental results indicate that our approach of identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus for search significantly outperforms the baseline methods such as Vector Space Model (VSM) and Language Model for Information Retrieval (LMIR). ...|$|R
