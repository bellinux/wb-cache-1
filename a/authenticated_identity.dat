50|$|<b>Authenticated</b> <b>Identity</b> Body or AIB is {{a method}} {{allowing}} parties in a network to share <b>authenticated</b> <b>identity</b> thereby increasing the integrity of their SIP communications. AIBs extend other authentication methods like S/MIME {{to provide a more}} specific mechanism to introduce integrity to SIP transmissions. Parties transmitting AIBs cryptographically sign a subset of SIP message headers, and such signatures assert the message originator's identity. To meet requirements of reference integrity (for example in defending against replay attacks) additional SIP message headers such as 'Date' and 'Contact' may be optionally included in the AIB.|$|E
50|$|In {{information}} security, computational {{trust is}} {{the generation of}} trusted authorities or user trust through cryptography. In centralised systems, security is typically based on the <b>authenticated</b> <b>identity</b> of external parties. Rigid authentication mechanisms, such as Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) or Kerberos have allowed this model to be extended to distributed systems within a few closely collaborating domains or within a single administrative domain. During recent years, computer science has moved from centralised systems to distributed computing. This evolution has several implications for security models, policies and mechanisms needed to protect users’ information and resources in an increasingly interconnected computing infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|A DKIM-compliant ADMD generates {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} {{asymmetric}} keys, then hands private keys to the signing MTA, and publishes public keys on the DNS. The DNS labels are structured as , where selector identifies the key pair, and [...] is a fixed keyword, followed by the signing domain's name so that publication occurs {{under the authority of}} that domain's ADMD. Just before injecting a message into the SMTP transport system, the signing MTA creates a digital signature that covers selected fields of the header and the body (or just its beginning). The signature should cover substantive header fields such as , , , and , which can be chosen on a per-message basis, and then is added to the message header itself, as a trace field. Any number of relays can receive and forward the message. At any hop, the signature can be verified by retrieving the public key from the DNS. If the signature verifies successfully, the domain name is the <b>authenticated</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E

The SPF verifier queries the Domain Name System (DNS) for an SPF record labelled with that name. An SPF-compliant ADMD should publish that record beforehand, declaring which IP addresses are, or are not, authorized to use the domain name on the label. The verifier then finds the record's directive that matches the IP {{address of the}} sending MTA, and returns the associated result.

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} body of literature and technology that provides access control and security of communication for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) based on cryptographic authentication technologies and protocols. We introduce a new method of granting access and securing communication in a MANET environment to augment, not replace, existing techniques. Previous approaches grant access to the MANET, or to its services, merely {{by means of an}} <b>authenticated</b> <b>identity</b> or a qualified role. We present BARTER, a framework that, in addition, requires nodes to exchange a model of their behavior to grant access to the MANET and to assess the legitimacy of their subsequent communication. This framework forces the nodes not only to say who or what they are, but also how they behave. BARTER will continuously run membership acceptance and update protocols to give access to and accept traffic only from nodes whose behavior model is considered "normal" according to the behavior model of the nodes in the MANET. We implement and experimentally evaluate the merger between BARTER and other cryptographic technologies and show that BARTER can implement a fully distributed automatic access control and update with small cryptographic costs. Although the methods proposed involve the use of content-based anomaly detection models, the generic infrastructure implementing the methodology may utilize any behavior model. Even though the experiments are implemented for MANETs, the idea of model exchange for access control can be applied to any type of network...|$|E

In Intelligent Vehicular Networks, {{featured}} as car-to-car and car-toinfrastructure wireless communication, most applications need important {{location information}} or credential information. We address a location-based encryption method {{that not only}} ensures messages confidentiality but also <b>authenticates</b> <b>identity</b> and location of communication peers. The authentication of location means that a message can only decrypted by the receiver which is “physically ” present inside a decryption region specified by locations, and is moving at a specific speed, acceleration and at a specific time period. A secret key is generated by converting location, time and mobility information (such as speed and acceleration) into a unique number. The determination of the decryption region is addressed in two steps: predicting and updating. The proposed method evaluated by simulations is efficient and secure...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{increase}} the effectiveness of automated face recognition to <b>authenticate</b> <b>identity,</b> considering features of change of the face parameters over time. The improvement of the recognition accuracy, as well as consideration of the features of temporal changes in a human face can be based on the methodology of artificial neural networks. Hybrid neural networks, combining the advantages of classical neural networks and fuzzy logic systems, allow using the network learnability along with the explanation of the findings. The structural scheme of intelligent system for identification based on artificial neural networks is proposed in this work. It realizes the principles of digital information processing and identity recognition taking into account the forecast of key characteristics’ changes over time (e. g., due to aging). The structural scheme has a three-tier architecture and implements preliminary processing, recognition and identification of images obtained as a result of monitoring. On the basis of expert knowledge, the fuzzy base of products is designed. It allows assessing possible changes in key characteristics, used to <b>authenticate</b> <b>identity</b> based on the image. To take this possibility into consideration, a neuro-fuzzy network of ANFIS type was used, which implements the algorithm of Tagaki-Sugeno. The conducted experiments showed high efficiency of the developed neural network and a low value of learning errors, which allows recommending this approach for practical implementation. Application of the developed system of fuzzy production rules that allow predicting changes in individuals over time, will improve the recognition accuracy, reduce the number of authentication failures and improve the efficiency of information processing and decision-making in applications, such as authentication of bank customers, users of mobile applications, or in video monitoring systems of sensitive sites...|$|R
