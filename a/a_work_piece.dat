5000|$|Another {{variation}} {{is to use}} the shock wave for spallation testing of materials. This application is based on the behavior of shockwaves to reflect from the rear free surface of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> as a tensile wave. Depending on the material properties and the shock wave characteristics, the reflected tensile wave may be strong enough to form microcracks or voids near the back surface, or actually [...] "blow-off" [...] or spall material from the back surface.

50|$|Use {{of laser}} shocks {{to measure the}} bond {{strength}} of coatings on metals has been developed {{over a period of}} years in France called LASAT for Laser Adhesion Test. This application is also based on the behavior of shockwaves to reflect from the rear free surface of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> as a tensile wave. If the back surface is coated with an adherent coating, the tensile wave can be tailored to fracture the bond upon reflection from the surface. By controlling the characteristics of the shock wave, the bond strength of the coating can be measured, or alternatively, determined in a comparative sense.|$|E
50|$|In {{other cases}} the {{application}} requires {{the production of}} pulses having as large an energy as possible. Since the pulse energy {{is equal to the}} average power divided by the repetition rate, this goal can sometimes be satisfied by lowering the rate of pulses so that more energy can be built up in between pulses. In laser ablation for example, a small volume of material at the surface of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> can be evaporated if it is heated in a very short time, whereas supplying the energy gradually would allow for the heat to be absorbed into the bulk of the piece, never attaining a sufficiently high temperature at a particular point.|$|E

50|$|Programming {{is done on}} a PC {{equipped}} with appropriate software that {{can be part of}} the machine or a connected external workstation. For generating a new program engineering data can be imported or pasted per mouse and keyboard. Through a graphic and menu-driven user interface previous CNC programming skills are not required. All the punches in <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> are shown on the screen making programming mistakes easily detected. Ideally each program is stored in one database, in this manner it is easy to recover them by search and sort functions. When selecting a new piece, all the necessary tooling changes are displayed. Before transferring it to the control unit the software scans each program for possible collisions. This eliminates most handling errors.|$|E
50|$|ECAE {{is unique}} because {{significant}} cold {{work can be}} accomplished without reduction in the cross sectional area of the deformed workpiece. In conventional deformation processes like rolling, forging, extrusion, and drawing, strain is introduced by reduction in the cross sectional area. ECAE produces significant deformation strain without reducing the cross sectional area. This is accomplished by extruding the work piece around a corner. For example, a square cross section bar of metal is forced through a channel with a 90 degree angle. The {{cross section of the}} channel is equal on entry and exit. The complex deformation of the metal as it flows around the corner produces very high strain. Because the cross section remains the same, <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> can be extruded multiple times with each pass introducing additional strain.|$|E
5000|$|In {{press brake}} forming, <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is {{positioned}} over the die block and the die block presses the sheet {{to form a}} shape. Usually bending has to overcome both tensile stresses and compressive stresses. When bending is done, the residual stresses cause the material to [...] towards its original position, so the sheet must be over-bent to achieve the proper bend angle. The amount of spring back {{is dependent on the}} material, and the type of forming. When sheet metal is bent, it stretches in length. The bend deduction is the amount the sheet metal will stretch when bent as measured from the outside edges of the bend. The bend radius refers to the inside radius. The formed bend radius is dependent upon the dies used, the material properties, and the material thickness.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{important}} aspects in manufacturing calculation is how to find and calculate the machining time in a machining operation. Generally, machining is family of processes or operations in which excess material is removed from <b>a</b> starting <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> by <b>a</b> sharp cutting tool so the remaining part has the desired geometry and the required shape. The most common machining operations can be classified into four types: turning, milling, drilling and lathe work.|$|R
40|$|Turning is {{the removal}} of metal from the outer {{diameter}} of <b>a</b> rotating cylindrical <b>work</b> <b>piece.</b> Turning is used to reduce {{the diameter of the}} <b>work</b> <b>piece,</b> usually to <b>a</b> specified dimension, and to produce a smooth finish on the metal.

5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was marked with the {{appearance}} of hydraulic forging presses that started to replace hammers at forging works. Forging in forging presses is carried out by two dies of which one makes reciprocal movements and the other one remains stationary. This is the reason for relatively low productivity and high labour intensity of conventional forging in presses. The forging of low-ductility and hard-to-deform steels and alloys by two dies using conventional forging methods is very difficult and sometimes is practically impossible because of high tensile stresses in deformation zone leading to various forging defects and high percentage of rejected products.In the 1970s the mechanical radial forging machines (RFM) started to be used for the large-scale production of long-axis forgings where <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is reduced in radial directions simultaneously by several pairs of dies. The process of radial forging in mechanical RFM features high productivity of forging. However small single reductions of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> restricted by the design of these machines lead to localization of strains mainly in surface zones of the work piece while metal in the core zone remains unworked. [...] In 80-90s hydro-mechanical and hydraulic radial forging machines appeared that do not have the disadvantages inherent to mechanical RFM. Nevertheless, radial forging machines are very specific and very expensive equipment in comparison with multipurpose forging presses. The application of such machines at enterprises {{with a wide range of}} forgings manufactured is economically disadvantageous and inexpedient.The problem of manufacturing long-axis forgings by radial forging method in open-die hydraulic forging presses can be solved with use of multi-die forging devices. First such devices different in design and principle of operation appeared in the 1980s. At present, the most widespread and famous is the four-die forging device of the above described design engineered by Ukrainian and Russian scientists. The four-die forging devices have no analogues in the world now. They are successfully used at works in Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China and Germany.|$|E
50|$|Due to the plastic-elastic {{characteristic}} of a metals it is typical that any deformation of sheet metal at room temperature will have both elastic and plastic deformation. After the metal work piece {{is removed from the}} tool or deformation implement that the elastic deformation will be released and only the plastic deformation remain. When a metal forming tool is planned and designed to deform <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece,</b> the shape imparted by the tool will be a combination of elastic and plastic deformation, the release of the elastic deformation is the spring back often observed {{at the end of a}} metal forming process. The spring back has to be compensated to achieve an accurate result.Usually that is realized by overbending the material correspondent to the magnitude of the spring back.That means for the practical side of the bending process, the bending former enters deeper into the bending prism.|$|E
50|$|Pocket milling {{has been}} {{regarded}} as one of the most widely used operations in machining. It is extensively used in aerospace and shipyard industries. In pocket milling the material inside an arbitrarily closed boundary on a flat surface of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is removed to a fixed depth. Generally flat bottom end mills are used for pocket milling. Firstly roughing operation is done to remove the bulk of material and then the pocket is finished by a finish end mill.Most of the industrial milling operations can be taken care of by 2.5 axis CNC milling. This type of path control can machine up to 80% of all mechanical parts. Since the importance of pocket milling is very relevant, therefore effective pocketing approaches can result in reduction in machining time and cost.NC pocket milling can be carried out mainly by two tool paths, viz. linear and non-linear.|$|E
