Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was {{and why he}} had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have {{found himself in the}} rear of the advancing Confederate troops.|$|E
5|$|Demeke {{demanded that}} the {{aircraft}} be flown to New York City and demanded political asylum in the United States.

This put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel.|$|E

5|$|Paxton's cavalry {{met with}} Lane's {{infantry}} {{at a point}} on Cold Knob Mountain <b>around</b> <b>noon</b> on November 26. The two colonels conferred, and Lane decided that his regiment was not in condition to continue the mission. His men were wet and cold, and they began their return to their camp in Summerville. Paxton also considered ending the mission, but decided to continue after being convinced by Major Powell. Powell was assigned to lead the advance guard, and selected Lieutenant Jeremiah Davidson and 20 men from Company G to join him. The advance guard, followed {{by the rest of}} the cavalry regiment, proceeded down the mountain toward the rebel camps.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Aletta was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical storm}} that killed 308people while meandering {{off the coast}} of Central America in May 1982. An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression on May20, and into a tropical storm <b>around</b> <b>noon</b> on May21. The cyclone turned northeast, reaching its peak as a strong tropical storm on May23. Aletta meandered and gradually weakened, dissipating a few hundred miles southwest of Acapulco on May29. Moisture from the tropical system spread over Honduras and Nicaragua, causing flooding. Throughout the two countries, 308people were killed and total damage was at $457million (1982USD). In the aftermath of the storm, many programs provided relief to the victims of Aletta.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for {{a large part of}} the Deep South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began <b>around</b> <b>noon</b> and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E
50|$|At <b>around</b> 12 <b>noon,</b> at {{the signal}} of the O.C. a 3,000 strong armed Muslim mob {{attacked}} the warehouses.

40|$|Empirical {{correlations}} for estimating {{the ratios of}} monthly mean hourly to daily global solar radiation received on horizontal surfaces have been compared and their validities tested. The correlation of Collares-Pereira and Rabl [Solar Energy, 22, (1979) 155] yields the best results, while the correlations of Liu and Jordan [Solar Energy, 4 (1960) 19], and Garg and Garg [Solar & Wind Technology 4 (1987) 113] give satisfactory values. Calculated ratios show small deviations from observed ratios <b>around</b> the solar <b>noon.</b> Measured ratios are generally lower than the calculated ratios {{in the morning and}} evening hours, while the reverse is observed for the hours <b>around</b> the solar <b>noon.</b> ...|$|R
