25|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Widerøe and Polarfly would {{occasionally}} use the airfield for air ambulance services. Scandinavian Airlines System received permission on 3 March 1953 to use Ørlandet as an <b>alternative</b> <b>airfield</b> for its route to Northern Norway; the permission was expanded to also include their North Pole route to Los Angeles. In {{the course of}} ten years this resulted in six or seven landings. From 1958 to 1962 a direct cargo route with crabs and fish was established between Ørlandet and Stockholm, using a Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar.|$|E
25|$|The airport, which {{normally}} {{should have been}} closed due to the severe conditions, was not declared closed as its management feared that this could cause a diplomatic incident. According to the news agency Interfax, the pilot was told that Smolensk North Airport was enveloped in thick fog and strongly advised against landing, but still he decided {{to continue with the}} original flight plan and attempt a landing. According to an interview with a flight controller Pavel Plusnin it was suggested to the pilot that he land at an <b>alternative</b> <b>airfield</b> in Moscow or Minsk. According to Plusnin, the pilot said, that he would attempt one approach, and if landing was not possible, he would then divert to another airfield.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{situation}} in the cockpit was one of very high stress. As the weather continued to worsen, the crew became increasingly aware of the extreme difficulty they would encounter in landing at Smolensk. The crew may have feared a negative reaction from their passengers should they have to divert to an <b>alternative</b> <b>airfield.</b> The protocol director was present in the cockpit from time to time, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force was present in the cockpit for the final approach phase of the flight, including the crash itself. At one point, the navigator is heard on the CVR saying [...] "He'll go crazy", a possible reference to the President of Poland, had the crew chosen to divert. There may also have been some friction between the Air Force Commander and the captain, caused by an absence of the latter from condition training.|$|E
5000|$|In Moscow, by noon the {{concentration}} of airborne pollutants intensified and reached at 6.6 times normal level for carbon monoxide, and 2.2 times for suspended particulate matter. Seven flights heading for Domodedovo and Vnukovo airports were redirected to <b>alternative</b> <b>airfields.</b> The temperature may have reached [...] in Moscow Oblast. At Sheremetyevo International Airport, visibility was reduced to 325 meters.|$|R
50|$|Ovda was {{originally}} {{built as a}} military airport in 1980 following Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula {{as part of the}} Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty because the Israeli Air Force needed <b>alternative</b> <b>airfields</b> to its Sinai bases. Nowadays, in addition to Air Force traffic, the airport also serves as the destination for many commercial flights to Eilat, especially for large aircraft which cannot use the shorter runway and limited apron space at Eilat Airport.|$|R
2500|$|In September 1940, No 10 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Weston-super-Mare {{established}} a Relief Landing Ground on [...] at Broadfield Down by the hamlet of Lulsgate Bottom, near Redhill. Being high, at , the site had a poor weather record during warm front conditions, {{when it was}} often covered in low cloud. However, when this occurred the <b>alternative</b> <b>airfields</b> at Filton and Cardiff were usually clear and operational; and as Lulsgate was clear when the low-lying airfields were obscured by radiation fog in calm weather, the landing ground provided a useful alternative. Few facilities were constructed although pillboxes, defensive anti-aircraft guns and later two Blister hangars were added. In late 1940, a Starfish site was set up south of the village of Downside and {{just west of the}} airfield. Its decoy fires attracted a large quantity of Luftwaffe high explosives and incendiaries on the nights of 16 March, 3 April and 4 April 1941 during the Bristol Blitz.|$|R
5000|$|Bluie West Two: Kipisako unused <b>alternative</b> <b>airfield</b> {{location}} on Coppermine Bay ...|$|E
50|$|The closest <b>alternative</b> <b>airfield</b> is Hoedspruit Civil, {{situated}} 2 km north {{east from}} Zandspruit and adjacent to Hoedspruit town.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{came into}} {{use in the}} 1930s for private flying and it {{was used as an}} <b>alternative</b> <b>airfield</b> to Croydon Airport by Imperial Airways.|$|E
50|$|In a {{dramatic}} bad weather flight {{they managed to}} get through the foothills of the Cascades to the Pacific coast, at Gold Beach. They followed the coastline of Oregon southward to the Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco in California. The airport Half Moon Bay near San Francisco, was completely covered with clouds. In their type of aircraft you lose orientation and control of the aircraft in clouds within seconds. However, they had hardly any fuel left and <b>alternative</b> <b>airfields</b> were no longer within reach. So they decided to do a bold approach to the airfield of Half Moon Bay, which was completely under clouds. In San Francisco, they met with Karl-Heinz Johannsmeier, who had made it from a Stasi prisoner in East Germany to a multi-millionaire in the United States. After they had interviewed him at his estate about his success and his dreams, they continued their adventures. They flew over the dream factory Hollywood to their destination near Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Captain Lessing’s force {{encounters}} Lampard’s {{patrol and}} is virtually {{wiped out in}} a nighttime ambush. Leaving a detachment at a base camp, Lampard takes {{the rest of his}} men deeper into enemy territory with plans to attack the Luftwaffe base at Beda Fomm but just as they arrive, Barton and his last remaining pilot, American Hick Hooper, make a dive-bombing attack which puts the defences on full alert. Angered, the SAS patrol heads for an <b>alternative</b> target, the <b>airfield</b> at Barce where Major Schramm is based. Despite the Germans now being aware of their presence, Lampard recklessly presses on to reach the airfield and they wipe out two squadrons of Me-109s. But it is now nearly dawn and the Germans are in hot pursuit. Confrontations with Italian CR-42 fighters and a convoy of German infantry sees the patrol lose nine men and all their vehicles, leaving only Lampard and two others alive. They manage to reach their base camp and rejoin the detachment that had been left there.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{intended}} by Cobb County, Georgia as an <b>alternative</b> <b>airfield</b> for Atlanta's Candler Field, this airfield {{was constructed in}} 1941 as Rickenbacker Field. This was named for the former U.S. Army Air Corps top flying ace of World War I, Captain Eddie Rickenbacker ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{with the help}} of USAID, eight {{potential}} locations were analyzed for a new international airport, namely Kemayoran, Malaka, Babakan, Jonggol, Halim, Curug, South Tangerang and North Tangerang. Finally, the North Tangerang site was chosen; it was also noted that Jonggol could be used as an <b>alternative</b> <b>airfield.</b> Meanwhile, as an interim step, the Indonesian government upgraded the Halim Perdanakusumah airfield for use for passenger services. The old Kemayoran site was closed in 1985, and the land was later used for commercial and housing purposes.|$|E
