50|$|The Sally Lightfoot crab, the periwinkle, {{the common}} West Indian Chiton, the rock boring urchin, and <b>the</b> brown booby <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{affected}} (least resilient)species after the spill. The Sally Lightfoot crab <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected crustacean after the spill.

OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical characteristics of parotid gland tumors submitted to surgical treatment by the same surgeon. METHODS: Retrospective study with 154 patients who had parotid gland tumors. Clinical and histological data, type of surgery, and complications were assessed and described. RESULTS: <b>The</b> main manifestation <b>was</b> a mass with a median evolution of 12 months for benign tumors and five months for malignant tumors. Ultrasonography <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent complementary exam.
