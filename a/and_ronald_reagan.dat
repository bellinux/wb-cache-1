He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward {{the end of his}} career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

5|$|In the Mid-Atlantic, {{the weather}} event broke the 24-hour {{rainfall}} record for September30 at several locations: the Norfolk, Baltimore–Washington, <b>and</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> Washington airports recorded 7.85in (199mm), 6.02in (153mm), and 4.66in (118mm) respectively. In Maryland, two buses collided amid the stormy weather, injuring 26of their passengers. With localized estimates {{of up to}} 8in (200mm), the state of New York experienced {{some of its most}} historic rainfall; an official total 4.24in (108mm) shattered the 24-hour record for any calendar day in Binghamtom. Flash floods throughout the state resulted in one drowning death and US$10,000 in damage. Considerable flooding also occurred in Vermont and Pennsylvania, with a 24-hour rainfall maximum of 10.5in (265mm) in Moscow. Farther north, the remnant low enhanced a pressure gradient over southern New England, generating strong winds that knocked out the power in Litchfield County. Rainfall there additionally caused minor flooding. In Quebec, torrents following 3.5in (90mm) of rainfall inundated basements and caused two drownings. Despite the deaths and damage, the rains lightened prolonged drought conditions in those regions.|$|E
