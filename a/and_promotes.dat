5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage.

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal <b>and</b> <b>promotes</b> infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E
