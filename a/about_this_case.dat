500|$|Although {{his efforts}} dealing with video games have {{generally}} focused on juveniles, Thompson {{got involved in}} a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant {{in a series of}} highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the [...] "functional equivalent of a 15-year-old," [...] and [...] "the only thing insane <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> is the (insanity) defense".|$|E

500|$|Under Georgia law, appeals {{of death}} penalty cases had {{to be based on}} errors of law, not a reevaluation of the {{evidence}} presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, [...] "I have thought <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I {{do not have to be}} convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that." ...|$|E

"While the {{defendant}} committed this horrific crime, what is also so disturbing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> is the indifference {{of the people}} employed at the bar that night.

They were all focused on finishing their shift and leaving.

Stories ranged from the killer turning himself in, to a third and even fourth double murder. Gonzaullas stated that Texarkanians were trying hard to help in the cases, but many were hindering it maliciously, using the cases as an instrument for grudges and spitefulness. On Thursday, Gonzaullas and Presley issued a statement that if a break came in the cases, it would be reported in the Gazette and Daily News. Gonzaullas continued, [...] "The newspapers are not printing rumors and have assured us they will not.

Defense minister Henk Kamp ordered an immediate (re-)investigation into the matter, but said that earlier information <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> did not result in the military police and Dutch public prosecutors to start a criminal investigation. Left-wing parties, such as the Labour Party (PvdA), which demanded an immediate parliamentary investigation were later rebuked by military commander Dick Berlijn, who stated that the left-wing opposition tarnished the reputation of the Dutch Department of Defense by their incriminating language, while nothing happened in Iraq.

Subsequently, the elephants are given anthropomorphized personalities and have created their own religion, folklore, and customs, all based on the author's research on elephant behavior.|$|R
