Featuring {{the voices of}} John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter in his directorial debut, and executive {{produced by}} John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton. The film centers on two monsters employed at the titular energy-producing factory Monsters, Inc. — top scarer James P. [...] "Sulley" [...] Sullivan and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski. In the film, employees at Monsters, Inc. generate their city's power by scaring children, but they themselves <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the children are toxic to them, and when one child enters the factory, Sulley and Mike must return her home {{before it is too}} late.|$|E

500|$|While {{migration}} to more developed countries {{in search of}} better opportunities, also known as [...] "brain drain," [...] is partially responsible for the shortage of health care workers in Malawi, many health care workers have been personally affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic; in fact, an average of 48 nurses die of HIV/AIDS in Malawi every year. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has resulted in high levels of absenteeism among health workers in Malawi, who often leave work {{to spend time with}} HIV-positive friends or relatives, and the Malawian government has failed to respond to the declining number of full-time employees working in the health sector. Health workers who are not chronically absent frequently abandon their jobs because they are unable to cope with the heavy patient loads or because they <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> working in a medical environment will increase their risk of becoming infected with HIV.|$|E

500|$|Lucy Popescu of CineVue {{called the}} film [...] "a {{powerful}} {{indictment of the}} global trade in human beings and the abuse of vulnerable people," [...] but criticized the film for focusing on human trafficking victims, arguing that the perpetrators should have been dealt with more prominently. She commended Bilheimer on the few interviews with traffickers that he did include, but she condemned as inadequate the [...] "only passing reference {{to the thousands of}} men who engage in sexual tourism, like those who travel to Cambodia to 'buy' traumatized children who they can then abuse for weeks at a time." [...] Popescu also called the film [...] "simplistic", arguing that it should have more clearly expressed that sex trafficking victims are not able to provide legitimate consent for sexual activity because they <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> their lives might be in danger if they do not comply. John Rash of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "a cacophony of concerned voices speaking about a modern-day scourge." [...] Rash praised the film for its global scope, but suggested that this geographical breadth allows American audiences to ignore the fact that the trafficking of children is prevalent in the United States and not just in other countries.|$|E

2500|$|Fractional-reserve banking ordinarily {{functions}} smoothly. Relatively few depositors demand payment at {{any given}} time, and banks maintain a buffer of reserves to cover depositors' cash withdrawals and other demands for funds. [...] However, during a bank run or a generalized financial crisis, demands for withdrawal can exceed the bank's funding buffer, and the bank {{will be forced to}} raise additional reserves to avoid defaulting on its obligations. A bank can raise funds from additional borrowings (e.g., by borrowing in the interbank lending market or from the central bank), by selling assets, or by calling in short-term loans. If creditors <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the bank is running out of reserves or is insolvent, they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible before other depositors access the remaining reserves. Thus the fear of a bank run can actually precipitate the crisis.|$|E
