5000|$|One {{physiological}} {{characteristic of}} sleep {{goes by the}} name of [...] "homeostatic regulation". This is the notion that animals need a more or less constant amount of sleep every day, so that if a subject is deprived of sleep one day, the amount of sleep tends to [...] "rebound" [...] (increase) the next few days. This has been observed in zebrafish. At night, zebrafish appear to float in the water column, either horizontally or with the head slightly up. Their frequency of mouth and gill movement is reduced by almost half and they are twice as hard to arouse as during the day. If they are deprived of this sleep-like behaviour, the sleep bouts thereafter are longer and the <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> is higher than usual, suggesting a rebound effect. [...] Similarly, in the convict cichlid, activity decreases on days that follow an experimental disruption of the fish's normal rest behaviour at night.|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that preterm infants, full-term infants, and older infants [...] have greater time periods of quiet sleep and also {{decreased}} time awake when they are positioned to sleep on their stomachs. In both human infants and rats, <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{have been shown to}} be at higher levels in the electroencephalography (EEG) during slow-wave sleep.|$|R
5000|$|The highest <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> (e.g. {{difficulty}} of awakening, such as by {{a sound of}} a particular volume) are observed in stage 3. A person will typically feel groggy when awakened from this stage, and indeed, cognitive tests administered after awakening from stage 3 indicate that mental performance is somewhat impaired for periods up to 30 minutes or so, relative to awakenings from other stages. This phenomenon has been called [...] "sleep inertia." ...|$|R
40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{the human brain}} remains in a very active state during sleep, and being asleep {{is by no means}} equal to an absence of {{conscious}} experience. Previous research has shown that participants can produce a behavioural response to auditory stimuli during sleep without necessarily awakening. Such responses are elicited more readily during the subjectively lighter stages of sleep compared to the subjectively deeper stages. This is illustrated when we consider that auditory <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> (AAT’s) normally progressively decline across the night, which is commensurate with the declining proportion of time spent in deep sleep as sleep progresses...|$|R
40|$|Study Objectives: The {{effect of}} common {{sedatives}} on upper airway physiology and breathing during sleep in {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) has been minimally studied. Conceptually, certain sedatives may worsen OSA in some patients. However, sleep and breathing could improve with certain sedatives in OSA patients with a low respiratory <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold.</b> This study aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that trazodone increases the respiratory <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> in OSA patients with a low <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold.</b> Secondary aims were {{to examine the effects of}} trazodone on upper-airway dilator muscle activity, upper-airway collapsibility, and breathing during sleep. Design: Patients were studied on 4 separate nights according to a within-subjects cross-over design. Setting: Sleep physiology laboratory. Patients: 7 low respiratory <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> OSA patients. Interventions: In-laboratory polysomnograms were performed at baseline and after 100 mg of trazodone followed by detailed overnight physiology experiments under the same conditions. During physiology studies, CPAP was transiently lowered to measure <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> (negative epiglottic pressure prior to arousal), dilator muscle activity (genioglossus and tensor palatini), and upper-airway collapsibility (Pcrit). Measurements and Results: Trazodone increased the respiratory <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> by 32 ± 6 % (- 11. 5 ± 1. 4 vs. - 15. 3 ± 2. 2 cmH 2 O, p< 0. 01) but did not alter the apnea/hypopnea index (39 ± 12 vs. 39 ± 11 events/h sleep, p= 0. 94). Dilator muscle activity and Pcrit also did not systematically change with trazodone. Conclusions: Trazodone increases the respiratory <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> in OSA patients with a low <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> without major impairment in dilator muscle activity or upper-airway collapsibility. However, the magnitude of change in <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> was insufficient to overcome the compromised upper-airway anatomy in these patients...|$|E

Rationale: A low {{respiratory}} <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> is {{a physiological}} trait involved in {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) pathogenesis. Trazodone may increase <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> without compromising upper airway muscles, which should improve OSA. Objectives: We aimed to examine how trazodone alters OSA severity and <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold.</b> We hypothesized that trazodone would increase the <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> and improve the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) in selected patients with OSA. Methods: Subjects were studied on two separate nights in a randomized crossover design. Fifteen unselected subjects with OSA (AHI ≥ 10 /h) underwent a standard polysomnogram plus an epiglottic catheter to measure the <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold.</b> Subjects were studied after receiving trazodone (100 mg) and placebo, with 1 week between conditions. The <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> was calculated as the nadir pressure before electrocortical arousal from approximately 20 spontaneous respiratory events selected randomly. Measurements and Main Results: Compared with placebo, trazodone resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} AHI (38. 7 vs. 28. 5 events/h, P = 0. 041), without worsening oxygen saturation or respiratory event duration. Trazodone was not associated with a significant change in the non-REM <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> (- 20. 3 vs. - 19. 3 cm H 2 O, P = 0. 51) compared with placebo. In subgroup analysis, responders to trazodone spent less time in N 1 sleep (20. 1 % placebo vs. 9. 0 % trazodone, P = 0. 052) and had an accompanying reduction in arousal index, whereas nonresponders were not observed to have a change in sleep parameters. Conclusions: These findings suggest that trazodone could be effective therapy for patients with OSA without worsening hypoxemia. Future studies should focus on underlying mechanisms and combination therapies to eliminate OSA...|$|E

40|$|AbstractExtended {{periods of}} rest in Drosophila melanogaster {{resemble}} mammalian sleep states {{in that they}} are characterized by heightened <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> and specific alterations in gene expression [1, 2]. Defined as inactivity periods spanning 5 or more min, amounts of this sleep-like state are, as in mammals, sensitive to prior amounts of waking activity, time of day, and pharmacological intervention [1 – 3]. Clearly recognizable changes in the pattern and amount of brain electrical activity accompany changes in motor activity and <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> originally used to identify mammalian sleeping behavior [4 – 6]. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and/or local field potentials (LFPs) are now widely used to quantify sleep state amounts and define types of sleep. Thus, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is characterized by EEG spindles and large-amplitude delta-frequency (0 – 3. 5 Hz) waves. Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by irregular gamma-frequency cortical EEG patterns and rhythmic theta-frequency (5 – 9 Hz) hippocampal EEG activity [7]. It is unknown whether rest and activity in Drosophila are associated with distinct electrophysiological correlates. To address this issue, we monitored motor activity levels and recorded LFPs in the medial brain between the mushroom bodies, structures implicated in the modulation of locomotor activity, of Drosophila[8]. The results indicate that LFPs can be reliably recorded from the brains of awake, moving fruit flies, that targeted genetic manipulations can be used to localize sources of LFP activity, and that brain electrical activity of Drosophila is reliably correlated with activity state...|$|R
40|$|How <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{vary with}} {{different}} sounds {{is a critical}} issue for emergency awakenings, especially as sleepers are dying in fires despite having a working smoke alarm. Previous {{research shows that the}} current high pitched (3000 + Hz) smoke alarm signal is significantly less effective than an alternative signal, the 520 Hz square wave, in all populations tested. However, as the number of sounds tested has been small further research is needed. Here we measured auditory <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> (AATs) across signals with a range of characteristics to determine the most effective waking signal. Thirty nine young adults participated over three nights. In Part A, nine signals were presented in stage 4 sleep with ascending decibel levels. Signals were short beeps in the low to mid frequency range with different spectral complexities: square waves, pure tones, whoops and white noise. Part B manipulated temporal patterns, inserting silences of 0, 10 and 21 seconds after each 12 seconds of beeps. It was found that the low frequency (400 and 520 Hz) square waves yielded significantly lower AATs than the alternatives. A trend was found across the three temporal manipulations, with a 10 second intervening silence showing some advantage. These findings support earlier research indicating that the best sound for awakening from deep sleep is a low frequency square wave. It is argued that the signal with the lowest response threshold when awake may be the same as the most arousing signal when asleep, especially where the sleeper processes the signal as meaningful...|$|R

Here we provide the first, automated technique to quantify the respiratory arousal threshold-defined {{as the level of}} ventilatory drive triggering arousal from sleep-using diagnostic polysomnographic signals in patients with OSA. Ventilatory drive preceding clinically-scored arousals was estimated from polysomnographic studies by fitting a respiratory control model (Terrill P et al. ERJ 2015) to the pattern of ventilation during spontaneous respiratory events. Conceptually, the magnitude of the airflow signal immediately after arousal onset reveals information on the underlying ventilatory drive that triggered the arousal. Polysomnographic <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> measures were compared to gold standard values taken from esophageal pressure and intraoesophageal diaphragm electromyography recorded simultaneously; N= 29). Comparisons were also made to <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> measures using CPAP dial-downs (N= 28).

Study Objectives: To {{determine}} the effects of the nonbenzodiazepine sedative zopiclone on the threshold to arousal with increasing respiratory effort and genioglossus muscle activity and to examine potential physiological factors mediating disparate effects of zopiclone on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity between patients. Methods: Twelve patient s with OSA (apnea-hypopnea index = 41 ± 8 events/h) were studied during 2 single night sleep studies conducted approximately 1 w apart after receiving 7. 5 mg of zopiclone or placebo according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover design. The respiratory <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> (epiglottic pressure immediately prior to arousal during naturally occurring respiratory events), genioglossus activity and its responsiveness to pharyngeal pressure during respiratory events, and markers of OSA severity were compared between conditions. Genioglossus movement patterns and upper airway anatomy were also assessed via magnetic resonance imaging in a subset of participants (n = 7) during wakefulness. Results: Zopiclone increased the respiratory <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> versus placebo (- 31. 8 ± 5. 6 versus - 26. 4 ± 4. 6 cmH 2 O, P = 0. 02) without impairing genioglossus muscle activity or its responsiveness to negative pharyngeal pressure during respiratory events (- 0. 56 ± 0. 2 versus - 0. 44 ± 0. 1 %max/-cmH 2 O, P = 0. 48). There was substantial interindividual variability in the changes in OSA severity with zopiclone explained, at least in part, by differences in pathophysiological characteristics including body mass index, <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold,</b> and genioglossus movement patterns. Conclusions: In a group of patients with predominantly severe OSA, zopiclone increased the <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> without reducing genioglossus muscle activity or its responsiveness to negative pharyngeal pressure. These properties may be beneficial in some patients with OSA with certain pathophysiological characteristics but may worsen hypoxemia in others...|$|E
40|$|Conclusion. Impairment in bladder {{and brain}} {{functions}} was identified {{in children with}} severe NE. Post-treatment studies indicated that brain function normalized in parallel with amelioration of bladder dysfunction. Interaction between brain and bladder dysfunction {{is likely to have}} an important implication in the pathophysiology and resolution of NE. Objective. To (1) investigate sleep pattern and cortical arousals in enuretic children; (2) assess brain and bladder function in enuretic children; (3) evaluate post-treatment brain and bladder functional changes in enuretic children and correlate these with the treatment outcomes. Part II. Fifty-two patients with severe PNE and 15 normal controls were recruited. Bladder and brain functions (sleep <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold,</b> P 300 ERPs latency and PPI of startle amplitude) in enuretic children were evaluated, and brain function was compared with normal controls. Part II. Markedly reduced nocturnal FBC and impaired brain function were found in enuretic patients. Higher sleep <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> was negatively correlated to lower FBC. Prolonged P 300 ERPs and higher PPI of startle amplitude were positively correlated to a higher sleep <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold.</b> Part III. NE episodes and bladder function were re-evaluated in 52 severely enuretic children (Part II) at 3 and 6 months on treatment. Brain function was re-evaluated in 41 / 52 enuretic children at 6 months on treatment. Part III. Post-treatment FBC significantly increased, and sleep <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold,</b> number of awakenings, P 300 ERPs latency and PPI of startle amplitude normalized in treatment responders. NE episodes reduction was significantly correlated to the improvement in FBC and brain function. Greater decrease in sleep <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> was positively correlated to higher FBC increase. Higher P 300 ERPs latency and PPI of startle amplitude reduction were positively correlated to greater decrease in sleep <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold.</b> Patients and methods. Part I. Thirty-five children with refractory PNE and 21 normal controls were recruited. Overactive bladder contractions, NE episodes and volume in enuretic children, sleep stages and cortical arousals in all children were recorded. Results. Part I. Underlying bladder dysfunction, abnormal sleep architecture and increased cortical arousal index were found in enuretic children. Cortical arousal index was positively correlated to the frequency of overactive bladder contractions. Diao Mei. "May 2005. "Adviser: Chung-Kwong Yeung.

40|$|The {{response}} to chemical stimuli (chemical responsiveness), and {{the increases in}} respiratory drive required for arousal (<b>arousal</b> <b>threshold)</b> and for opening the airway without arousal (effective recruitment threshold) are important determinants of ventilatory instability and, hence, severity of obstructive apnea.

During sleep, pressure was intermittently reduced (dial-down) to induce severe hypopneas. Dial-downs were done on room air and following 30 seconds of breathing hypercapneic and/or hypoxic mixtures, which induced a range of ventilatory stimulation prior to dial-down.

In total, nine OSA patients, mean+/-sd age 49 +/- 9 yrs, apnoea/hypopnoea index 52 +/- 32 events. h(- 1), were studied on 2 nights, one with trazodone at 100 mg and one with a placebo, in a double blind randomised fashion. While receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), repeated arousals were induced: 1) by increasing inspired CO(2) and 2) by stepwise decreases in CPAP level. Respiratory effort was measured with an oesophageal balloon. End-tidal CO(2) tension (P(ET,CO(2))) was monitored with a nasal catheter. During trazodone nights, compared with placebo nights, the arousals occurred at a higher P(ET,CO(2)) level (mean+/-sd 7. 30 +/- 0. 57 versus 6. 62 +/- 0. 64 kPa (54. 9 +/- 4. 3 versus 49. 8 +/- 4. 8 mmHg), respectively).

40|$|Introduction: Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) {{severity}} is markedly reduced during slow-wave sleep (SWS) even {{in patients with}} a severe disease. The reason for this improvement is uncertain but likely relates to non-anatomical factors (i. e. reduced arousability, chemosensitivity, and increased dilator muscle activity). The anticonvulsant tiagabine produces a dose-dependent increase in SWS in subjects without OSA. This study aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that tiagabine would reduce OSA severity by raising the overall <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> during sleep. Aims and Methods: After a baseline physiology night to assess patients' OSA phenotypic traits, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial of tiagabine 12 mg administered before sleep was performed in 14 OSA patients. Under each condition, we assessed the effects on sleep and OSA severity using standard clinical polysomnography. Results: Tiagabine increased slow-wave activity (SWA) of the electroencephalogram (1 - 4 Hz) compared to placebo (1. 8 [0. 4] vs. 2. 0 [0. 5] Log?V 2, p =. 04) but did not reduce OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 41. 5 [20. 3] vs. 39. 1 [16. 5], p >. 5). SWS duration (25 [20] vs. 26 [43] mins, p >. 5) and <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> (? 26. 5 [5. 0] vs. ? 27. 6 [5. 1] cmH 2 O, p =. 26) were also unchanged between nights. Conclusions: Tiagabine modified sleep microstructure (increase in SWA) but did not change the duration of SWS, OSA severity, or <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> in this group of OSA patients.

Drosophila sleep has been studied extensively, {{with the aim of}} gaining fundamental insights into the evolutionarily conserved functions of sleep as well as the mechanisms that regulate it. An interesting question that has not yet been addressed is whether fly sleep can be classified into distinct sleep types, each having particular biological roles – like rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep in birds and mammals. Typically, Drosophila sleep displays a bimodal pattern, consisting of distinct daytime and nighttime components. Notably, daytime and nighttime sleep differ with respect to several qualities, such as sleep-bout lengths and <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds.</b> In this short review, we describe several genetic and environmental factors that differentially affect daytime and nighttime sleep, highlighting the observations suggesting the notion that these temporally distinct components of Drosophila sleep may have unique biological functions and be regulated by different homeostatic regulatory mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|We used a Grodins-type {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} cardio-pulmonary system to investigate the cycling behaviour of the respiratory system during hypoxia in response to changes of state between waking and sleeping, namely a diminution of respiratory chemosensitivity during sleep. Shifts between waking and sleeping were triggered by various combinations of threshold values for PAO 2. Mild or moderate hypoxia was simulated by values of inspired O 2 concentration between 13 % and 16 % (normal 21 %). In mild or moderate hypoxia, reductions of overall respiratory gain from about 2 to 0. 8 l. min- 1 mmHg- 1 at sleep onset will produce falls in PAO 2 likely to cause sleep-wake cycles with oscillations in PAO 2. The higher the <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> (in relation to steady-state PAO 2 during sleep), the shorter and more stable the sleep-wake cycles. As the <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> is raised, and as hypoxia is exacerbated from mild (FIO 2 = 16 %) to moderate (FIO 2 = 13 %), the sleep-wake cycle length tends to converge to a value around one minute. The level and determinants of the "back-to-sleep" threshold are hard to define from presently available experimental data, but the level is not important in determining {{the length of the}} sleep-wake cycle compared to the <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold.</b> Alinearities in chemoreceptor feedback were introduced first by incorporating "drive" thresholds, to simulate central or obstructive apnoea. This produced larger oscillations in respiratory variables, but no change in cycle length. Chemoreceptor thresholds for PCO 2 at the level of 38 - 39 mmHg did produce shorter ventilation cycles, down to about 20 s in length, but these were not related in any simple way to the resulting sleep-wake cycles.

40|$|The mating {{success of}} larger male Drosophila melanogaster in the {{laboratory}} and the wild has been traditionally been explained by female choice, even though the reasons are gen-erally hard to reconcile. Female choice can explain this success by virtue of females taking less time to mate with preferred males, but so can the more aggressive or persistent court-ships efforts of large males. Since mating is a negotiation between the two sexes, the behaviors of both are likely to interact and influence mating outcomes. Using a series of assays, we explored these negotiations by testing for the relative influence of male behav-iors {{and its effect on}} influencing female courtship <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold,</b> which is the time taken for females to accept copulation.

Competition between two males or an increasing number of males had no influence on female sexual arousal threshold;—females therefore may have a relatively fixed ‘arousal threshold ’ that must be reached before they are ready to mate, and larger males appear to be able to manipulate this threshold sooner. On the other hand, the females ’ physiological and behavioral state drastically influences mating; once females have crossed the courtship <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> they take less time to mate and mate indiscriminately with large and small males. Mating quicker with larger males may be misconstrued to be due to female choice; our results suggest that the mating advantage of larger males may be more a result of heightened male activity and relatively less of female choice. Body size per se may not be a trait under selection by female choice, but size likely amplifies male activity and signal outputs in courtship, allowing them to influ-ence female <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> faster...|$|E
50|$|This {{advice was}} based on the {{epidemiology}} of SIDS and physiological evidence which shows that infants who sleep on their back have lower <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> and less slow-wave sleep (SWS) compared to infants who sleep on their stomachs. In human infants sleep develops rapidly during early development. This development includes an increase in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep) which is also called quiet sleep (QS) during the first 12 months of life in association with a decrease in rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) which is also known as active sleep (AS). In addition, slow wave sleep (SWS) which consists of stage 3 and stage 4 NREM sleep appears at 2 months of age and it is theorized that some infants have a brain-stem defect which increases their risk of being unable to arouse from SWS (also called deep sleep) and therefore have an increased risk of SIDS due to their decreased ability to arouse from SWS.|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the impact psychotropic drugs, {{particularly}} sedatives, have on human behaviour in a residential fire emergency. Two separate but related avenues of investigation were conducted to explore human behaviour in fire when under the influence of psychotropic drugs. In Study One the efficacy of current and alternative smoke alarm signals was tested after the consumption of hypnotics. A supplementary objective was to examine the relationship between sleep quality and <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Study Two retrospectively analysed an Australian database of fire fatalities using advanced algorithmic modelling techniques to determine: (a) if users of psychotropics and hypnotics were overrepresented in the Australian fire fatality statistics; and (b) the relationship between psychotropic drug consumption and a number of behavioural, environmental, and demographic risk factors. The research provided new, important evidence revealing an uncomfortably high level of risk to users of psychotropic drugs, particularly hypnotics, in a residential fire context. This was the first time psychoactive drug usage had been considered in such detail in the international literature...|$|R
40|$|A {{multitude}} of studies used external sensory stimuli to experimentally induce electroencephalographic, vegetative or behavioral reactions in the sleeping subject, either {{to gather information}} {{on the nature of}} sleep or to induce sleep fragmentation. But Ernst Otto Heinrich Kohlschütter was the first to systematically investigate the change of awakening thresholds across the night, generating a sleep depth curve for his 1862 dissertation ‘‘Measurements on the Firmness of Sleep” (‘‘Messungen der Festigkeit des Schlafes”). For the time, his concepts of sleep and the design of his experiments were impressive. A re-analysis of his data with modern regression techniques and a comparison with a polysomnographic laboratory study on the effects of traffic noise on sleep shows that he correctly captured the typical evolution of awakening thresholds across the night, with only 74 measurements in a single subject. Nevertheless, Kohlschütter’s analyses were hypothesis driven, as he discarded almost 50 % of the data points to derive what he called an ‘‘idealized curve of sleep”. This does not belittle his achievement of being the first to systematically investigate <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> across the night without the help of electrophysiologic measurement techniques...|$|R

Sleep-related symptoms for post-traumatic stress disorder takes place within hyperarousal symptoms and re-experiencing traumatic life events in DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Hyperarousal symptoms usually present as difficulty in initiation and maintaining sleep. Patients often complain from nightmares and these include repetition of traumatic events and reflect threatening incidents.

40|$|Organisms {{perceive}} {{changes in}} their dietary environment and enact a suite of behavioral and metabolic adaptations that can impact motivational behavior, disease resistance, and longevity. However, the precise nature and mechanism of these dietary responses is not known. We have uncovered a novel link between dietary factors and sleep behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary sugar rapidly altered sleep behavior by modulating the number of sleep episodes during both the light and dark phase of the circadian period, independent of an intact circadian rhythm and without affecting total sleep, latency to sleep, or waking activity. The effect of sugar on sleep episode number was consistent with a change in <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> for waking. Dietary protein had no significant effect on sleep or wakefulness. Gustatory perception of sugar was necessary and sufficient {{to increase the number}} of sleep episodes, and this effect was blocked by activation of bitter-sensing neurons. Further addition of sugar to the diet blocked the effects of sweet gustatory perception through a gustatory-independent mechanism. However, gustatory perception was not required for diet-induced fat accumulation, indicating that sleep and energy storage are mechanistically separable. We propose a two-component model where gustatory and metabolic cues interact to regulate sleep architecture in response to the quantity of sugar available from dietary sources. Reduced <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold</b> in response to low dietary availability may have evolved to provide increased responsiveness to cues associated with alternative nutrient-dense feeding sites. These results provide evidence tha...|$|E
40|$|Sleep-disordered {{breathing}} {{is a common}} and serious cause of meta-bolic, cardiovascular, and neurocognitive morbidity in children. The spectrum of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing ranges from habitual snoring to partial or complete airway obstruction, termed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Breathing patterns due to airway narrowing are highly variable, including obstructive cycling, in-creased respiratory effort, flow limitation, tachypnea, and/or gas exchange abnormalities. As a consequence, sleep homeostasis may be disturbed. Increased upper airway resistance is an essen-tial component of OSA, including any combination of narrowing/ retropositioning of the maxilla/mandible and/or adenotonsillar hypertrophy. However, in addition to anatomic factors, {{the stability of the}} upper airway is predicated on neuromuscular activation, ven-tilatory control, and <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold.</b> During sleep, most children with OSA intermittently attain a stable breathing pattern, indicating successful neuromuscular activation. At sleep onset, airway muscle activity is reduced, ventilatory variability increases, and an apneic threshold slightly below eupneic levels is observed in non-REM sleep. Airway collapse is offset by pharyngeal dilator activity in re-sponse to hypercapnia and negative lumenal pressure. Ventilatory overshoot results in sudden reduction in airway muscle activation, contributing to obstruction during non-REM sleep. Arousal from sleep exacerbates ventilatory instability and, thus, obstructive cy-cling. Paroxysmal reductions in pharyngeal dilator activity related to central REM sleep processes likely account for the disproportionate severity of OSA observed during REM sleep. Understanding the pathophysiology of pediatric OSA may permit more precise clinical phenotyping, and therefore improve or target therapies related to anatomy, neuromuscular compensation, ventilatory control, and/or <b>arousal</b> <b>threshold...</b>|$|E
40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{the human brain}} remains in a very active state during sleep, 1 and being asleep {{is by no means}} equal to an absence of {{conscious}} experience. 2 Previous research has shown that participants can produce a behavioural response to auditory stimuli during sleep without necessarily awakening. 3 Such responses are elicited more readily during the subjectively lighter stages of sleep compared to the subjectively deeper stages. This is illustrated when we consider that auditory <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> (AAT’s) normally progressively decline across the night, 4 which is commensurate with the declining proportion of time spent in deep sleep as sleep progresses. 5 Although the previously cited results describe the norm for many, it is problematic for the designers of alarm signals that AAT research has revealed that there are important individual differences that are likely to affect whether a sleeping person will respond to an auditory signal. These differences are as follows: • Sleepy individuals (defined as sleep latency ≤ 5 minutes), and alert individuals (defined as sleep latency ≥ 10 minutes) who have been deprived of sleep, do not show the usual decline in AAT’s across the night. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: An animal's {{state of}} arousal is {{fundamental}} to all of its behavior. Arousal is generally ascertained by measures of movement complemented by brain activity recordings, which can provide signatures independently of movement activity. Here we examine the relationships among movement, arousal state, and local field potential (LFP) activity in the Drosophila brain. Results: We have measured the correlation between local field potentials (LFPs) {{in the brain and}} overt movements of the fruit fly during different states of arousal, such as spontaneous daytime waking movement, visual arousal, spontaneous night-time movement, and stimulus-induced movement. We found that the correlation strength between brain LFP activity and movement was dependent on behavioral state and, to some extent, on LFP frequency range. Brain activity and movement were uncoupled during the presentation of visual stimuli and also in the course of overnight experiments in the dark. Epochs of low correlation or uncoupling were predictive of increased <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> even in moving flies and thus define a distinct state of arousal intermediate between sleep and waking in the fruit fly. Conclusions: These experiments indicate that the relationship between brain LFPs and movement in the fruit fly is dynamic and that the degree of coupling between these two measures of activity defines distinct states of arousal...|$|R
40|$|For decades, Drosophila melanogaster {{has been}} used as a model {{organism}} to study human diseases, ranging from heart disease to cancer to neurological disorders [9]. For studying neurodegenerative diseases, Drosophila has been instrumental in understanding disease mechanisms and pathways as well as being an efficient tool in drug discovery studies. For some better-understood disorders, such as Fragile X (a mental retardation syndrome), clinical trials are being run, based in part on translational work in flies and rodents. However, Drosophila is currently less used to study psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), despite numerous discoveries of disease susceptibility genes that could be explored by reverse genetics or miss-expression studies. This deficit might be explained by (1) a lack of reliable tests to study more complex disease (endo) phenotypes in flies, (2) difficulties in translating disease symptoms into animal models and (3) the polygenetic nature of these diseases. In this review we discuss strategies to use D. melanogaster to study complex psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and ADHD. Two common features of these diseases may be defective sleep and attention mechanisms, hence calling for better methods for quantifying and screening <b>arousal</b> <b>thresholds</b> in flies...|$|R
