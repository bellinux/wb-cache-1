30|$|According to the {{structure}} and morphology, liposomes were fabricated by the hydrophilic and hydrophobic region. Various drugs and agents have been encapsulated inside the region to develop some specific functions. In this respect, magnetic nanoparticles have been embedded into the liposomes, namely magnetic liposomes [3, 10 – 12] or magnetoliposomes [11, 13 – 16], to achieve specific functions in magnetic-related characteristic such as contrast agent [17], magnetic-targeted ability[18], and heating generation [3, 19]. Specifically, through the guidance of external magnetic field, magnetic liposomes could be directed into the specific area of tumor cells, then promote another specific function, including drug release [3, 16, 20, 21] and killing the cancerous cells [3, 13, 16, 22, 23]. High-frequency magnetic field (HFMF) has been developed as a system to assist <b>the</b> <b>magnetic-based</b> nanoparticles developed <b>the</b> specific function based on the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>magnetic-based</b> nanoparticles and HFMF exposure [1 – 3, 24, 25].|$|R

It mainly involves pulmonary vein isolation and additional ablations in the left atrium in persistent cases. There have been significant advancements in this procedure to enhance the safety and effectiveness. One {{of them is the}} evolution of various imaging modalities to facilitate better visualization of the complex left atrial anatomy and the pulmonary veins in order to deliver the lesions accurately. In this article, we review the electroanatomic mapping systems including <b>the</b> <b>magnetic-based</b> and impedence-based systems.

40|$|Two nucleic acid-based {{methods for}} rapid and {{sensitive}} detection of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes in milk {{were developed in}} this study. These methods rely on paramagnetic nanoparticle-based isolation of bacterial DNA directly from milk and subsequent PCR with selective primers for the listeriolysin O (hlyA) gene. The hlyA specific product was reproducibly detected and showed a sensitivity of 10 cfu ml(- 1). <b>The</b> <b>magnetic-based</b> system had a sensitivity 10 -fold {{higher than that of}} commercially available column devices. The detection limit of both methods is sufficient for direct detection of L. monocytogenes DNA in milk avoiding the enrichment culturing step, reducing the time necessary to obtain results from samples to 7 h rather than the 5 -day minimum required for the standard procedure.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{magnetic}} domain walls {{is essential for}} <b>the</b> <b>magnetic-based</b> memory and logic applications. As an elementary excitation of magnetic order, spin wave is capable of moving magnetic domain walls just as the conducting electric current. Ferromagnetic spin waves can only be right-circularly polarized. In contrast, antiferromagnetic spin waves have full polarization degree of freedom, including both left- and right-circular polarizations, {{as well as all}} possible linear or elliptical ones. Here we demonstrate that, due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the spin wave driven domain wall motion in antiferromagnets strongly depends on the linear polarization direction of the injected spin waves. Steering domain wall motion by simply tuning the polarization of spin waves offers new designing principles for domain-wall based information processing devices. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic drug {{carriers}} such as microrobots and paramagnetic microparticles {{have the}} potential to increase the therapeutic indices by selectively targeting the diseased tissue. These magnetic microobjects can be controlled using magnetic-based manipulation systems. In this study, we analyze a minimum input motion control to minimize the currents at each of the electromagnets of a magnetic system. This minimum input control allows us to achieve point-to-point closed-loop motion control of microparticles in the three-dimensional space, at an average speed of 198 μm/s, and maximum root mean square position tracking error of 104 μm. The minimum input control system is further evaluated by comparing norm- 2 of its resulting current vector to the current vector of a proportionalintegral (PI) control system. This comparison shows that the minimum input control achieves 11 % decrease in the current input, as opposed to the PI control system. However, the PI control system achieves 43 % and 285 % higher average speed and positioning accuracy, respectively, as opposed to the minimum input controller. <b>The</b> <b>magnetic-based</b> minimum input control can be used to perform closed-loop control of magnetic microrobots while decreasing the current input...|$|R
40|$|This review {{looks at}} <b>the</b> {{implementation}} of <b>magnetic-based</b> approaches in surgical instruments for abdominal surgeries. As abdominal surgical techniques advance toward minimizing surgical trauma, surgical instruments are enhanced {{to support such}} an objective through <b>the</b> exploration of <b>magnetic-based</b> systems. With this design approach, surgical devices are given the capabilities to be fully inserted intraabdominally to achieve access to all abdominal quadrants, without the conventional rigid link connection with the external unit. The variety of intraabdominal surgical devices are anchored, guided, and actuated by external units, with power and torque transmitted across the abdominal wall through magnetic linkage. This addresses many constraints encountered by conventional laparoscopic tools, such as loss of triangulation, fulcrum effect, and loss/lack of dexterity for surgical tasks. Design requirements of clinical considerations to aid the successful development of magnetic surgical instruments, are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Turgor {{pressure}} {{provides a}} sensitive indicator for irrigation scheduling. Leaf turgor pressure of Musa acuminate {{was measured by}} using the so-called leaf patch clamp pressure probe, i. e. by application of an external, magnetically generated and constantly retained clamp pressure to a leaf patch and determination of the attenuated output pressure P p that is highly correlated with the turgor pressure. Real-time recording of P p values was made using wireless telemetric transmitters, which send the data to a receiver base station where data are logged and transferred to a GPRS modem linked to an Internet server. Probes functioned over several months under field and laboratory conditions without damage to the leaf patch. Measurements showed that <b>the</b> <b>magnetic-based</b> probe could monitor very sensitively changes in turgor pressure induced by changes in microclimate (temperature, relative humidity, irradiation and wind) and irrigation. Irrigation effects could clearly be distinguished from environmental effects. Interestingly, oscillations in stomatal aperture, which occurred frequently below turgor pressures of 100 kPa towards noon at high transpiration or at high wind speed, were reflected in the P p values. The period of pressure oscillations was comparable with the period of oscillations in transpiration and photosynthesis. Multiple probe readings on individual leaves and/or on several leaves over the entire height of the plants further emphasised the great impact of this non-invasive turgor pressure sensor system for elucidating the dynamics of short- and long-distance water transport in higher plants...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{monitoring}} of plant water status {{under field conditions}} remains difficult to quantify. Here we give evidence that <b>the</b> <b>magnetic-based</b> leaf patch clamp pressure (LPCP) probe is a non-invasive and online-measuring method that can elucidate short- and long-term temporal and spatial dynamics of leaf water status of trees with high precision in real time. Measurements were controlled remotely by telemetry and data transfer to the Internet. Concomitant measurements using the pressure chamber technique (frequently applied for leaf water status monitoring) showed that both techniques yield in principle the same results despite of the high sampling variability of the pressure chamber data. There {{was a very good}} correlation between the output pressure signals of the LPCP probe and the balancing pressure values (on average r 2 Â =Â  0. 90 Â Â±Â  0. 05; nÂ =Â  8), i. e. the external pressure at which water appears at the cut end of a leaf under pressure chamber conditions. Simultaneously performed direct measurements of leaf cell turgor pressure using the well-established cell turgor pressure probe technique evidenced that both techniques measure relative changes in leaf turgor pressure. The output pressure signals of the LPCP probe and the balancing pressure values were inversely correlated to turgor pressure. Consistent with this, the balancing pressure values and the cell turgor pressure values could be fitted quite well by the same firm theoretical backing derived recently for the LPCP probe (Zimmermann et al., 2008). This finding suggests that use of the LPCP probe technique in agricultural water management can be built up on the knowledge accumulated on spot leaf or stem water potential measurements.

40|$|International audienceThe article {{addresses}} the position control {{problem of a}} 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) piezoelectric cantilever {{by means of an}} embedded <b>magnetic-based</b> position sensor. <b>The</b> active part of the piezocantilever used in the experimental setup is similar to cantilevers previously developed and already used for low-frequency micro-actuators in microrobotics devices. The contribution relies on the estimation of the biaxial displacement of the piezocantilever via conventional Hall-effect (HE) sensors, reducing the mechanical complexity and cost aspects. The actual sensing approach is validated via the implementation of a real-time position control based on the H 1 scheme. In comparison with high resolution sensors, as laser or confocal chromatic (high-cost) or capacitive displacement (bulky), the actual sensor-control system is provides a satisfactory performance to cope with traditional micro-positioning tasks requiring a micrometer resolution. The performanceof <b>the</b> embedded <b>magnetic-based</b> position sensor is evaluated, in open- and closed-loop, with respect the measurements provided by a Keyence laser sensors...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{systems have}} the {{potential}} to control the motion of microparticles and microrobots during targeted drug delivery. During their manipulation, a nominal magnetic force-current map is usually derived and used as a basis of the control system design. However, the inevitable mismatch between the nominal and actual force-current maps along with external disturbances affects the positioning accuracy of the motion control system. In this paper, we devise a control system that allows for the realization of the nominal magnetic force-current map and the point-to-point positioning of paramagnetic microparticles. This control is accomplished by estimating and rejecting the 2 -D disturbance forces using an inner loop based on a disturbance force observer. In addition, an outer loop is utilized to achieve stable dynamics of the overall magnetic system. The control system is implemented on a magnetic system for controlling microparticles of paramagnetic material, which experience magnetic forces that are related to the gradient of the field-squared. We evaluate the performance of our control system by analyzing the transient- and steady-state characteristics of the controlled microparticle for two cases. The first case is done without estimating and rejecting the mismatch and the disturbance forces, whereas the second case is done while compensating for these disturbance forces. We do not only obtain 17 % faster response during the transient state, but we are also able to achieve 23 % higher positioning accuracy in the steady state for the second case (compensating disturbance forces). Although the focus of this paper is on <b>the</b> wireless <b>magnetic-based</b> control of paramagnetic microparticle, the presented control system is general and can be adapted to control microrobots...|$|R
40|$|Realization of {{point-to-point}} {{positioning of}} a magnetotactic bacterium (MTB) necessitates {{the application of}} a relatively large magnetic field gradients to decrease its velocity in the vicinity of a reference position. We investigate an alternative closed-loop control approach to position the MTB. This approach is based on the characterization of the magnetic dipole moment of the MTB and its response to a field with alternating direction. We do not only find agreement between our characterized magnetic dipole moment and previously published results, but <b>also</b> observe that <b>the</b> velocity of the MTB decreases by 37 % when a field with alternating direction is applied at 85 Hz. The characterization results allow us to devise a null-space control approach which capitalizes on <b>the</b> redundancy of <b>magnetic-based</b> manipulation systems. This approach is based on two inputs. The first controls the orientation of the MTB, whereas the second generates a field with alternating direction to decrease its velocity. This control is accomplished by the redundancy of our magnetic-based manipulation system which allows for the projection of the second input onto the null-space of the magnetic force-current map of our system. A proportional–derivative control system positions the MTB at an average velocity and region of convergence of 29 μm s− 1 and 20 μm, respectively, while our null-space control system achieves an average velocity and region of convergence of 15 μm s− 1 and 13 μm, respectively...|$|R
