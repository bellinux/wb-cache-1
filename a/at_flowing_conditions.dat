The drill string got stuck while drilling these intervals. During production testing of MW- 04, fluid entries were observed from overlying layers and a temperature of 390  °C was measured after 11 days of flow testing and about 1 month after the end of drilling.

40|$|From {{previous}} experiments, it {{was shown}} that small quantities of liquids reduce or eliminate the singing phenomenon in corrugated tubes. The singing mitigation was attributed to filling up of the corrugations, interference with the boundary layer or due to the increased acoustic damping. To evaluate {{the influence of the}} presence of liquids on the acoustic damping, this damping was measured in a smooth and a corrugated tube (internal diameter 49 mm). The damping was measured using an active source (loudspeaker) and measuring amplitude of sound waves {{on both sides of the}} pipe. This was done at different gas velocities (U = 0, 15, 30 m/s) and different liquid injection rates (0, 150, 250 350 ml/min) for a frequency range between 0 - 2200 Hz. The smooth pipe results compared well with literature models such as the Kirchhoff model. In the presence of liquid, the acoustic damping increased linearly with the liquid rate. This increase was higher than expected based on the assumptions of mist flow or overall pressure drop. In case of the corrugated tube, the measured damping is dominated by a large fluctuation due to the source behavior (negative damping) <b>at</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>conditions.</b> At low velocities a decrease in source strength was measured with increasing liquid. At higher gas velocities, it was observed that liquid has almost no effect on the damping. Copyright © 2013 by ASME...|$|E

The validity of the approach to compute the associated error estimates, derived from a base grid to an extrapolated infinite-size grid, was first demonstrated on a sub-scaled wind tunnel model <b>at</b> representative ascent <b>flow</b> <b>conditions</b> for which the experimental data existed. Such analysis <b>at</b> the transonic <b>flow</b> <b>conditions</b> revealed a maximum deviation of about 23 % between the computed longitudinal aerodynamic coefficients with the base grid and the measured data across the entire roll angles.
