2500|$|As the Battle of Aleppo started, Saeed Jalili, {{the head}} of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, met with Assad in Damascus. Jalili said Iran would help Assad to confront [...] "attempts at blatant foreign interference" [...] in Syria's {{internal}} affairs, saying, [...] "Iran will not allow the axis of resistance, of which it considers Syria to be an essential part, to be broken in any way". During the Tehran sermon on 16 December 2016, Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani praised the [...] "Aleppo triumph" [...] as a [...] "defeat of the infidels".

2500|$|When St. Leger {{arrived at}} Ticonderoga, Vermont militia under Roger Enos were arrayed {{across the lake}} to observe them. [...] St. Leger was {{instructed}} to treat any Vermonters his men encountered in a friendly manner. [...] During a scouting expedition, a company of St. Leger's men killed one Vermont militiaman, Sgt. Archelaus Tupper, and captured five more. [...] Horrified <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> St. Leger wrote a letter of apology which unintentionally divulged aspects of the conspiracy. [...] Enos forwarded {{the letter to the}} assembly, using as a messenger someone who had long harbored suspicions about the actions of the Allen clan. [...] In addition to delivering the letter, he broadcast his suspicions far and wide. [...] A crowd gathered at the assembly, demanding answers from Ira Allen. [...] He demurred, claiming that Chittenden, who was not present at the time, was in possession of the relevant papers, and would deliver them. [...] A series of more innocuously worded dispatches was then forged by Nathaniel Chipman and delivered to the assembly to satisfy its demands for information.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien was {{the chief}} {{negotiator}} {{of what would be}} called the [...] "Kitchen Accord", an agreement which led to the agreement of nine provinces to patriation. In the Kitchen Accord, Chrétien, Roy McMurtry and Roy Romanow came up with the compromise of Section 33, the so-called [...] "notwithstanding clause" [...] allowing Parliament and provincial legislatures to overrule the courts in Charter cases. Chrétien remembered that Trudeau [...] "hated" [...] the idea of Section 33 and that he had to tell him: [...] "Pierre, if you don’t take the notwithstanding clause, you don’t have the Charter." [...] Trudeau only accepted Section 33 when the Ontario Premier Bill Davis, who together with New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield, were the only premiers supporting the federal government phoned him to say he would join the [...] "Gang of 8" [...] if Trudeau did not accept Section 33, which Chrétien remembered changed Trudeau's attitude completely. In a 2012 interview, Chrétien defended the controversial Section 33, saying: [...] "Because some would argue that in a society the elected people have to be supreme — not judges — and I subscribe to that. Look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in the United States where the judges reign according to their so-called philosophy. That is not the tradition here." [...] With the exception of Parti Québécois Quebec Premier René Lévesque, all of the [...] "Gang of 8" [...] premiers accepted the compromise of Section 33. Chrétien's role in the dealings, however, would not be forgotten in his native province of Quebec, which did not ratify the Constitution Act of 1982 (although the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Quebec was bound by it). One of Trudeau's aides Barry Strayer later said about Chrétien's role in the constitutional battle: [...] "He was able to contemplate compromises that Trudeau would have been able to. Everybody saw him as a honest broker. Without him you could argue it would not have happened".|$|E
