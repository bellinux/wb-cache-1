500|$|Writing for {{the journal}} British Politics, {{academic}} Mark Garnett provided {{a detailed analysis}} of the Blair and Mandelson memoirs, observing that while A Journey gives a more in-depth account of what he termed [...] "contemporary British government", The Third Man is a more satisfying read: [...] "The Third Man was a worthwhile effort for Peter Mandelson's reputation, while Tony Blair has journeyed in vain." [...] The New Zealand Listener, on the other hand, suggested that A Journey and other memoirs written by prominent architects of New Labour had helped to seal its doom after David Miliband – the preferred candidate of all three as Brown's successor – failed to be elected to the position: [...] "All three backed David Miliband, <b>and</b> <b>however</b> much Miliband tried to distance himself – I'm not New Labour, I'm Next Labour – these three books and the publicity that surrounded them showed he had New Labour dye all over his hands. David was beaten to the leadership by his younger brother, Ed (a man who lacked, as Blair himself might put it, the New Labour baggage), by a whisker – just over 1%.

[...] "Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy." [...] The anonymous medieval author of the Christian mystical work The Cloud of Unknowing similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged contemplation a soul dries up the [...] "root and ground" [...] of the sin that is always there, even after one's confession <b>and</b> <b>however</b> busy one is in holy things: [...] "therefore, whoever would work at becoming a contemplative must first cleanse his [...] conscience." [...] The medieval Flemish mystic John of Ruysbroeck likewise held that true conscience has four aspects {{that are necessary to}} render a man just in the active and contemplative life: [...] "a free spirit, attracting itself through love"; [...] "an intellect enlightened by grace", [...] "a delight yielding propension or inclination" [...] and [...] "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing." ...|$|E
500|$|NME {{reviewer}} Dele Fadele saw My Bloody Valentine as the [...] "blueprint" [...] for the shoegaze genre, and wrote: [...] "with 'Loveless' you could've {{expected the}} Irish / English partnership {{to succumb to}} self-parody or mimic The Scene That's Delighted To Eat Quiche [...] But no, 'Loveless' fires a silver-coated bullet into the future, daring all-comers to try and recreate its mixture of moods, feelings, emotion, styles and, yes, innovations."

[...] Melody Maker writer Simon Reynolds praised the album, and wrote that Loveless [...] " [...] how unique, how peerless MBV are." [...] He declared, [...] "Along with Mercury Rev's Yerself is Steam, 'Loveless' is the outermost, innermost, uttermost rock record of 1991." [...] Reynolds noted that his only criticism was that [...] "while My Bloody Valentine have amplified and refined what they already were, they've failed to mutate or leap into any kind of beyond." [...] In a review that also covered Chapterhouse and Creation labelmates Velvet Crush, Rolling Stone reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, [...] "Despite the record's intense ability to disorient—this is real do-not-adjust-your-set stuff—the effect is strangely uplifting. Loveless oozes a sonic balm that first embraces and then softly pulverizes the frantic stress of life." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that the band had [...] "written a new vocabulary for the guitar, and perhaps given it another 10 years of life as rock`s central instrument." [...] Spin gave Loveless a mixed review with writer Jim Greer noting that the album's songs are [...] "standard-ish and dull" [...] and concluded that he felt [...] "The warped music is a cool idea and I recommend the album—but {{not on the basis}} of the singing or the songs".|$|E
