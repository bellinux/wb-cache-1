500|$|The vast {{majority}} of damage was done by hail and rain. Approximately 24,000 houses were significantly damaged, with many suffering water damage through the holes in roofs that the large hailstones created. The stones were estimated as travelling at up to [...] in some periods of the storm, causing indentation damage to around 70,000 vehicles. Twenty-three <b>aeroplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> at Sydney Airport were reported as having incurred notable damage from the hail, caused by the inability to place them under hangars in time to avoid the storm. This has been significantly attributed {{to a lack of}} warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology, who had expected the storm to continue moving further out into the Tasman Sea in the north-northeasterly direction in which it had previously been travelling.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} a moderately positive reception from critics. Some {{of the community}} criticized the game for not featuring certain key elements found in previous games but the game eventually received positive reviews later on. According to Rare, the early reception was [...] "expected". The game received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release. It holds an average score of 79/100 at Metacritic, based on an aggregate of 71 reviews. The vehicular-based mechanics of the game were met with scepticism from many reviewers. Tom Bradwell of Eurogamer criticised the overall design of vehicles {{and the lack of}} traditional platforming as [...] "unfair", alongside citing a [...] "weak mission design". Ben Reeves of Game Informer stated that the mission structure was a [...] "mixed bag", asserting that racing was largely repetitive and [...] "derivative". Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the variety of the mission structure and vehicle building, stating that each [...] "problem" [...] requires creative thinking and innovation. However, McShea criticised the controls and physics of some of the vehicles, thus adding difficulty to the overall experience. Sterling McGarvey of GameSpy called Rare's decision to [...] "move the emphasis away from platforming" [...] and toward creation as bold, however he criticised the game's mechanics and manoeuvrability of land-based vehicles, although he noted that <b>aeroplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> were easy to utilise. McGarvey furthermore criticised the manoeuvrability of vehicles, stating that it was overall frustrating on how much the game relied on the awkward mechanics.|$|E

2500|$|Sutton Park is a {{large urban}} park located in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, West Midlands, England. Most of the park is a National Nature Reserve; large parts are also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is often locally called [...] "the largest urban park in Europe", however {{this is not true}} as this title belongs to Serra de Collserola. In fact, {{there are a number of}} European Urban parks larger than Sutton Park, {{including}} Lee Valley Park in London. The park covers more than [...] according to one source, or [...] according to another. It consists of a mix of heathland, wetlands and marshes, seven lakes, extensive ancient woodlands (covering approximately a quarter of the park), several restaurants, a private 18-hole golf course on its western edge and a municipal golf course to the south, a donkey sanctuary, children's playgrounds and a visitors' centre. There is no entrance charge, although on summer Sundays a parking charge for cars applies. A wide range of leisure activities are undertaken in the park including dog walking, pony treking, bike riding and kite flying. There are areas to fly model <b>aeroplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>helicopters.</b> A railway line runs through the park.|$|E

In addition, a passive pilot model is included in the aeroelastic loop and the corresponding effects on uncontrolled and controlled gust response are analysed...|$|R

50|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{are that}} an airship {{has a very}} large reference area and comparatively large drag coefficient, thus a larger drag force {{compared to that of}} <b>aeroplanes</b> <b>and</b> even <b>helicopters.</b> Given the large frontal area and wetted surface of an airship, a practical limit is reached around 80 - 100 mph.

40|$|Abstract- In {{the world}} of photography, {{surveillance}} of larger areas and military operations, the immediate machines that accommodate the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) category are the autonomous <b>aeroplane</b> <b>and</b> <b>helicopter.</b> Helicopters have clear advantages over the aeroplanes. They can be able to hover and land/take off in limited spaces. The quad rotor is a helicopter that has four rotors which are fixed to a certain spin axis. The different spinning directions of the motors balance the torques on their associated axes, therefore {{eliminating the need for}} a tail rotor that a normal helicopter requires. As long as all four rotors rotate at the same speed, the quad rotor helicopter essentially hovers, this proving to be a less complex in mechanical structure. Researches are being done to improve the reliability and decrease the size of such vehicles. So, they can be used in Search and Rescue operations, surveillance, inspection, aerial photography and aerial mapping. I...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} animals {{that live in}} deserts, Androctonus does not dig burrows to protect itself from a sandstorm. Instead, it can {{withstand}} sandstorms powerful enough to strip paint off steel, without any apparent damage. The resistance of Androctonus to sandstorms is suspected {{to be due to}} the discovery of its odd exoskeleton surface. Its armor is covered with dome-shaped granules that are [...] high and [...] across. When its odd surface is translated into other materials it protects them to a certain degree as well, which has led to the possibility of the applicability of imitation surfaces in such objects as <b>aeroplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>helicopters.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{native of}} Cairns, Rappolt held {{a variety of}} jobs before he entered politics. He served in the Citizens' Military Force from 1957 until 1961. In 1961 he began working as an agent for his brother, {{described}} by One Nation leader Bill Feldman as a musician [...] "of some renown". From 1974 to 1978 he ran his own building company, and was a licensed environmental auditor in Queensland and Victoria. During his time as an environmental auditor, Rappolt became interested in mining, and he soon became a mine manager, prospector and financier. He was also a commercial pilot, flying <b>aeroplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> for a time. Another interest of Rappolt's was soccer, and he volunteered as a coach and referee at junior level.|$|E
50|$|During the 2006 FIFA World Cup {{football}} championship, DLR {{implemented the}} Soccer project aimed at preventing traffic congestion. In this transportation research project, traffic data {{was obtained from}} the air in Berlin, Stuttgart and Cologne and used as input for traffic forecasting. A sensor system combining a conventional and a thermographic camera was used to obtain the data. A zeppelin, an <b>aeroplane</b> <b>and</b> a <b>helicopter</b> served as flying research platforms. An image analysis software package generated aerial photos showing the current traffic parameters as well as traffic forecasts. In this way, traffic control centres could be provided with almost-real-time traffic information, and road users could be diverted whenever necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{single most}} common class of {{aircraft}} is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, {{but the main}} area of growth over the last 20 years {{has been in the}} use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, amateur built <b>aeroplanes,</b> <b>and</b> smaller <b>helicopters.</b> The most important recent developments for small aircraft been the introduction of advanced avionics (including GPS) that were formerly found only in large airliners, and the introduction of composite materials to make small aircraft lighter and faster. Ultralight and homebuilt aircraft have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation they are much less expensive than certified aircraft.|$|R
