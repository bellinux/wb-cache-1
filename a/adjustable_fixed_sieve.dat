40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a {{speculative attack}} model of currency crises {{in an attempt}} to identify the roles of macroeconomic fundamentals and speculative market pressures in the recent crisis, as well as earlier devaluations in <b>adjustable</b> <b>fixed</b> exchange rate systems in the European currency markets. For a sample of five countries, including Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Norway, and Sweden, our empirical analyses show that both economic fundamentals and speculative factors have a significant influence on the probability of devaluations. The recent experience in the European foreign exchange markets suggests that the latest realignments are mainly the result of foreign exchange market tensions amidst the growing conflict between the needs of the domestic economies and the policies needed to maintain fixed exchange rates. Our results confirm that regardless of the source of the deterioration in economic conditions, market participants perceived the existing parities of the currencies in these five countries as inconsistent with their underlying economic fundamentals, thus effectively bringing about either a realignment or a modification of the exchange arrangement. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{several recent}} papers {{dealing with the}} feeding of copepods on natural {{particle}} assem-blages investigators have claimed to show types of behavior more complex than simple siev-ing by the animals. We question these interpretations because first, the sensing-zone counters used in these experiments size particles {{on the basis of}} their volumes, so that the equivalent spherical diameters thus obtained bear little relationship to the linear dimensions of many algal cells; and second, sieves remove particles from water {{on the basis of their}} linear di-mensions, not necessarily on the basis of their volumes. If mixtures of phytoplankton of diverse shapes are passed through a sieve and sized with a sensing-zone counter, the sieve will appear to have “behavior. ” Two other sources of artifact-the breakage of phytoplankton cells by experimental agitation and by the feeding of the copepods-add to the difficulties of interpreting natural particle experiments. Proper control experiments to evaluate the contri-bution of these sources of artifact to experimental results have not yet been done. Several papers have been published in recent years that purport to show “op-portunistic ” (Poulet 1974, 1978) or “flex-ible ” (Richman et al. 1977) feeding by copepods on naturally occurring particu-late material. In these experiments, sens-ing-zone counters such as the Coulter Counter have been used to size the par-ticles. Richman et al. (1977, p, 69) give a typical summary: “The results suggest considerable flexibility in copepod feed-ing behavior which cannot be explained solely by the mechanism of a <b>fixed</b> <b>sieve.</b> ” While we agree that it is likel...|$|R

40|$|The Treasury should {{supplement}} its bond offerings with adjustable-rate coupon bonds. The adjustable coupon {{would be}} linked to the six-month Treasury bill auction yield. Given the different magnitude of <b>adjustable</b> and <b>fixed</b> mortgage rates, the interest servicing costs would be dramatically lower for the floating-coupon bonds. This idea is already a proven winner in the corporate bond market where close to 30 percent of new Eurobond offerings in the last 10 years have been adjustable-rate bonds. In addition to reducing servicing costs, the strategy will relieve some of the burden on the long-maturity fixed-coupon bonds. Reducing the supply of the fixed-coupon bonds should increase prices and decrease long-term yields. Reduction in long-term interest rates enhances spending, construction and capital expenditures. Most importantly, these bonds help enforce a low inflation policy. Copyright 1993 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R
