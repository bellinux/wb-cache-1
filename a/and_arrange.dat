5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order <b>and</b> <b>arrange</b> a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers <b>and</b> <b>arrange</b> a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Marie's eldest daughter, Princess Elisabeth, {{was engaged}} to Prince George of Greece, the eldest son of the deposed King Constantine I of Greece and Marie's cousin Sophia. After {{inviting}} George and his two sisters, the Princesses Helen and Irene, to lodge with them at Sinaia, Marie organised numerous activities for the young couple and was delighted {{at the prospect of}} marrying off her daughter, whose character was severely flawed. In October, reports of King Alexander's death came from Greece; the Greek princesses needed to be returned to their parents as soon as possible. The following day, news arrived that Marie's mother had died in her sleep in Zurich. Marie made arrangements for her departure to Switzerland, where she would take Helen and Irene to their parents <b>and</b> <b>arrange</b> her mother's funeral. Meanwhile, George and Elisabeth would remain at Sinaia.|$|E
5|$|The {{company began}} as a {{development}} team that created software called Picture This Home in the mid-1990s for Autodesk in San Rafael, California.

Picture This Home was awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. In 1998, the software and its team of 40developers were sold to Broderbund, which was owned by The Learning Company, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc. Broderbund eventually spun Picture This Home off as a company called GoodHome.com in June 1999. The company received $30 million in venture capital from Hearst Interactive Media.|$|E

5|$|The music, however, was {{not written}} by Fordham, {{but rather by}} several composers, {{including}} Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), Scrubs composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, each of whom helped write <b>and</b> <b>arrange</b> several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez, the writers of hit Broadway musical Avenue Q. Marx and Lopez's involvement came {{at the suggestion of}} Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if {{it would be possible to}} get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode. Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of musical genre suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in the same room.|$|E
5|$|The {{successes of}} Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav partisans in Dalmatia led the Allies to {{despatch}} small patrols into Yugoslavia and Albania to contact partisan leaders <b>and</b> <b>arrange</b> co-operation with the Allied air forces. Several Rhodesian patrols from the LRDG {{were selected to}} undertake such missions during August and September 1944. Yugoslav partisans subsequently indicated targets for Allied bombing missions, with some success. From September, members of the LRDG's Rhodesian squadron under Captain Olivey undertook advanced reconnaissance in the Peloponnese peninsula of southern Greece. Landing at Katakolo, {{they made their way}} inland to Corinth and, along with the British 4th Parachute Battalion, entered Athens as the Germans departed in November. The Rhodesians of the LRDG spent November and December helping Greek forces to garrison an Athens orphanage against supporters of the communist Greek People's Liberation Army. Four Rhodesians were killed.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, <b>and</b> <b>arrange</b> them so they could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had pygostyles on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|E
