From an initial reference structure a set of trial structures is created by varying the model parameters. The parameters are changed until an optimal agreement between theory and experiment is achieved. However, for each trial structure a full LEED calculation with multiple scattering corrections must be conducted. For systems with a large parameter space the need for computational time might become significant.

25|$|In physics, the {{standard}} {{definition of a}} glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching, although the term glass {{is often used to}} describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg. For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered <b>atomic</b> <b>configuration</b> of the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, a glass exists in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} a local picture of strongly correlated systems as a Feynman sum over <b>atomic</b> <b>configurations.</b> The hopping amplitudes between these <b>atomic</b> <b>configurations</b> {{are identified as}} the renormalization group charges, which describe the local physics at different energy scales. For a metallic system away from half-filling, the fixed point local Hamiltonian is a generalized Anderson impurity model in the mixed valence regime. There are three types of fixed points: a coherent Fermi liquid (FL) and two classes of self-similar (scale invariant) phases which we denote incoherent metallic states (IMS). When the transitions between the <b>atomic</b> <b>configurations</b> proceed coherently at low energies, the system is a Fermi liquid. Incoherent transitions between the low energy <b>atomic</b> <b>configurations</b> characterize the incoherent metallic states. The initial conditions for the renormalization group flow {{are determined by the}} physics at rather high energy scales. This is the domain of local quantum chemistry.

50|$|For {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} interpretation a PES is typically defined within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (in order {{to distinguish between}} nuclear and electronic motion and energy) which states that the nuclei are stationary relative to the electrons.

5000|$|If {{a single}} photon {{approaches}} an atom which is receptive to it, the photon can be {{absorbed by the}} atom in a manner very similar to a radio wave being picked up by an aerial. At the moment of absorption the photon ceases to exist and the total energy contained within the atom increases. This increase in energy is usually described symbolically by saying {{that one of the}} outermost electrons [...] "jumps" [...] to a [...] "higher orbit". This new <b>atomic</b> <b>configuration</b> is unstable and the tendency is for the electron to fall back to its lower orbit or energy level, emitting a new photon as it goes. The entire process may take no more than 1 x 10−9 seconds. The result is much the same as with reflective colour, but because of the process of absorption and emission, the substance emits a glow. According to Planck, the energy of each photon is given by multiplying its frequency in cycles per second by a constant (Planck’s constant, 6.626 x 10−27 erg seconds). It follows that the wavelength of a photon emitted from a luminescent system {{is directly related to the}} difference between the energy of the two atomic levels involved.|$|E
5000|$|The RMC method {{suffers from}} a number of {{potential}} problems. The most notable problem is that often more than one qualitatively different model will give similar agreement with experimental data. For example, in the case of amorphous silicon, the integral of the first peak in the pair distribution function may imply an average atomic coordination number of 4. This might reflect the fact that all atoms have coordination number of 4, but similarly having half the atoms with coordination number of 3 and half with 5 will also be consistent with this data. Unless a constraint on the coordination number is employed, the RMC method will have no means of generating a unique coordination number and most likely a spread of coordination numbers will result. Using amorphous silicon as an example, Biswas, Atta-Fynn and Drabold were the first to elucidate the importance of including constraints in RMC modeling. [...] Since the RMC method follows the normal rules of statistical mechanics, its final solution will be the one with the highest degree of disorder (entropy) possible. A second problem {{comes from the fact that}} without constraints the RMC method will typically have more variables than observables. One result from this will be that the final <b>atomic</b> <b>configuration</b> may have artifacts that arise from the method attempting to fit noise in the data.|$|E
