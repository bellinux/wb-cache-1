5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment.

5|$|The final {{problem was}} the poor {{financial}} situation that Nicola was in. In {{a letter to the}} Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council dated April 7, 1779, Nicola asked for a pay raise, saying he was unable to purchase food or even clothes. Some members of the Invalid Corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves. On February 5, 1782, the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council fired Nicola from the position of Town Major; their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at the time. During that same month <b>and</b> <b>struggling</b> for money, Nicola asked the Continental superintendent of finance Robert Morris for the money that the Congress did not pay the Corps.

5|$|Complaining of exhaustion, <b>and</b> <b>struggling</b> with an injury, Allen rested {{from the}} MCC's next tour games. He was criticised for this, by Warner among others, {{particularly}} when the team lost in his absence. Allen proposed that he miss the final Test, but the other selectors insisted he play. For the game, Australia chose a fast bowler, Laurie Nash, who had returned to first-class cricket after a three-year absence to play for Victoria against the MCC. Allen, concerned over the possible use of Bodyline by Nash, who had bowled short against the MCC, spoke to Bradman before the game. Bradman replied that an opposing captain could not veto members of his team, at which Allen went to the umpires and threatened to bring his team off the field if Bodyline was used. Struggling with a leg injury, Allen was below his best. Australia won the toss, scored 604 and, assisted by rain, bowled England out for 239 and 165 to win the match and series; Nash did not bowl short.|$|E

After passing through the 61st Infantry Battalion's position, at around 9:00am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay. As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties. They also encountered several Japanese soldiers who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead. In response, some Australians systematically bayoneted and shot the bodies of Japanese soldiers. At noon, the 9th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit from the 7th Infantry Brigade, dispatched two companies to occupy some of the ground that the 2/12th had regained around No. 3 Airstrip and the mission.|$|E

After opening the batting for much of the round-robin phase, <b>and</b> <b>struggling</b> with only 159 runs at 19.87 in four matches, Karthik then played in the zonal Under-19 one-dayers, managing only 28 runs in four innings. Karthik returned to the middle-order for the semi-final against Railways, scoring his maiden first-class century of 122 to help his team take a first innings lead. He followed this with 48 in the second innings, to help Tamil Nadu progress to the final on the basis of the first innings after Railways held on for a draw still more than 300 runs short of their target. He followed this with an unbeaten 109 in the final against Mumbai. His innings was the mainstay of Tamil Nadu’s 294, but Mumbai made 613 to take a first innings lead. Tamil Nadu made 4/393 in the second innings with Karthik not batting, but the first innings lead in the drawn match gave Mumbai the title. Karthik ended with three catches in the innings. However these performances were insufficient to gain regional representation, and he was overlooked for South Zone's matches in the Duleep Trophy.|$|E
