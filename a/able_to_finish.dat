5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been {{troublesome}} for some time, she suffered {{a succession of}} falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices. She realised {{that she would not}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title Harvest of the Cold Months.|$|E

The next two volumes were supposed to detail the dungeons beneath Castle Zagyg. However, before they could be written, Gygax died in March 2008. Three months after his death, Gygax Games – a new company formed by Gary's widow, Gail – withdrew all of the Gygax licenses from Troll Lord, and also from Hekaforge.|$|E

5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned and was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
5|$|Casey had {{intended}} to come ashore {{on the first day}} of the landing at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific. For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was subsequently awarded a bronze oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.|$|E
25|$|A 1990 Legacy was {{the first}} Group N car <b>to</b> ever <b>finish</b> the WRC Safari Rally. This rally is {{considered}} the world's most gruelling rally under the World Rally Championship. In 1990 the 38th Safari Rally had 59 competitors total, only 10 of which were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach the <b>finish.</b> The Legacy was the only Group N car <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach the <b>finish</b> and was in 8th place overall.|$|R

50|$|At the 5th {{event of}} the series in Turkey (Antalya), Gary {{introduced}} his first new dive - a previously unattemped back piked 3 somersaults with 4 twists. The dive has a difficulty rating of 6.2 and {{is the most difficult}} dive to be performed in any form of competitive diving. Although he was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finished</b> 3rd at this event, the new dive got a huge amount of attention, opened the eyes of the cliff diving community and began to cement Gary's reputation as a fearless daredevil who was going to push the sport to new levels.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> landing their troops, {{which may}} have contributed to the {{impression}} of significant forces in front of the Australian defenders and their subsequent withdrawal. The heavy losses suffered by the Allied aircraft and aircrew virtually eliminated their ability to influence the subsequent ground battles. Moran's report on Japanese incompetence at night fighting was the most important result of the battle. Since few details about the subsequent night combats off Java survived, Moran's assessment influenced Allied thinking about the IJN until the stunning victory during the nighttime Battle of Savo Island in August flipped the Allied beliefs about the Japanese ability at night fighting on their heads.|$|E
5|$|After initial preparations, the Americans and French {{built their}} first {{parallel}} {{and began the}} bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781 Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> their second parallel. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Lord Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began, resulting in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Aguinaldo {{suffered}} successive, disastrous {{losses in}} the field, as he retreated northwards. On 13 November 1899, Aguinaldo decided to disperse his army and begin conducting a guerrilla war. General José Alejandrino, one of Luna's remaining aides, stated in his memoirs that if Luna had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> the planned military camp in the Mountain Province and had shifted to guerrilla warfare earlier as Luna had suggested, Aguinaldo might have avoided having to run for {{his life in the}} Cordillera Mountains. For historian Teodoro Agoncillo, however, Luna's death did not directly contribute to the resulting fall of the Republic. In his book, Malolos: The Crisis of the Republic, Agoncillo stated that the loss of Luna showed the existence of a lack of discipline among the regular Filipino soldiers and it was a major weakness that was never remedied {{during the course of the}} war. Also, soldiers connected with Luna were demoralized and as a result eventually surrendered to the Americans.|$|E

50|$|Jeff Torborg, {{the manager}} {{at the start of}} the season, lead the team to a 16-22 start, one of the worst in the league. Adding to that, their three top {{pitchers}} A. J. Burnett, Josh Beckett and Mark Redman, had each endured injuries that season, but Beckett and Redman were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> the rest of 2003. On May 11, Torborg was fired and replaced with Jack McKeon, a fiery 72-year-old who began his managerial career in 1973 with the Kansas City Royals.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that {{they were not going to}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E

50|$|The {{good form}} which secured Southampton's Championship status in 2005-06 was carried {{through to the}} start of the 2006-07 season, and the turn of the year saw the team in fourth place in the table. The new board of {{directors}} had spent a club record £6 million on transfers: Polish strikers Grzegorz Rasiak and Marek Saganowski and 17 year-old left back Gareth Bale all had great runs in form. However, a drastic loss in the team's form overall, coupled with inept displays against fellow promotion hopefuls, saw the team drop to eighth place by mid-March 2007, and rapidly losing touch with the promotion race. With other promotion rivals dropping points and a small run of form in late April, however, Southampton were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>finishing</b> in sixth place, the last play-off position. They lost the home leg of their playoff semi-final to Derby County, and on 15 May achieved parity on aggregate but lost on penalties in a thrilling encounter.|$|R
