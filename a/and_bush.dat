5|$|Following the {{announcement}} of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated John Roberts to succeed her. On September 5, {{following the death of}} Chief Justice William Rehnquist, this nomination was withdrawn <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} legal {{protection}} of trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> outside forests is {{regulated by the}} wildlife conservation act of 16 April 2004 and belongs to local government tasks. To fulfill these tasks the council is equipped with legal tools of various character. One of these tools concerning the protection of trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> in urban <b>and</b> rural areas, which has been functioning in legislation for a long time, {{is the duty of}} property owners to get permission to remove trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes.</b> The duty in question is connected with the obligation to incur charge on account of such removal while the amount of the charge ought to be specified in the permission. However, in some cases legislator provides for exemption from both obtaining the permission and incurring charge. By contrast any removal of trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> without required permission as well as violating other obligations connected with the protection of trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> result in imposing a fine which amounts to triple charge of the removal. The tools mentioned above (permission to remove trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes,</b> charges for removal of trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> approved by the permission, a mandatory penalty for the removal of trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> without required permission and for the destruction of trees, <b>bushes</b> <b>and</b> greenery) are in the form of administrative decisions, so in theory they are administrative deeds issued by a local executive body: respectively by a borough leader, a mayor, or a city president. However, such tools are used by a starost with reference to property owned by a local government...|$|R

5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), <b>and</b> <b>bush</b> rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E

5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf <b>and</b> <b>bush</b> dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E

The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E

5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention.

Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

5|$|At {{the meeting}} with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush {{advocated}} cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir John Anderson. But by October 1942, Conant <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British {{should be limited to}} technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, on a visit to London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson and Bundy met with Anderson, Lord Cherwell and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended current policy. Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the Combined Policy Committee with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.|$|E
5|$|Bush left Tufts in 1919, {{although}} he remained employed by AMRAD, {{and joined the}} Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT, where he worked under Dugald C. Jackson. In 1922, he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H. Timbie on Principles of Electrical Engineering, an introductory textbook. AMRAD's lucrative contracts from World War I had been cancelled, <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> attempted to reverse the company's fortunes by developing a thermostatic switch invented by Al Spencer, an AMRAD technician, on his own time. AMRAD's management {{was not interested in}} the device, but had no objection to its sale. Bush found backing from Laurence K. Marshall and Richard S. Aldrich to create the Spencer Thermostat Company, which hired Bush as a consultant. The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars. It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals & Controls Corporation in 1931, and with Texas Instruments in 1959. Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006, and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground <b>and</b> <b>bush</b> made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} {{on a number of}} issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it {{remained}} successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon {{is thought to}} have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodons fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests <b>and</b> <b>bush,</b> which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out {{at the same time that}} most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.|$|E
