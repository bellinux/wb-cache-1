40|$|The {{renin-angiotensin system}} is {{upregulated}} with <b>diabetes,</b> <b>and</b> this {{may contribute to}} the development of a dilated myopathy. Angiotensin II (Ang II) locally may lead to oxidative damage, activating cardiac cell death. Moreover, <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> hypertension could synergistically impair myocardial structure and function. Therefore, apoptosis and necrosis were measured in ventricular myocardial biopsies obtained from diabetic and diabetic-hypertensive patients. Accumulation of a marker of oxidative stress, nitrotyrosine, and Ang II labeling were evaluated quantitatively. The diabetic heart showed cardiac hypertrophy, cavitary dilation, and depressed ventricular performance. These alterations were more severe with <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> hypertension. <b>Diabetes</b> was characterized by an 85 -fold, 61 -fold, and 26 -fold increase in apoptosis of myocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, respectively. Apoptosis in cardiac cells did not increase additionally with <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> hypertension. <b>Diabetes</b> increased necrosis by 4 -fold in myocytes, 9 -fold in endothelial cells, and 6 -fold in fibroblasts. However, <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> hypertension increased necrosis by 7 -fold in myocytes and 18 -fold in endothelial cells. Similarly, Ang II labeling in myocytes and endothelial cells increased more with <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> hypertension than with diabetes alone. Nitrotyrosine localization in cardiac cells followed a comparable pattern. In spite of the difference in the number of nitrotyrosine-positive cells with <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> with <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> hypertension, apoptosis and necrosis of myocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts were detected only in cells containing this modified amino acid. In conclusion, local increases in Ang II with <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> with <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> hypertension may enhance oxidative damage, activating cardiac cell apoptosis and necrosis...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer <b>and</b> Type 2 <b>diabetes</b> Mellitus are two chronic {{conditions}} that impact the lifespan {{and quality of}} life of women. Both <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> breast cancer have a disproportionate impact on African-American/Black women and it is reasonable to believe that Biological mechanisms or treatments for this co-morbid condition may have an antagonistic effect and impact the individual’s risk of mortality. AIM: This study aims to address whether pre-existing diabetes occurs at different rates among African-American/Black women with breast cancer than White women, <b>and</b> if <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> race are associated with higher all-cause and breast cancer specific mortality among women. METHODS: The US mortality linked data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 2006 - 2009, was used in the analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model and estimate the adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratios of the identified risk factors on mortality.

5|$|The {{process of}} deep frying food is {{generally}} detrimental to its nutritional value.

Consumption of large amounts of saturated and trans fats {{has been linked to}} a higher risk for some cancers including prostate cancer. Eating deep-fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, heart attacks, <b>and</b> <b>diabetes.</b> Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, <b>and</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet <b>and</b> <b>diabetes.</b> He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, <b>and</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus.|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease <b>and</b> <b>diabetes</b> risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
