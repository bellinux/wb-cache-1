5|$|Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, {{state senator}} Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, {{the baby was}} born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, in honor of his covert new family member.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by her {{religious}} upbringing, Olga {{took control of}} a portion of her sizable fortune when she was twenty and began to respond independently to requests for charity. One day when she was out for a drive she saw a young child using crutches. She asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> and learned that the youngster's parents were too poor to afford treatment. Olga set aside an allowance to cover the child's medical bills.

500|$|Stach and Brod {{state that}} {{during the time that}} Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe [...] "Grete" [...] Bloch, a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka's son, {{although}} Kafka never knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921. However, Kafka's biographer Peter-André Alt claims that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father as the pair were never intimate. Stach states that Bloch had a son, but there is not solid proof and moreover contradictory evidence that Kafka was the father.|$|E

After her father returned to Raw after faking his own death, McMahon publicly revealed {{that her father}} had an illegitimate child, who was among the WWE roster. On the taped edition of Raw that aired September 3, 2007, McMahon, along with her mother Linda and her brother Shane, made several appearances to confront Mr. McMahon <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> who was later revealed to be Hornswoggle, turning into a fan favorite. On Raw's 15 Year Anniversary episode, she appeared along with Shane in a segment—also involving her husband Triple H and Hornswoggle—which ended with her kissing her real life husband Triple H, to humiliate her father on Raw.|$|E

500|$|Among other {{theories}} about the case, early speculation was that the girl could have been murdered {{by a member of}} her family. A criminologist stated that it did not seem likely that she would have been [...] "murdered by a stranger," [...] according to statistics of [...] similar cases. The fact that she had been disposed of along with personal items reinforced this theory. The fact that there were not yet any tips from relatives with information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> supported the idea that family members were involved with the disposal of the body—and possibly with her death. Investigators feared for other children who may have been in the care of those that disposed of the body, as they could be in danger. A different theory held that the child's family members might also be deceased, having faced a similar demise.|$|E
500|$|Boisselier {{confidently}} {{announced at}} a press conference in Florida in December 2002 that Clonaid had successfully produced a live-born clone, named Eve, for an infertile couple. Canadian sociologist Susan J. Palmer notes that naming the cloned child [...] "Eve" [...] recalls Raël's teachings that aliens created the first humans through cloning. After the announcement, Boisselier received abundant press, but the media, particularly late-night comedy programs, criticized her glamorous appearance and mocked Raëlism. Around that time, Boisselier appeared on many U.S. network news broadcasts and on CNN. She did not provide details <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> or its family, although she was often asked to. She hired a science editor from ABC to supervise verification of the cloning. Many scientists doubted that the Raëlians could overcome the difficulties that human cloning posed, or that {{they would be able to}} produce a healthy child. Boisselier said a DNA test was forthcoming and announced that five more clones would be born later that winter. As Raël and Boisselier continued to seek media exposure, journalistic animosity towards them grew.|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town but, all I can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{ideas were}} {{suggested}} for {{the sequel to}} Friday the 13th, including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the Friday the 13th moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, which suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience {{wanted to know more}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice did not see the [...] "real Jason" [...] in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in The Final Chapter, it was the director Joseph Zito's intention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in A New Beginning. Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in Jason Lives, when A New Beginning did not spark the [...] "creative success" [...] the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not care how it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since A New Beginning, no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{psychiatrists and}} pediatricians {{first began to}} {{recognize}} and discuss childhood psychiatric disorders in the 19th century, they were largely influenced by literary works of the Victorian era. Authors like the Brontë sisters, [...] George Eliot, and Charles Dickens, introduced new ways of thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> mind and the potential influence early childhood experiences could have on child development and the subsequent adult mind. When the Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology, the first psychiatric journal in English, was published in 1848, child psychiatry didn’t exist as its own field yet. However, {{some of the earliest}} works on the possibility of nervous disorders and [...] "insanity" [...] in children were published in the Journal and several medical writers directly referenced works such as Jane Eyre (1847), Wuthering Heights (1847), Dombey and Son (1848), and David Copperfield (1850), to illustrate this new conceptualization of the child mind. Until that time, it was generally accepted that children were free from nervous disorders and the [...] "passions" [...] that affected the adult mind.|$|E
2500|$|Newborns {{were held}} upside down by {{their feet and}} lifted up and down to prevent 'livergrown' disorder. Some {{midwives}} believed that placing the child next to the mother under the quilt would force 'bold hives' out of the baby's body. Others recommended a little catnip or ground ivy tea, a drop or two of turpentine, or a spoonful of whiskey in order to [...] "hive" [...] the baby. A piece of cloth was tied around the newborn's waist for six week to protect the navel area which was thought to easily rupture due to its weakness. The newborn’s hair could not be cut {{during the first few}} weeks of life for fear of death before six months of age. If a child whose hair was cut too early did not die, it was feared that the child would become a thief later in life. If someone stepped over the child, this would stunt the newborn’s growth. The day of the week on which the child was born also said a lot <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> Children born on a Tuesday were said to be unlucky.|$|E
2500|$|After {{gathering}} the hostages in the gym, the attackers singled out 15–20 of whom they thought were the strongest adults among the male teachers, school employees, and fathers, {{and took them}} into a corridor next to the cafeteria on the second floor, where a deadly blast soon took place. An explosive belt {{on one of the}} female bombers detonated, killing another female bomber (it was also claimed the second woman died from a bullet wound) and several of the selected hostages, as well as mortally injuring one male hostage-taker. According to the version presented by the surviving hostage-taker, the blast was actually triggered by the [...] "Polkovnik" [...] (the group leader); he set off the bomb by remote control to kill those who openly disagreed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> hostages and intimidate other possible dissenters. The hostages from this group who were still alive were then ordered to lie down and shot with an automatic rifle by another gunman; all but one of them were killed. Karen Mdinaradze, the Alania football team's cameraman, survived the explosion as well as the shooting; when discovered to be still alive, he was allowed to return to the sports hall, where he lost consciousness. The militants then forced other hostages to throw the bodies out of the building and to wash the blood off the floor. One of these hostages, Aslan Kudzayev, escaped by jumping out the window; the authorities briefly detained him as a suspected hostage-taker.|$|E
