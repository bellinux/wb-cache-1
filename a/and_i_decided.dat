We just wanted to essentially look him in the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E
500|$|Dodge City {{had been}} a {{frontier}} cowtown for several years, but by 1879 had begun to settle down. Wyatt {{received a letter from}} his older brother Virgil that year, who was the town constable in Prescott, Arizona Territory. Virgil wrote Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone. Later in life, Wyatt wrote, [...] "In 1879, Dodge was beginning to lose much of the snap which had given it a charm to men of reckless blood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to move to Tombstone, which was just building up a reputation." ...|$|E

He batted [...]277 in 188 at-bats in his pro debut for the Spokane Indians in the Short-season Northwest League, while leading {{the team in}} steals (11) and triples (6). He then spent the 2003–04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' {{strength}} and conditioning coaches. He said: [...] "I was probably 170 pounds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> I needed to lift, put on some weight, and eat as much as I could. And I learned how to hit." ...|$|E

500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween. Carpenter recalls that the film crew [...] "didn't have any money to make a mask. It was originally written the way you see it, in other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless. I don't know why I wrote that down, why Debra [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> on that, maybe it was because of an old movie called Eyes Without a Face".|$|E
500|$|In the 1953–54 NBA season, the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined, {{averaging}} 18.1 points, 14.3 {{rebounds and}} 2.4 assists per game. Under his leadership, the Lakers won another NBA {{title in the}} 1954 NBA Finals, making it their third-straight championship and fifth in six years; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg. From an NBA perspective, the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957–69. At {{the end of the}} season, Mikan announced his retirement. He later said: [...] "I had a family growing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to be with them. I felt {{it was time to get}} started with the professional world outside of basketball." [...] Injuries also were a factor, as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career, often having to play through these injuries.|$|E
500|$|Pearson {{was born}} near Spartanburg, South Carolina. When Pearson was young, he climbed a tree {{at the local}} stock car racing track (Spartanburg Fairgrounds) to see the races. Pearson said, [...] "I'd always been {{interested}} in cars, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> right then that was what I wanted to do with my life." [...] He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to purchase a Ford coach. Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod. He jumped the car over ditches until he rolled it over. His mother paid him to junk the car and he used the money to purchase another car to build. In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race. He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including Joe Littlejohn.|$|E

500|$|A Secret Service agent, Bond was a {{composite}} {{based on a}} number of commandos whom author Ian Fleming had known during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, to whom he added his own style and a number of his own tastes. Fleming appropriated the name from American ornithologist James Bond. Bond's code number 007 comes from one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the breaking of the German diplomatic code. One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075, and {{which was one of the}} factors that led the US entering the war. Subsequently, if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified. Fleming later told a journalist, [...] "When I was at the Admiralty... all the top-secret signals had the double-0 prefix... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to borrow it for Bond".|$|E
500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{attended}} Savanna High School in Anaheim, describing {{himself as}} a [...] "band geek" [...] who played the trumpet. At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time; Hillenburg {{took part in a}} [...] "dive program" [...] at Woods Coves in Laguna Beach, California, as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna. This experience, as well as subsequent dives, reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college: [...] "The switch clicked <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist." [...] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise, saying: [...] "You should just draw fish." [...] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by [...] "making weird, little paintings". During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant in Maine. (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.) ...|$|E

[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> I needed to go back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E
500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You kept thinking he was going to make a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E
500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my folks <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that I'd make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E
5000|$|He {{changed his}} name after the series' {{playbill}} misspelled his name as [...] "Hugh Krape".

2500|$|In August 1933, Italian {{journalist}} Francesco Gasparini submitted what he {{said was}} the first news article on the Loch Ness Monster. In 1959, he reported sighting a [...] "strange fish" [...] and fabricated eyewitness accounts: [...] "I had the inspiration to get hold of the item about the strange fish.

So this fella, Cord Cooper, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> we needed to answer three basic questions in a very simple form, but I think substantively and really bares no rational refutation... We quote Einstein and Stephen Hawking, who is still living, the most brilliant man on the planet.

So this book is so simple, yet I think profound truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swaminathan {{then decided}} {{to pursue a career}} in {{agricultural}} sciences. He enrolled in Madras Agricultural College ( [...] now the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University [...] ) where he graduated as valedictorian with another Bachelor of Science degree, this time in Agricultural Science. He explained this career decision thus: [...] "My personal motivation started with the great , when I was a student at the University of Kerala.

2500|$|According to Pearce:"In 1986 whilst {{staying with}} Tibet in his flat in Freya Aswynn's house in north London {{over a period}} of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each {{separate}} night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so I could actually see which one it was. When I awoke I made a note of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to try and form an 'appropriate' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a 'thumbs up' about the whole thing. It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME." ...|$|E
