2500|$|Elderly care, {{or simply}} eldercare (also known {{in parts of}} the English {{speaking}} world as aged care), is the fulfillment of the special needs and requirements that are unique to senior citizens. [...] This broad term encompasses such services as assisted living, <b>adult</b> <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> long term care, nursing homes (often referred to as residential care), hospice care, and home care. Because of the wide variety of elderly care found nationally, as well as differentiating cultural perspectives on elderly citizens, cannot be limited to any one practice. For example, many countries in Asia use government-established elderly care quite infrequently, preferring the traditional methods of being cared for by younger generations of family members.|$|E
2500|$|A {{mental health}} {{professional}} is {{a health care}} practitioner or community services provider who offers services {{for the purpose of}} improving an individual's mental health or to treat mental disorders. [...] This broad category was developed as a name for community personnel who worked in the new community mental health agencies begun in the 1970s to assist individuals moving from state hospitals, to prevent admissions, and to provide support in homes, jobs, education and community. These individuals (i.e., state office personnel, private sector personnel, and non-profit, now voluntary sector personnel) were the forefront brigade to develop the community programs, which today may be referred to by names such as supported housing, psychiatric rehabilitation, supported or transitional employment, sheltered workshops, supported education, daily living skills, affirmative industries, dual diagnosis treatment, individual and family psychoeducation, <b>adult</b> <b>day</b> <b>care,</b> foster care, family services and mental health counseling.|$|E

Four sites providing ADHC in VA facilities are participating in an ongoing randomized controlled trial. Three years of developmental work prior to the study addressed methodological issues that were problematic in previous studies. This developmental work resulted in the methodological approaches described here: (1) a patient recruitment process that actively recruits and screens all potential candidates using empirically developed admission criteria based on predictors of nursing home placement in VA; (2) the selection and development of measures of medical efficacy that assess a wide range of patient and caregiver outcomes with sufficient sensitivity to detect small but clinically important changes; and (3) methods for detailed, accurate, and efficient measurement of utilization and costs of health care within and outside VA. These approaches may be helpful to other researchers and may advance the methodological sophistication of long-term care program evaluation...|$|R

40|$|One {{approach}} to providing cost-effective <b>adult</b> <b>day</b> health <b>care</b> (ADHC) services is to guide both the inputs to ADHC {{services and the}} provision of other services so that substitution for institutional services can realistically take place. This approach has been used in a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the medical efficacy and cost of ADHC in the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). This article describes the strategies that were used to improve the cost effectiveness of ADHC during the evaluation. Cost and use estimates were developed based on the best data available from the DVA and previous research on the cost for patients' use of ADHC, nursing home, hospital, and ambulatory care. A cost workshop was attended by the ADHC managers to develop plans for controlling costs. Plans were identified that increase the likelihood that ADHC can be shown to be less costly than customary care...|$|R

Although VA published proposed regulations that would make these services available in noninstitutional settings to eligible veterans, the regulations had not been finalized as of April 17, 2002.

GAO found, however, that both the services required by the act and VA's other noninstitutional services were unevenly available across the VA system. ...|$|R
