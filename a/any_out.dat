The gunner, who had more forecast of that kind than I had, agreed to the proposal, and added, why might we not try to catch some fish out of the lake? The first thing we had before us was to try if we could make any hooks, and this indeed put our artificer to his trumps; however, with some labour and difficulty, he did it, and we catched fresh fish of several kinds.

Of course we avoided the showy-looking horses, and chose those specially suited to the country and likely to be fast.

The buying of this brooch {{took a long time}} at the jeweller's in the rue des Romains, and she had only just fixed on an {{amethyst}} before feeling deadly ill with a dreadful pain through her lungs. She went out with her tiny package quickly, not wanting any fuss, and began to mount towards home. There were only three hundred yards to go, and with each step she said to herself: [...] "Nonsense! What would the Queen think of you! Remember the poor soldiers with only one leg! You have got both your legs! And the poor men who walk from the battlefield with bullets through the lungs. What is your pain to theirs! Nonsense!" [...] But the pain, like none she had ever felt--a pain which seemed to have sharp double edges like a knife--kept passing through and through her, till her legs had no strength at all, and seemed to move simply because her will said: [...] "If you don't, I'll leave you behind. So there!" [...] She felt as if perspiration were flowing down, yet her face was as dry as a dead leaf when she put up her hand to it. Her brain stammered; seemed to fly loose; came to sudden standstills. Her eyes searched painfully each grey-shuttered window for her own house, though she knew quite well that she had not reached it yet. From sheer pain she stood still, a wry little smile on her lips, thinking how poor Polly would say: [...] "Keep smiling!" [...] Then she moved on, holding out her hand, whether because she thought God would put his into it or only to pull on some imaginary rope to help her. So, foot by foot, she crept till she reached her door. A most peculiar floating sensation had come over her. The pain ceased, and as if she had passed through no doors, mounted no stairs--she was up in her room, lying on her sofa, with strange images about her, painfully conscious that she was not in proper control of her thoughts, and that Augustine must be thinking her ridiculous.

6000|$|Before I {{come to the}} Nymphs,[17] I {{must get}} through all disagreeables. I went to the Isle of Wight, thought so much about poetry, so long together, that I could not get to sleep at night; and, moreover, I know not how it was, I could not get {{wholesome}} food. By this means, {{in a week or}} so, I became not over capable in my upper stories, and set off pell-mell for Margate, at least a hundred and fifty miles, because, forsooth, I fancied that I should like my old lodging here, and could contrive to do without trees. Another thing, I was too much in solitude, and consequently was obliged to be in continual burning of thought, as an only resource. However, Tom is with me at present, and we are very comfortable. We intend, though, to get among some trees. How have you got on among them? How are the Nymphs? I suppose they have led you a fine dance. Where are you now?--in Judea, Cappadocia, or the parts of Libya about Cyrene? Stranger from [...] "Heaven, Hues, and Prototypes," [...] I wager you have given several new turns to the old saying, [...] "Now the maid was fair and pleasant to look on," [...] as well as made a little variation in [...] "Once upon a time." [...] Perhaps, too, you have rather varied, [...] "Here endeth the first lesson." [...] Thus I hope you have made a horseshoe business of [...] "unsuperfluous life," [...] "faint bowers," [...] and fibrous roots. I vow that I have been down in the mouth lately at this work. These last two days, however, I have felt more confident--I have asked myself so often why I should be a poet more than other men, seeing how great a thing it is,--how great things are to be gained by it, what a thing to be in the mouth of Fame,--that at last the idea has grown so monstrously beyond my seeming power of attainment, that the other day I nearly consented with myself to drop into a Phaethon. Yet 'tis a disgrace to fail, even in a huge attempt; and at this moment I drive the thought from me. I began my poem about a fortnight since, and have done some every day, except travelling ones. Perhaps I may have done a good deal for the time, but it appears such a pin's point to me, that I will not copy <b>any</b> <b>out.</b> When I consider that so many of these pin-points go to form a bodkin-point (God send I end not my life with a bare bodkin, in its modern sense!), and that it requires a thousand bodkins to make a spear bright enough to throw any light to posterity, I see nothing but continual uphill journeying. Now is there anything more unpleasant (it may come among the thousand and one) than to be so journeying and to miss the goal at last? But I intend to whistle all these cogitations into the sea, where I hope they will breed storms violent enough to block up all exit from Russia.
