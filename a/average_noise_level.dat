METHODS: The <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> on the asphalt concrete pavement(ACP) and the jointed plain concrete pavement(JPCP) of the national highway were measured and analysed with respect to three variables, i. e., pavement type, surface condition, and measurement distance. The PASS-By method is utilized for the noise measurement and then using CPB spectrum analysis method with 1 / 3 octave bandwidth, the <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> and frequency characteristics were calculated for two-second periods {{before and after the}} peak noise.

On the contrary, layers with a rubberized asphalt binder have shown to be durable, but their performance regarding noise abatement is not consensual yet. This paper aims at assessing {{the effect of the}} use of layers with rubberized asphalt binder on noise abatement. For this purpose seven road sections with different surface types, among which five gap graded and three with rubberized asphalt have been selected. In these road sections the tyre-road noise generated by a heavy truck and two light vehicles at three levels of speed were measured by means of pass-by tests.
