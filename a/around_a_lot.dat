5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E

25|$|Sam Browne VC was a British {{army officer}} serving in India in the 19th century. In those days {{officers}} always carried a sword into battle. It {{hung from a}} small metal clip on the waistbelt, called a 'frog'. However, the scabbard tended to slide <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> when they charged the enemy, meaning {{that it had to}} be steadied with the left hand before being drawn.|$|E
25|$|In {{southern}} Saskatchewan {{there was}} one main group of plains Indians who were called Assiniboine. They moved around the area that is modern day Willow Bunch. This band {{is thought to have}} arrived 11,000 years ago, just after the last glacier retreated. Like most bands at the time, this group moved where their food went. They depended on the bison for almost everything. They used the bison to make clothing, build their shelter and to make tools. Since they moved <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> they made a very smart way of transporting their tipis. The poles of the tipis would make a sled of sort that was called a travois and would be pulled by dogs. This carried all that they needed and transported their home at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Carlton Gary {{was born}} on September 24, 1950 in Columbus, Georgia. His father was a {{construction}} worker who {{wanted nothing to do}} with him and would accept no financial responsibility for him. Gary only met his father once, when he was twelve years old. Gary's mother was extremely poor and as a result, they moved <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> He was malnourished most of the time and was often left with his aunt or great aunt, both maids for elderly, wealthy, white women. In elementary school, Gary suffered serious head trauma when he was knocked unconscious in a playground accident, and in his teens, he was a heavy drug user. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he was arrested multiple times for robbery, arson, and assault. During that time, he also got married to a woman named Sheila, and had two children. In 1970, he moved to Albany, New York, where he had plans to become a singer, but he continued to carry out his criminal activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} scenes {{taken from the}} movie, along with shots of the band inside the Tomb of the Primes (The 7 original Transformers) while performing the song. A lot of special effects are also seen and the video is heavily edited in places making use of thermal cameras and using flying food parts as texture <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the thermal imagery. Despite many rumors of the female in the video being Megan Fox and even vocalist Chester Bennington's wife Talinda, she is a different actress hired to portray Mikaela Banes. According to Talinda, she is only shown in the thermal lens to look more like Fox. Bassist Dave Farrell is not seen in shots of the whole band performing as he injured his wrist during {{the first day of}} filming. It is presumed this is the reason for his lack of appearance in the video. However, he is seen many times during the special effects.|$|E
25|$|Tim is a stereotypical American male, {{who loves}} power tools, cars, and sports. In particular, {{he is an}} avid fan of local Detroit teams. In {{numerous}} instances, Tim wears Lions, Pistons, Red Wings, and Tigers clothing, and many plots revolve around the teams. He is a former salesman for the fictional Binford Tool company, and {{is very much a}} cocky, overambitious, accident-prone know-it-all. Witty but flippant, Tim jokes <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> even at inappropriate times, much to the dismay of his wife. However, Tim can sometimes be serious when necessary. Jill, Tim's wife, is loving and sophisticated, but not exempt from dumb moves herself. In later seasons she returns to college to study psychology. Family life is boisterous for the Taylors with the two oldest children, Brad and Randy, tormenting the much younger Mark, all while continually testing and pestering each other. Such play happened especially throughout the first three seasons, and was revisited only occasionally until Jonathan Taylor Thomas left {{at the beginning of the}} eighth season. During the show's final season, Brad and Mark became much closer due to Randy's absence.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Treasure Planet took roughly {{four and}} a half years to create, but the concept for Treasure Planet (which was called Treasure Island in Space at the time) was {{originally}} pitched by Ron Clements in 1985 during the meeting wherein he and John Musker also pitched The Little Mermaid. Clements stated that Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was the chief of Walt Disney Studios at the time, [...] "just wasn't interested" [...] in the idea. Since Musker and Clements wanted to be able to move [...] "the camera <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like Steven Spielberg or James Cameron," [...] the delay in production was beneficial since [...] "the technology had time to develop in terms of really moving the camera." [...] Principal animation for the film began in 2000 with roughly 350 crew members working on it. In 2002, Roy Conli estimated that there were around 1,027 crew members listed in the screen credits with [...] "about four hundred artists and computer artists, about a hundred and fifty musicians and another two hundred technologists".|$|E
500|$|On December 12, 2006, the Texas Rangers signed Lofton to {{a one-year}} contract. By signing with the Rangers, Lofton tied Todd Zeile for most teams played {{for by a}} {{position}} player. In 84 games with the Rangers, he hit [...]303 with 16 doubles. On July 27, 2007, Lofton was traded by the Rangers to the Indians in exchange for minor league catcher Max Ramírez. [...] "That's my biggest thing right now. I'm {{trying to get a}} World Series ring", Lofton said on joining the Indians {{for the third time in}} his career. The Jacobs Field crowd greeted Lofton with a standing ovation during his first at bat for this tour of duty with the Indians. Lofton noted, [...] "I missed being in Cleveland... I enjoy Cleveland. It's the city that got me going." [...] In Game One of the 2007 ALDS against the Yankees, he went 3-for-4 with four RBIs and one stolen base, which tied him with Rickey Henderson for the MLB's all-time postseason stolen bases record (33). In Game Two, he went 2-for-3 with two walks and scored the winning run in the 11th inning. Then, in Game Three of the 2007 ALCS, the 40-year-old Lofton hit a two-run home run against the Boston Red Sox' Daisuke Matsuzaka, becoming the seventh-oldest player to hit a post-season home run. Lofton earned his 34th career postseason stolen base in Game Four of the 2007 ALCS, setting a new MLB record for playoff steals. The Indians, who at one point had a 31 game lead over the Red Sox, eventually lost the series. Lofton became a free agent at the end of the season but did not sign a contract with a major league team. He expressed interest in playing before the 2009 season. From 2002 to 2007, Lofton played for eight teams and made it to the postseason with four of them. Joe Torre said, after Lofton had been to the playoffs in 11 of the past 13 seasons and played for 11 clubs in his career, [...] "He bounced <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of clubs for a reason: They felt he could help them. He did a hell of a job." [...] As Rollie Fingers wrote, [...] "On one hand, Lofton could be seen as a catalyst who magically sparked his teams into playoff contention, but others could say that it was simply a case of top playoff contenders repeatedly seeing him as the final piece of their puzzle." ...|$|E
