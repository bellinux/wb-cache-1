25|$|The MVFugroSupporter and MVHavila Harmony were {{equipped}} with a Kongsberg HUGIN4500 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which carried the same instruments as the towfish deployed by the other vessels. Unlike the towfish, the AUVs were self-propelled and could manoeuvre themselves to maintain a constant altitude above the seafloor. When launched, the torpedo-shaped AUV dived to the proper altitude, then followed a pre-programmed search pattern for up to 24 hours, collecting sonar data for up to 24hours; when the mission was complete, the AUV surfaced and was recovered by the vessel, where the data was downloaded and the batteries were swapped for the next mission. The AUVs were used to scan areas {{which could not be}} effectively searched by the towfish on the other three vessels.

40|$|Auroral {{displays}} in the noon sector were examined by using hundreds of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program auroral images, {{taken over the}} southern polar region in <b>austral</b> <b>winters,</b> {{in order to determine}} the morphology. The auroral {{displays in}} the midday part of the auroral oval can be grouped into five characteristic types, depending on the geomagnetic activity and the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field. An important characteristic is the clear disconnection in appearance between the noonside and the nightside discrete auroras. Also, there is the lack of correlation between the concurrent nightside substorm activity and midday discrete auroral activity. Thus, the occurrence of bright, discrete auroras in the midday oval may be caused by the local injection of the magnetosheath plasma into the dayside boundary layer. The observed discontinuity of discrete auroras between the dayside and the nightside ovals is consistent with the existence of two separated major injection regions along the auroral oval: the dayside cusp and the nightside plasma sheet...|$|R

This hypothesis grew from the supposition that breeding colonies in the WAP during summer are located adjacent to areas of complex bathymetry where circulation and upwelling processes appear to ensure predictable food resources. Therefore, we tested the additional hypothesis that these areas continue to contribute to the foraging strategy of this species throughout the non-breeding winter season.

40|$|Reconstructions {{of climate}} from marine sediment(1) and ice(2) cores {{show that the}} {{amplitude}} of glacial-interglacial climate cycles increased substantially after the Mid-Brunhes Event(3), about 430, 000 years ago. Interglacial periods before the event seem to be characterized by larger continental ice sheets, lower sea level(4, 5), cooler temperatures in Antarctica 2 and lower atmospheric CO 2 concentrations(6), relative to the more recent interglacials. Here we use an Earth system model of intermediate complexity to assess the contributions of insolation and greenhouse-gas concentrations to the climate associated with the peaks of all the interglacials over the past 800, 000 years. Our simulations recreate the expected warmer interglacials after the Mid-Brunhes Event and suggest that later interglacials are warmer primarily because of increased global mean temperatures during Northern Hemisphere winters. This warmth arises from increased insolation during this season, relative to the interglacials that preceded the Mid-Brunhes Event, in conjunction with increased atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations.
