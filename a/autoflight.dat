50|$|US Summary Comments on Draft Final Report of Aircraft Accident Flash Airlines flight 604, Boeing 737-300, SU-ZCF 3 January 2004, Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.Quote {{from page}} 5 of 7:"Distraction. A {{few seconds before}} the captain called for the {{autopilot}} to be engaged, the aircraft's pitch began increasing and airspeed began decreasing. These deviations continued {{during and after the}} autopilot engagement/disengagement sequence. The captain ultimately allowed the airspeed to decrease to 35 knots below his commanded target airspeed of 220 knots and the climb pitch to reach 22°, which is 10° more than the standard climb pitch of about 12°. During this time, the captain also allowed the aircraft to enter a gradually steepening right bank, which was inconsistent with the flight crew's departure clearance to perform a climbing left turn. These pitch, airspeed and bank angle deviations indicated that the captain directed his attention away from monitoring the attitude indications during and after the autopilot disengagement process.Changes in the <b>autoflight</b> system's mode status offer the best explanation for the captain's distraction. The following changes occurred in the <b>autoflight</b> system's mode status shortly before the initiation of the right roll: (1) manual engagement of the autopilot, (2) automatic transition of roll guidance from heading select to control wheel steering-roll (CWS-R), (3) manual disengagement of the autopilot, and (4) manual reengagement of heading select for roll guidance. The transition to the CWS-R mode occurred in accordance with nominal system operation because the captain was not closely following the flight director guidance {{at the time of the}} autopilot engagement. The captain might not have expected the transition, and he might not have understood why it occurred. The captain was probably referring to the mode change from command mode to CWS-R when he stated, “see what the aircraft did?,” shortly after it occurred. The available evidence indicates that the unexpected mode change and the flight crew’s subsequent focus of attention on reestablishing roll guidance for the <b>autoflight</b> system were the most likely reasons for the captain’s distraction from monitoring the attitude".|$|E
50|$|On 22 March 2010, Aviastar-TU Flight 1906, a Tupolev Tu-204 (RA-64011) {{crashed on}} {{approach}} to Moscow Domodedovo International Airport.

Prediction algorithms are used to extrapolate {{the current state of the}} aircraft based on flight management, autopilot and autothrottle system control laws and knowledge of mode transition logic. The resulting predicted trajectory represents the future four-dimensional flight path of the aircraft if the current course of action is continued. Probabilistic methods are used to estimate the trim envelope through high-fidelity model-based computation of attainable equilibrium sets. The corresponding maneuverability limitations of the aircraft are determined through a robust reachability analysis (relative to the trim envelope) through an optimal control formulation. The combination of prediction and assessment technologies are used to trigger timely alerts to avoid loss of control situations. The maneuvering envelope limits are also indicated on the primary flight display, and the predicted trajectory is displayed on navigation and vertical situation displays. The display features and alerts were evaluated in the Advanced Concepts Flight Simulator at NASA Ames Research Center, where commercial airline crews flew multiple problematic approach and landings scenarios to investigate the impact on current and future aircraft energy state awareness.

40|$|Conceptual {{models are}} one of many {{resources}} available to pilots for {{making sense of the}} flight environment. In this paper we describe the conceptual models a pilot uses, in interviews, to explicate his encounter with a mountain wave while flying an Airbus airplane on the line. In the discourse four models emerge: mountain wave, thrust to control speed, pitch to control speed, and climb-descend to control speed. The models he utilizes in his descriptions have a different conceptual structure from models presented in training materials. The analysis suggests that the pilot's conceptual models have an operational organization, and this structure is somehow adapted for managing specific flight situations. Keywords Conceptual models, <b>autoflight,</b> flight training As part of an on-going study of the cognitive consequences of flight deck automation we are attempting to track the development of pilots' conceptual models of <b>autoflight</b> system operation through their flying careers. It is important to understand the structure of conceptual models pilots actually use because these models, unlike engineering models, are very likely to be adapted to the conditions of use on the line. Differences between the models that are provided in training and the models that are used on the line may indicate that the organization of the models provided in training are somehow not fitted to or adapted to use on the line.

Simulations as well as flight tests have shown that more accurate flight path changes are achieved by this addition.

40|$|Past {{flight deck}} design {{practices}} used within the U. S. commercial transport aircraft industry have been highly successful in producing safe and efficient aircraft.

40|$|Task-analytic models {{structure}} {{essential information}} about operator interaction with complex systems, {{in this case}} pilot interaction with the <b>autoflight</b> system. Such models serve two purposes: (1) they allow researchers and practitioners to understand pilots' actions; and (2) they provide a compact, computational representation needed to design 'intelligent' aids, e. g., displays, assistants, and training systems. This paper demonstrates {{the use of the}} operator function model to trace the process of mode engagements while a pilot is controlling an aircraft via the, <b>autoflight</b> system. The operator function model is a normative and nondeterministic model of how a well-trained, well-motivated operator manages multiple concurrent activities for effective real-time control. For each function, the model links the pilot's actions with the required information. Using the operator function model, this paper describes several mode engagement scenarios. These scenarios were observed and documented during a field study that focused on mode engagements and mode transitions during normal line operations. Data including time, ATC clearances, altitude, system states, and active modes and sub-modes, engagement of modes, were recorded during sixty-six flights. Using these data, seven prototypical mode engagement scenarios were extracted. One scenario details the decision of the crew to disengage a fully automatic mode in favor of a semi-automatic mode, and the consequences of this action. Another describes a mode error involving updating aircraft speed following the engagement of a speed submode. Other scenarios detail mode confusion at various phases of the flight. This analysis uses the operator function model to identify three aspects of mode engagement: (1) the progress of pilot-aircraft-autoflight system interaction; (2) control/display information required to perform mode management activities; and (3) the potential cause(s) of mode confusion. The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to demonstrate the use of the operator functio model methodology to describe pilot-system interaction while engaging modes And monitoring the system, and (2) to initiate a discussion of how task-analytic models might inform design processes. While the operator function model is only one type of task-analytic representation, the hypothesis of this paper is that some type of task analytic structure is a prerequisite for the design of effective human-automation interaction...|$|E

The narratives of 10 pilot reports of errors made in the automation-assisted altitude-change task are used to illustrate some of the issues of pilots interacting with automatic systems. These narratives are then used to construct a description of the cockpit as an information processing system.

40|$|Current {{advanced}} commercial transport aircraft, {{such as the}} Boeing B 777 /B 747 - 400, the Airbus A 320 /A 340 and the McDonnell Douglas MD- 11, rely on <b>AutoFlight</b> Systems (AFS) {{for flight}} management, navigation and inner loop control. These systems have evolved from straightforward autopilots into multiple computers capable of sophisticated and interrelated tasks. These tasks span the range from high level flight management to low level inner loop control. In addition, these systems provide envelope protection to prevent pilots from committing mistakes such as stalling the aircraft or lowering flaps at high speeds. Unfortunately, as these systems have become more complex and interconnected, {{a new class of}} problems has developed associated with pilots’ interaction with the automation. Many incidents have been reported where there exists some confusion between the pilots’ expectations of the AFS and what the system is actually doing (Corwin, 1995).

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} to closeout a NASA grant to Mississippi State University (MSU) for research into situation awareness (SA) and automation in the advanced commercial aircraft cockpit. The grant was divided into two obligations including $ 60, 000 for the period from May 11, 2000 to December 25, 2000. The information presented in this report summarizes work completed through this obligation. It also details work to be completed with {{the balance of the}} current obligation and unobligated funds amounting to $ 50, 043, which are to be granted to North Carolina State University for completion of the research project from July 31, 2000 to May 10, 2001. This research was to involve investigation of a broad spectrum of degrees of automation of complex systems on human-machine performance and SA. The work was to empirically assess the effect of theoretical levels of automation (LOAs) described in a taxonomy developed by Endsley & Kaber (1999) on naive and experienced subject performance and SA in simulated flight tasks. The study was to be conducted {{in the context of a}} realistic simulation of aircraft flight control. The objective of this work was to identify LOAs that effectively integrate humans and machines under normal operating conditions and failure modes. In general, the work was to provide insight into the design of automation in the commercial aircraft cockpit. Both laboratory and field investigations were to be conducted. At this point in time, a high-fidelity flight simulator of the McDonald Douglas (MD) 11 aircraft has been completed. The simulator integrates a reconfigurable flight simulator developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology and stand-alone simulations of MD- 11 <b>autoflight</b> systems developed at MSU. Use of the simulator has been integrated into a study plan for the laboratory research and it is expected that the simulator will also be used in the field study with actual commercial pilots. In addition to the flight simulator, an electronic version of the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) has been completed for measuring commercial pilot SA in flight tasks. The SAGAT is to be used in both the lab and field studies. Finally, the lab study has been designed and subjects have been recruited for participation in experiments. This study will investigate the effects of five levels of automation, described in Endsley & Kaber's (1999) taxonomy and applied to the MD- 11 <b>autoflight</b> system, on private pilot performance and SA in basic flight tasks by using the MD- 11 simulator. The field study remains to be planned and executed...|$|E
