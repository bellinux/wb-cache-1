After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Qualitative interviews with 40 <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> {{based in the}} UK. The interviews cover why they became au pairs; what their working routine is like; their relationships with their host families and their future plans. Interviews range in length from 20 minutes to c. 1. 5 hours. Project description: This project investigates the lives of <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> and host families in the UK. <b>Au</b> <b>pairs</b> are now depended upon by thousands of British households to provide childcare and help with housework and {{there is evidence that}} <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> are now less distinguishable from other domestic workers. However, <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> are not protected by employment law. They have no right to a minimum wage, nor defined maximum working hours nor a right to holidays. The project aims are: to investigate the effects of changes to recent UK immigration legislation on the supply of <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> within the UK to examine the place of <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> in the life and work trajectories of <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> to evaluate the subjective experience of <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> to examine understandings of <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> within host families’ narratives of (good) parenting. The project uses four methods: an on-line survey and analysis of existing data to provide an overview of {{the nature and extent of}} <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> in the UK; in-depth interviews with <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> to explore their experiences; interviews with host families to uncover how <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> to fits with their identity as parents and interviews with key informants to provide context...|$|R

On {{the beach}} on Lake Geneva, he met Gweneth Howarth, who was from Ripponden, Yorkshire, {{and working in}} Switzerland as an <b>au</b> <b>pair.</b> Feynman's love life had been turbulent since his divorce; his previous girlfriend had walked off with his Albert Einstein Award medal and, {{on the advice of}} an earlier girlfriend, had feigned pregnancy and blackmailed him into paying for an abortion, then used the money to buy furniture. When Feynman found that Howarth was being paid only $25 a month, he offered her $20 a week to be his live-in maid. That this sort of behavior was illegal was not overlooked; Feynman had a friend, Matthew Sands, act as her sponsor. Howarth pointed out that she already had two boyfriends, but eventually decided to take Feynman up on his offer, and arrived in Altadena, California, in June 1959. She made a point of dating other men but Feynman proposed in the spring of 1960. They were married on September 24, 1960, at the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. They had a son, Carl, in 1962, and adopted a daughter, Michelle, in 1968. Besides their home in Altadena, they had a beach house in Baja California, purchased with the money from Feynman's Nobel Prize.|$|E
