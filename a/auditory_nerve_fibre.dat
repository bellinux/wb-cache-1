40|$|We propose several {{modifications}} to an existing computational model of stochastic vesicle release in inner hair cell ribbon synapses, {{with the aim}} of producing simulated <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibre</b> spiking data that more closely matches empirical data. Specifically, we studied the inter-spike-interval (ISI) distribution, and long and short term ISI correlations in spontaneous spiking in post-synaptic auditory nerve fibres. We introduced short term plasticity to the pre-synaptic release probability, in a manner analogous to standard stochastic models of cortical short term synaptic depression. This modification resulted in a similar distribution of vesicle release intervals to that estimated from empirical data. We also introduced a biophysical stochastic model of calcium channel opening and closing, but showed that this model is insufficient for generating a match with empirically observed spike correlations. However, by combining a phenomenological model of channel noise and our short term depression model, we generated short and long term correlations in auditory nerve spontaneous activity that qualitatively match empirical data...|$|E
40|$|Neural spike {{trains are}} {{commonly}} {{characterized as a}} Poisson point process. However, the Poisson assumption is a poor model for spiking in auditory nerve fibres because {{it is known that}} interspike intervals display positive correlation over long time scales and negative correlation over shorter time scales. We have therefore developed a biophysical model based on the well-known Meddis model of the peripheral auditory system, to produce simulated <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibre</b> spiking statistics that more closely match the firing correlations observed in empirical data. We achieve this by introducing biophysically realistic ion channel noise to an inner hair cell membrane potential model that includes fractal fast potassium channels and deterministic slow potassium channels. We succeed in producing simulated spike train statistics that match empirically observed firing correlations. Our model thus replicates macro-scale stochastic spiking statistics in the auditory nerve fibres due to modeling stochasticity at the micro-scale of potassium channels.

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{whether the}} Hodgkin-Huxley model for unmyelinated nerve fibres {{could be more}} comprehensively modified to predict excitation behaviour at Ranvier nodes of a human sensory nerve fibre, as specifically applied {{to the prediction of}} temporal characteristics of the human auditory system. The model was developed in three phases. Firstly, the Hodgkin-Huxley model was modified to describe action potential dynamics at Ranvier nodes using recorded ionic membrane current data from single human myelinated peripheral nerve fibres. A nerve fibre cable model, based on a combination of two existing models, was subsequently developed using human sensory nerve fibre morphometric data. Lastly the morphological parameters of the nerve fibre model were changed to resemble a Type I peripheral <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibre</b> and coupled to a volume-conduction model of the cochlea. This study is the first to show that the Hodgkin-Huxley model equations can be modified successfully to predict excitation behaviour of a generalised human peripheral sensory nerve fibre without using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equations. The model includes a more comprehensive establishment of temperature dependence of the physiological and electrical parameters compared to existing models. Two versions of the human Type I <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibre</b> model were developed, one simulating an undamaged (non-degenerate) fibre and another a damaged (degenerate) fibre. Comparison between predicted and measured results indicated similar transient and persistent sodium, as well as slow potassium ionic membrane currents to those found in generalised sensory nerve fibres. Results confirm that chronaxie, rheobase current, mean latency, threshold and relative refractive periods depend on the amount of degeneracy of fibres. The model could account for threshold differences observed between different asymmetric waveforms. The combination of persistent sodium and slow potassium ionic membrane currents could in part predict non-monotonic excitation behaviour observed experimentally. A simplified method was developed to calculate electrically evoked compound action potential responses following neural excitation. It provided a computationally effective way to obtain an estimate of profile widths from the output of models that calculate neural excitation profiles, and an indirect way to estimate stimulus attenuation by calculating the value of the parameter that produces the best fit to experimental data. Results also confirmed that electrode arrays located closer to the modiolus produce more focussed neural excitation spread than more laterally located arrays.

40|$|The {{relation}} between the endocochlear potential and spontaneous discharge rate in <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibres</b> was determined following intravenous injections of furosemide in anaesthetized cats. Following furosemide administration, both the endocochlear potential and the spontaneous discharge rates of <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibres</b> decreased synchronously. The logarithm of the spontaneous discharge rate was proportional to the endocochlear potential. The slope of the logarithmic relation increased {{as a function of}} the characteristic frequency of the fibre. The slope of the logarithmic relation is steeper for fibres with 'medium' spontaneous discharge rates (0. 5 - 12 spikes/s) than for fibres with 'high' spontaneous discharge rates (greater than 18 spikes/s). Among high spontaneous rate fibres, the slope does not appear to vary systematically with the spontaneous rate of the fibre. The decrease in spontaneous discharge rate in <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibres</b> is interpreted as follows: (1) the injection of furosemide causes a decrease in the endocochlear potential, (2) a decrease in the endocochlear potential produces a linearly related hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of the hair cell by altering the standing current which flows through the transducer membrane, and (3) the logarithm of the rate of release of transmitter quanta decreases with the hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of the hair cell, which decreases the rate of occurrence of action potentials at the hair cell afferent junction...|$|R

40|$|Our {{auditory}} {{system is}} capable of perceiving the azimuthal location of a low frequency sound source with a precision of a few degrees. This requires the auditory system to detect time differences in sound arrival between the two ears down to tens of microseconds. The detection of these interaural time differences relies on network computation by auditory brainstem neurons sharpening the temporal precision of the afferent signals. Nevertheless, the system requires the hair cell synapse to encode sound with the highest possible temporal acuity. In mammals, each <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibre</b> receives input from only one inner hair cell (IHC) synapse. Hence, this single synapse determines the temporal precision of the fibre.

40|$|The study {{presents}} {{the development of}} an alternative noise current term and novel voltage dependent current noise algorithm for conductance based stochastic <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibre</b> (ANF) models. ANFs are known to have significant variance in threshold stimulus which affects temporal characteristics such as latency. This variance is primarily caused by the stochastic behaviour or microscopic fluctuations of the node of Ranvier’s voltage dependent sodium channels of which the intensity is a function of membrane voltage. Though easy to implement and low in computational cost, existing current noise models have two deficiencies: it is independent of membrane voltage and it is unable to inherently determine the noise intensity required to produce in vivo measured discharge probability functions. The proposed algorithm overcomes these deficiencies whilst maintaining its low computational cost and ease of implementation compared to other conductance and Markovian based stochastic models. The algorithm is applied to a Hodgkin-Huxley based compartmental cat ANF model and validated via comparison of the threshold probability and latency distributions to measured cat ANF data. Simulation results show the algorithm’s adherence to in vivo stochastic fibre characteristics such as an exponential relationship between the membrane noise and transmembrane voltage, a negative linear relationship between the log of the relative spread of the discharge probability and the log of the fibre diameter and a decrease in latency with an increase in stimulus intensity.

40|$|Problem summary The {{auditory}} {{system has}} to represent sound across 6 orders of magnitude of sound pressure (120 dB). At present we only partly understand how the system is able to function so well across this range. One mechanism {{to deal with this}} is compression in the cochlea. The passive mechanical filtering properties of the basilar membrane are modified by an active process which amplifies very quiet sounds. Gain decreases very rapidly with sound pressure level such that a doubling in level might only lead to a 10 % increase in the amplitude of vibration on the basilar membrane. Thus {{at the level of the}} cochlear there exists a mechanism which increases the dynamic range of the cochlea by at least 60 dB at some frequencies. A common source of hearing deficit is damage to this active mechanism, which produces a raise in thresholds but also a reduction in the dynamic range of the system such that whilst quiet sounds are much quieter, loud sounds are just as loud. In the brain, problems remain in the representation of broadband spectra. The majority (70 %) of auditory nerve (AN) fibres are highly sensitive and have a dynamic range which only changes in firing rate at very low levels. The dynamic range of the firing rate of these neurons can be as little as 15 dB. Thus at normal signal levels (> 60 dB SPL) almost all auditory nerve fibres are firing at their saturated rate. Recordings of the <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibre</b> responses to steady state vowels confirm that the representation of spectrum in auditory nerve fibres varies with level and is highly degraded at high sound levels.

40|$|Exposure to loud sound affects hair cells, the {{auditory}} nerve or central processing {{in the brain}} thereby producing sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This thesis aims to determine biomarkers of SNHL in rodents at the early stages (five days) after acoustic over exposure (AOE). Biomarkers of SNHL were characterized in the cochlea and in the cochlear nucleus, the first relay of the central auditory pathway integrating auditory and non-auditory projections. Wistar rats were here exposed for 6 hours to a loud (100 dB SPL) single tone (15 kHz). After five days, auditory brainstem response recordings showed increased hearing thresholds for frequencies exceeding 15 kHz. Electron microscopy performed at a similar time post AOE, showed a decreased number of myelinated auditory nerve fibres within the cochlea and a proportional increase {{of the number of}} cochlear unmyelinated auditory nerve fibres. Auditory nerve fibres project to the cochlear nuclei and after AOE, the central portion of {{the auditory}} nerve was characterized by a decreased diameter of its myelin sheath and a delocalization of Kv potassium channel subunits along nodal regions. Previous studies have shown that <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibre</b> terminals and non-auditory projections are characterized by VGLUT- 1 and VGLUT- 2 vesicular glutamate transporters respectively. Acoustic over-exposure led to a decreased expression of VGLUT- 1 and an increased expression of VGLUT- 2 transporters probably reflecting the auditory deficit and its compensation by non auditory projections respectively. The vestibular system relays information about the position of the head and the dorsal cochlear nucleus is involved in processing the localisation of sound in the vertical plane. The study demonstrates the presence of VGLUT- 2 positive projections from the lateral vestibular nucleus to the dorsal cochlear nucleus. After AOE, the up-regulation of those VGLUT- 2 vestibular projections suggests the involvement of vestibular compensation for the loss of VGLUT- 1 mediated auditory inputs during SNHL. In summary, myelin and VGLUT transporters consist of biomarkers which could be acted upon during the early stages of SNHL following exposure to loud sound...|$|E

This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} the publisher. The psychophysics of multiple-channel electrical stimulation of residual <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibres</b> has been studied in two postlingually deaf patients with total hearing losses, and the information used to design a speech processing strategy that enables them to understand connected speech in everyday situations when used in conjunction with lipreading. A constant rate of stimulation of different groups of <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibres</b> produced different pitch sensations which could be scaled from low to high, and this was consistent with the place theory of frequency coding. The me patients were also able to associate the different percepts produced by each electrode with different vowel colours and sharpnesses. In addition, the patient reported that pitch increased with pulse rate and loudness increased with current level. A speech processing strategy was developed whereby the parameters for voicing determine the rate of stimulation for all electrodes, and the parameters for the dominant spectral peak in the mid-frequency range determine the site of electrode stimulation and current level. 25 - 27 August 1980 Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} network model of neurons of the cochlear nucleus to explore leveldependent processing by T stellate cells. These cells selectively process input from {{two types of}} <b>auditory</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>fibres</b> to enhance their dynamic range. We use a biologically plausible network between T stellate, D stellate and tuberculoventral cells, to show how level-dependent selective processing {{can be used to}} recreate rate-level curves seen in vivo and encode the spectrum of the vowel /ε/. The compartmental models include recently formulated current models of ventral cochlear nucleus cells to give greater accuracy of cell spiking behaviour. 1...|$|R
