40|$|Water {{is by far}} {{our most}} {{important}} natural resource needed to sustain all forms of life on our planet. Today we face depletion and increased scarcity of this precious resource. At {{the same time there}} is also a rapid urbanization process going on, - in particular in developing nations. This will put an unprecedented pressure upon the urban water service providers (water utilities) to supply enough hygienically safe water for their customers. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are no exception to this general trend. Water losses occur to different degrees in all water supply systems. In developing countries it is not uncommon that half of the water invested in through production and distribution is lost through different types of wastage. There is however methods and techniques that can be applied to reduce the waste of drinking water. This thesis analyses, through an extensive literature review, some of the methods applied on the demand side. As opposed to supply side management that concentrates on major infrastructural investments, the demand side management develops strategies to improve and optimize existing water resources and infrastructure. The term for these strategies applied to Pacific water service providers are Water Loss Management (WLM). WLM could potentially contribute significantly to meet the millennium development goal 7 (specifically target 7 c) for the given country. WLM strategies are known to be data intensive, but many service providers in SIDS do not have an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to give a reasonable idea of “what water goes where”. The goal of this research is to find ways to optimize water supply in small urban services in Pacific Island Countries (PIC). It is believed that the most crucial step, from having very little overview to having an improved overview on the supply system, is achievable by starting up WLM initiatives whilst data needs are identified and strategies are implemented to deliver these needs. Based on the literature review WLM initiatives were implemented and are presented as three different practical examples. Field observations and analysis of the examples emphasizes the understanding of the baseline situation as a critical first step in moving towards an effective WLM program. Suggested strategies and the identification of key factors that influence the implementation of WLM initiatives in PIC are explained...|$|E
40|$|Automatic Programming Assessment (APA) {{has been}} known as a method used to {{automatically}} mark and grade students’ programming solutions. In order to realise APA as a tangible deliverable, a number of automated tools which are called Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APAS) have been developed and tested for decades. Basically, the need for decreasing the load of work among lecturers, timely feedback to students and accuracy on the grading results are the common reasons that motivate the need for APAS. In order {{to carry out a}} dynamic testing in APA, it is necessary to prepare an appropriate and <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> test <b>data</b> to judge the correctness quality of students’ programming solutions in terms of the aspects of functional and/or structural testing. Manual preparation <b>of</b> quality test <b>data</b> becomes a hard, time consuming, and feasible task in the practice of both software testing and APA. Thus, the generation <b>of</b> automated test <b>data</b> is highly desirable to alleviate the humans’ burden from performing repetitive tasks. This paper aims to describe the design, implementation and user experience when evaluating a tool developed to support APA as a test data generator that is called FaSt-generator. The tool plays an important role to furnish a test set that includes an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> test <b>data</b> to execute both the functional and structural testing in APA. Results collected from the conducted user experience evaluation using FaSt-generator reveal that all the subjects had relatively positive opinions and greatly favour the criteria of User Perception and End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) ...|$|R

For such models to produce reliable muscle and joint force estimations, an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> musculo-skeletal <b>data</b> is necessary. In this study, we present a complete and coherent dataset for the lumbar spine, based on medical images and dissection measurements from one embalmed human cadaver. We divided muscles into muscle-tendon elements, digitized their attachments at the bones and measured morphological parameters. In total, we measured 11 muscles from one body side, using 96 elements. For every muscle element, we measured three-dimensional coordinates of its attachments, fiber length, tendon length, sarcomere length, optimal fiber length, pennation angle, mass, and physiological cross-sectional area together with the geometry of the lumbar spine. Results were consistent with other anatomical studies and included new data for the serratus posterior inferior muscle. The dataset {{presented in this paper}} enables a complete and coherent musculo-skeletal model for the lumbar spine and will improve the current state-of-the art in predicting spinal loading...|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} programming assessment (APA) method aims to support marking and grading of students’ programming exercises. APA requires a test data generation {{to perform a}} dynamic testing on students’ programs. In software testing field, diverse automated methods for test data generation are proposed. Unfortunately, APA seldom adopts these methods. Merely limited studies have attempted to integrate APA and test data generation to include more useful features {{and to provide a}} precise and thorough quality of program testing coverage. Thus, we propose a test data generation approach to cover both the functional and structural testing of a program for APA by focusing the structural testing in this paper. We design a test set based on the integration of positive and negative testing criteria that enhanced path coverage criterion to select the desired test data. It supports lecturers of programming courses to furnish an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> test <b>data</b> to assess students’ programming solutions in term of structural testing without necessarily having the expertise in a particular knowledge of test cases. The findings from the experiment depict that the test set improves the criteria of reliability and validity for test data adequacy in programming assessments...|$|R

40|$|Automatic Programming Assessment (or APA) has {{recently}} become a notable method in assisting educators of programming courses to automatically assess and grade students’ programming exercises as its counterpart; the typical manual tasks {{are prone to}} errors and lead to inconsistency. Practically, this method also provides an alternative means of reducing the educators’ workload effectively. By default, test data generation process {{plays an important role}} to perform a dynamic testing on students’ programs. Dynamic testing involves the execution of a program against different inputs or test data and the comparison of the results with the expected output, which must conform to the program specifications. In the software testing field, there have been diverse automated methods for test data generation. Unfortunately, APA rarely adopts these methods. Limited studies have attempted to integrate APA and test data generation to include more useful features and to provide a precise and thorough quality program testing. Thus, we propose a framework <b>of</b> test <b>data</b> generation known as FaSt-Gen covering both the functional and structural testing of a program for APA. Functional testing is a testing that relies on specified functional requirements and focuses the output generated in response to the selected test data and execution, Meanwhile, structural testing looks at the specific program logic to verify how it works. Overall, FaSt-Gen contributes as a means to educators of programming courses to furnish an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> test <b>data</b> to assess students’ programming solutions regardless of having the optimal expertise in the particular knowledge of test cases design. FaSt-Gen integrates the positive and negative testing criteria or so-called reliable and valid test adequacy criteria to derive desired test data and test set schema. As for the functional testing, the integration of specification-derived test and simplified boundary value analysis techniques covering both the criteria. Path coverage criterion guides the test data selection for structural testing. The findings from the conducted controlled experiment and comparative study evaluation show that FaSt-Gen improves the reliability and validity <b>of</b> test <b>data</b> adequacy in programming assessments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{predicate}} abstraction, exact image computation is problematic, requiring in {{the worst}} case an exponential number of calls to a decision procedure. For this reason, software model checkers typically use a weak approximation of the image. This {{can result in a}} failure to prove a property, even given an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> predicates. We present an interpolant-based method for strengthening the abstract transition relation in case of such failures. This approach guarantees convergence given an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> predicates, without requiring an exact image computation. We show empirically that the method converges more rapidly than an earlier method based on counterexample analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{continue}} the study <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> <b>sets</b> which we began in [2] by introducing the idea <b>of</b> a strongly <b>adequate</b> <b>set,</b> {{which has an}} additional requirement on the overlap of two models past their comparison point. We present a forcing poset for adding a club to a fat stationary subset of ω 2 with finite conditions, thereby showing that {{a version of the}} forcing posets of Friedman [1] and Mitchell [3] for adding a club on ω 2 can be developed in the context <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> <b>sets.</b> The idea <b>of</b> an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> models was introduced by the author in [2]. Roughly speaking, an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> is a <b>set</b> consisting <b>of</b> countable models which are pairwise membership comparable below a particular ordinal called their comparison point. The relevance of the comparison point is that the two models have only a finite overlap past this ordinal. We presented a general framework in [2] for using <b>adequate</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> models as side conditions in forcing on ω 2 with finite conditions. Examples of forcings which fit into this framework include adding a generic function on ω 2, forcing a nonreflecting stationary subset of ω 2 ∩ cof(ω), and adding an ω 1...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that an ecqlogical interface for a simulated pasteurization plant leads to most effective failure diagnosis pe?formance only if the interface is supported by an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> sensors.

Results provide some support for the idea that when the interface is supported by an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> sensors, an ecological interface produces less between-subjects variability in the values of higher-order state variables, but more between-subjects variability in the number of control actions taken. We interpret these findings to indicate that when goals and higher-order properties of a system are revealed through effective interface design, the degrees of freedom for action at lower levels are more fullv exuloited, which is all the better to achieve the higher-order purposes of control.,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} the idea <b>of</b> a coherent <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> models, {{which can be}} used as side conditions in forcing. As an application we define a forcing poset which adds a square sequence on ω 2 using finite conditions. In previous work [3] we introduced the idea <b>of</b> an <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> models and showed how to use <b>adequate</b> <b>sets</b> as side conditions in forcing with finite conditions. We gave several examples <b>of</b> forcing with <b>adequate</b> <b>sets,</b> including forcing posets for adding a generic function on ω 2, adding a nonreflecting stationary subset of ω 2, adding a Kurepa tree on ω 1, and in [4] adding a club to a fat stationary subset of ω 2. The main result of the present paper is to define a forcing poset using <b>adequate</b> <b>sets</b> which adds a ω 1 -sequence. The idea of using models as side conditions in forcing goes back to Todorčević [6], where the method was applied to add generic objects of size ω 1 with finite approximations. In the original context of applications of PFA, the preservation of ω 2 was not necessary. To preserve ω 2, Todorčevic ́ introduced the requirement of a system of isomorphisms on the models in a condition...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecommender systems aim at {{suggesting}} {{items to}} users that fit their preferences. Collaborative filtering {{is one of}} the most popular approaches of recommender systems; it exploits users' ratings to express preferences. Traditional approaches of collaborative filtering suffer from the cold-start problem: when a new item enters the system, it cannot be recommended while a sufficiently high number of users have rated it. The quantity of required ratings is not known a priori and may be high as it depends on who rates the items. In this chapter, we propose to automatically select the <b>adequate</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> users in the network of users to address the cold-start problem. We call them the "delegates", and they correspond to those who should rate a new item first so as to reliably deduce the ratings of other users on this item.
