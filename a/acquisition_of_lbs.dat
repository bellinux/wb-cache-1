40|$|Advanced optical {{instruments}} {{are useful for}} analysis and manipulation of individual living cells and their internal structures. We have employed Raman microspectroscopic analysis for assessment of algal lipid body (LB) volume in vivo. Some algae contain β-carotene in high amounts in their LBs, including strains which are considered useful in biotechnology for lipid and pigment production. We have detected proportionality between the Raman vibrations of β-carotene and the LB volume. This finding may allow fast <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> volume approximation valuable e. g. for Raman microspectroscopy assisted cell sorting. We combine optical manipulation and analysis on a microfluidic platform {{in order to achieve}} fast, effective, and non-invasive sorting based on spectroscopic features of the individual living cells. The resultant apparatus could find its use in demanding biotechnological applications such as selection of rare natural mutants or artificially modified cells resulting from genetic manipulations...|$|R
40|$|LB 80380, a dipivoxil ester prodrug <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80331 (metabolite, LB 80317), {{is a novel}} {{antiviral}} {{agent for}} chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80331 /LB 80317 were evaluated in two clinical studies and a study with mice. The clinical studies were dose-escalating pharmacokinetic studies with six healthy subjects per single-dose group and six CHB patients per repeated-dose group. The mouse {{study was designed to}} measure the amounts of the phosphorylated portions <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80331 and LB 80317 in the liver. In healthy subjects receiving a single dose <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80380, the plasma level <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80331 increased as the dose increased. Although a high-fat diet delayed the time to the maximum concentration in plasma (Tmax) <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80331, the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity was similar between the subjects in the fasted group and those in the group who consumed a high-fat diet. In CHB patients, the mean Tmax <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80331 was 1. 0 to 2. 0 h postdosing at steady state. The steady-state plasma concentration <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80331 declined in a monoexponential manner, and the apparent elimination half-life was 2. 5 to 3. 3 h. The steady-state plasma concentration <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80317 was maximum at 3 to 8 h postdoing and declined in a monoexponential manner; the apparent elimination half-life was 45 to 62 h at the 30 - to 240 -mg doses, while LB 80317 was measurable in plasma only at higher doses of 120 and 240 mg after the administration of the first dose <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80380. Forty percent of the amount <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80331 /LB 80317 in the mouse liver was detected as the phosphorylated form. In conclusion, LB 80380 is rapidly absorbed and converted to LB 80331. LB 80317 has a long half-life at steady-state, supporting the use of a once-daily dosing regimen. The ingestion of a high-fat diet delays the rate <b>of</b> absorption <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> 80380 without affecting the extent of absorption. Copyright © 2009, American Society for Microbiology.

40|$|Abstract Background Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, {{involved}} in primary graft dysfunction following lung transplantation, leads to inactivation of intra-alveolar surfactant which facilitates injury of the blood-air barrier. The alveolar epithelial type II cells (AE 2 cells) synthesize, store and secrete surfactant; thus, an intracellular surfactant pool stored in lamellar bodies (Lb) {{can be distinguished}} from the intra-alveolar surfactant pool. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate ultrastructural alterations of the intracellular surfactant pool in a model, mimicking transplantation-related procedures including flush perfusion, cold ischemia and reperfusion combined with mechanical ventilation. Methods Using design-based stereology at the light and electron microscopic level, number, surface area and mean volume of AE 2 cells as well as number, size and total volume <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> were determined in a group subjected to transplantation-related procedures including both I/R injury and mechanical ventilation (I/R group) and a control group. Results After I/R injury, the mean number <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> per AE 2 cell was significantly reduced compared to the control group, accompanied by a significant increase in the luminal surface area per AE 2 cell in the I/R group. This increase in the luminal surface area correlated with the decrease in surface area <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> per AE 2. The number-weighted mean volume <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> in the I/R group showed a tendency to increase. Conclusion We suggest that in this animal model the reduction of the number <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> per AE 2 cell is most likely due to stimulated exocytosis <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> into the alveolar space. The loss <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> is partly compensated by an increased size <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> thus maintaining total volume <b>of</b> <b>Lb</b> per AE 2 cell and lung. This mechanism counteracts at least in part the inactivation of the intra-alveolar surfactant. </p...|$|R
40|$|Lyme borreliosis (LB) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} vector-borne disease in Western Europe and Northeastern parts of the USA. The causative agents <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> are spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group, which are transmitted by Ixodes ticks. Since the late 1970 ’s, researchers in the United States and Europe have extensively investigated the clinical manifestations and pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> as well as strategies to prevent B. burgdorferi transmission. The aim of this thesis is to ‘dissect’ three different aspects of LB; namely I) challenging clinical aspects <b>of</b> <b>LB,</b> II) further insights in tick-pathogen-host interactions and III) novel vaccine strategies to prevent <b>LB.</b> The diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> {{is based on a}} history of potential exposure to ticks and the risk of infection with B. burgdorferi, development of specific symptoms, exclusion of other causes, and when appropriate, combined with serological and/or other diagnostic tests. Here we examine the challenges for physicians to establish or exclude the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>LB.</b> Secondly, a better understanding of tick-host-pathogen interactions could contribute {{to our understanding of the}} pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>LB.</b> Here we focus on the interaction between the tick salivary gland protein TSPI and the mammalian immune system. Finally, there is currently no human vaccine available to prevent LB. In this thesis we investigate whether tick gut proteins can be used as vaccines to prevent LB. The data described in this thesis may improve care for patients suspected <b>of</b> <b>LB,</b> increase our understanding <b>of</b> <b>LB</b> pathogenesis and identify new vaccine candidates to prevent LB...|$|R
