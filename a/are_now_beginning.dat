Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E

Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of a 22-member opposition to Alberta's legislature signals {{for the first time}} since 1971 a significant competitive voice to the dominant Conservative Party in that province's voting citizenship. This development and the emergence of the New Democrats as the primary opposition party in Alberta necessitates a reevaluation of Alberta politics, which critics have long labeled as ideologically conservative, anachronistic, and oddly unpredictable. Alberta politics <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to resemble that of Canada's other provinces. The rise of a new, competent opposition is a healthy development in Alberta's politics and will likely contribute positively to Alberta's economic and social well-being, Tupper (1986) argues.|$|E
500|$|However, when Domnall mac Causantín died at Dunnottar in 900, he was {{the first}} man to be {{recorded}} as rí Alban and his kingdom was the nucleus that would expand as Viking and other influences waned. In the tenth century the Alban elite had begun to develop a conquest myth to explain their increasing Gaelicisation at the expense of Pictish culture. Known as MacAlpin's Treason, it describes how Cináed mac Ailpín is supposed to have annihilated the Picts in one fell takeover. However, modern historians <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to reject this conceptualization of Scottish origins. No contemporary sources mention this conquest. Moreover, the Gaelicisation of Pictland was a long process predating Cináed, and is evidenced by Gaelic-speaking Pictish rulers, Pictish royal patronage of Gaelic poets, and Gaelic inscriptions and placenames. The change of identity can perhaps be explained by the death of the Pictish language, but also important may be Causantín II's alleged Scoticisation of the [...] "Pictish" [...] Church and the trauma caused by Viking invasions, most strenuously felt in the Pictish kingdom's heartland of Fortriu.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "New Wave" [...] did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} approval among those who were regarded as part of it. [...] Brian Aldiss, for example, wrote to Judith Merril in 1966 that he suspected the term was [...] "a journalistic invention of yours and Mike Moorcock's", and added [...] "I feel I am {{no part of the}} New Wave; I was here before 'em, and by God I mean to be here after they've gone (still writing bloody science fiction)!" [...] Merril was a key advocate for the New Wave, and popularized it in her anthology England Swings SF, which appeared in 1968; she spent almost a year in London, living near Moorcock, when researching the anthology in 1966–1967. [...] Merril and writer Christopher Priest were among those who used the term [...] "New Wave" [...] to describe the work being done in New Worlds, but Aldiss was not the only writer to object to the term, and it never received a generally accepted definition. [...] Critic Brian Attebery characterizes it as a [...] "disruptive, existentially fraught and formally daring" [...] style; Peter Nicholls hesitates to define it but comments that [...] "perhaps the fundamental element was the belief that sf could and should be taken seriously as literature". [...] In a 1967 interview, Ballard, one of the writers most closely associated with the New Wave, described modern U.S. sf as extrovert and optimistic, and contrasted it with [...] "the new science fiction, that other people apart from myself <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to write", which he saw as [...] "introverted, possibly pessimistic rather than optimistic, much less certain of its own territory." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{light rail}} {{has been a}} {{catalyst}} for both residential and commercial development along the route and has {{played a significant role}} in the revitalization of Hudson County. Many of the stops are sited in vacant or underutilized areas, which <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to see intense residential and mixed-use development. The line running along Essex Street in downtown Jersey City has spawned 3,000 residential units in five years. An [...] tract of land bordering Liberty State Park is being redeveloped into a transit-oriented development known as Liberty Harbor North, which will consist of 6,000 residential units and millions of square feet of commercial space. Two New Urbanism projects in Jersey City, Bayfront and Canal Crossing, are being planned with the expectation that new stations will be built in conjunction with their development. Other developments are either planned or already underway in Hoboken, Union City, Bayonne, and Weehawken, in areas very near to light rail stations.|$|E
2500|$|Another form {{of salmon}} production, which is safer but less controllable, {{is to raise}} salmon in {{hatcheries}} until they {{are old enough to}} become independent. They are then released into rivers, often in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This practice was very common in countries like Sweden before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies, as anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, limiting a company's chances of benefiting financially from their investment. Because of this, the method has mainly been used by various public authorities and non profit groups like the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association as a way of artificially increasing salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to overharvest, construction of dams, and habitat destruction or disruption. Unfortunately, there can be negative consequences to this sort of population manipulation, including genetic [...] "dilution" [...] of the wild stocks, and many jurisdictions <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls and habitat improvement and protection. A variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released where fishermen can then catch them.|$|E
