5|$|Portias' venom {{is unusually}} {{powerful}} against spiders. When a Portia stabs a small to medium spider (up to the Portia′s weight), including another Portia, the prey usually runs <b>away</b> <b>for</b> about 100 to 200millimetres, enters convulsions, becomes paralysed after 10 to 30seconds, and continues convulsing for 10seconds to 4minutes. Portia slowly approaches the prey and takes it. Portia usually needs to inflict up to 15stabbings to completely immobilise a larger spider(1.5 to 2times to the Portia′s weight), and then Portia may wait about 20 to 200millimetres <b>away</b> <b>for</b> 15 to 30minutes from seizing the prey. Insects {{are usually not}} immobilised so quickly but continue to struggle, sometimes for several minutes. If Portia cannot make further contact, all types of prey usually recover, making sluggish movements several minutes after the stabbing but often starting normal movement only after an hour.|$|E

5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them <b>away</b> <b>for</b> their safety.|$|E

5|$|After {{staying for}} a period in Robert's stronghold of Bristol, Matilda {{established}} her court in nearby Gloucester, still safely in the south-west but far enough <b>away</b> <b>for</b> her to remain independent of her half-brother.

Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E

5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller {{late in the}} day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip.

Compton hooked it <b>away</b> <b>for</b> two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E

Bonnet reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E
