60|$|How {{the time}} wears, I know not; until I am {{recalled}} by my child-wife's old companion. More restless than he was, he crawls {{out of his}} house, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and wanders to the door, and whines to go upstairs.|$|E
60|$|Biddy {{dropped her}} work, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Joe held his knees <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> both of them.

I won't look at him, but I FEEL him staring at me, and it makes me so nervous." ...|$|E

And him like a viper a-looking at me--more like a viper than a human boy. He leans on the bar <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'All right, Aunt Flo,' he says, just that and nothing more. Time after time, I've dreamt of it, and now he's come. 'They've Reformed me,' he says, 'and made me a devil, and devil I mean to be to you. So out with it,' he says." ...|$|E

Bless her heart! she's just as easily amused now as when she was a child. Give us another kiss, my own little love. You understand what I mean, don't you, though you can't hear me? Ah, dear, dear! when she stands <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with her eyes like that, she's the living image of--" ...|$|E
6000|$|May 31.--James H. Williams, aged 21, 3d Virginia cavalry.-About as mark'd {{a case of}} {{a strong}} man brought low by a {{complication}} of diseases, (laryngitis, fever, debility and diarrhoea,) as I have ever seen--has superb physique, remains swarthy yet, and flushed and red with fever-is altogether flighty--flesh of his great breast and arms tremulous, and pulse pounding away with treble quickness--lies {{a good deal of the}} time in a partial sleep, but with low muttering and groans--a sleep in which there is no rest. Powerful as he is, and so young, he will not be able to stand many more days of the strain and sapping heat of yesterday and to-day. His throat is in a bad way, tongue and lips parch'd. When I ask him how he feels, he is able just to articulate, [...] "I feel pretty bad yet, old man," [...] <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with his great bright eyes. Father, John Williams, Millensport, Ohio.|$|E

You'd 'a' thought I'd sold him a second, or asked him to work on Yom Kippur! He hands me the cold-boiled stare and yaps, 'I dunno, friend, I'll see,' and he ducks behind the rigamajig they {{keep track of the}} rooms on. Well, I guess he called up the Credit Association and the American Security League to see if I was all right--he {{certainly}} took long enough--or maybe he just went to sleep; but finally he comes out <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like it hurts him, and croaks, 'I think I can let you have a room with bath.' 'Well, that's awful nice of you--sorry to trouble you--how much 'll it set me back?' I says, real sweet. 'It'll cost you seven bucks a day, friend,' he says.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had it {{out last}} night with my mother," [...] he said. [...] "I dreaded the scene, for she takes things terribly hard. She does n't scold nor storm, {{and she does n't}} argue nor insist. She sits with her eyes full of tears that never fall, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> when I displease her, as if I were a perfect monster of depravity. And the trouble is that I was born to displease her. She does n't trust me; she never has and she never will. I don't know what I have done to set her against me, but ever since I can {{remember}} I have been looked at with tears. The trouble is," [...] he went on, giving a twist to his moustache, [...] "I 've been too absurdly docile. I 've been sprawling all my days by the maternal fireside, and my dear mother has grown used to bullying me. I 've made myself cheap! If I 'm not in my bed by eleven o'clock, the girl is sent out to explore with a lantern. When I think of it, I fairly despise my amiability. It 's rather a hard fate, to live like a saint and to pass for a sinner! I should like for six months to lead Mrs. Hudson the life some fellows lead their mothers!" ...|$|E

'Last Tuesday afternoon, your Honours, I 'appened to be drivin' my cart meself {{up through}} Trover {{on to the}} cottages just above the dip, and I'd gone in to Mrs. 'Oney's, the laundress, leavin' my cart standin' same as I always do. I 'ad a bit o' gossip, an' when I come out, I see this gentleman walkin' away in front towards the village street. It so 'appens I 'appened {{to look in the}} back o' my cart, and I thinks to meself, That's funny! There's only two flat rounds--'ave I left two 'ere by mistake? I calls to Mrs. 'Oney, an' I says, [...] "I 'aven't been absent, 'ave I, an' left ye two?" [...] "No," [...] she says, [...] "only one--'ere 'tis! Why?" [...] she says. [...] "Well," [...] I says, [...] "I 'ad four when I come in to you, there's only two now. 'Tis funny!" [...] I says. [...] "'Ave you dropped one?" [...] she says.

[...] "'E may 'ave," [...] I says, [...] "but the only thing I see on the road is that there." [...] An' I pointed to this gentleman. [...] "Oh!" [...] she says, [...] "that's the rector." [...] "Yes," [...] I says, [...] "I ought to know that, seein' 'e's owed me money a matter of {{eighteen}} months. I think I'll drive on," [...] I says. Well, I drove on, and come up to this gentleman. 'E turns 'is 'ead, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Good afternoon!" [...] he says--like that. [...] "Good afternoon, sir," [...] I says. [...] "You 'aven't seen a loaf, 'ave you?" [...] 'E pulls the loaf out of 'is pocket. [...] "On the ground," [...] 'e says; [...] "dirty," [...] 'e says. [...] "Do for my birds! Ha! ha!" [...] like that. [...] "Oh!" [...] I says, [...] "indeed! Now I know," [...] I says. I kept my 'ead, but I thinks: [...] "That's a bit too light-'earted. You owes me one pound, eight and tuppence; I've whistled for it gettin' on for two years, but you ain't content with that, it seems! Very well," [...] I thinks; [...] "we'll see. An' I don't give a darn whether you're a parson or not!" [...] I charge 'im with takin' my bread.' ...|$|E

The author stresses the collective nature of the presentation – the actors, present on stage the whole time, form a community, and the director standing among them {{plays the role of}} a shaman releasing his energy. The reviewer stresses the skillful weaving of political issues into the play. In his opinion, the avoidance of radically journalistic overtones and the creative use of a worker’s theater aesthetic make the performance an interesting discussion on humanitarianism and freedom...|$|E
