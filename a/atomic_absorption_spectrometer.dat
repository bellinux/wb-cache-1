40|$|The {{determination}} of phosphorus by graphite furnace <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrometry at the non-resonance line at 213. 6 nm, and {{the capability of}} Zeeman-effect background correction (Z-BC) {{to deal with the}} fine-structured background absorption due to the PO molecule have been investigated in the presence of selected chemical modifiers. Two line source <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometers,</b> one with a longitudinally heated and the other with a transversely heated graphite tube atomizer have been used in this study, as well as two prototype high-resolution continuum source <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometers,</b> one of which had a longitudinally arranged magnet at the furnace. It has been found that Z-BC is capable correcting very well the background caused by the PO molecule, and also that of the NO molecule, which has been encountered when the Pd + Ca mixed modifier was used. Both spectra exhibited some Zeeman splitting, which, however, did not cause any artifacts or correction errors. The practical significance {{of this study is to}} confirm that accurate results can be obtained for the {{determination of}} phosphorus using Z-BC. The best sensitivity with a characteristic mass of m(0) = 11 ng P has been obtained with the pure Pd modifier, which also caused the lowest background level. The characteristic mass obtained with the mixed Pd + Ca modifier depended on the equipment used and was between m(0) = 9 ng P and m(0) = 15 ng P, and the background signal was higher.

50|$|Atomic {{spectroscopy}} is {{the study}} of the electromagnetic radiation absorbed and emitted by atoms. Since unique elements have characteristic (signature) spectra, atomic spectroscopy, specifically the electromagnetic spectrum or mass spectrum, is applied for determination of elemental compositions. It can be divided by atomization source or by the type of spectroscopy used. In the latter case, the main division is between optical and mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry generally gives significantly better analytical performance, but is also significantly more complex. This complexity translates into higher purchase costs, higher operational costs, more operator training, and a greater number of components that can potentially fail. Because optical spectroscopy is often less expensive and has performance adequate for many tasks, it is far more common <b>Atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometers</b> {{are one of the most}} commonly sold and used analytical devices.|$|R

50|$|Most {{currently}} available GFAAs are fully controlled {{from a personal}} computer that has Windows-compatible software. The software easily optimizes run parameters, such as ramping cycles or calibration dilutions. Aqueous samples should be acidified (typically with nitric acid, HNO3) to a pH of 2.0 or less. GFAAs are more sensitive than flame <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometers,</b> and have a smaller dynamic range. This makes it necessary to dilute aqueous samples into the dynamic range of the specific analyte. GFAAS with automatic software can also pre-dilute samples before analysis. After the instrument has warmed up and been calibrated, a small aliquot (usually less than 100 microliters (µL) and typically 20 µL) is placed, either manually or through an automated sampler, into the opening in the graphite tube. The sample is vaporized in the heated graphite tube; the amount of light energy absorbed in the vapor is proportional to atomic concentrations. Analysis of each sample takes from 1 to 5 minutes, and the results for a sample is the average of triplicate analysis.|$|R

40|$|All of Bangladesh’s {{approximately}} 10 million drinking-water tube wells must be periodically {{tested for}} arsenic. The {{magnitude of this}} task and the limited resources of Bangladesh {{have led to the}} use of low-cost, semiquantitative field kits that measure As to a relatively high 50 µg/L national drinking water standard. However, there is an urgent need to supplement and ultimately replace these field kits with an inexpensive laboratory method that can measure As to the more protective 10 µg/L World Health Organization (WHO) health-based drinking water guideline. Unfortunately, Bangladesh has limited access to <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometers</b> or other expensive instruments that can measure As to the WHO guideline of 10 µg/L. In response to this need, an inexpensive and highly sensitive laboratory method for measuring As has been developed. This new method is the only accurate, precise, and safe way to quantify As < 10 µg/L without expensive or highly specialized laboratory equipment. In this method, As is removed from the sample by reduction to arsine gas, collected in an absorber by oxidation to arsenic acid, colorized by a sequential reaction to arsenomolybdate, and quantified by spectrophotometry. We compared this method with the silver diethyldithiocarbamate [AgSCSN(CH 2 CH 3) 2] and graphite furnace <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy (GFAAS) methods for measuring As.
