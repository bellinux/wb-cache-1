2500|$|T’ien-t’ai (538–597), Chinese Buddhist {{scholar who}} upheld the Lotus Sutra, {{developed}} a theoretical system {{to describe the}} infinite interconnectedness of life translated as [...] "the principle of the mutually inclusive relationship <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> life and all phenomena" [...] or [...] "three thousand realms in <b>a</b> single <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> life" [...] (Japanese: ichinen sanzen). This theory demonstrates that the entire phenomenal world exists in <b>a</b> single <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> life. [...] Soka Gakkai members believe that because Nichiren made actualizing this possible by inscribing Gohonzon and teaching the invocation, their prayers and actions can in <b>a</b> single <b>moment</b> pierce through chains of limitations.|$|R

5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E

5|$|The Dive Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> free-falling {{with at least}} one near 90-degree drop. Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first drop, a Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a holding brake which stops the train just as it enters the vertical drop. After a few seconds, the train is released into the drop.|$|E
