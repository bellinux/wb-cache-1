This gives a live real-time WYSIWYG (what {{you see is}} what you get) exposure simulation preview in Full Manual / Manual ISO mode, and <b>Auto-Exposure</b> (<b>AE)</b> / Manual ISO modes: P (Program), Tv (Time Value: shutter speed priority), and Av (Aperture Value). If Auto ISO is used, Autogain (Auto-EV0) framing/focus live view suspends Exposure Simulation live view.|$|E
40|$|Many image {{processing}} methods, such as techniques for people re-identification, assume photometric constancy between different images. This paper addresses the correction of photometric variations based upon changes in background areas to correct foreground areas. We assume a multiple light source model where all light sources can have different colors and will change over time. In training mode we learn per-location relations between foreground and background color intensities. In correction mode we apply a double linear correction model based on learned relations. This double linear correction includes a dynamic local illumination correction mapping {{as well as}} an inter-camera mapping. We evaluate our illumination correction by computing the similarity between two images based on the Earth Mover’s Distance. We compare the results to a representative <b>auto-exposure</b> (<b>AE)</b> algorithm found in the recent literature plus a color correction one based on the inverseintensity chromaticity. Especially in complex scenarios our method outperforms these state-of-the-art algorithms...|$|E
50|$|The Vidster is {{appreciated}} for {{the unique}} aesthetic {{properties of the}} video footage it records. Since the M-JPEG video created by the Vidster is so highly compressed, the footage exhibits constantly visible macroblocks, or square blocky artifacts from encoding. The Vidster only has <b>auto-exposure</b> as <b>a</b> method of exposure control, and also is constantly automatically white-balancing itself. This leads to very accentuated alterations in the qualities of the image, even from small changes in a scene. The lens of the Vidster is extremely small, resulting in an image with slight vignetting of image sharpness. There is also significant color fringing and video noise, especially for low-light subjects.|$|R
5000|$|The F-501 {{can be set}} {{for auto}} exposure, [...] "hi-speed" [...] auto exposure, [...] "dual" [...] auto-exposure (with AI-S type lenses) which {{switches}} between regular auto exposure and hi-speed autoexposure based on the lens attached, aperture priority, or full manual exposure modes, which allow the user to set both the aperture and shutter speeds.

40|$|Abstract—A CMOS {{active pixel}} sensor (APS) with in-pixel <b>auto-exposure</b> and <b>a</b> wide dynamic-range linear output is described. The chip {{features}} a unique architecture enabling a customized number of additional {{bits per pixel}} per readout, with minimal effect on the sensor spatial or temporal resolution. By utilizing multiple read-outs via real-time feedback, each pixel {{in the field of}} view can au-tomatically set an independent exposure time, according to its illu-mination. A customized, large increase in the dynamic range can be achieved and a scene containing both bright and dark regions can be captured. A prototype of 64 64 pixels has been fabri-cated using 1 -poly 3 -metal CMOS 0. 5 m n-well process available through MOSIS. Power dissipation is 3. 7 mW at = 5 V. The special functions have been verified experimentally, and an in-crease of 2 bits over the inherent dynamic range captured is shown.

5000|$|From 1964, Leica {{produced}} {{a series of}} single-lens reflex cameras, beginning with the Leicaflex, followed by the Leicaflex SL, the Leicaflex SL2, and then the R series from R3 to R7, made {{in collaboration with the}} Minolta Corporation. The Leica R8 was entirely designed and manufactured by Leica. The final model was the Leica R9, which could be fitted with the Digital Module back. Leica was slow to produce <b>an</b> <b>auto-exposure</b> model, and never made a Leica R model that included auto-focusing. Leica's U.S. official website announced (25 March 2009) that the R-series has been discontinued. The reason given was that [...] "new camera developments have significantly affected the sales of Leica R cameras and lenses resulting in a dramatic decrease in the number sold. Sadly, therefore, there is no longer an economic basis on which to keep the Leica R-System in the Leica production programme." ...|$|R

The X-ray Telescope (XRT) enables Swift to determine GRB positions with a few arcseconds accuracy within 100 seconds of the burst onset. The XRT utilizes a mirror set built for JET-X and an XMM-Newton/EPIC MOS CCD detector to provide a sensitive broad-band (0. 2 - 10 keV) X-ray imager with effective area of> 120 cm 2 at 1. 5 keV, field of view of 23. 6 x 23. 6 arcminutes, and angular resolution of 18 arcseconds (HPD). The detection sensitivity is 2 x 10 − 14 erg cm − 2 s − 1 in 10 4 seconds. The instrument {{is designed}} to provide automated source detection and position reporting within 5 seconds of target acquisition. It can also measure the redshifts of GRBs with Fe line emission or other spectral features.
