25|$|We clam {{up and get}} tense. But I {{think the}} {{national}} show will improve {{in the next few}} weeks. We want to include the best segments of IMT in the national show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.|$|E
25|$|Read on its own, the First Meditation {{can be seen}} as {{presenting}} skeptical doubts as {{a subject}} of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight {{to the heart of the}} Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.|$|E
500|$|In a {{roundtable}} {{interview with}} multiple news outlets, Vaughn {{responded to a}} question about choosing [...] "Love Love" [...] by the British band Take That for the end-credits theme, explaining, [...] "I bumped into [...] Gary [...] in , and we were just talking, and I said, 'Do you want to come and see a rough cut of it?’ And they came, and they wrote the song, and I listened to it, and I said, ‘I think it’ll be a hit’, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do a video which gets girls more interested ... we might get them to come and watch it. So it’s pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film." [...] An instrumental of the song [...] "Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)" [...] by Gnarls Barkley is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene.|$|E

6000|$|... "Will it be possible," [...] {{the farmer}} asked Pearson, when night again fell, [...] "to go out <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{discover}} any traces of them?" ...|$|R
500|$|Speaking to The BoomBox, Usher {{explained}} {{that he wanted to}} work with Swedish House Mafia ever since they both performed together at the 2010 American Music Awards. The group agreed to work with Usher, saying [...] "We'll see if we can come to Atlanta, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> we'll start to work on some tracks, writing, and moving the ball forward." [...] In an interview with MTV News, regarding the collaboration with Usher, Steve Angello commented, [...] "We met Usher couple of years ago, we did the AMA's together and then we came to hang-out in Ibiza. We were in Atlanta and we were all working together for five days. He has always been a great artist and he always knows what he wants so it is a good collaboration all in all. We rather work with somebody who we respect, than to rather work with just big name." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the 2007 playoffs, Selänne became Anaheim's all-time leading playoff scorer when he {{recorded}} his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild. The Ducks defeated the Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings {{to reach the}} Final; {{it was the first}} time in Selänne's career that he played in the NHL's championship series. As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup, his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit; Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère noted, [...] "We don't have any better teammate. He's a guy who always has fun. He deserves this <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> help him along the way, that would be great. I'd just love to see Teemu win this thing." [...] Selänne finished the playoffs with 15 points in 21 games, and after 14 NHL seasons, the 36-year-old Selänne raised the Stanley Cup with his teammates after defeating the Ottawa Senators in five games.|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength {{to come back here}} – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good for you, Dave!" [...] cried Barringford. [...] "That makes number one. Now let us finish him <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{run down}} some more on 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so, too! Well, come ahead, let's hurry <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> catch {{sight of}} them." [...] And then the two boys pushed ahead faster than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jonas, [...] "not much now, but {{the wind}} may rise before we get back. However, we'll go <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get a boat." ...|$|R
500|$|He started 2002–03 well, {{taking his}} place in the team due to {{injuries}} to other players. He made his first appearance in the opening match, a 1–1 draw away to Macclesfield Town on 10 August 2002, with chairman John Batchelor claiming Smith had a [...] "wonderful game <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get that sort of attitude from everyone in the team we won't have any problems". Smith was dropped to the bench for a 1–1 home draw with Wrexham on 29 October 2002 due to a change in formation, having started every match in 2002–03 prior to this match, although he did play as a 48th-minute substitute. He suffered a hamstring injury in early-November 2002, making his return in a 1–0 victory away to Rochdale on 23 November. Smith received his first red card of 2002–03 for a second bookable offence in a 1–1 home draw with Hull City on 28 December 2002, resulting in a one-match suspension. This meant he missed York's match against Torquay on 11 January 2003, and after a short spell on the sidelines returned in a 2–1 home win over Macclesfield on 2 February. Smith finished 2002–03 with 39 appearances for York, and was described by the Evening Press as the [...] "surprise star of the season". Despite being in outstanding form and becoming a fans' favourite, he was not offered a new contract with York at the end of 2002–03 by Dolan, although he hoped to still to have a future at the club. This decision was reversed by newly appointed player-manager Chris Brass, and Smith signed a new one-year contract in July 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Summer {{was honored}} at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards ceremony. Singer Natasha Bedingfield honored Summer, calling her [...] "a {{remarkable}} woman who brought so much light and who inspired many women, including myself, through her music. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> remember her through her music, this will never really {{be the last}} dance." [...] After her statement, she began to sing [...] "Last Dance", Summer's Academy Award-winning song. As she sang the song, photos of Summer were displayed on a screen overhead.|$|E
2500|$|... if [...] has a shape {{similar to}} the one shown in the figure, then we have created the phase {{behavior}} we wanted and the field will show a self-focusing effect. In other words, the field creates a fiber-like guiding structure while propagating. If the field creates a fiber and it is the mode of such a fiber at the same time, it means that the focusing nonlinear and diffractive linear effects are perfectly balanced and the field will propagate forever without changing its shape (as long as the medium does not change <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> neglect losses, obviously). In order to have a self-focusing effect, we must have a positive , otherwise we will get the opposite effect and we will not notice any nonlinear behavior.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I heard it," [...] {{cried the}} other; [...] "come, let us run {{down along the}} beach a bit, <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make out {{whereabouts}} she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{go over to}} the Run <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> learn {{anything}} about the trains," [...] said Sam, a spark of hope springing up in his breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, Jack. Suppose you and I {{walk back}} <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> locate the fellows," [...] {{suggested}} Fred. [...] "They don't know us, so they won't be suspicious." ...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2008, Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, {{suggested}} that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, [...] "the next fiscal year starts in April <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> try to achieve {{that in the next}} fiscal year that would be a great thing" [...] and that [...] " [...] is not a definite commitment, but that is what I would like to try to shoot for". However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008. In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing PlayStation 2's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market. In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, I. A. Gordon {{declared}} that [...] "Coleridge's Monody on the Death of Chatterton {{can never be}} {{regarded as one of}} his greatest poems, but it can lay a fair claim to be considered one of his most interesting; and in one respect at least it is unique. The Monody took him no less than forty-four years to beat into its final form, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> credit his statement that some lines of it were written 'in his thirteenth year as a school exercise' the forty-four years are stretched to almost fifty." [...] By 1975, Samuel Chew and Richard Altick declared: [...] " [...] addiction to 'turgid ode and tumid stanza,' clogged with pompous rhetoric and frigid personification, is evident in the Destruction of the Bastille (1789) [...] and in the Monody on the Death of Chatterton which was later (1794) completely rewritten.".|$|E
6000|$|Fellows, I {{believe there}} is a camp over there, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> manage to get across perhaps we'll learn {{something}} about our belongings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Let us {{sail for}} that spot <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{discover}} anything,” suggested Dave, {{as the party}} came away. “We may find some {{of those in the}} small boats.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, boys, we've {{got to do}} something," [...] {{said the}} Brill captain, when the nine came in. [...] "Two runs at least, <b>and</b> three <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} get them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{hurry to}} Morton's Junction <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find out {{anything}} more," [...] said Sam to his college chum. His face showed plainly how greatly he was worried.|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly, Mr. Jarvie," [...] {{said our}} friend Owen, [...] "credit {{is the sum}} total; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> but save that, at {{whatever}} discount"-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Can {{we go down}} <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be of any assistance?" [...] Beric asked. [...] "We {{might help}} in {{removing}} goods from the houses, and in carrying off the aged and sick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "let us go <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> amuse {{ourselves}} with my uncle's venerable friend. I do not suppose that he speaks English, but I will interpret for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. We {{have been}} {{planning}} {{to stay at home}} about a week, <b>and</b> then, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> arrange it, <b>we</b> want to visit Snowshoe Island and do a little hunting before school opens again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{watch out}} for that Mangle, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> ever get our hands on him, make him give up our money and then have him locked up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I said, Adolphus. I said that I {{thought we had}} better wait. I'm sure mamma thinks so. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only see you now and then--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But don't {{let us be}} any {{hindrance}} to you, O'Connor. If you are {{disposed to}} try, by all means do so <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> help you in any way, we will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm off {{to look at}} the pass," [...] cried March Marston, {{vaulting}} suddenly {{into the}} saddle. [...] "Come, Bertram; you'll go with me, won't you, <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find some wild-cats in it?" ...|$|R
