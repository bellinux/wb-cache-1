5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> {{known as}} the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected {{to each other and}} the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least {{a part of the}} answer.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{coordination}} was {{not helped}} by the poor relations between the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine Commanders-in-Chief, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring and Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder. The system required both services to work together, but it produced co-operation difficulties. <b>A</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was twofold. Fighter units defending the North Sea coast were subordinated to Luftgaukommando XI (Air District Command 9) in Hannover. These fighter units would function as an autonomous fighter command, or Jagdfliegerführer (Fighter Flyer Leaders). The command of Fighter Command unit was given to Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher, a former commander of II./Jagdgeschwader 77. Schumacher {{had served in the}} Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy) during the First World War and as an officer cadet had seen combat at the Battle of Jutland. It was hoped with his naval background and easy personality it would ease any difficulties with naval service cooperation. Nevertheless, Schumacher and his counterpart in the Navy were of the same rank, so each lacked authority over the other, an arrangement that lacked the needed unity of command.|$|E

25|$|Soon after tram {{operations}} were started, many problems arose. The hilly terrain of Kiev presented the largest problem. On Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street, {{a pair of}} horses {{was not enough to}} pull the trams uphill. Therefore, another two pairs of horses were added, which did not improve the situation. Thus, mechanizing the tram using a steam-powered engine was attempted as <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> However, the steam engines produced a lot of noise, which scared the horses and people, and produced a lot of air pollution.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{building}} Sampo, Finland {{had only one}} state-owned icebreaker, Murtaja, which was built in 1890 {{and was one of}} the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world. However, the 930-ton single-screw vessel was not powerful enough to keep even the southernmost port of Finland, Hanko, open during severe winters and the icebreaking characteristics of its spoon-shaped bow were not as good as was hoped for. A committee, appointed by the Senate of Finland in 1895 to find <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> came to a conclusion that a second state-owned icebreaker would be needed.|$|E

However, it was the coming of the railway, with its need to cross existing obstacles, such as rivers, roads, canals and other railways, in as straight a line as possible, that rekindled the civil engineer's interest in the skew arch bridge.|$|E

25|$|Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela {{originally}} {{coined the}} concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference. This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of the humanised 'subject'.|$|E
25|$|Nunes also {{solved the}} problem of finding the day with the {{shortest}} twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration. This problem per se is not greatly important, yet it shows the geometric genius of Nunes {{as it was a}} problem which was independently tackled by Johann and Jakob Bernoulli more than a century later with less success. They could find <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they got lost in the details of differential calculus which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.|$|E
25|$|Montana District Courts are {{the courts}} of general {{jurisdiction}} in Montana. There are no intermediate appellate courts. District Courts have jurisdiction primarily over most civil cases, cases involving a monetary claim against the state, felony criminal cases, probate, and cases at law and in equity. When so authorized by the legislature, actions of executive branch agencies may be appealed directly to a District Court. The District Courts also have de novo appellate jurisdiction from inferior courts (city courts, justice courts, and municipal courts), and oversee naturalization proceedings. District Court judges are elected, and serve six-year terms. They are not term limited. There are 22 judicial districts in Montana, served by 56 District Courts and 46 District Court judges. The District Courts suffer from excessive workload, and the legislature has struggled to find <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
