40|$|When an {{electric}} current {{higher than a}} certain intensity passes through a thermistor, the thermistor shows a negative differential resistance characteristic. If the thermistor is biased reasonably in this region and an alternating current of small amplitude is superimposed on the bias current, the phase and the amplitude of the resulting voltage variation depend on {{the frequency of the}} current. At extremely low frequencies, the voltage is 180 ° out of phase with the current. Since the thermistor has a thermal inertia, the phase difference between current and voltage is 90 ° at a certain frequency, and it exhibits an apparent inductance characteristic. Because the phase difference between current and voltage depends on the surrounding temperature, the temperature control can be realized as follows : a constant low frequency oscillator is employed as the <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator.</b> The variation of the surrounding temperature is detected by the variation of the phase difference, and th...|$|E

Introduction: Alternating current will {{perhaps in}} time {{supplant}} direct current for traction purposes {{as it did}} in lighting, {{with the advent of the}} long distance high potential transmission, but as yet the direct current plays a very important part in both power and traction. It has however the disadvantage of being difficult to transmit long distances without great loss. This is due to the inherent limitations in the production of high voltages from the direct current generator. Commutation at voltages sufficiently high to warrant economical transmission over long distances, is extremely difficult. Sparking and other difficulties at once arise which place the voltage within the limitations mentioned. The <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator</b> has not only the advantage of higher voltage, but by means of suitable transformer devices the voltage may be raised to any desired value for economical transmission. It will be readily seen, therefore, that alternating current machinery will supplant the direct current for traction purposes. In this thesis only direct current is treated. Direct current on a small scale and for local distribution fulfills more nearly the requirements demanded for traction purposes such as is needed on railways. The discussions are confined to the electrical equipment of the car only, the mechanical construction being referred to only as needed in line with the electrical connections...|$|E
40|$|Citation: Sidorfsky, Henry August. The <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1903. Introduction: 1. Principles of Alternating Currents. Faraday’s {{discovery}} that by moving wires across {{a magnetic field}} so as to cut lines of force, a current would be induced, suggested the construction of magneto electric machines, drawn by mechanical power. If a coil of wire be revolved between the poles of a magnetic current a current will be induced in the conductors. In Fig. 1. A simple coil C of wire is revolved between the poles of a magnet N S each end of this coil is connected to a slip ring A-B. Now suppose the coil to be revolving so that {{the top of the}} coil is coming toward one, then the current induced in the wires at that moment will be in the direction indicated by the arrow heads. It will leave by the ring A. and will return from the circuit through B. Now when the coil is turned 180 ? degrees from the position shown, the E. M. F. will be reversed and now it will leave the right B. and return through A. Hence in each complete revolution of the coil the E. M. F rises to a maximum, then falls to 0 and then rises to a maximum in the opposite direction. Then we have a primitive form of the alternator, generating a simple periodical alternating current. In alternating current working, the current is rapidly reversed, rising and falling in a set of pulses, the electrical current is being set oscillating, forwards and backwards, through the line and around the circuit with great rapidity under the influence of a rapidly reversing E. M. F. Now, as seen above, the coil by cutting lines of force of the magnetic field sets up a periodic E. M. F. which changes at every half turn giving rise to alternating currents. On each whole revolution there will be an E. M. F. which rises to a maximum and then dies away giving a curve such as is represented in Fig. 2. The heights of the curve above the horizontal line represent the momentary values of the E. M. F. ’s; the depths below {{in the second half of}} the curve represent the inverse E. M. F. ’s that succeed them. The exact slope of this curve depends upon the arrangement of the iron and the winding of the alternator, and also upon the current that is flowing. Some machines are constructed so that their E. M. F. curve is nearly a sine curve, while in other machines the curves vary and sometimes are very irregular. Each complete operation exhibited by the whole wave above and below the line is called a period, and the number of periods in a second is called the frequency or periodicity of the alternator. The number of revolutions per second times the number of pairs of poles gives the frequency...|$|E
