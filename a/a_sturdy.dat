5|$|During his lifetime, Thomas {{was praised}} for his learning, his {{encouragement}} {{of education in}} his diocese, and his generosity. He was an excellent singer and composed hymns. In his youth, he was known for having <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> build, and in his old age he had a ruddy complexion and snow white hair.|$|E
5|$|In Texas, the Weather Bureau {{notified}} people {{early enough}} to allow mass evacuations: most coastal residents and camping visitors evacuated the vulnerable islands as the storm neared. Between 60–70% of Port Isabel's 500residents left before the storm, with the remainder sheltering in <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> brick store on the highest land available.|$|E
5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
50|$|By 1929, the Indian 402 {{would have}} a {{stronger}} twin-downtube frame based on that of the 101 Scout and <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> five-bearing crankshaft than the Ace, which had a three-bearing crankshaft.|$|R
25|$|In 1929, the Indian 401 was {{replaced}} by the Indian 402 which received a stronger twin-downtube frame based on the 101 Scout frame and <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> five-bearing crankshaft than the Ace, which only had a three-bearing crankshaft.|$|R
25|$|Times Europa was {{designed}} by Walter Tracy in 1972 for The Times, as <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> alternative to the Times font family, designed for the demands of faster printing presses and cheaper paper. The typeface features more open counter spaces.|$|R
5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, are central to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> body. The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in the}} breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is <b>a</b> <b>sturdy,</b> muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 {{the larger}} Type 4 (411 and 412) models were introduced. These {{differed}} substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of monocoque/unibody construction, {{the option of}} a fully automatic transmission, electronic fuel injection, and <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> powerplant.|$|R

50|$|In 1968 the {{internal}} bracing of the Dove was made heavier; while this made <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> guitar that was {{less likely to}} be returned to Gibson for warranty work, the volume of the guitar was reduced and the tone was negatively affected.|$|R
5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E
5|$|Some {{countries}} have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert {{of a possible}} tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far {{to the side of}} the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell in 1914 to provide <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> mixed-traffic locomotive with high route availability. Intended to replace several obsolete 0-6-0 types, the Nclass {{was the first step}} in the SECR's fleet standardisation programme, which also included the Kclass 2-6-4T passenger tank locomotive. Maunsell enlisted the help of former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft, who suggested that a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement would allow the class to run on the poor-quality track in north Kent. This arrangement allowed for a longer wheelbase with leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on tight track curves, which had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR. A longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than an 0-6-0, giving the Nclass sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
50|$|Recently, {{neoprene}} {{has become}} a favorite material for lifestyle and other home accessories including laptop sleeves, tablet holders, remote controls, mouse pads, and cycling chamois. In this market, it sometimes competes with LRPu (low-resilience polyurethane), which is <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> (more impact-resistant) but less-used material.|$|R
50|$|Baroda won {{the trophy}} in 2011-12 by {{defeating}} Punjab by 8 runs at Brabourne Stadium {{largely due to}} the all-round performance by Irfan Pathan. Irfan came in at No. 7 turned the game from 91 for 5 into <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> 149 for 6 and took two for 24 while bowling.|$|R
50|$|The Fourche Mountain {{salamander}} has <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> {{body shape}} {{than most of}} the other salamander species in the locality. Its back is black with two rows of irregular grey blotches and a speckling of smaller pale spots. The underside is dark with a few lighter spots and the chin is pale.|$|R
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops species possessed <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> build, {{with strong}} limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. Although {{certainly}} quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs {{has long been}} the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed out, in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} the bridge's opening the Second World War broke out. Because of their close {{proximity}} to Chelsea Barracks {{it was expected that}} enemy bombers would target the three road bridges in the area, and a temporary bridge was built parallel to Chelsea Bridge. As with the four other temporary Thames bridges built in this period, it was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. As it turned out, no enemy action took place in the area, and all three bridges survived the war undamaged. The temporary bridge was dismantled in 1945.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{embroidery}} {{techniques such}} as chain stitch and couching or laid-work are the most economical of expensive yarns; couching is generally used for goldwork. Canvas work techniques, in which large amounts of yarn are buried {{on the back of}} the work, use more materials but provide <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> and more substantial finished textile.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the extra}} weight and stresses, tandem wheels may use a higher spoke count, {{sturdier}} rims, higher pressure tires, a stronger freewheel, dishless spoke configuration, or asymmetric wheels. Tandems wear out rear wheels faster than front wheels; therefore, they may use non-symmetrical wheel setups, such as more spokes or <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> rim on the rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|In 1900 the gun {{carriage}} vehicle was modified into <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> four-wheeler which eventually became the Davidson Automobile Battery armored car, a lightly armored military vehicle. Davidson, {{inventor of the}} first military vehicle in the United States, received little credit from the Army for his efforts {{of being the first}} to build armored cars in the United States.|$|R
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5|$|New Forest ponies have {{a gentle}} {{temperament}} and {{a reputation for}} intelligence, strength, and versatility. On the whole, they are <b>a</b> <b>sturdy</b> and hardy breed. The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia, a muscular condition also found in humans, dogs, cats, and goats. It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009, after a clinically affected foal {{was presented to the}} Equine Clinic of Utrecht University. DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1, a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle. The mutated allele was found in both the foal's parents, its siblings, and two other related animals, none of whom exhibited any clinical signs. The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype. The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin: the founder of the mutated gene, as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion. The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje's Ronaldo; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene. All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society's stud book, and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested, whether or not they descend from Kantje's Ronaldo, to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree, although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock. All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested.|$|E

50|$|Due to poor maintenance, {{the second}} bridge slowly deteriorated. A fire damaged the structure, {{and since the}} road served as a {{critical}} traffic link, funding was provided for a new bridge in 1907 and 1908. The new bridge was built in 1908 {{at a cost of}} £2,023, and was <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> construction. It was located south east of the present bridge.|$|R
50|$|Automatic belt systems {{generally}} offer inferior occupant crash protection. In {{systems with}} belts {{attached to the}} door rather than <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> fixed portion of the vehicle body, a crash that causes the vehicle door to open leaves the occupant without belt protection. In such a scenario, the occupant may be thrown from the vehicle and suffer greater injury or death.|$|R
50|$|The Paper Mate PhD Multi is a pen/pencil/stylus combination. The PhD {{series of}} pens and pencils have been {{specifically}} designed for durability and comfort, notably with a unique ergonomic, cushioned triangular grip that is endorsed by the American Physical Therapy Association. The PhD series of pens also distinguishes itself from most other Paper mate products by having <b>a</b> <b>sturdier,</b> higher-quality design.|$|R

50|$|Vaginal {{prolapse}} or uterine prolapse {{may occur}} in women when other pelvic ligaments and supportive structures are weakened. One treatment is sacrospinous fixation. In this surgery, {{the apex of}} the vagina has a sling implanted in surgery. This travels under the vagina and is attached to the sacrospinous ligament, which may offer <b>a</b> <b>sturdier</b> support than weakened pelvic ligaments, ideally preventing further prolapse.|$|R
