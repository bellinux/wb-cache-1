Apparently {{there was}} nothing to keep American {{engineers}} with adequate credentials from seeing <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see and from asking about <b>all</b> that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> learn. As a result the American engineers developed knowledge of railroads in three areas - ...|$|R

5000|$|None of my {{associates}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{talk about}} the Apple II or the Osborne I computer anymore, nor did <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fantasize about writing the next super-selling program ... <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> talk about was the IBM Personal Computer—what it was, its potential and limitations, and most of all, the impact IBM {{would have on the}} business of personal computing.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{would take}} you long, {{and it would}} take them longer! <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do is to prevent us from doing.

60|$|Furthermore, {{not only}} will {{socialism}} get food more easily and in greater quantity, but it will achieve a more equitable distribution of that food. Socialism promises, for a time, to give all men, women, and children <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> eat, and {{to enable them to}} eat all they want as often as they want. Subsistence will be pushed back, temporarily, an exceedingly long way. In consequence, the flood of life will rise like a tidal wave. There will be more marriages and more children born. The enforced sterility that obtains to-day for many millions, will no longer obtain. Nor will the fecund millions in the slums and labour-ghettos, who to-day die of all the ills due to chronic underfeeding and overcrowding, and who die with their fecundity largely unrealised, die in that future day when the increased food-getting efficiency of socialism will give them <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> eat.|$|E
60|$|The {{splendor of}} this {{arrangement}} took Jill's breath away, {{and before she}} got it again, in came Frank and Ralph with two clothes-baskets of treasures to be hung upon the tree. While they wired on the candles the children asked questions, and found out <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know about the new plans and pleasures.|$|R
60|$|But Peter {{was not to}} be conciliated, {{and took}} himself off in high dudgeon. To be laughed at before Felicity--to be laughed at BY Felicity--was {{something}} he could not endure. Let Cecily and the Story Girl cackle <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to,</b> and let those stuck-up Toronto boys grin like chessy-cats; but when Felicity laughed at him the iron entered into Peter's soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on and ask {{one of the}} men about them," [...] {{came from}} Tom; and a little later they had a long talk with an aviator named Captain Colby, who proved to be a {{relative}} to Larry Colby, one of their former chums at Putnam Hall. He had heard about the Rover boys and some of their doings, and willingly told them <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know.|$|R
6000|$|... "What would such {{a promise}} be worth if John Ball {{got hold of}} her money? That's what they're after, as sure as my name is Martha; and what she's after too, very likely. She was there once {{before she went to}} Littlebath at <b>all.</b> <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get their uncle's money back, and she wants to be a baronet's wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... " [...] Yes, it was," [...] {{replied the}} messenger, who {{appeared}} excited, [...] "an' these fellers can get home without you, for our manager says he'll pay their fare. He. telegraphed to New York, an' if the little feller's name is Edward Hawley, he's goin' to give 'em <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> eat, an' buy a stateroom, an' {{they are to}} go like reg'lar swells." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, a long way; {{probably}} he was through {{by the time}} we came up here. They are not likely to post them more than fifty or sixty yards from the wall; and, indeed, it is, as Bathurst pointed out to me, probable that they are only thick near the gate. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do is to prevent us slipping away. I should think that Bathurst must be out near the lines by this time." ...|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{that these}} things {{interested}} him, the Asika volunteered the information through Jeekie, {{that this was a}} divining-bowl, and that if those who went before her had wished to learn the future, they caused Little Bonsa to float in it and found out <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know by her movements. She, however, she added, had other and better methods of learning things that were predestined.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{appointed}} captain of Kálló in 1599. His work was hindered by shortage of money. He asked in several letters the Szepes Chamber {{to pay off}} the defenders' military pay. learning the refusal, [...] "the soldiers very outraged", [...] "so much that <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> rebel, I found it hard to quiet them" [...] - wrote Káthay to the Chamber in one of his letters dated 1 November 1599.|$|R

6000|$|That evening, when Kennicott was {{trimming}} the grass along the walk with sheep-shears, Bresnahan rolled up, alone. He {{was now in}} corduroy trousers, khaki shirt open at the throat, a white boating hat, and marvelous canvas-and-leather shoes [...] "On the job there, old Will! Say, my Lord, this is living, {{to come back and}} get into a regular man-sized pair of pants. They can talk <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> about the city, but my idea of a good time is to loaf around and see you boys and catch a gamey bass!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You see, I teach 'em {{to cut out}} demand--that {{supply is}} the main thing. I teach 'em not to desire {{anything}} beyond their simplest needs. A little mutton, a little cocoa, and a little fruit brought up from the coast--that's <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make 'em happy. I've got 'em well trained. They make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable fibre and straw, and they're a contented lot. It's a great thing,' winds up Shane, 'to have made a people happy by the incultivation of such simple institutions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you make}} me think. You must believe me a pill. I wanted you to--to fall for me hard.... That bunch of sapheads have spoiled me, I'll say. Daren, I'm sick of them. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do is mush. I like tennis, riding, golf. I want to do things. But it's too hot, or this, or that. Yet they'll break their necks to carry a girl off to some roadhouse, and dance--dance till you're melted. Then they stop along the river to go bathing. I've been twice. You see, I have to sneak away, or lie to mother and say I've gone to Gail's or somewhere." ...|$|E
60|$|He got {{across and}} after {{three or four}} hours they reached the section-shack. Graham was in bed, but he got up and told them <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know. Three policemen with an Indian and a pack-horse had come down the track and Graham {{imagined}} they had found the entrance to Jimmy's valley. He reckoned they would send back the Indian and the horse when they took the rocks, but the fellow had not yet returned. Peter was puzzled about the Indian.|$|R
60|$|Their father {{predicted}} {{that he would}} never have time to fulfil his old engagement of taking them out to the Shag Rock, but the prediction was not verified, for he rowed both them and Mr. Ashford thither one fine May afternoon, showed them <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see, and let them scramble to their heart's content. He laughed at their hoard of scraps of the wood of the wreck, which they said their mamma had desired them to fetch for her.|$|R
50|$|Alpha Delta Chi {{was founded}} in 1925 at the University of California, Los Angeles by ten women. Their vision {{was to create a}} place where Christian women could {{participate}} in Greek life without compromising their beliefs, build strong friendships, and most of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create a place which would mirror Christ's love to their community. The sorority was originally named Areta, which means virtue. The sorority's purpose is to provide fellowship for Christian college women, to strengthen the spiritual lives of its members, to be a testimony for Christ on each campus.|$|R
6000|$|... --Oh, {{and another}} thing Wada told me. The gangster clique has {{established}} its privilege of taking first cut of the salt-beef in the meat-kids. After that, the rest take the rejected pieces. But I will say, contrary to my expectations, the Elsinore's forecastle is well found. The men are not on whack. They have <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> eat. A barrel of good hardtack stands always open in the forecastle. Louis bakes fresh bread for the sailors three times a week. The variety of food is excellent, if not the quality. There is no restriction {{in the amount of}} water for drinking purposes. And I can only say that in this good weather the men's appearance improves daily.|$|E
60|$|The {{condition}} of the men grows deplorable. They were always poor at pulling on ropes, but now it takes two or three to pull {{as much as one}} used to pull. One thing in their favour is that they are well, though grossly, fed. They have <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> eat, such as it is, but it is the cold and wet, the terrible {{condition of}} the forecastle, the lack of sleep, and the almost continuous toil of both watches on deck. Either watch is so weak and worthless that any severe task requires the assistance of the other watch. As an instance, we finally managed a reef in the foresail in the thick of a gale. It took both watches two hours, yet Mr. Pike tells me that under similar circumstances, with an average crew of the old days, he has seen a single watch reef the foresail in twenty minutes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sadler, [...] "it is a {{camp with}} {{a good deal of}} comfort in it. Our Number One camps are pretty rough. They are for hunters and {{scientific}} people. We give them game enough in season, and some bare places where they can make fires and stretch a bit of canvas. That is <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> <b>to</b> have a truly good time. That is the best camp of all, I think. Number Two camps are generally for fishermen. They always want a chance for pretty good living when they are out in the woods. They stay in camp in the evenings, and like to sit around and have a good time. Number Threes are the best camps we put families into, so you see, madam, I'm rating you pretty high. There's always a log-cabin in these camps, with cots and straw mattresses and plenty of traps for cooking. And, more than that, there is a chance for people who don't tramp or fish to do things, such as walking or boating, according to circumstances. There's one of our camps has a croquet-ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid General Braddock's defeat {{will cause}} us lots {{of trouble in}} the future. Mr. Risley was telling {{me that he had}} heard the Indians over at Plum Valley were as impudent as they could be. He said half a dozen of 'em made a settler named Hochstein give 'em <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> eat and drink, and when the German found fault they flourished their tomahawks and told him all the {{settlers}} but the French were squaws and that he had better shut up or they'd scalp him and burn down his cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you wouldn't," [...] {{retorted}} the Eagle. [...] "You {{would probably}} have been half suffocated and a good deal dirtied, and you might have been singed, but you wouldn't have died; and what need you care now, for the people saw nothing but a bundle. You might have been a bundle of old clothes for <b>all</b> <b>they</b> knew or cared. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see was the bravery, as they call it, of the man; as if there were not hundreds upon hundreds of women who would do the same thing if their muscles were strong enough, and occasion served." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{supplied}} {{them very}} abundantly. He brought {{them not only}} <b>all</b> that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> eat, but gathered also a large number in clusters on the branches, for them to carry to the carriage and take home.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a trifle, and I only {{mention it}} to beg of you to pluck up [...] a little courage, and not be alarmed every time any of the little [...] knot of threateners annoy you. They want to break off all kind of [...] {{connection}} {{between me and the}} Edinburgh Review. I have long seen [...] it. Their fury against the article in the last number knows no [...] bounds, and they will never cease till they worry you out of your [...] connection with me, and get the whole control of the Review into [...] their own hands, by forcing you to resign it yourself. A party [...] and a personal engine is <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make it. What possible [...] right can any of these silly slaves have to object to my opinion [...] being--what it truly is--against the Holland House theory of Lord [...] Chatham's madness? I know that Lord Grenville treated it with [...] contempt. I know others now living who did so too, and I know that [...] so stout a Whig as Sir P. Francis was clearly of that opinion, and [...] he knew Lord Chatham personally. I had every ground to believe [...] that Horace Walpole, a vile, malignant, and unnatural wretch, [...] though a very clever writer of Letters, was nine-tenths of the [...] Holland House authority for the tale. I knew that a baser man in [...] character, or a meaner in capacity than the first Lord Holland [...] existed not, even in those days of job and mediocrity. Why, then, [...] was I bound to take a false view because Lord Holland's family [...] have inherited his hatred of a great rival?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now I do {{not pretend}} to be perfect myself. Heaven knows I have to {{struggle}} hard enough every day with what the Germans call my higher impulses. I know too well the temptation to be moral, to be self-sacrificing, to be loyal and patriotic, to be respectable and well-spoken of. But I wrestle with it and--as far as human fraility will allow--conquer it, whereas the German abandons himself to it without scruple or reflection, and is actually proud of his pious intemperance and self-indulgence. Nothing will cure him of this mania. It may end in starvation, crushing taxation, suppression of all freedom to try new social experiments and reform obsolete institutions, in snobbery, jobbery, idolatry, and an omnipresent tyranny in which his doctor and his schoolmaster, his lawyer and his priest, coerce him worse than any official or drill sergeant: no matter: it is respectable, says the German, therefore it must be good, and cannot be carried too far; and everybody who rebels against {{it must be a}} rascal. Even the Social-Democrats in Germany differ from the rest only in carrying academic orthodoxy beyond human endurance--beyond even German endurance. I am a Socialist and a Democrat myself, the hero of a hundred platforms, {{one of the leaders of}} the most notable Socialist organizations in England. I am as conspicuous in English Socialism as Bebel is in German Socialism; but do you suppose that the German Social-Democrats tolerate me? Not a bit of it. I have begged again and again to be taken to the bosom of my German comrades. I have pleaded that the Super-Proletarians of all lands should unite. I have pointed out that the German Social-Democratic party has done nothing at its Congresses for the last ten years except the things I told them to do ten years before, and that its path is white with the bones of the Socialist superstitions I and my fellow Fabians have slain. Useless. They do not care a rap whether I am a Socialist or not. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know is; Am I orthodox? Am I correct in my revolutionary views? Am I reverent to the revolutionary authorities? Because I am a genuine free-thinker they look at me as a policeman looks at a midnight prowler or as a Berlin bourgeois looks at a suspicious foreigner. They ask [...] "Do you believe that Marx was omniscient and infallible; that Engels was his prophet; that Bebel and Singer are his inspired apostles; and that Das Kapital is the Bible?" [...] Hastening in my innocence to clear myself of what I regard as an accusation of credulity and ignorance, I assure them earnestly that I know ten times as much of economics and a hundred times as much of practical administration as Marx did; that I knew Engels personally and rather liked him as a witty and amiable old 1848 veteran who despised modern Socialism; that I regard Bebel and Singer as men of like passions with myself, but considerably less advanced; and that I read Das Kapital in the year 1882 or thereabouts, and still consider it one of the most important books of the nineteenth century because of its power of changing the minds of those who read it, in spite of its unsound capitalist economics, its parade of quotations from books which the author had either not read or not understood, its affectation of algebraic formulas, and its general attempt to disguise a masterpiece of propagandist journalism and prophetic invective as a drily scientific treatise of the sort that used to impose on people in 1860, when any book that pretended to be scientific was accepted as a Bible. In those days Darwin and Helmholtz were the real fathers of the Church; and nobody would listen to religion, poetry or rhetoric; so that even Socialism had to call itself [...] "scientific," [...] and predict the date of the revolution, as if it were a comet, by calculations founded on [...] "historic laws." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{women from}} the DC Rape Crisis Center who {{initiated}} work with PAR were Loretta Ross, Yulanda Ward and Nkenge Toure. Ross has said that whilst the relationship was seen initially as controversial, {{it was one of}} the more interesting aspects of her work at the DC Rape Crisis Center in the 1970s and 80s. In an interview with Joyce Follet, Ross observed that in the work of the DC Rape Crisis center they could bandage up women <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to,</b> but if <b>they</b> did not stop rape what was the point?
