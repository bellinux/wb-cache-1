40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{investigation of}} the electrolytic deposition of copper from concentrated aqueous <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>solutions</b> {{has been carried out}} based on the thermodynamic analysis of the system Cu-NH 3 -H 2 O. The speciation of copper vs. pH and redox potential was modeled in high ionic strength solutions, in which the activity coefficients of the system species were estimated according to the Modified Bromley's Methodology. The electrochemical behavior of the redox system Cu(0) /Cu(I) /Cu(II) in concentrated aqueous <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>solutions</b> was studied at pH = 9. 5 and the cathodic reactions in these solutions were determined. It was found that metallic copper was formed under strongly reductive redox conditions. while under mildly reductive to mildly oxidative conditions the cuprous di-ammine complex species dominate. Under highly oxidative conditions the cupric tetra-ammine complex species predominated. According to the theory and results, the cathodic deposition of copper from concentrated aqueous <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>solutions</b> proceeds in a two-step reduction mechanism. The cupric ammine species are first reduced to cuprous di-ammine, which in turn is reduced to metallic copper. The electrochemical experiments revealed that copper deposition over time follows a sigmoid-type curve, verifying the two-step mechanism. The main feature of these sigmoid curves was the presence of an induction period with negligible copper deposition, followed by an acceleration period where the copper deposition rate gradually increased. By increasing the applied cell voltage, the induction period was significantly reduced or disappeared. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study {{it was found that}} the {{presence}} of millimolar amounts of copper (II) ions in <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>solutions</b> leads to the spontaneous formation of a stable passive layer on metallic iron and iron alloys with nickel and cobalt, under conditions in which they would otherwise remain in active dissolution.

Electrochemical and scanning electron microscopy / energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) investigations conducted as part of this study showed that the observed passivation is promoted by the cementation of copper onto the actively dissolving iron surface, and subsequently by its re-dissolution.

50|$|The Sherritt {{process is}} a hydrometallurgical process named for Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. (now Sherritt International) of Sherridon and Lynn Lake Manitoba Canada, based on the older Forward process {{developed}} by Dr. Frank Forward for the recovery of copper and nickel from those same mines. Nickel sulfide concentrates can be treated by either roasting or flash smelting to produce matte from which nickel and cobalt can be recovered hydrometallurgically, {{or they may be}} treated by an ammonia solution pressure leach. The residue is removed. A feed of matte and sulfide concentrate containing approximately 0.4% cobalt and 30% sulfur is pressure leached at elevated temperature and pressure in an <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>solution</b> to produce a solution of nickel, copper and cobalt. By boiling away the ammonia; copper is precipitated as a sulfide and sent to a smelter. Hydrogen sulfide is added to the autoclave to remove nickel sulfide and copper sulfide which is fed back to the leaching process. Air is then passed through the solution in the autoclave for oxyhydrolysis. The solution is then reduced with hydrogen, again at high temperature and pressure, to precipitate nickel powder (>99%). The remaining solution (containing approximately equal proportions of nickel and cobalt sulfides), is then adjusted (to a lower temperature and pressure) to precipitate the mixed sulfides and the fluid is concentrated and crystallized into ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4). The mixed sulfides are pressure leached with air and sulfuric acid. Ammonia is then added to remove potassium and iron as jarosite (KFe (OH)6(SO4)2). More ammonia and air is added for oxidation. The solution is removed from the autoclave and sulfuric acid added to remove nickel as nickel(II) sulfate-ammonium sulfate hexahydrate ((NiSO4)•((NH4)2SO4)•6H2O) which is then sent to have its nickel recovered.

5000|$|Thermometric titrimetry: Thermometric titrimetry is an {{extraordinarily}} versatile technique. This is differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry {{by the fact}} that the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution. Instead, the equivalence point is determined by the rate of temperature change. Because thermometric titrimetry is a relative technique, it is not necessary to conduct the titration under isothermal conditions, and titrations can be conducted in plastic or even glass vessels, although these vessels are generally enclosed to prevent stray draughts from causing [...] "noise" [...] and disturbing the endpoint. Because thermometric titrations can be conducted under ambient conditions, they are especially well-suited to routine process and quality control in industry. Depending on whether the reaction between the titrant and analyte is exothermic or endothermic, the temperature will either rise or fall during the titration. When all analyte has been consumed by reaction with the titrant, a change in the rate of temperature increase or decrease reveals the equivalence point and an inflection in the temperature curve can be observed. The equivalence point can be located precisely by employing the second derivative of the temperature curve. The software used in modern automated thermometric titration systems employ sophisticated digital smoothing algorithms so that [...] "noise" [...] resulting from the highly sensitive temperature probes does not interfere with the generation of a smooth, symmetrical second derivative [...] "peak" [...] which defines the endpoint. The technique is capable of very high precision, and coefficients of variance (CV's) of less than 0.1 are common. Modern thermometric titration temperature probes consist of a thermistor which forms one arm of a Wheatstone bridge. Coupled to high resolution electronics, the best thermometric titration systems can resolve temperatures to 10−5K. Sharp equivalence points have been obtained in titrations where the temperature change during the titration has been as little as 0.001K. The technique can be applied to essentially any chemical reaction in a fluid where there is an enthalpy change, although reaction kinetics can play a role in determining the sharpness of the endpoint. Thermometric titrimetry has been successfully applied to acid-base, redox, EDTA, and precipitation titrations. Examples of successful precipitation titrations are sulfate by titration with barium ions, phosphate by titration with magnesium in <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>solution,</b> chloride by titration with silver nitrate, nickel by titration with dimethylglyoxime and fluoride by titration with aluminium (as K2NaAlF6) Because the temperature probe does not need to be electrically connected to the solution (as in potentiometric titrations), non-aqueous titrations can be carried out as easily as aqueous titrations. Solutions which are highly colored or turbid can be analyzed by thermometric without further sample treatment. The probe is essentially maintenance-free. Using modern, high precision stepper motor driven burettes, automated thermometric titrations are usually complete in a few minutes, making the technique an ideal choice where high laboratory productivity is required.|$|E

In the perchlorate salt, only five electrons are transferred, however observations made on the mineral surface after leaching {{do not support the}} formation of elemental sulphur. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis of the mineral surface suggest presence of an iron–sulphur surface layer completely free of copper under the ammonia–ammonium sulphate conditions, an iron-rich surface layer under ammonia–ammonium perchlorate solutions and absence of surface layer build up under ammonia–ammonium carbonate solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissolution}} {{behavior of}} silver and copper from their elemental states and Ag/Cu alloys in <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>solutions</b> has been studied using rotating disk electrodes. The variables tudied included concentration of ammonia, oxygen partial pressure, and rotating speed of the disk. The results have been interpreted {{in terms of the}} mixed potential theory. The effect of local current resistance on the overall current has also been examined {{as a part of the}} governing theory of the dissolution. The dissolution rate of copper from the alloys in terms of the same area of the Cu-phase has been found to be higher than that from pure copper due to the galvanic oupling, and it increased with the increase of the silver content in the alloy. When the surface area fraction is about 0. 5, the galvanic urrent between the Ag- and Cu-phases is maximum. The dissolution of copper from its pure state and alloys is mainly oxygen diffusion controlled. Like pure silver, the dissolution of silver from its alloy is considered to be chemical reaction controlled...|$|R
