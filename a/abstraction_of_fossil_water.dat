40|$|The Quaternary {{deposits}} {{found in}} the Alnarp valley in southwestern Sweden have had the greatest influence on chloride values in shallow groundwater. This is mostly due {{to the presence of}} high permeability sands that enable efficient groundwater extraction, which leads to upconing and saltwater intrusion either because the piezometric levels are near the sea level or the extraction occurs near the ocean. Highly saline <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> has been found deep in the Scanian bedrock. The predominant hypothesis is that this <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> was formed by a combination of sea transgression over the land during the Mesozoic era and tectonic movement, which pushed the seawater deep underground. Meanwhile bedrock with low permeability has conserved the <b>fossil</b> <b>water.</b> Weathering <b>of</b> the Danian limestone bedrock increases the chloride content in groundwater due to ion exchange processes. However, in this case ion exchange in the bedrock only contributes a small portion of chloride to the groundwater in comparison to <b>fossil</b> <b>water.</b> Depth is a contributing factor to high chloride concentrations found in groundwater due to the presence <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>water,</b> which is seldom refreshed, and therefore remains saline. The calcium:sodium ratio is much higher in the deep groundwater compared with seawater. The potassium:sodium ratio is on the other hand, much lower. The salinity increases 100 g/L TDS per 1000 meter with depth. These results can be used for assessing the risk of upconing saline water in deeper wells for irrigation and drinking water supply...|$|R

40|$|The south {{sector of}} the Venice Lagoon {{mainland}} is a territory characterized {{by the presence of}} saline contamination. Sea water contamination is registered in groundwater near the coastline, and tidally dispersed sea water is usually found in the riverbeds, suspended above the surrounding land. Geophysical research, confirmed by some deep drillings, detected throughout the territory the existence of a deep salt-water aquifer storing <b>fossil</b> saline <b>water</b> at a depth of about 450 m. This research aimed to verify whether the deep <b>fossil</b> saline <b>water</b> could contribute to the salt contamination of the lagoonal mainland. Therefore, together with a critical revision of old geophysical data (vertical electric sounding -VES-, acquired during the 1970 s), new geophysical sounding and geochemical analysis were performed. The revision of the geophysical data shows the presence of a dislocation of the aquifer basement: a deep buried tectonic lineament seems to affect the salt-groundwater distribution, apart from the lateral and vertical variability of permeability and the textural pattern of the stratigraphic succession. Moreover, the geochemical-isotopic analyses show the presence <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> in the unconfined aquifer. Therefore, salt contamination may be due to saline ingression from the sea and the lagoon, and also by the mobilization <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> brines by means of a combined action of tectonics and fresh water dilution processes. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the real origin of saltwater by means of chemical and isotopic analysis of water samples collected all over the area, determining the groundwater age and chemical composition and therefore, distinguishing old <b>fossil</b> <b>waters</b> from actual marine water...|$|R

We analyze the performance of two species of mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. californianus, near a diffuser discharging produced water in the Southern California Bight, California. Produced water is a byproduct of oil production consisting <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> together with compounds added during the extraction process, and generally contains highly elevated levels of pollutants relative to sea water. Produced water negatively affects the production of somatic and reproductive biomass in both mussel species; we show that these negative effects can be quantified with our DEB-based modeling framework through the estimation of toxic effect scaling parameters. Our analyses reveal that the toxic impact of produced water on growth and reproduction of M. californianus is substantially higher than for M. galloprovincialis. Projections of the expected lifetime production of gonad biomass indicate that the environmental impact of produced water can be as large as 100 %, whereas short-term assessment without the use of DEB theory projects a maximum effect of only 30 %...|$|R
40|$|Lava-fed deltas are {{extraordinarily}} useful indicators <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>water</b> (and ice) {{levels in}} glacial, marine, and lacustrine environments. Deltas fed by ‘a‘ā lava {{should be at}} least as common as those sourced in pāhoehoe, yet they have been rarely described. Although facies models for pāhoehoe lava-fed deltas are well established, the architecture and lithofacies of ‘a‘ā-fed equivalents are substantially different and have thus far largely been unrecognized. This can have profound consequences for paleoenvironmental investigations, particularly those attempting to reconstruct past ice sheets. Essential features of ‘a‘ā lava-fed deltas include (1) a subaerial ‘a‘ā lava capping unit comprising massive internal sheet lava overlain by clinkers; (2) a crudely developed subaerial to subaqueous transition (passage zone); (3) a chaotic subaqueous association of abundant lava lobes and hyaloclastite with admixed vesicular, often reddened (oxidized) lava clinkers; and (4) rare subaqueous stratifi cation with predominantly lower dips (~ 10 °– 20 °) than in deltas fed by pāhoehoe lava (~ 25 °– 40 °).

500|$|When rain {{falls in}} deserts, as it {{occasionally}} does, {{it is often}} with great violence. The desert surface is evidence of this with dry stream channels known as arroyos or wadis meandering across its surface. These can experience flash floods, becoming raging torrents with surprising rapidity after a storm that may be many kilometers away. Most deserts are in basins with no drainage to the sea but some are crossed by exotic rivers sourced in mountain ranges or other high rainfall areas beyond their borders. The River Nile, the Colorado River and the Yellow River do this, losing much of their water through evaporation as they pass through the desert and raising groundwater levels nearby. There may also be underground sources of water in deserts {{in the form of}} springs, aquifers, underground rivers or lakes. Where these lie close to the surface, wells can be dug and oases may form where plant and animal life can flourish.

40|$|Water is {{a primary}} element in the human diet and a {{necessary}} resource for the agriculture. In addition, industrial practices need a growing amount of water. Since human population is continuously growing at a quasi-exponential rate, water demand, for domestic, agricultural and industrial uses, is increasing too. However, considering that the water resources on the Earth are finite, even disregarding the potential threats due to the climate change, this situation appears {{as one of the}} biggest challenges of the current era. Actually, one-third of the world’s population is water-stressed, of which 12 % severely: in these nations, a large portion of the population lives below the minimum threshold judged permissible for a decent life. In practice, almost every nation deals with problems related to water sustainability. In some countries, the water supply is ensured only thanks to the extraction <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>water,</b> which is a limited resource that will not last indefinitely. The impact on water quality has also dramatically increased. The scarcity of water resources is expected to spread to wider areas in the near future, mostly in developing countries, if the actual trends of development and population growth do not change. The rapid urbanizing rate will also create additional stress. Climate change can in turn alter both water supply and demand: increasing temperatures will reflect in increased evaporation and decreased stream flows. Rising seas could contaminate groundwater resources, and increasingly variable precipitation will likely mean more frequent high-intensity droughts and floods and less available rainfall in arid and semiarid regions. The effects of these changes will increase the natural variability of the climate, exacerbating the extreme climatic phenomena (drought and flood events), increasing the difficulty of managing water resources, especially in the most vulnerable regions, and affecting water availability even in regions that are not usually subjected to water shortage...|$|R

40|$|Water {{samples from}} 28 hotsprings and mineral springs in Nagano Prefecture, central Japan, were {{examined}} for their stable isotope ratios of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and sulfur. Spring waters of Kashio are highly saline and enriched in heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen (δ(18) O=- 2. 5 ～- 4. 6 ‰, δD=- 54 ～- 57 ‰). Linear relationships among δD, δ(18) O, and Cl(-) suggest that spring waters are the mixtures {{of a deep}} brine and local surface water. Extrapolation of the linear relationships indicates that the deep brine is both isotopically and chemically {{very similar to the}} deep brine previously suggested for the springs of Arima, Takarazuka, and Ishibotoke of which δD, δ(18) O, and Cl(-) are estimated as - 33 ‰, + 8. 0 ‰, and 44 g/l, respectively. A common origin may be warranted among these postulated brines, while their provenance is yet to be worked out. The hot springs in Matsushiro are a Na-Ca-Cl type of high carbonate content. Their hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios (δD=- 71 ～- 46 ‰, δ(18) O=- 9. 1 ～- 2. 0 ‰) are higher than the local surface water. On the basis of the relationships among δD, δ(18) O, and Cl(-), they are considered to be the mixtures <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> sea <b>water</b> and certain water of meteoric origin of which Cl(-) is about 4 g/l and δ(18) O is higher by about 3 ‰ than the local surface water. The latter may be meteoric water circulating in the marine sedimentary formations (Green Tuff formations) with soluble sea salts. Isotopic exchange with carbonate minerals in the formations explains its (18) O enrichment. Spring waters from Yashio and Isobe (Gunma Pref.) as well as Yunosawa and Yatate (Akita Pref.) were previously interpreted to be mixtures <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> sea <b>water</b> and local surface water of low Cl(-) content. Re-examination of their data revealed that the meteoric waters responsible for these springs contain about 3 g/l Cl(-), similar to the value obtained for Matsushiro.

40|$|The multi-layered {{aquifer systems}} of the Po Valley {{are one of the}} largest {{freshwater}} reserves in Europe. This aquifer {{plays a key role in}} supplying water in a densely populated area that suffer the intensive metropolisation processes. These are responsible for the enormous increase of water demand, of the hydrogeological risk and of the climate change which renders this aquifer more vulnerable. These challenges can be tackled thanks to an accurate reconstruction of the subsurface geological model of plain lowland areas such as the Padana Plain, North Italy, requires the employment of up-to-date non-invasive geophysical methods specifically designed to maximise the quantity of additional subsurface information to aid in the reconstruction of conceptual hydrogeologic and geochemical models necessary for further construction of hydrodynamic ones. The geoelectrical method, one of the oldest active, since 1926, and are most widely used geophysical techniques for the exploration of the subsurface at different depths: from few cm’s to thousands of meters depending, mainly among others, on the characteristics of the target especially those related to the presence of a measurable contrast of the physical property between target and surrounding materials. The Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and the less commonly used Electrical Induced Polarization (EIP) techniques shall be discussed through the presentation of some 2 D images obtained at a test site the framework of the work package, WARBO-Life+ EU project (concluded in 2015, [URL] related to the artificial recharge activities of an high salinity shallow subsurface aquifers. Such images, as shall we see later, allow for better visualization of lateral as well as vertical resistivity variations that can be interpreted in terms of lithology, saturation, physio-chemical modifications due to interaction with the natural and anthropogenic processes (Archie 1942; Mualem and Friedman, 1991; Ewing and Hunt 2006). All these factors represent in one way or another the ingredients that contribute in the reconstruction of a hydrogeological model especially where there is a need to characterize low land areas such as the Po Plain in northern Italy. In this area lateral and vertical lithologic variations are rarely uncommon. The sensibility of resistivity to groundwater saturation and quality, allowed their use since the sixties of the last century to map freshwater-saltwater interface mainly along coast lines. Further hardware and software advancements permitted the extension of their use to achieve suggestive 2 D, 3 D and recently 4 D images of the resistivity and, less common, chargeability distribution in the subsurface. The 4 D imaging, has recently been utilized to capture temporal resistivity variations of the subsurface resistivity provoked either naturally or artificially. As an example we present the application of static and dynamic ERT surveys carried out in a test site located at Copparo town, NE Italy (Fig. 1), Artificial Recharge (A. R.) operations were experimented to counteract the effect of undergoing salinization process of the shallow and the first semi-confined aquifer. It worth’s mentioning that this site is located at more than 60 km to the west of the Adriatic Sea coast. The high salinity is due to the plume <b>of</b> methane <b>fossil</b> <b>waters</b> that rise to the surface along tectonic discontinuities, stratigraphic gaps and mining wells abandoned in 1962 since it was forbidden the methane extraction to prevent subsidence induced by the overexploitation and to mitigate the salinization of channels for the irrigation and of green farmland induced by the dispersion <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>waters</b> that are very rich in chlorides, bromides and metals toxic to the environment and health (Sciarra et al 2015). The geochemical characterization of confined aquifers of the Po Valley in the northern sector of the Ferrara territory have identified in the deep <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> alluvial aquifers the contamination source that causes widespread salinization (Sciarra, 2015, Bonzi et al 2016). The Dominant ions of deep wells are rich in sodium chlorides and bicarbonates of magnesium and calcium (Mg/Ca ratio is about 1. 5) and significant are the amounts of Potassium. Very low is the concentration of sulphates. In fact, a new discipline of research projects has been developed in this direction in the last few years whose aim is to Manage Artificial Recharge activities (MAR projects, (Nieto et al 2012, Pezzi et al., 2014). This means that their use do not focus only on the geometrical definition of aquifer boundaries but goes a step further towards monitoring the dynamic behaviour of the salinization/de-salinization process in strict relation to the modality being used for A. R. Within this context, the main focus of the present work is to present and discuss the use of these techniques as a cost-effective tool for the monitoring of A.
