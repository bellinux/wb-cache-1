5|$|The {{book was}} written {{in the context of the}} natural {{theology}} tradition. In earlier centuries, theologians such as John Ray and William Derham, as well as philosophers of classical times such as Cicero, argued for the existence <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> of God from the general well-being of living things and the physical world.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{its history}} Goofus and Gallant has been {{interpreted}} as an effective didactic comic.

5|$|Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth <b>and</b> <b>Goodness</b> is {{the only}} {{complete}} work of children's literature by the 18th-century English feminist author Mary Wollstonecraft. Original Stories begins with a frame story that sketches out the education of two young girls by their maternal teacher Mrs. Mason, followed {{by a series of}} didactic tales. The book was first published by Joseph Johnson in 1788; a second, illustrated edition, with engravings by William Blake, was released in 1791 and remained in print for around a quarter of a century.|$|E

5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of {{accessing}} the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E
5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity <b>and</b> <b>goodness.</b> Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, {{remaining}} on Earth, {{as a living}} being surrounded by a working ecosystem, is a fair statement {{of the most basic}} values <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> to any being we are able to communicate with. A moral system without this axiom seems simply not actionable.|$|E
25|$|By prayer one {{acknowledges}} God's power <b>and</b> <b>goodness,</b> and one's own neediness and dependence. It {{is therefore}} {{an act of}} the virtue of religion implying the deepest reverence for God and habituating a person to look to him for everything. Prayer presupposes faith in God and hope in his goodness. By both, God, to whom one prays, moves the individual to prayer.|$|E
25|$|The books {{now known}} as the Corpus Hermeticum were part of a renaissance of syncretistic and intellectualized pagan thought that took place from the 3rd to the 7th centuryAD. These post-Christian Greek texts dwell upon the oneness <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> of God, urge {{purification}} of the soul, and defend pagan religious practices such as the veneration of images. Their predominant literary form is the dialogue: Hermes Trismegistus instructs a perplexed disciple upon various teachings of the hidden wisdom.|$|E

40|$|Introduction to the Scientific Proof of the Natural Moral Law This paper {{proves that}} Aquinas has {{a means of}} demonstrating and {{deriving}} both moral <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> the natural moral law from human nature alone. Aquinas scientifically proves {{the existence of the}} natural moral law as the natural rule of human operations from human nature alone. The distinction between moral <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> transcendental <b>goodness</b> is affirmed. This provides the intellectual tools to refute the G. E. Moore (Principles of Ethics) attack against the natural law as committing a "naturalistic fallacy". This article proves that instead Moore commits the fallacy of equivocation between moral <b>goodness</b> <b>and</b> transcendental <b>goodness</b> in his very assertion of a "naturalistic fallacy" by the proponents of the natural moral law. In the process the new deontological/kantian theory of natural law as articulated by John Finnis, Robert George, and Germain Grisez is false historically and philosophically. Ethical naturalism is affirmed as a result...|$|R

25|$|Franklin {{formulated}} {{a presentation}} of his beliefs and published it in 1728. It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas as regards belief in salvation, the divinity of Jesus, and indeed most religious dogma. He clarified himself as a deist in his 1771 autobiography, although he still considered himself a Christian. He retained a strong faith in a God as the wellspring of morality <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> in man, and as a Providential actor in history responsible for American independence.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the first}} heroic horses {{emerged from the}} silent film era, they were {{prominently}} featured in the B-Westerns of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. During {{the early decades of}} sound film, cowboy movies targeted a juvenile demographic. The film's heroes were generally one-dimensional, stock characters who represented and promoted truth <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> to their young audience. More popular with adolescent viewers than a human sidekick, the Wonder Horse could not only outrun the mounts of the villains, but could also perform a series of feats and tricks to ensure that the cowboy hero would triumph.|$|E
25|$|Syrian-Egyptian Gnosticism {{includes}} Sethianism, Valentinianism, Basilideans, Thomasine traditions, and Serpent Gnostics, {{as well as}} {{a number}} of other minor groups and writers. Hermeticism is also a western Gnostic tradition, though it differs in some respects from these other groups. The Syrian–Egyptian school derives much of its outlook from Platonist influences. It depicts creation in a series of emanations from a primal monadic source, finally resulting in the creation of the material universe. These schools tend to view evil in terms of matter that is markedly inferior to goodness and lacking spiritual insight <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> rather than as an equal force.|$|E

25|$|Lopez dives {{into more}} detail about this conflict, {{focusing}} on the death and destruction that Sonnet 60 describes The second quatrain explains life's cycle, presenting the journey from birth to death and from sunrise to eclipse or sunset as ways to explicate the feeling of loss after having so much. It culminates in the pessimism that all that was ever had, has been or will be lost. He explains the third quatrain as the degradation of his fascination's beauty, that the weapons that time methodically uses to slowly strip what the speaker values is a crushing blow. The completeness of time's destruction is made clear as if man's beauty <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> are created only for time to demolish.|$|E

At the same time, according to its ideal imaginary political vision of a prosperous city-state, Dubravka is a kind of utopia; its a hymn to the ideal social order and to {{the best of all possible}} countries ruled by divine principles of fairness, honesty, beauty <b>and</b> <b>goodness.</b> With the pastoral story line set in a timeless, mythical world of eternal love and freedom, in the allegorical tone, Gundulić sets his work in the specific time and place and gives it the moral, political and ethical meaning of his time, noting also its advantages and disadvantages.|$|E

500|$|The {{script was}} {{intentionally}} {{written in a}} way that promoted the empowerment of women in Indian society (including the power to resist sexual advances) and the maintenance of a sense of moral dignity and purpose as individuals; this was contrary to what Mayo had claimed in her book.

500|$|In fact, Cobb has not {{shied away}} even from re-imaging {{what is now}} {{regarded}} as the “traditional” Christian notion of God. [...] He {{does not believe that}} God is omnipotent in the sense of having unilateral control over all events, since Cobb sees reconciling total coercive power with love <b>and</b> <b>goodness</b> to be an impossible task. [...] Instead, all creatures are viewed as having some degree of freedom that God cannot override. [...] Cobb solves the problem of evil by denying God’s omnipotence, stressing instead that God’s power is persuasive rather than coercive, that God can influence creatures but not determine what they become or do. [...] For Cobb, God’s role is to liberate and empower.|$|E
