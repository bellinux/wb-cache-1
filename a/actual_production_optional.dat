40|$|Development {{of plywood}} {{industries}} {{should not be}} rated from the increase of ply mill number and the production aspects alone, but there is other indicators that need {{be taken into consideration}} such as productivity and efficiency factors. High productivity and efficiency would bring more profit to the company and save the existing national resources. In this report some results of productivity analysis is presented based on ratio of <b>actual</b> <b>production</b> over break even point (BEP) production level, and efficiency analysis is presented based on ration of <b>actual</b> <b>production</b> over production capacity level, ratio of output value over input value, and added value of logs processed into plywood criteria. Based on criteria as mentioned above it can be concluded that all six visited plymills on the average have fairly high productivity and efficiency, but utilization rate of existing production capacity is still low. The average ratio of <b>actual</b> <b>production</b> over BEP production is 2. 48 with range 1. 35 ­ 3. 28 (coefficient of variation 29 %), the average ratio of <b>actual</b> <b>production</b> over production capacity is 0. 64 with range 0. 25 ­ 0. 91 (coefficient of variation 50 %), the average ratio of output value over input value is 1. 27 with range 1. 07 ­ 1. 38 (coefficient of variation 10 %), while the average of added value of logs to plywood is 70 % with range 17 % - 112 % (coefficient of variation 21 %) ...|$|R

When information about costs is incomplete, {{the location of a}} plant will be chosen not only for its impact on <b>actual</b> <b>production</b> costs, but also for Its impact on the perception of costs as held by foreign rivals. We show that the latter consideration, which can arise only in the presence of asymmetric information about costs, may lead to a decision to multinationalize even though <b>actual</b> <b>production</b> costs are higher as a result. As such, the informational role of plant location decisions is a potentially important element in understanding the behavior of the multinational firm. ...|$|R
