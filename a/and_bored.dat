He publishes an advertisement looking for adventure, and soon finds himself embroiled {{in a series of}} exploits, many of which involve Carl Peterson—who becomes his nemesis—and Peterson's mistress, the femme fatale Irma.

5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated <b>and</b> <b>bored</b> by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.|$|E
5|$|With {{his film}} career behind him, Whale found himself at a loose end. He {{was offered the}} {{occasional}} job, including the opportunity to direct Since You Went Away for David O. Selznick, but turned them down. Lewis, meanwhile, was busier than ever with his production duties and often worked late hours, leaving Whale lonely <b>and</b> <b>bored.</b> Lewis bought him a supply of paint and canvasses and Whale re-discovered his love of painting. Eventually he built a large studio for himself.|$|E

At Jones' hotel room, Nemo is murdered while taking a bath, and his body is dumped in the woods.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, <b>and</b> <b>bored.</b> You know? So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich <b>and</b> <b>bored</b> housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E

25|$|From the 1948–49 {{series against}} West Indies, Vizzy became a radio {{commentator}} {{and was the}} guest commentator for BBC during the Indian tour of England in 1959. He was not a particularly good commentator. According to Dickie Rutnagur, when Vizzy had just finished describing how he had hunted tigers, Rohan Kanhai responded: Really?

25|$|On March 4, 1971, while Prime Minister, {{he quietly}} married Margaret Sinclair at St. Stephen's Catholic church in North Vancouver. Contrary to his publicized exploits, Trudeau was an intense {{intellectual}} with intense work habits and {{little time for}} family or fun, and she felt trapped <b>and</b> <b>bored</b> in the marriage, feelings that were exacerbated by her retroactively diagnosed bipolar depression. After three children, 23rd and current Prime Minister Justin (born 1971), Alexandre (Sacha, born 1973), and Michel (1975–1998), the couple separated in 1977 and were finally divorced in 1984.|$|E

However, Gaunt finds himself drawn into a plot involving a traitor general of the arch-enemy and the Blood Pact assassins sent to silence him.

25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing {{a sense of}} mastery over sexual impulses, {{and it has a}} role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or the child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated <b>and</b> <b>bored.</b> Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Ministers {{reported}} that the colonists were typically inattentive, uninterested, <b>and</b> <b>bored</b> during church services. According to the ministers' complaints, the people were sleeping, whispering, ogling the fashionably-dressed women, walking about and coming and going, or at best looking out the windows or staring blankly into space. By 1740, the acute shortage of clergy was easing, and by 1776, there were more Anglican clergy living in Virginia than there were parishes. Devout parishioners used the Book of Common Prayer for private prayer and devotion. This allowed devout Anglicans to lead an active and sincere religious life {{in addition to the}} formal church services. However the stress on private devotion weakened the need for a bishop or a large institutional church of the sort Blair wanted. The stress on personal piety opened the way for the First Great Awakening, which pulled people away from the established church.|$|E
25|$|Fassbinder's second film, Katzelmacher (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang {{term for}} a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was {{received}} more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at Mannheim. It features a group of rootless <b>and</b> <b>bored</b> young couples who {{spend much of their}} time in idle chatter, empty boasting, drinking, playing cards, intriguing or simply sitting around. The arrival of Jorgos, a guest worker from Greece, leads to a growing curiosity {{on the part of the}} women and the antagonism among the men living in a suburban block of apartments in Munich. This kind of social criticism, featuring alienated characters unable to escape the forces of oppression, is a constant throughout Fassbinder's oeuvre. Katzelmacher was adapted from Fassbinder's first produced play – a short piece that was expanded from forty minutes to feature length, moving the action from a country village to Munich and delaying the appearance of Jorgos.|$|E

25|$|Three editions were {{published}} 1929–1931 in English and German. The British Library holds a reference copy. In this whodunit novel, private detective Will Disher {{is described as}} suave, plump, astute <b>and</b> <b>bored,</b> but Scotland Yard still asks him for help in solving the mystery. The plot begins with the masked-murderer scenario, this one being a toff in evening dress. Much of the plot takes place in an English country house, {{and some of it}} is set in London, but the general setting is the marshland just south of Herne Bay and Birchington in Kent. Real local place names such as Maypole, Whitstable and Stodmarsh are transmuted into fictional places with names such as the Hope Poles Inn, Winstonlea and Stodmere Farm, and a chase through countryside at night evokes the true atmosphere of the marshes around the rivers Stour and Wantsum with their dykes or banked drainage trenches, twisting lanes and dark woods.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1948 he arrived in Italy and visited Fossalta where in 1918 he had been wounded. A month later, while duck hunting with an Italian aristocrat he met 18-year-old Adriana Ivancich. He and his then wife Mary then went to Cortina to ski: she broke her ankle <b>and,</b> <b>bored,</b> Hemingway began the draft of the book. Hemingway himself then became ill with an eye {{infection}} and was hospitalized. In the spring he went to Venice where he ate lunch with Adriana a few times. In May he returned to Cuba and carried out a protracted correspondence with her while working on the manuscript. In the autumn he had returned to Europe and at the Ritz in Paris he finished the draft. Once done, he and Mary went again to Cortina to ski: {{for the second time}} she broke her ankle and he contracted an eye infection. By February the first serialization was published in Cosmopolitan and in March the Hemingways returned to Paris and then home to Cuba where the final proofs were read before the September publication.|$|E
