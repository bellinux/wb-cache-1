50|$|<b>Acedoben</b> (4-acetamidobenzoic acid) is a {{chemical}} compound with the molecular formula of C9H9NO3. It is the acetyl derivative of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA).|$|E
5000|$|Inosine pranobex (BAN; {{also known}} as inosine <b>acedoben</b> {{dimepranol}} (INN) or methisoprinol) an antiviral drug that {{is a combination of}} inosine and dimepranol <b>acedoben</b> (a salt of acetamidobenzoic acid and dimethylaminoisopropanol) in a ratio of 1 to 3. Inosine pranobex has no effect on viral particles itself. Instead, it acts as a immunostimulant, an analog of thymus hormones. [...] It is most commonly used to treat the rare measles complication subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in conjunction with intrathecal interferon therapy.|$|E
5000|$|Dimethylaminoisopropanol is a {{chemical}} compound with the molecular formula C5H13NO that {{is classified as}} an amino alcohol. It {{is used as a}} building block in organic synthesis. [...] Under the name dimepranol, it is also used as an ingredient in some pharmaceutical formulations such as dimepranol <b>acedoben,</b> a component of inosine pranobex.|$|E
40|$|Inosine pranobex (inosine {{dimepranol}} <b>acedoben,</b> isoprinosine) (Inos) is an immunomodulatory and {{antiviral drug}} {{used in some}} viral infections, especially in patients with weakened immunity. In the present study, effects of Inos on the production of cytokines attributable to Th 1 (IL- 2, IFN-g, and TNF-a) or Th 2 cells (IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 10) were tested in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Inos enhanced TNF-a secretion significantly (in short-term - 24 -hour, and prolonged term - 72 -hour cultures) and IFN-g (in 72 -hour cultures). Surprisingly, production of IL- 10 by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was suppressed by Inos in a dose-dependent manner in both 24 -hour and 72 -hour cultures. These results {{shed some light on}} immunomodulatory properties of Inos and suggest applicability of this agent in patients with a depressed function of the immune system...|$|E
