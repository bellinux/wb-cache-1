5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore {{the fact that}} the composer is still a respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> congratulation than regret... Mr. Sibelius is a fine musical constructionist, an eloquent harmonist and a fine colorist despite his fondness for dark tints.|$|E
5|$|At the age {{of eight}} the younger Reginald began {{attending}} the local grammar school at Whitchurch, where he remained for five years. In 1796 {{he was sent to}} Bristow's, a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London. This establishment provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge universities. At Bristow's Reginald met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend. The pair shared a lively interest in church history and beliefs; a lengthy letter, written by Heber to Thornton, is described by Heber's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being worthy of a learned theologian. In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College, Oxford; Thornton's decision to go to Cambridge was <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> Heber's considerable regret.|$|E
5|$|Como died in {{his sleep}} on May 12, 2001, {{at his home in}} Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida, six days before his 89th birthday. He was {{reported}} to have suffered from symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Como's older son, Ronnie, and his daughter, Terri, could not agree on their interpretations of Como's 1999 living will and it became <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> the courts in the year before his death. His funeral Mass took place at St. Edward's Catholic Church in Palm Beach, Florida. Como and his wife, Roselle are buried at Riverside Memorial Park, Tequesta (Palm Beach County), Florida.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 19th century, {{there were}} very few schools. Most of those that existed were run by the church, for the church, {{stressing}} religious education. In {{the latter part of the}} 19th Century, compulsory attendance at school ceased to be <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> local option, with the introduction of the Elementary Education Act 1870 a milestone in the British school education system. Children had to attend between the ages of 5 and 10 though with some local discretion such as early leaving in agricultural areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} of De Mauro remained a mystery and <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> many speculations. In May 1994 Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta {{declared that the}} Sicilian Mafia {{had been involved in}} the murder of Mattei. He also claimed that De Mauro was killed because of his investigations into the death of Mattei. According to Buscetta, Mattei was killed {{at the request of the}} American Cosa Nostra because his oil policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East. The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the large oil companies.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} English Church {{had been}} <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> great debate in the {{years prior to the}} 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had {{traditionally}} exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.|$|E

25|$|The role {{of women}} in ancient warfare {{differed}} from culture to culture. Warfare throughout written history mainly has been portrayed in modern times as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> men, but women also have played a role.

50|$|Calvinism has {{traditionally}} always asserted that engaging in premarital {{sex is a}} sin. Calvin himself said little on why he thought engaged couples should not have sex and Witte believes his rationale for the prohibition was vague but he did seek to reduce the length of engagements among couples in Geneva to less than six weeks, to reduce the temptation of premarital sex. He agreed, though, with Luther that marriage was <b>a</b> legal <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> the state, not <b>a</b> sacramental <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> the church.|$|R

25|$|In Scotland and Northern Ireland, no banknotes, {{not even}} those issued in those countries, are legal tender.

However, new co-counsellors are encouraged not to develop new non-co-counselling relationships with other co-counsellors until they have more experience and experienced co-counsellors will often have people with whom they only have a co-counselling relationship. Teachers of co-counselling are strongly discouraged from having sexual relationships with people they have taught.|$|E
