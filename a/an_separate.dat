Before Constructing the Temple in Alagramam Village People who was living in Alagramam used to go for Keezh Idayalam Jain Temple or Avani Avittam to Wear Poonal. After Some Years Alagramam Jain People Decided To Built An Temple in Alagramam Village. On the Day Of Avani Avittam they took An Small Lord Parshwanath Idol from Keezh Idayalam Temple To Alagramam And Build An Small Temple on the Occasion of Avani Avittam to Wear Poonal.

At this point the party had two representatives in the Federal Assembly, five in the Czech National Council, and 25 local branches with a membership of between 1300 and 5000. However, the party struggled to survive outside of Civic Forum, and was dependent on support from the German Free Democratic Party. The party elected a new leader, Viktorie Hradská (born 1944), in November 1991, but soon split, with Hradská's faction soon merging with the Civic Democratic Alliance.|$|E

50|$|The {{area has}} been {{inhabited}} since the fifth century BCE. Its name comes from Nahuatl, meaning “where water is gathered.” From the colonial period {{to the beginning of}} the 20th century, Tacubaya was <b>an</b> <b>separate</b> entity to Mexico City and many of the city’s wealthy, including viceroys, built residences here to enjoy the area’s scenery. From the mid-19th century on, Tacubaya began to urbanize both due to the growth of Mexico City and the growth of its own population. Along with this urbanization, the area has degraded into one of the poorer sections of the city and contains the “La Ciudad Perdida” (The Lost City), a shantytown where people live in shacks of cardboard and other materials. Many of the mansions that were built here in the 19th century remain, such as the Casa Amarilla and Casa de la Bola, but most Mexico City residents are familiar with it due to its transportation hub on Avenida Jalisco where the Metro, Metrobus and many street buses all converge.|$|E

5000|$|The 40th {{anniversary of}} the coup in 2013 was {{particularly}} intense. That year the name of Avenida 11 de Septiembre was reversed to the original Avenida Nueva Providencia. The Association of Chilean Magistrates issued a public statement in early September 2013 recognizing the past unwillingness of judges to protect those persecuted by dictatorship. On September 11, 2013 hundreds of Chileans posed as dead {{in the streets of}} Santiago in remeberance of the ones [...] "dissapeared" [...] by the dictatorship. The Chilean opposition refused to attend the conmemoration event organized by Sebastián Piñera's right-wing government organizing <b>an</b> <b>separate</b> event. President Piñera held an unusual speech in which he denounced [...] "passive accomplices" [...] like news reporters who deliberately changed or omitted the truth and judges who rejected recursos de amparos that could have saved lives. People who knew things or could have known things but decided to stay quiet were also criticized as passive accomplices in Piñera's speech. A number of new films, theatre plays and photography expositions were held to cast light on the abuses and censorship of the dictatorship. The number of new books published on the subject in 2013 was such that it constituted an editorial boom. Conferences and seminaries on the subject of coup were also held. Chilean TV aired interviews with politicians and series on the subject.|$|E

Methods of analysis and synthesis from is used in the diploma thesis. These are the findings from literature, questionnaire and archive survey. The outcome of the thesis is that by consistent archiving of all proper evidence used on income tax, can significantly improve the proofing proces used on value added tax and vice versa. The recommendation is to create <b>an</b> <b>separate</b> archive where the tax entity keeps the all primary documents and proper evidence, which would also have the effect on reduction the compliance costs incurred in the tax proceeding...|$|E

By unfolding methods from photography, threshold  spaces can be enhanced. Working in-between mediums such as photography, drawing and models. Transforming the findings into new space. I want to invite the visitors into a moment, going through, inside and around the space.   Working with photography I highlight different parts to later take it further into 3 D modeling, to show my findings in the image. After this translation in the digital world, it comes back to the analogue world again. Here it’s possible to work in a less controlled way than in the computer. So the method goes through different stages in representations from 2 D analogue to 3 D modeling. ...|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{knowledge}} is used extensively in developing road safety policy, yet, {{at the same}} time, specific factors could improve {{the use of this}} knowledge even further.

Other important factors are institutional factors. Road safety policy is often determined on various government levels, focuses on the integration of road safety in other policy domains and deals with political arguments. Road safety knowledge, on the other hand, more often focuses on the national level, on road safety as <b>an</b> <b>separate</b> subject and on technocratic arguments. In order to improve the use of scientific knowledge in road safety policy, more knowledge should be developed specifically for regional and local governments.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} between the factors of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and the 11 -year solar cycle is considered as <b>an</b> <b>separate</b> factor influencing the interannual January-March variations of total ozone over Northeastern Europe. Linear correlation analysis and the running correlation method are used to examine possible connections between ozone and solar activity at simultaneous moment the QBO phase. Statistically significant correlations between the variations of total ozone in February and, partially, in March, and the sunspot numbers during the different phases of QBO are found. The running correlation method between the ozone and the equatorial zonal wind demonstrates a clear modulation of 11 -y solar signal for February and March. Modulation is clearer if the QBO phases are defined {{at the level of}} 50 hPa rather than at 30 hPa. The same statistical analyses are conducted also for possible connections between the index of stratospheric circulation C 1 and sunspot numbers considering the QBO phase. Statistically significant connections are found for February. The running correlations between the index C 1 and the equatorial zonal wind show the clear modulation of 11 -y solar signal for February and March. Based on the obtained correlations between the interannual variations of ozone and index C 1, it may be concluded that a connection between solar cycle ? QBO ? ozone occurs through the dynamics of stratospheric circulation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prognosis}} {{of patients}} with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is variable, despite a myriad of prognostic markers. We compared and integrated the established prognostic models, HAP and ART scores, for their accuracy of overall survival (OS) prediction. RESULTS: In both training and validation sets, HAP and ART scores emerged as independent predictors of OS (p< 0. 01) with HAP achieving better prognostic accuracy (c-index: 0. 68) over ART (0. 57). We tested both scores in combination to evaluate their combined ability to predict OS. Subgroup analysis of BCLC-C patients revealed favorable HAP stage (p< 0. 001) and radiological response after initial TACE (p< 0. 001) as positive prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prognostic scores were studied using multivariable Cox regression and c-index analysis in 83 subjects with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) A/B stage from UK and Italy (training set), and 660 from Korea and Japan (validation set), all treated with conventional TACE. Scores were further validated in <b>an</b> <b>separate</b> analysis of patients with BCLC-C stage disease (n= 63) receiving initial TACE. CONCLUSION: ART and HAP scores are validated indices in patients with intermediate stage HCC undergoing TACE. The HAP score is best suited for screening patients prior to initial TACE, whilst sequential ART assessment improves early detection of chemoembolization failure. BCLC-C patients with low HAP stage may be a subgroup where TACE should be explored in clinical studies...|$|E
