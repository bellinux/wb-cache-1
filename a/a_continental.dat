5|$|In the finals, Atlético faced Olimpia for {{the second}} time in <b>a</b> <b>continental</b> decision, and the Paraguayan club won the first leg, played at the Defensores del Chaco, by 20. The competition's rules demanded a stadium with at least a {{capacity}} of 40,000 for the finals, and the second leg was played at the Mineirão. A Jô goal in the beginning of the second half, and a header by Leonardo Silva at the 87th minute, equalised the aggregate, and the match ended with the same score after extra-time. The title was decided by a penalty shootout, which Atlético Mineiro won 43 to claim its first Copa Libertadores trophy. Jô was the top goalscorer in the competition with seven goals, and Victor was selected as the tournament's best goalkeeper. The team's victory also ensured awards for Atlético players at <b>a</b> <b>continental</b> level: Ronaldinho was named South American Footballer of the Year and selected for the continent's ideal team of 2013, along with Bernard, Réver, Marcos Rocha and Jô.|$|E

His unassuming style, however, has also led to a lack of attention from successive England national football team managers in favour of all-action midfielders such as Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, a fact noted by Carrick's club and national team captain Wayne Rooney.|$|E

He struck up a friendship with Cranmer and after his return to Basel, he wrote about Cranmer to the German reformer Martin Bucer in Strasbourg. Grynaeus' early contacts initiated Cranmer's eventual relationship with the Strasbourg and Swiss reformers.|$|E
