5|$|Steph is {{diagnosed}} with cervical cancer {{and does not}} tell Gilly, who later finds out from Cheryl. Gilly is angry at Steph for keeping this from him. Steph undergoes <b>a</b> <b>hysterectomy</b> to remove the cancer. However, doctors tell her and Gilly it failed. She is soon told her cancer is terminal. Gilly takes the news bad. The pair split up when Steph feels it is unfair on Gilly, but they get back together and start to plan their wedding. Gilly and Steph eventually get married beside the village river.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{because there}} is less {{interference}} with the bladder's nerve supply, there should also be fewer de novo cases of vesicourethral dysfunction [4].

25|$|After {{hysterectomy}} for benign indications {{the majority}} of women report improvement in sexual life and pelvic pain.

A proportion of patients who undergo <b>a</b> <b>hysterectomy</b> for chronic pelvic pain continue to suffer from pelvic pain after <b>a</b> <b>hysterectomy</b> and develop dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse).|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} factors influencing the choice between different approaches in hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 285 women who had undergone hysterectomy for uterine fibroids at the Liverpool Hospital, New South Wales, Australia. Results: This study shows that several factors influenced the choice of hysterectomy approach. First, concomitant adnexal surgery increased the likelihood of undergoing <b>an</b> abdominal <b>hysterectomy</b> rather than either a vaginal or <b>a</b> laparoscopic <b>hysterectomy</b> by 10 - and fivefold (both p  280  g) had a 20 (p <  0. 05) and 10 (p <  0. 01) times greater chance of undergoing <b>an</b> abdominal <b>hysterectomy</b> than either <b>a</b> vaginal or <b>a</b> laparoscopic <b>hysterectomy,</b> respectively. Third, gynecologic endoscopists were more likely to perform laparoscopic hysterectomy than gynecologic generalists (p <  0. 001). Conclusion: Certain clinical parameters determine the choice of hysterectomy approach. Surgeons' expertise also has significant influence over the choice between laparoscopic and traditional approaches for hysterectomy...|$|R

25|$|Most {{bilateral}} oophorectomies (63%) {{are performed}} without any medical indication, most (87%) were performed together with <b>a</b> <b>hysterectomy.</b> Conversely, unilateral oophorectomy is commonly performed {{for a medical}} indication (73%; cyst, endometriosis, benign tumor, inflammation, etc.) and less commonly in conjunction with hysterectomy (61%).|$|E

30|$|In the Finnish study, no {{distinction}} was made between vaginal, abdominal, or laparoscopic hysterectomy. The vaginal hysterectomy reduces hospital stay compared to abdominal hysterectomy, whereas {{the duration of}} the surgical procedure of <b>a</b> vaginal <b>hysterectomy</b> is shorter than the duration of <b>a</b> laparoscopically-assisted <b>hysterectomy</b> (LAVH) [15]. An economic evaluation comparing LAVH and abdominal hysterectomy showed LAVH to be significantly more expensive [16]. These two studies support the conclusion that the vaginal hysterectomy is the most cost-effective route for <b>hysterectomy.</b> <b>As</b> far as we know, a comparison of the cost of vaginal hysterectomy with those of abdominal hysterectomy and LAVH has not been performed. Theoretically, <b>an</b> uncomplicated vaginal <b>hysterectomy</b> can result in a day-care hospital admittance and will substantially reduce the costs. However, Fig.  1 b shows that hysterectomy will be cost-effective if this major operation does not cost more than € 2000.|$|R

25|$|In rare cases, {{oophorectomy}} {{can be used}} {{to treat}} endometriosis by eliminating the menstrual cycle, which will reduce or eliminate the spread of existing endometriosis as well as reducing pain.
