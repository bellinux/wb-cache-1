The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E

25|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1908, Girault vividly described {{an encounter with}} bedbugs in 1907 {{in a hotel room}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was reluctant to sleep on the bed after discovering the bedbugs as he entered the room a little after midnight. He eventually decided to keep the lights on and to lie <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> without getting under the covers. He slept fitfully, constantly waking up to find bedbugs scurrying away after feeding on him. At 3:30 AM, he eventually gave up and slept on a rocking chair. Despite the discomfort, he systematically described the behaviour and stages of maturity of the bedbugs, the general conditions of the room, and attempted to search for eggs and moultings of the insects.|$|E
25|$|Late 20th century domestic/studio models {{typically}} use up to 200 latch-hook needles to {{hold the}} stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or cam box is passed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} needle hook (tuck stitch). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping. In the most modern machines, punchcards have been replaced by computer control.|$|E
40|$|A set of peat column {{experiments}} {{was used}} to determine the transport potential of lead (Pb) and diesel range organics (DRO) in palustrine slope wetlands near Juneau, AK. This project is important to southeast Alaskan communities because limited land resources are forcing development of regional wetlands. This study was instigated by concerns that proposed modifications to a nearby rifle range using DRO-contaminated soil posed a potential risk to an anadromous fish-bearing stream 250 m from the site. Three pairs of peat columns were extracted from the rifle range for analysis, one pair along and two pairs <b>across</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>bedding</b> planes of <b>the</b> soil. One column in each pair was spiked with Pb and DRO and the other was used as a control. Approximately 1 -year worth of water (171 cm) was passed through each column and leachate was collected at regular intervals. The results showed that substantial DRO transport only occurred along <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> planes. Leads was surprisingly mobile, both along and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> planes with estimated soil–water partition coefficients several orders of magnitude lower than commonly published values, probably because the peat was heavily Pb-loaded by lead from bullets and because the peat’s acidic, organic-rich environment enhanced Pb mobility.

500|$|The Nightmare likely {{influenced}} Mary Shelley in a {{scene from}} her famous Gothic novel Frankenstein (1818). Shelley would have been familiar with the painting; her parents, Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, knew Fuseli. The iconic imagery associated with the Creature's murder of the protagonist Victor's wife seems to draw from the canvas: [...] "She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> her head hanging down, and her pale and distorted features half covered by hair." [...] The novel and Fuseli's biography share a parallel theme: just as Fuseli's incubus is infused with the artist's emotions in seeing Landholdt marry another man, Shelley's monster promises to get revenge on Victor {{on the night of}} his wedding. Like Frankenstein's monster, Fuseli's demon symbolically seeks to forestall a marriage.|$|E
2500|$|Dewey's wife Frances died in July 1970, after battling {{breast cancer}} for six years. In {{the autumn of}} 1970, Dewey began to date actress Kitty Carlisle, and {{there was talk of}} {{marriage}} between them. On March 15, 1971, Dewey traveled to Miami, Florida for a brief golfing vacation with friend Dwayne Andreas and other associates. On March 16, following a round of golf with Boston Red Sox player Carl Yastrzemski, he returned to his room in the Seaview Hotel to pack; he was due that evening at the White House in Washington to help celebrate the engagement of President Nixon's daughter, Tricia. When Dewey failed to appear for his ride to the Miami airport, a concerned Andreas convinced the hotel management to take him to Dewey's room. They found Dewey's body, fully dressed, lying on his back <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and packed to leave. An autopsy determined that he had died suddenly from a massive heart attack. He was 68 years old, dying eight days before his 69th birthday. Following a public memorial service at Saint James' Episcopal Church in New York City, which was attended by President Nixon, former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and other prominent politicians, Dewey was buried next to his wife Frances in the town cemetery of Pawling, New York. [...] After his death, his farm of Dapplemere was sold and renamed [...] "Dewey Lane Farm" [...] in his honor.|$|E

50|$|Cuestas are the {{expression}} of extensive outcrops of gently dipping strata, typically sedimentary strata, that consist of alternating beds of weak or loosely cemented strata, i.e. shale, mudstone, and marl and hard, well-lithified strata, i.e. sandstone and limestone. The surfaces of the hard, erosion-resistant rock strata form the caprock of the backslope (dip-slope) of the cuesta, where erosion has preferentially removed the weaker strata. The frontslope of the cuesta consists of an escarpment that cuts <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> of <b>the</b> strata comprising it. Because of the gently dipping nature of the strata that forms a cuesta, a significant shift in horizontal location will take place as the landscape is lowered by erosion. Because the slope of a cuesta dips {{in the same direction}} as the sedimentary strata, the dip angle of this bedding (θ) can be calculated by (v / h) = tan(θ) where v is equal to the vertical distance and h is equal to the horizontal distance perpendicular to the strike of <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Generic-Safety-Issue (GSI) 191 study is to {{determine}} if the transport and accumulation of debris in containment following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) will impede the operation of the ECCS in operating pressurized water reactors (PWRs). In the event of a LOCA within the containment of a PWR, thermal insulation and other materials (e. g., coatings and concrete) {{in the vicinity of the}} break will be damaged and dislodged. A fraction of this material will be transported to the recirculation (or emergency) sump and accumulate on the screen. The debris that accumulates on the sump screen forms a bed that acts as a filter. Excessive head loss <b>across</b> <b>the</b> debris <b>bed</b> may exceed <b>the</b> net positive suction head (NPSH) margin of the ECCS or CS pumps. For sump screens that are only partially submerged by water on the containment floor, excessive head loss <b>across</b> <b>the</b> debris <b>bed</b> may prevent water from entering the sump. Thus, excessive head loss can prevent or impede the flow of water into the core or containment. Also, excessive head loss <b>across</b> <b>the</b> debris <b>bed</b> may lead to ECCS-or CS-pump damage. Excessive head loss will be referred to as “sump failure. ” As part of the GSI- 191 study, the parametric evaluation documented in this report was performed to demonstrate whether sump failure is a plausible concern for operating PWRs.

40|$|Zircon in greenschist-facies Dalradian {{metasedimentary}} {{rocks of}} Scotland {{is characterized by}} two types: large detrital grains and small euhedral metamorphic grains. The former are concentrated in psammites and contain abundant evidence of dissolution and reaction with metamorphic fluids. The smallest metamorphic microzircons (&# 60; 9 µm 2) represent &# 62; 65 % of zircon grains, are clustered within pelites and form in aligned arrays that cut <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding.</b> <b>The</b> combination of textural characteristics with the spatial distribution shows that the growth of microzircon occurred in a small-scale crack network that developed after folding, reflecting precipitation from locally derived metamorphic fluids. Zircons within psammites in the hinge of an antiform show an enhanced metamorphic response suggesting focusing of fluids by the fold. Metamorphic zircon may be successfully used to map detailed fluid pathways, providing a unique approach to monitoring permeability structure in the crust. The scarcity of unmodified detrital zircon, which forms &# 60; 7 % of larger grains, indicates that major biases in the preservation potential of zircon are generated during metamorphism. These biases may feed through into the U–Pb ages of detrital zircons that are analysed from metamorphic rocks and hence into models of crustal evolution...|$|R
