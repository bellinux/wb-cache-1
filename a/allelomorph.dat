40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the factor for white eye color and the factor for eosin eye color are allelomorphs. Each arose as a mutation, but unlike other {{original}} and independent mutations they do not give, when crossed, the wild type (red eye) by recombination. Each factor has the same normal <b>allelomorph</b> in the wild fly, and each factor gives the same linkage ratio as the other one with any sex-linked factor. The factor for eosin, the factor for white and their normal <b>allelomorph</b> form a system of triple allelomorphs. Only two of these factors can exist at any one time in the same female, and, since they are sex-linked, only one at a time in a male. In consequence, a red-eyed female may be heterozygous for white or for eosin, but never for white and for eosin...|$|E
40|$|The {{foregoing}} {{discussion and}} conclusions may be summarized thus: In certain bean hybrids, mottled seed-coats depend upon {{the presence of a}} mottling <b>allelomorph</b> in a heterozygous condition, the homozygous condition giving unmottled seeds. This peculiar situation results in a tripolyhybrid ratio, 18 : 18 : 6 : 6 : 16, instead of the usual ratio, 27 : 9 : 9 : 3 : 16. Latency is held to mean invisibility, and not inactivity or dormancy, and four types are recognized, according to the different causes of invisibility; still other types may be found. The four types discussed in this paper are: (a) Latency due to separation, in which an allelolmorph when acting alone has no external manifestation and is only rendered patent by combining it with another <b>allelomorph.</b> Such latency gives rise to the ratios 9 : 3 : 4, 9 : 7, 27 : 9 : 9 : 3 : 16 and 27 : 9 : 28, instead of the theoretical, 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 and 27 : 9 : 9 : 9 : 3 : 3 : 3 : 1. (b) Latency due to combination, in which two dominant allelomorphs, each giving rise to a peculiar character when acting alone, lose their external manifestation when co-existing in the same zygote. Upon self-fertilization this type of latency gives rise to such ratios as 1 : 1, 3 : 3 : 2, 18 : 18 : 6 : 6 : 16, etc., and may be found to account for the existence of certain mid-races, and other eases in which a double series of characteristics are presented in nearly equal numbers. (c) Latency due to hypostasis, in which the presence of one <b>allelomorph</b> can not be detected owing to the presence of another <b>allelomorph,</b> the character produced by the latter being unmodified by the activity of the former. This type of latency is exemplified by the black bean which hides the presence of a wholly distinct brown <b>allelomorph,</b> and a dark orange bean which carries invisibly a light yellow <b>allelomorph.</b> This condition gives rise in one series of crosses to the ratio, 12 : 3 : 1. Properly the term "dominance" should be limited to the relation between any positive characteristic and its own absence. Whenever one positive character seems to dominate another positive character, the latter is latent by hypostasis in the individual possessing the former. (d) Latency due to fluctuation, a very frequent phenomenon in which characteristics disappear under conditions of poor nutrition, etc. Cultivation under favorable conditions makes such characteristics patent and this fact may account in part for the general impression that cultivation induces variation. Cases of "double adaptation" are examples of this type of latency. Many discrepancies between theoretical and empirical inheritance-ratios are due to latency, and care should be taken to investigate the possible latencies which may be present before declaring that a character is non-Mendelian, because of a discrepant ratio. "Variable potency," "contamination" or "impurity" of the gametes, and "alternating dominance" which have been proposed to account for the appearance of various novelties, or of deviations from expected ratios, eau have no secure standing until the question of latency in the sense of invisibility has been taken into account. A modification of expected ratios may rarely result also from the failure of certain allelomorphs to make vigorous zygotes when joined together in certain combinations...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} chiefly with {{the behavior of a}} duplicating chromosome derived from the undescribed scute <b>allelomorph</b> known as scute- 10 - 2. This <b>allelomorph,</b> obtained by x-raying scute- 10, is associated with a reciprocal 1 - 4 translocation. The X-chromosome is broken near its left end, between the loci of silver and broad, and the short terminal piece (loci from yellow to silver) is exchanged for a section of the fourth chromosome that includes all the known loci of that chromosome (with the possible exception of cubitus-interruptus, which is difficult to test, since this translocation shows the position effect recently described by Dubinin and Sidoroff(1)). The small chromosome, made up of the left end of X attached to the spindle-fibre region of 4, may be obtained in individuals (of either sex) that are otherwise normal diploids.

40|$|AbstractThe {{polymorphism}} at residue 129 of {{the human}} PRNP gene modulates disease susceptibility and the clinico-pathological phenotypes in human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The molecular mechanisms by which {{the effect of this}} polymorphism are mediated remain unclear. It has been shown that the folding, dynamics and stability of the physiological, α-helix-rich form of recombinant PrP are not affected by codon 129 polymorphism. Consistent with this, we have recently shown that the kinetics of amyloid formation do not differ between protein containing methionine at codon 129 and valine at codon 129 when the reaction is initiated from the α-monomeric PrPC-like state. In contrast, we have shown that the misfolding pathway leading to the formation of β-sheet-rich, soluble oligomer was favoured by the presence of methionine, compared with valine, at position 129. In the present work, we examine the effect of this polymorphism on the kinetics of an alternative misfolding pathway, that of amyloid formation using partially folded PrP allelomorphs. We show that the valine 129 <b>allelomorph</b> forms amyloids with a considerably shorter lag phase than the methionine 129 <b>allelomorph</b> both under spontaneous conditions and when seeded with pre-formed amyloid fibres. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that the effect of the codon 129 polymorphism depends on the specific misfolding pathway and on the initial conformation of the protein. The inverse propensities of the two allelomorphs to misfold in vitro through the alternative oligomeric and amyloidogenic pathways could explain some aspects of prion diseases linked to this polymorphism such as age at onset and disease incubation time...|$|E

2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{view is that}} Bateson, de Vries, Morgan and Reginald Punnett had by 1918 formed a {{synthesis}} of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and {{the probability that a}} new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900. The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that [...] "If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible <b>allelomorphs,</b> the various homo- and hetero-zygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected". Also in 1902, the statistician Udny Yule showed mathematically that given multiple factors, Mendel's theory enabled continuous variation. Yule criticised Bateson's confrontational approach, but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.|$|R

Although differentiation had been known already for about 25 years the 'new' races were not found on varieties of Solanum tuberosum in practice. This supported the supposition that the 'common' race was superior to the other races on varieties of S. tuberosum.

40|$|In {{a series}} of papers, Serebrovsky (1930), Dubinin (1929), Agol (1930) and their colleagues have {{described}} an extremely interesting group of bristle-reducing mutant genes lying at the scute locus of the X-chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster.

40|$|THE {{differences}} wich {{exist in}} rate of feathering of various breeds have be-come {{a major problem}} in the production of high quality broilers. The discrimina-tion of the market against "bare backs" has influenced poultry breeders to en-deavor to develop strains of heavy breeds that are well feathered at the bfpiler age. Observation of the growing chick has shown two major genetic types of feather-ing, namely, early and late. Serebrovsky (1922) reported evidence that a sex-linked gene affects the rate of feathering. Warren (1925) confirmed the findings of Sere-brovsky. The dominant gene is late feathering which is typical of most heavy breeds, and its recessive <b>allelomorph,</b> early feathering, is found in the Mediterranean breeds. The gene controls the rate of feathering from hatching throughout the growing period. Warren (1933) described another type, retarded feathering, which behaves as a simple autosomal recessive factor. Its in-fluence is to modify the number of second-aries of the day-old chick and inhibit the appearance of tail feathers for several weeks.

40|$|Rose-alpha gene mutates {{frequently}} to its purple <b>allelomorph.</b> The {{results of measurements}} indicate that the gene mutated with approximately the same rate during twelve cell generations {{of the development of}} sepals. No difference in mutability was observed when the gene mutability in the lowest five flowers of racemes was compared with the mutability of the next five flowers of the same racemes. The mutability curves were practically horizontal lines in material differing widely in the frequency of mutability. The rate of mutability in garnetogenesis was probably not higher than the rate of mutability in somatic tissue. Lavender-alpha gene has a high rate of mutability early and late in ontogeny, and has a low rate of mutability or is constant in the intermediate stages of ontogeny. The evidence accumulated in studying mutable genes is opposed to the assumption that these genes are composed of two kinds of smaller hereditary units (gene elements), and that the frequent mutability of these genes is due to an assortment of gene elements.

40|$|If Drosophila larvae {{homozygous}} for {{the third}} chromosome recessive straio- 2 are treated with X-rays, back-mutations of the straw-?, gene to its normal <b>allelomorphs</b> take place in somatic cells, and {{the cells of the}} wings give rise to hairs which can be recognized as wild type (Waddington, 1940 &). In one attempt to follow out this matter in more detail high doses (7000 r. units) were applied. The resulting mortality was, it might be said, 100 %. That is, no flies emerged; but on dissecting the pupa cases, it was found that a considerable proportion had developed up to the hatching stage, but {{had not been able to}} free themselves from the pupal integuments. These flies were found to exhibit some rather remarkable deformities, and the experiment has therefore been repeated a number of times. It is the purpose of the present paper to describe in some detail the developmental abnormalities produced by such heavy doses of X-rays.

40|$|The {{infectious}} agent of prion diseases is identified with PrP(Sc), a beta-rich, amyloidogenic and partially protease resistant isoform of the cellular glycoprotein, PrP(C).

We show that human PrP amyloid forms readily from its PrP(C) -like state in vitro, that the lag time of the reaction can be further shortened by the presence of a "seed" of pre-formed PrP amyloid, and that amyloid propagation is more complex than a simple crystallization process. We further show that the kinetics of amyloid formation do not differ between the Met 129 and Val 129 <b>allelomorphs</b> of human PrP, and that amyloid from each functions as an equally effective seed in heterologous, as in homologous amyloid reactions.

40|$|Arisaema dracontium is an aroid {{perennial}} herb which {{grows in}} wooded floodplains. It occurs throughout {{a large part}} of eastern North America, but is considered rare at the northern periphery of its range which includes Canada and a number of northeastern states in the USA. The genetic structure, fertility and fecundity of A. dracontium was studied across the species 2 ̆ 7 range in order to assess whether those aspects of the population biology leave the species more vulnerable in the northern ecological margins. The study of genetic structure was preceded by an analysis of the mode of inheritance of the species in order to correctly interpret isozyme banding patterns. Existing evidence from chromosome counts and morphology suggest that A. dracontium is diploid in parts of Florida and an autotetraploid throughout the rest of its range. The mode of inheritance was investigated by examining banding patterns from cellulose acetate allozyme electrophoresis. Unbalanced heterozygotes and tri-allelic loci were observed in tetraploid cytotypes; however, only balanced heterozygotes and di-allelic loci were observed in diploid cytotypes. This is consistent with disomic and tetrasomic inheritance, respectively, and also supports the hypothesis that tetraploid cytotypes are autotetraploid in nature. A survey of allozyme variation revealed that genic and clonal diversity is high {{in all parts of the}} species 2 ̆ 7 range although population differentiation and the number of unique twelve-locus <b>allelomorphs</b> was higher in the northern periphery. A single Florida population was sampled, and found to be markedly distinct from all the other populations. Fertility and fecundity were extremely variable in all regions of the range.

Two closely related genes subsequently identified as alleles, mac- 1 a 1, and mac- 1 b 1, from a genomic library of #M. galloprovincialis$ were partially cloned and sequenced. They mainly differed from each other by a 65 -bp insertion within their first intron. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed outside the insertion. The PCR analysis of 166 individual mussels from #M. galloprovincialis$ and #M. edulis$ populations revealed three size-classes of alleles or allelomorphs, two of which were of the expected sizes for mac- 1 a 1 and mac- 1 b 1.

The animals comprise the first hybrid (F 1) and second hybrid (F 2) generations {{derived from a}} cross between two inbred strains. The emphasis is primarily physiological. The genetic interpretation of the results is reserved for later publication. Material The two parental strains are as follows: 1. Dilute Brown. [...] This strain has been closely inbred since 1909. It {{has been used for}} many genetic experiments. Papers dealing with its tumor-producing characteristics and general physiology of reproduction have been published by Murray (1927, 1928, 1934). The strain is characterized by a high incidence of mammary tumors which are either adenomas or adenocarcinomas. Sarcomas or tumors of other organs than the mammary gland are relatively very infrequent. The strain is homozygous for color and differs from the wild house mouse by three recessive Menddian factors. a ' = non-agouti or self color. b r = brown rather than black pigmentation. d b = blue dilution. 2. Yellows (Dunn's Derivative of Brooke's English Stock). [...] These mice are less inbred than the foregoing stock.

40|$|The widely {{accepted}} models describing {{the emergence of}} domesticated grain crops from their wild type ancestors are mostly based upon selection (conscious or unconscious) of major features related either to seed dispersal (nonbrittle ear, indehiscent pod) or free germination (nondormant seeds, soft seed coat). Based on the breeding systems (self-pollination) and dominance relations between the <b>allelomorphs</b> of seed dispersal mode and seed dormancy, it was postulated that establishment of the domesticated forms and replacement of the wild ancestral populations occurred in the Near East within a relatively short time. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), however, appears as an exception among all other “founder crops” of Old World agriculture because of its ancient conversion into a summer crop. The chickpea is also exceptional because its major domestication trait appears to be vernalization insensitivity rather than pod indehiscence or free germination. Moreover, the genetic basis of vernalization response in wild chickpea (Cicer reticulatum Ladiz.) is polygenic, suggesting that a long domestication process was imperative due to the elusive phenotype of vernalization nonresponsiveness. There is also a gap in chickpea remains in the archaeological record between the Late Prepottery Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age. Contrary to the common view that Levantine summer cropping was introduced relatively late (Early Bronze Age), we argue for an earlier (Neolithic) Levantine origin of summer cropping because chickpea, when grown as a common winter crop, was vulnerable to the devastating pathogen Didymella rabiei, the causal agent of Ascochyta blight. The ancient (Neolithic) conversion of chickpea into a summer crop required seasonal differentiation of agronomic operation from the early phases of the Neolithic revolution. This topic is difficult to deal with, as direct data on seasonality in prehistoric Old World field crop husbandry are practically nonexistent. Consequently, this issue was hardly {{dealt with in the}} literature. Information on the seasonality of ancient (Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Age, calibrated 11, 500 to 4, 500 years before present) Near Eastern agriculture may improve our understanding of the proficiency of early farmers. This in turn may provide a better insight into Neolithic agrotechniques and scheduling. It is difficult to fully understand chickpea domestication without a Neolithic seasonal differentiation of agronomic practice because the rapid establishment of the successful Near Eastern crop package which included wheats, barley, pea, lentil, vetches, and flax, would have preempted the later domestication of this rare wild legume...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were planned}} {{to study the}} {{influence}} of selection upon natural resistance to fowl typhoid in the chicken, and to determine something about the genetic nature of differences in resistance. Using a pathogen of constant virulence and a uniform method of infection, {{it was determined that}} degree of infection influenced the mortality in unselected chicks. Both total mortality and rate of mortality were increased by the heavier doses. Four generations of selection for resistance to a standard dose of fowl typhoid bacteria resulted in a decided decrease in mortality in the selected population. The mortalities observed in the chicks of the selected generations, S 1 to S 4, were respectively 40, 29, 15 and 23 percent. In the unselected (control) population the respective mortalities were 90, 93, 86 and 86 percent. The increased mortality in the selected S 4 population was due to unavoidable chilling of the last two groups of chicks tested in that generation. An analysis of the breeding records of the selected population shows degrees of inbreeding over 30 percent for some of the birds of this stock, but so far it is difficult to evaluate the part that the inbreeding has played in bringing about the increased resistance of the selected stock. Reciprocal crosses of selected by unselected birds demonstrated that the male as well as the female transmits resistance to the offspring. These results show that a passive transfer of immunity was not a great, if existent, factor in the enhanced resistance of the selected progeny. F 1, F 2 and backcross progenies from a parental cross of resistant with highly susceptible unselected birds indicated the presence of genetic factors for resistance. No evidence was found of a linkage between major factors for resistance or susceptibility and the gene for inhibition of plumage color (I), or its <b>allelomorph</b> (i). Nor was there evidence of major sex-linked factors for resistance. With the exception of one cross (selected males with unselected females) significant differences in mortality were not observed between males and females. Inherent resistance to fowl typhoid is undoubtedly controlled by multiple factors some of which show dominance or partial dominance. Because of the complexities introduced by environmental variations and the interrelations of host and pathogen, the genetic analysis of resistance to fowl typhoid must await the development of inbred lines which react in a uniform and reasonably constant manner to infection with this bacterium...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{inheritance}} of a number of various characters in watermelons. Data were obtained from parent selections and from F 1, F 2 and backcross progenies in 1934. The difference between elongate and spherical fruits was found to be determined by a single pair of genes which lacked dominance. Heterozygous individuals bore fruits which were intermediate in shape. Shapes of young ovaries were inherited {{in the same manner as}} shapes of fruits, but the segregation was more clear-cut in the case of ovaries. Shapes of mature fruits and shapes of young ovaries were very highly correlated. Small size of fruits may be considered dominant if the data for fruit weight are plotted arithmetically, but if the data are plotted logarithmically the genes for size must be regarded as lacking dominance and having proportional effects. Many correlation coefficients are presented in an effort to show the relationships between time of flowering, time of maturity, and length, width, shape and weight of fruits in the watermelon. There was highly significant negative correlation of fruit shape with fruit weight (r= -. 34 and -. 41 in F 2). The data indicate that one major gene largely determines small size of seed in contrast to large size of seed in the cross of Long Iowa Belle X Japan 4. Those F 1 plants having the large-seeded Iowa Belle as female parent blossomed earlier, matured fruits earlier and produced larger fruits than the reciprocal F 1 plants with the small-seeded Japan 4 as female parent. Dark-green rind was dominant to light-green rind and was determined by one gene, though other genes apparently deter· mined minor variations of the light color. The type of broad striping found in the China 23 watermelon seemed to be due to a single recessive factor when crossed with the dark-green Iowa Belle but was dominant when crossed with the light-colored Japan 6. Apparently the striping gene either forms a multiple-allelomorphic series with the genes for dark and light-green rind color, or it is very closely linked with these genes. The genes for striping and those for dark and light green are all linked in about the same degree with the gene for Iowa Belle mottling or its <b>allelomorph.</b> The Iowa Belle mottling (IB) was determined by a single gene in two crosses and was recessive. However, in the cross of Iowa Belle X Japan 6, the heterozygous fruits carried an intermediate type of marking (sub-IB). Secondary factors apparently affected the dominance of the non-IB gene. The Iowa Belle rind marking was highly correlated with length, width and weight of fruits in the cross of Iowa Belle X Japan 6. This indicates that a size gene may be linked with the color factor. The fact that size and shape are also correlated, while the Iowa Belle marking is not linked with shape, indicates that there are two genes for size and that they are carried on different chromosomes. The data indicate that the presence of a peripheral black band on the seed coat is a dominant character, that reddish brown is dominant to light tan, and that the combination of the genes for reddish brown and black bands gives black over the entire seed coat...|$|E
