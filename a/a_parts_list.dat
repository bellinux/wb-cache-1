5000|$|The 48-215 was {{the first}} model from General Motors in Australia to bear the Holden name. In {{mainstream}} parlance, the official name of [...] "Holden 48-215" [...] was eschewed in favour of the shortened [...] "Holden" [...] designation. Following {{the replacement of the}} first Holden, the 48-215 gained the unofficial nickname of Holden FX. This designation was first used in the Drawing Office at GM-H in 1952 as an unofficial means of distinguishing between early 48-215 vehicles with front suspension using lever-action shock absorbers, and those with the new telescopic shock absorber front suspension introduced in 1953 - the term [...] "FX" [...] was pencilled onto <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> <b>list</b> for the new suspension components.

However, Geoff is adamant that everyone has <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> <b>list</b> so that he knows what to buy, and Merv and Tom's parts list would be sucking up most of the budget ($2000) on the metal stairs, even with a 20% discount that Tom had fought hard to obtain.

Later in the day, Gordie and John are off to Steam Whistle Brewing for recycled parts; the brewery is expanding and thus have a lot to recycle. Among the parts that they have scored are parts desperately needed for the purification system.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. As the navy transitions to all electric warships, {{there will be}} many changes to the power distribution schemes found aboard ships today. It will be necessary to maintain reliability while supplying the various components onboard with the proper voltage levels. Since transformers cannot be used to alter voltage levels while providing galvanic isolation in DC power systems, it is necessary to find an efficient method to incorporate the increased safety provided by galvanic isolation in a DC power distribution system. This thesis examines the design and control of one possible element for a future Electrical Distribution System (EDS), a DC-DC converter with galvanic isolation. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a working model with associated theoretical proof and simulations.

40|$|Until recently, {{the only}} {{computational}} method available for predicting {{the function of}} an uncharacterized gene was sequence similarity, an approach that is effective but restricted to instances in which the function of a closely related sequence is known. Because homologs of characterized function are not available for many sequenced genes, new methods that do not rely upon sequence similarity are critical {{if we are to}} exploit and address the avalanche of sequences. Such methods have in fact emerged recently. By considering the genome as <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> <b>list,</b> we can link two genes functionally if they share the same evolutionary pattern, such that they are either both present or absent in any of the known genomes. Insofar as the genome is a permutation of genes, two genes may be associated if they are consistently found as chromosomal neighbors across genomes. Genes may also be linked if they are found fused as one gene in another genome or if they have common regulatory elements and/or similar expression patterns. Together, these methods constitute the many diverse senses of sequence analysis, which may collectively hint at the function of an uncharacterized sequence in the context of all other known sequences...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe high {{variability}} of customer expectations {{results in the}} complexity of product development and manufacturing processes, which exists obviously in all types of production systems. One of these production systems {{with a high level}} of complexity, is single-item production, which is addressed in this paper. The preparation process in single-item production is usually wasteful and complicated. The question is: how can a product be produced most efficiently in the single-item production process. Recently, due to the increasing application of variant-oriented product modelling, the efficiency of preparation processes has been increased. But deficiency of harmonisation between design and production structures limits the automation of the preparation and planning process after the design process. In this paper, we introduce an approach to restructure the production processes and also harmonise the design and production structures in single-item production system. Due to this structure, <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> <b>list</b> has been adapted. This adaptation promotes the automation of the preparation and planning process. To achieve this goal, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and PDM (Product Data Management) systems should not only be configured but also interconnected on the base of this introduced method.
