5|$|The Flyers {{hosted a}} {{practice}} {{game against the}} Muncie Tigers on September 26, 1920, but {{the result of the}} game is unknown. The Flyers' first game of the season was against the Rock Island Independents. The Independents beat the Flyers 45–0. As a result, the Staleys, who were supposed to play the Flyers the next week, cancelled because they wanted to play <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team.</b> The Flyers tried to schedule game {{for the next few weeks}} but were unsuccessful. Since there were no rules to keep players on teams, several Flyers' players left and played for other teams. The Flyers scheduled a game against the Cleveland Tigers three weeks later, but the game was cancelled because the Tigers decided to play against the Panhandles instead. The same result happened next week against the Dayton Triangles. The Flyers were challenged by the Gas City Tigers and Muncie Offers More AC—two teams of Muncie. These games are not counted in the APFA standings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team</b> than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E
5|$|The {{high regard}} with which The Invincibles {{are held in}} the annals of Australian and world cricket is {{reflected}} in the various honours accorded to the players. Bradman, Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996. Hassett, Morris and Harvey were later inducted, so that 20% of the inductees are from the 1948 team. Of these six, all except Hassett were selected in Australia's Team of the Century, with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy. Bradman, Lindwall, Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council's Hall of Fame. In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians. Graveney strongly disagreed with the result, writing 'there has not been <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team</b> in my lifetime than Don Bradman's Australian tourists of 1948'. The computer regarded Sam Loxton {{as a member of the}} team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey, if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team.|$|E

50|$|Bob {{was then}} sent to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1937 and {{improved}} again, going 15-14 and 16-11. This could be due because he was on <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>team,</b> but his ERA decreased a large amount, too.|$|R

25|$|In 1919, the Calgary Patricias {{were formed}} {{but they were}} never able to usurp the Calgary Regents as <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team.</b> The Regents would win the Banff Winter Carnival tournament in 1919, 1920 and 1921. In addition, the Regents would go undefeated for four years. In 1924, the Regents would {{dissolve}} and form a new team with some members of the Calgary Byngs Ladies club. The newly formed team was known as the Calgary Holliles, and they actually lost their first game, a 2–0 defeat {{at the hands of the}} Calgary Patricias. The Hollies would win four Banff tournaments and be awarded the Alpine Cup.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the team}} made {{numerous}} trades and increased their payroll {{in an effort}} to assemble <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team.</b> In one transaction, young players Todd Bertuzzi and Bryan McCabe were traded for veteran Trevor Linden. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997–98 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer Zigmund Palffy, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year Bryan Berard, and rugged defenseman Rich Pilon. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the National Football League's Washington Redskins and Cleveland Browns.|$|E
500|$|The Rangers {{decided that}} Feldman would begin 2009 as a middle reliever, and Kris Benson {{would be a}} starter.

50|$|They lost {{momentum}} {{and went through}} a losing streak. After losing to Curtis Axel and Ryback, Cody, told Goldust to find <b>a</b> <b>better</b> tag <b>team</b> partner and left his brother. Following Payback, Rhodes {{tried to find a}} new partner for his brother, getting Sin Cara, R-Truth, and Kofi Kingston to replace him in the team, both times losing to Axel and Ryback.|$|R
50|$|He is {{a second}} year student who plays as forward. Typically he would be {{substituted}} by Tsukushi {{during the second half}} of games. Previously famous for his lack of commitment, Kiichi seemed to care only for scoring, leaving up the defense and tactical work to his teammates. Like others, Tsukamoto's amazing effort and perseverance leads him to change his style, becoming <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>team</b> player and displaying lots of sacrifice for the team.|$|R
500|$|Attempting to {{win over}} Quagmire, Brian decides to invite him to dinner, using model and actress Cheryl Tiegs as bait. Soon {{discovering}} the invitation to be fake, Quagmire is crushed, causing Brian {{to suggest that they}} can be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team</b> than Lewis and Clark, and a third member who enjoyed [...] "ripping up maps."

500|$|Completing 25-of-38 {{passes for}} 247 yards with a {{touchdown}} and one interception, Manning led the Colts to a 29–17 {{victory over the}} Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI and was voted Super Bowl MVP. Manning, who had been criticized for failing to win big games, exorcised his big-game demons with the win. [...] "In years' past when our team's come up short, it's been disappointing", he told reporters. [...] "Somehow we {{found a way to}} have learned from some of those losses and we've been <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team</b> because of it." [...] For his role in the Colts' championship run, Manning was awarded the ESPY for Best Championship Performance. Manning was again named to the Pro Bowl and was also named Second-team All-Pro; in the Pro Bowl he played only two series, passing for 67 yards. Following the Super Bowl win, Manning agreed to restructure his contract to save the Colts $8.2million in salary cap space.|$|E
2500|$|While at Cambridge, Don-Wauchope {{took his}} Fettesian-Lorettonian team, firstly on tours of Scotland, and then venturing into North England. After playing several games against more well founded Scottish teams, such as West of Scotland and Edinburgh Wanderers, the club faced English teams, Manchester and Huddrsfield. Although losing my narrow score lines in Scotland, the Fettesian-Lorettonian team won both matches in England, which saw the Athletics News report [...] "...persons {{who saw the}} doings of the Fettes-Loretto boys in Huddersfield and Manchester are willing to swear that <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team</b> never existed, and a general wish has been {{expressed}} that Don-Wauchope should bring his grand team into the North of England once more." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1978 the {{sponsorship}} of the team was in Aero hands. After two consecutive 7th places in the first division, Celje was again relegated in the 1978-79 season, came back in 1983-84 season, but was relegated back into the second division the same year. A seven-year crisis occurred, when Celje was struggling even in the second division until the season 1988-89, when they were preparing <b>a</b> new, <b>better</b> <b>team,</b> which {{would be capable of}} regaining a position in the first division.|$|R

2500|$|Despite this, the AFL champions {{shared the}} {{confident}} feelings of their quarterback. According to Matt Snell, {{all of the}} Jets, not just Namath, were insulted and angry that they were 18-point underdogs. Most of the Jets considered the Raiders, whom they barely beat (27–23) in the AFL title game, <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team</b> than the Colts. Indeed, watching films of the Colts and {{in preparation for the}} game, Jets coaching staff and offensive players noted that their offense was particularly suited against the Colts defense. The Colts defensive schemes relied on frequent blitzing, which covered up weak points in pass coverage. The Jets had an automatic contingency for such blitzes by short passing to uncovered tight ends or backs. After a film session the Wednesday prior to the game, Jets tight end Pete Lammons, a Crockett, Texas, native, was heard to drawl, [...] "Damn, y'all, we gotta stop watching these films. We gonna get overconfident." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marty Duffy of Sligo was {{appointed}} match referee for the final. The decision led to comment from former managers of both counties {{involved in the}} final, Mick O'Dwyer who expressed his belief that the choice of referee was based on [...] "politics" [...] and Billy Morgan who thought that Pat McEnaney {{ought to have been}} appointed referee instead. The GAA officially refused to offer a response to the two men. Liam and Sam in the Irish Independent compared the [...] "pre-emptive" [...] criticism of the referee to a scenario where the referee were to question the manner in which one of the teams play the sport or express dismay that <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team</b> should have qualified for the final instead. Radio Kerry analyst and former referee Weeshie Fogarty expressed his dismay at the criticism of Duffy, commenting: [...] "It's bad enough to referee big games in Croke Park and see your name being castigated in the papers and torn asunder the following week. But by God, when it happens before the game, that is a new trend to me".|$|E
2500|$|... "I just couldn't {{believe there}} was no flag", Clark said after the game, in {{reference}} to Davis' contact with him. [...] "I mean, I just assumed it would be thrown. When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>team.</b> But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots. We just didn't make the plays we had to." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{game played}} on August 31, 1896 {{demonstrates}} {{how difficult it}} was for Mercer to secure wins for the Senators. On that day, Mercer shut out Chicago for 11 innings, but the Senators also failed to score a run against opposing pitcher Cy Young. The Senators finally scored a run in the 11th inning to give Mercer the win, but Mercer lacked the support to achieve the win totals he could have secured on <b>a</b> <b>better</b> hitting <b>team.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Waterford manager Derek McGrath {{speaking}} {{after the}} game said [...] "I think the first 10 or 15 minutes Tipp looked a bit more fluid than us. I thought we got a grip in the middle {{part of the first}} half and we seemed to be able to grind it out. This much vaunted ‘system’ seemed to be up and running and we were disappointed to go in a point down. But I could have no real qualms overall. I thought Tipp were <b>a</b> slightly <b>better</b> <b>team</b> than us.” ...|$|R
