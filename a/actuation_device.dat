40|$|While Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) have {{exceptional}} actuation {{characteristics such}} as high energy density, silent operation, flexible packaging, etc., they have not found widespread use in commercial applications because of the significant learning curve required of engineers before {{they are capable of}} designing actuation devices using this unique material. An SMA <b>actuation</b> <b>device</b> design framework consisting of grammar, design methods, and design process enables engineers of different backgrounds to make efficient and appropriate design decisions in different stages of the design process. A reference SMA <b>actuation</b> <b>device</b> structure built on a generalized <b>actuation</b> <b>device</b> hierarchical structure using the <b>actuation</b> <b>device</b> grammar works as a reference structure to identify and populate device design options, and to model and analyze the device actuation performance as well as to enlighten non-expert engineers about the essential elements of SMA actuation devices. Design methods consisting of modular modeling, model aggregation and performance prediction, and visualization approaches support design decisions to serve diverse stakeholders of <b>actuation</b> <b>device</b> design by exposing the effects of individual device elements not only for SMA actuation devices, but also {{for a wide range of}} actuation devices. A multi-stage design process is formalized to help engineers create a detailed design including a three-step decoupled equilibrium design procedure which prevents potential iteration by decoupling the force and deflection of actuation output behavior, and hides the complexity of material and SMA architectural models from engineers while still exposing the impact of design parameters. The design framework makes SMA design knowledge more accessible to engineers with different levels of expertise and roles in device development by systematically organizing and presenting the device grammar, design methods, and design process. A design tool software platform based on the framework enables the creation of computer-aided design tools to support a variety of design tasks, which were demonstrated in two use case examples. By having the SMA <b>actuation</b> <b>device</b> design framework, the acceptance of the SMA actuation technology into both research and commercial applications can be increased to utilize promising SMA actuation benefits, and the device development cycle leading to these applications can be streamlined...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study {{social control}} of a cow herd in which some of the animals are {{controlled}} by a sensing and <b>actuation</b> <b>device</b> mounted on the cow. The control is social in that it aims at exploiting the existing gregarious behavior of the animals, rather than controlling each individual directly. As a case study we consider the open-loop control of the herd’s position using location-dependent stimuli. We propose a hybrid dynamical model for capturing {{the dynamics of the}} animals during periods of grazing and periods of stress. We assume that stress can either be induced by the sensing and <b>actuation</b> <b>device</b> or by social amplification due to observing/overhearing nearby stressed congeners. The dynamics of the grazing part of the proposed model have been calibrated using experimental data from 10 free-ranging cows, and various assumptions on the animal behavior under stress are investigated by a parameter sweep on the hybrid model. Results show that the gregarious behavior of the animals must be increased during stress for control by undirected stimuli to be successful. We also show that the presence of social amplification of stress allows for robust, low-stress control by controlling {{only a fraction of the}} herd. ...|$|E

Sensor nodes and actuator nodes are interconnected in wireless networks as discussed in wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs). Actuator nodes and device nodes are interconnected in types of networks, i. e. wireless and wired network. Sensor nodes sense an physical event and send sensed values of the event to actuator nodes. An actuator node makes a decision on proper actions on receipt of sensed values and then issue the action requests to the device nodes. A device node really acts to the physical world. For example, moves a robot arms by performing the action on receipt of the action request. Messages may be lost and nodes may be faulty. Especially, messages are lost due to noise and collision in a wireless network. We propose a fully redundant model for an SADN where each of sensor, actuator, and device functions is replicated in multiple nodes and each of sensor-actuator and actuator-device communication is realized in many-to-many type of communication protocols. Even if some number of nodes are faulty, the other nodes can perform requested tasks.

While multiple actuator nodes communicate with multiple replica nodes of a device.

Design strategies based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations allow obtaining controllers for these complex control problems, which are characterized by large dimensionality, high computational cost and severe information constraints. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of the computational effectiveness of three different LMI-based controller design strategies: H-infinity, energy-to-peak and energy-to-componentwise-peak. The H-infinity approach is a well-known design methodology and has been widely used in the literature. The energy-to-peak approach is a particular case of generalized H 2 design that is gaining a growing relevance in structural vibration control. Finally, the energy-to-componentwise-peak approach is a less common case of generalized H 2 design that produces promising results among the three considered approaches. These controller design strategies are applied to synthesize active state-feedback controllers for the seismic protection of a five-story building and a twenty-story building both equipped with complete systems of interstory <b>actuation</b> <b>devices.</b> To evaluate the computational effectiveness of the proposed LMI design methodologies, the corresponding computation times are compared and a suitable set of numerical simulations is carried out to assess the performance of the obtained controllers. As positive results, two main facts can be highlighted: the computational effectiveness of the energy-to-peak control design strategy and the particularly well-balanced behavior exhibited by the energy-to-componentwise-peak controllers. On the negative side, it has to be mentioned the computational inefficiency of the considered LMI design methodologies to properly deal with very-large-scale control problems.
