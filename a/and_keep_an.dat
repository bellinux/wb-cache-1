25|$|An old fort can {{be found}} south of the col between High Peak and Round Top at 2,540feet (774m) in elevation. Built at first by British troops during the French and Indian War, it was most famously used by Tories and their Indian allies later during the Revolutionary War (in {{the early years of}} which pro-British {{sentiment}} was quite common in the region, as many of its tenant farmers despised their pro-independence landlords).

He was on the way to take over command of General of Division Domenico Pino's division. After a few soldiers escaped to warn him that the fort was taken, Peyri took his 650 men and retreated south to Bàscara. Notified of the disaster, General of Division Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers sent Peyri an infantry battalion and a cavalry squadron.

25|$|Going {{into the}} game, the Giants were 5–6. A three-game losing streak {{on the road}} had made the team's playoff {{prospects}} much dimmer since midseason. However, a win at home against the favored Eagles could, the team hoped, reverse the trend <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> outside shot at a playoff spot alive. Despite the team's storied past, the Giants had not played in the postseason since 1963 and had managed only two winning seasons since then. Although they were the league's fourth oldest franchise, they were almost a non-entity in the post-merger NFL. The move to New Jersey in 1976 had alienated some longtime fans, even if it made more seats available. Fans had never gone this long without a contender, but while they were growing restless, they were still forgiving.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} of ultrasound. It is relatively cheap, does not emit any radiation, is accessible, {{is capable of}} visualizing tissue function in real time and allows to the performing of provocative maneuvers in order to replicate the patient’s pain. [...] Those benefits have helped ultrasound become a common initial choice for assessing tendons and soft tissues. Limitations include, for example, {{the high degree of}} operator dependence and the inability to define pathologies in bones.

Robey was one of those; he had written to a friend on May 10 mentioning that [...] "it would pay {{to be on the lookout}} for inverts". On May 14, Robey went to the post office to buy the new stamps, and as he wrote later, when the clerk brought out a sheet of inverts, [...] "my heart stood still". He paid for the sheet, and asked to see more, but the remainder of the sheets were normal.|$|E
2500|$|Spanish Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta did {{not seek}} war with the United States. He did not expect victory, but he knew Spanish {{citizens}} would likely revolt if he conceded to American demands in Cuba. Meanwhile, Spanish naval leaders tried to employ a strategy where they would not win the war outright, but rather resist the US Navy as much as possible. On May 1, 1898, American and Spanish naval forces met in the Philippines at the Battle of Manila Bay, {{which resulted in a}} decisive victory for the United States. The Spanish government sent their fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete to defend Cuba <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> open line of communication with the Spanish garrison there; Cervera opposed this strategy. He believed his squadron lacked the strength necessary to engage the American squadron, preferring instead to engage the Americans near the Canary Islands or to mount an attack against the American coast, but he was overruled by his superiors in Madrid.

2500|$|Despite {{being in}} a {{potentially}} favorable situation, Hooker halted his brief offensive. His actions may have demonstrated his {{lack of confidence in}} handling the complex actions of such a large organization for the first time (he had been an effective and aggressive division and corps commander in previous battles), but he had also decided before beginning the campaign that he would fight the battle defensively, forcing Lee, with his small army, to attack his own, larger one. At the [...] Battle of Fredericksburg (December 13, 1862), the Union army had done the attacking and met with a bloody defeat. Hooker knew Lee could not sustain such a defeat <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> effective army in the field, so he ordered his men to withdraw back into the Wilderness and take a defensive position around Chancellorsville, daring Lee to attack him or retreat with superior forces at his back. He confused matters by issuing a second order to his subordinates to hold their positions until 5 p.m., but {{by the time it was}} received, most of the Union units had begun their rearward movements. That evening, Hooker sent a message to his corps commanders, [...] "The major general commanding trusts that a suspension in the attack to-day will embolden the enemy to attack him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vine's cricket {{career was}} not one of a rapid rise to fame. Although he played his first {{first-class}} match in 1896, it was not until 1900, after some tentative appearances in the three previous seasons, that he earned a regular place in the Sussex eleven. After that, however, he was indispensable. He was essentially a county cricketer, nearly all his work having been done for Sussex, but if, in addition to his batting and fielding, he had managed to retain his skill as a leg-break bowler it is quite likely that he would have played for England before he played his two Test matches in 1911/2. Already a dependable player, he made a great advance as a batsman in 1904 and during 1905 he was better than he had ever been before, scoring for Sussex in county matches alone over sixteen hundred runs. Good as his position is he would probably have been thought still more of if he had belonged to another county. A batsman would need to be great indeed to play on the same side as Ranjitsinhji and C.B. Fry, and not be overshadowed. His success as a batsman was largely gained in a series of first-wicket partnerships with Fry, and though he may at times carry caution a little too far <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> undue check on his hitting powers, the result is nearly always so satisfactory that it would be sheer hypercriticism to find fault with him. As an outfield Vine has not the wonderful pick-up of Denton, but in every other respect was in the highest class, {{and in the course of}} a season at the beginning of the twentieth century, perhaps no one saved a larger number of runs.|$|E
