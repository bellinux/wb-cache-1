5|$|Q*bert Rebooted {{contains}} a port {{of the classic}} arcade game alongside a new playing mode that uses hexagonal shapes, {{increasing the number of}} possible movement directions to six. Additionally, the 'Rebooted' mode features new enemy types, including a boxing glove that punches Q*bert off the levels and a treasure chest that tries to avoid him. The game has 5 different stage designs spread across 40 levels, which contain three rounds and a bonus round <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completed with 5 lives. Gems are collected to unlock different skins for the Q*bert character, and completing levels multiple times while reaching specific time and score goals is awarded with stars that enable access to more levels.|$|E
5|$|The Persians {{found the}} Ionians {{difficult}} to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus {{was able to}} identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects – such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Trina's bitten fingers become {{infected}} <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> amputated. To earn money she becomes a janitor at a children's school. She withdraws the $5,000 {{from the bank}} to keep it close to her, eventually spreading it on her bed so she can sleep on it. McTeague then returns, having spent the money he took, and asks Trina for more. The following day McTeague confronts Trina at the school. After a heated argument McTeague beats Trina to death and steals her $5,000.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} their conquest, the Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus identified elite native {{groups such as the}} priesthood of Judea – to help him rule his new subjects. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, certain tyrants might develop an independent streak <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians. In the past, Greek states had often been ruled by tyrants, but that form of government was on the decline. Past tyrants had also tended and needed to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply place-men. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. On the eve of the Greco-Persian wars, it is probable that the Ionian population had become discontented and was ready for rebellion.|$|E

25|$|The phase {{curves of}} many asteroids {{have also been}} {{observed}} and they too may exhibit opposition surges. Asteroids can be physically classified in this way.

25|$|Even {{with the}} best {{experimental}} design, {{it is not possible}} to control and constrain all other background stimuli impinging on a subject—scanner noise, random thoughts, physical sensations, and the like.

25|$|Notwithstanding the {{progress}} in hieroglyphic decipherment, {{the most important}} sources for Classic mythology are still scenes painted on pottery (the so-called 'ceramic codex') and monumental iconography.

25|$|While {{there are}} some {{relatively}} pristine objects, such as you might see in the Louvre or the British Museum, {{the vast majority of}} recovered tables and inscriptions are in much worse condition. They have been broken with only portions found, intentionally defaced, and damaged by weather or the effects of being buried underground.

It took many decades {{to improve the quality}} of the materials, including the change from iron to steel. The stronger the rails and the rest of the trackwork, the heavier and faster the trains the track can carry.|$|E

25|$|Samples for SEM {{have to be}} {{prepared}} to withstand the vacuum conditions and high energy beam of electrons, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of a size that will fit on the specimen stage. Samples are generally mounted rigidly to a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analyis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300 mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.|$|E
25|$|Water use {{charges were}} {{established}} in Law 99 of 1993 and defined in Decree 155 of 2004. Water use charges have two components, minimum and regional. The minimum is established every year by the Ministry of Environment. The regional component consist {{of a number of}} elements such as water availability, socio-economic aspects, investment needed, opportunity cost and is established every year by the local CAR, who also collect the fee <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> invested in the watershed according to the PIOM.

They are not problems of the Dutch state, and all that the Dutch laws say in this respect is that such Dutch subjects with dual nationality are allowed to renounce to their Dutch nationality.|$|E

25|$|The idea is {{that these}} groups have a {{centralizer}} of an involution with a component that is a smaller quasisimple group, which can be assumed to be already known by induction. So to classify these groups one takes every central extension of every known finite simple group, and finds all simple groups with a centralizer of involution with this as a component. This gives a rather large number of different cases to check: there are not only 26 sporadic groups and 16 families of groups of Lie type and the alternating groups, but also many of the groups of small rank or over small fields behave differently from the general case <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated separately, and the groups of Lie type of even and odd characteristic are also quite different.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads {{wear down}} <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} {{may need to}} be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the success, the design also {{demonstrated}} several serious problems. In particular, the gyroscopic platform had to be leveled out before use using several spirit levels, and then checked and repeatedly reset for accuracy. Worse, the gyros had a limited degree of movement, and if the plane banked far enough the gyro would reach its limit <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-set from scratch - something that could happen even due to strong turbulence. If the gyros {{were found to be}} off, the leveling procedure took as long as eight and a half minutes. Other minor problems were the direct current electric motors which drove the gyroscopes, whose brushes wore down quickly and left carbon dust throughout the interior of the device, and the positioning of the control knobs, which meant the bombardier could only adjust side-to-side or up-and-down aim at a time, not both. But in spite of all of these problems, the Mark XV was so superior to any other design that the Navy ordered it into production.|$|E
