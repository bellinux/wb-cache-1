Something of {{a departure from the}} band's previous work, the album features more <b>acoustic</b> <b>material</b> than previous releases; and—inspired by photographs of homeless people on the Thames Embankment taken by singer Ian Anderson's wife Jennie—contains a number of recurring themes, addressing religion along with Anderson's own personal experiences.|$|E
25|$|Doherty {{has been}} working on new <b>acoustic</b> <b>material,</b> similar to the wealth of his {{unreleased}} songs that can already be downloaded on the internet. On his own, and often with his band, he has continued The Libertines' tradition of performing on short notice guerrilla gigs in small venues. On New Year's Eve 2005, Doherty held a guerrilla gig in his North London flat where he showcased some of his solo works, many of which later leaked onto the internet. 31 March and 1 April 2006 Doherty was performing two surprising solo gigs, his first in mainland Europe, at the NonStop Kino pornographic cinema and venue in Graz, Austria, after he failed to turn up for an earlier arrangement in January. For this occasion he produced, at the suggestion of Bettina Aichbauer, friend of Doherty and owner of the NonStop Kino, a film with the title Spew It Out Your Soul which he showed on screen during his performance.|$|E

In the present work, airflow resistivity of porous materials is determined under effective operating conditions inside a vehicle (temperature, compression of the panels). Starting from the discussion on the measurement uncertainty, experimental data of airflow resistivity, measured as a function of temperature and applied static loads, are presented. By introducing the measured values in a SEA model of a typical vehicle panel, the foreseen values of acoustic absorption due to variation of temperature and static load are determined and presented...|$|R
2500|$|Marc Bolan founded Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967, {{following}} {{a handful of}} failed solo singles and a brief career as lead guitarist in psych-rock band John's Children. After a solitary disastrous performance as a four-piece electric rock band on 22 July at the Electric Garden in London's Covent Garden alongside drummer Steve Porter plus two older musicians: guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bassist, the group immediately broke up. Subsequently, Bolan retained the services of Porter, who switched to percussion under the name [...] Steve Peregrin Took and the two began performing <b>acoustic</b> <b>material</b> as a duo with a repertoire of folk-influenced Bolan-penned songs with an eastern flavour, an obvious homage to Indian musician Ravi Shankar. The combination of Bolan's acoustic guitar and distinctive vocal style with Took's bongos and assorted percussion—which often included children's instruments such as the Pixiphone—earned them a devoted following in the thriving hippy underground scene. BBC Radio One Disc jockey John Peel championed the band early in their recording career. Peel later appeared on record with them, reading stories written by Bolan. Another key collaborator was producer Tony Visconti, {{who went on to}} produce the band's albums well into their second, glam rock phase.|$|E

40|$|Generally, heavier {{noise control}} {{treatments}} are favored over lighter treatments since heavier <b>acoustic</b> <b>materials</b> generally insulate (block) the noise source more effectively. For automotive applications, however, heavier materials cannot necessarily be adopted {{because of concerns}} about the total weight of the vehicle. Thus, it is desired to have lighter <b>acoustic</b> <b>materials</b> to mitigate the vehicle interior noise for the purpose of the weight minimization. Acoustical materials used in automobiles have both absorption and transmission characteristics, and there is necessarily a trade off between these two. Therefore, it is important to study the exchange between the absorption and transmission of <b>acoustic</b> <b>materials</b> particularly as it pertains to weight. The idea of trade offs between absorption and transmission performance of noise treatment was introduced in a previous study. Here, a method of weight minimization by adjusting the acoustic properties of a porous layer and a flexible microperforated panel surface treatment to balance the absorption and transmission characteristics to yield the same acoustic performance of conventional (heavier) materials at a lighter weight is demonstrated. This research proves that reducing the weight of noise treatments can be achieved while maintaining acoustic performance equivalent to that of heavier noise treatments by properly balancing the absorption and transmission performance...|$|R
