5|$|Born in North Sydney, New South Wales, Madgwick {{trained as}} a schoolteacher before {{attaining}} degrees in economics and economic history from the University of Sydney and University of Oxford. Appointed as a lecturer at the University of Sydney, Madgwick worked in the school's extension program which gave him experience and interest in <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> With the onset of World War II, Madgwick and his colleagues proposed an <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> plan for the Australian Army. The government accepted the plan and, from 1941 to 1946, Madgwick served on active duty as Director of the Australian Army Education Service, which provided <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> services to the Army's 250,000 members during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|From September 1939 to March 1940, Madgwick {{designed}} and managed an <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> scheme for the Sydney University Regiment, based at Menangle. As Australia in 1940 became increasingly involved in World War II and expanded its military forces, Madgwick and colleagues David Drummond, C.E.W. Bean, (Sir) Robert W. Wallace (Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney), Richard Charles Mills, W.G.K. Duncan, Alf A.J. Conlon, and others began to publicly {{call for the}} Australian Army to install an <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> program to combat illiteracy among its members and educate them in the political history of Australia. Beginning in May 1940 and culminating in a special conference on 20 August 1940, Madgwick and the others cooperatively drafted an <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> scheme for the Army.|$|E
5|$|The last plank in Patton's {{education}} platform was {{the improvement}} of <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> This issue allowed him {{to work with a}} political foe, Republican senator David L. Williams, who had been pushing for additional resources for <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> since 1997. In 1998, Patton personally chaired a task force on <b>adult</b> <b>education,</b> and 18months later, the task force's recommendations were incorporated into a bill sponsored by Williams. The bill, which increased and equalized funding and tied continuing funds to successful performance by individual adult-education programs, passed both houses of the General Assembly unanimously. By 2003, the number of adults completing their GED rose by 17percent, and the number of GED recipients who matriculated to college rose from 13percent to 18percent.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} of <b>adult's</b> <b>education</b> and physical culture. It focuses on the growing role of <b>education,</b> especially <b>adults,</b> in contemporary society and formulates the idea of historical transformation of formerly time-and age-limited education in contemporary lifelong learning. In relation to that, the thesis describes the culture, especially the physical, and its link to the lifelong learning. This fact is considered from a historical and a theoretical perspective. Based on that, the thesis examines the relationship of <b>adult's</b> <b>education</b> and physical culture in the general theoretical and currently practical point of view. The importance of this investigation evaluates for potential <b>adult's</b> <b>education</b> knowledge application in physical culture and possible social function enhancing...|$|R

40|$|M. Phil. (<b>Adult</b> and Community <b>Education)</b> The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996 : 13) {{stipulates}} {{that everyone has}} the right to Basic Education and Training and to Further Education and Training, which the state through reasonable measures must make progressively available and accessible to all citizens. It has often been acknowledged that a well-developed <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training sector in the country could make a major contribution to South Africa's economic growth and general social development. The <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training Sector is meant to address the transformation of "night schools" into meaningful <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training centres. In 1997 the Department of Education adopted a framework for the implementation of <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training. This multi-year plan, informed the development of <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training plans at provincial level. Therefore, the Gauteng Department of Education's <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training plan set out a multi-level programme of action for four years, (1997 - 2000), which plan has now been strengthened by the promulgation of <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training Act No. 52 of 2000. The plan strategy as stipulated by the Department of Education (1997 : 4) sought to provide strategic direction for the transformation of <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training Centres in order to respond to the Education and Training needs of the citizens of this country. The plan also identified priorities, including timeframes that guide the restructuring of the sector. The policy framework as stated above, is quite clear in terms of {{what needs to be done}} to restructure and transform <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training centres. However these centres remain untouched by the envisaged developments. The pace at which change is happening is very slow. Therefore, this study sought to establish what are the stumbling blocks to the reorganisation of these <b>Adult</b> Basic <b>Education</b> and Training centres...|$|R

5|$|Among Madgwick's priorities, in {{addition}} to the mandated extension program, was the expansion of the university's curriculum while orienting it to meet the needs and culture of the New England community. As the first Australian university located in a rural area, Madgwick focused the university's development in the areas of <b>adult</b> <b>education,</b> agriculture, and ranching. These programs would help define the new university.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1943, Madgwick {{participated in}} {{government}} educational {{planning for the}} post-war years. He {{played a major role}} in the establishment of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme to provide government assistance to ex-servicemembers to complete or undertake university education. In 1944 Madgwick and colleagues began drafting their vision for post-war <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> and articulated their vision at the Workers Education Association of New South Wales Conference, held 10–11 March 1944 in Sydney. They followed-up the conference with a formal, published paper, which called for heavy Commonwealth government involvement and expenditures on <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> Their proposed plan, however, was rejected by the Prime Minister's office, which, to Madgwick's disappointment selected a more modest program. Madgwick's active duty service ended in March 1946 and he was transferred to reserve officer status on 19 April 1946.|$|E

40|$|Higher {{education}} {{is associated with}} less age-related decline in cognitive function, but the mechanism of this protective effect is unknown. The authors examined the effect of age on the relation between education and brain activity by correlating years of education with activity measured using functional MRI during memory tasks in young and older adults. In young <b>adults,</b> <b>education</b> was negatively correlated with frontal activity, whereas in older <b>adults,</b> <b>education</b> {{was positively correlated with}} frontal activity. Medial temporal activity was associated with more <b>education</b> in young <b>adults</b> but less <b>education</b> in older <b>adults.</b> This suggests that the frontal cortex is engaged by older adults, particularly by the highly educated, as an alternative network that may be engaged to aid cognitive function...|$|R
