5|$|Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially {{received}} in Spain <b>and</b> <b>Rome,</b> {{it happened at}} a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity.

5|$|Eilífr Goðrúnarson's Christianity-influenced {{account of}} Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of Skáldskaparmál) {{associates}} the {{well with the}} south <b>and</b> <b>Rome.</b> Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though {{there may be no}} other causative connection. Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan skald, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.|$|E

The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, <b>and</b> <b>Rome</b> did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
