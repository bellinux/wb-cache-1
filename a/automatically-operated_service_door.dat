500|$|While it was {{not named}} {{as a cause of}} the accident, {{investigators}} also found that the passenger safety briefing cards in the airplane showed two types of galley <b>service</b> <b>doors.</b> However, only one door is installed on a particular F28 model at any one time. The examination also showed that the safety card did not show how to operate either of the two types of galley <b>service</b> <b>doors</b> in the emergency mode if the normal opening mode failed. However, the final report stated that this [...] "did not contribute to the fatalities in the accident." ...|$|R
50|$|On 16 December 2004, {{during an}} earlier flight from Warsaw, the same {{aircraft}} experienced a rapid loss of cabin {{pressure and the}} crew made an emergency descent. The cabin crew reported to the captain {{that there had been}} a bang from the aft <b>service</b> <b>door,</b> and that there was a hand-sized hole in the door's seal. The Air Accident and Incident Investigation Board (AAIIB) of Cyprus could not conclusively determine the causes of the incident, but indicated two possibilities: an electrical malfunction causing the opening of the outflow valve, or the inadvertent opening of the aft <b>service</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

5000|$|For the 2008 model year, Blue Bird made {{a number}} of updates to the Vision. While the bus body itself {{remained}} unchanged, the hood design saw an extensive redesign. To increase space and improve engine cooling required for lower-emissions engines, the sharply angled hood was replaced by a more aerodynamic design that offered a larger grille. In another move, the hood design also moved the Blue Bird emblem {{from the back of the}} hood sides directly onto the grille. [...] Several changes to the Vision would reflect the connection of Blue Bird to Volvo in the early 2000s; rather than sourcing parts from the All American, the 2008 Vision would source a number of parts from Volvo trucks (headlights, steering column, and instrument cluster). Along with the traditional manual and air-powered <b>service</b> <b>doors,</b> an electric-powered <b>service</b> <b>door</b> became an option.|$|R

Small hooded vents are set into the wall above each of the windows.|$|R
5|$|The 767 {{interior}} introduced larger overhead bins {{and more}} lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and <b>service</b> <b>doors</b> are an overhead plug type, which retract upwards, and commonly used doors can {{be equipped with}} an electric-assist system.|$|R
25|$|The captain {{escaped from}} the {{aircraft}} through the left sliding window. 18 people {{escaped from the}} aircraft from the left overwing exit. 13 persons got out through the left main boarding door. 4 people jumped from the right <b>service</b> <b>door.</b> The rear jumpseat flight attendant and a passenger died from smoke inhalation in the DC-9's tailcone; the tailcone release was not activated, and later investigation determined that the tailcone release mechanism was mechanically inoperable.|$|R

5000|$|In {{aircraft}} terms, an [...] "exit" [...] is {{any one of}} {{the main}} doors (entry doors on the port side of the aircraft and <b>service</b> <b>doors</b> on the starboard side) and an [...] "emergency exit" [...] is defined as a door that is only ever used in an emergency (such as overwing exits and permanently armed exits). Passengers seated in exit rows may be called upon to assist and open exits {{in the event of an}} emergency.|$|R
25|$|Of the 142 {{people on}} board, 2 {{passengers}} sustained serious injuries; 41 passengers {{and the captain}} sustained minor injuries; and 94 passengers, 3 flight attendants, and the first officer sustained no injuries. The airplane sustained extensive exterior damage and some internal damage to the passenger cabin. During the accident sequence, the forward <b>service</b> <b>door</b> (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane; the nose gear collapsed; and the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed.|$|R
50|$|The use {{component}} {{is similar in}} nature to the use districts of Euclidean zoning. With an emphasis on form standards, however, use components are typically more inclusive and broader in scope. The site components define a variety of site conditions from low intensity to high intensity such as size and scale of buildings and parking, accessory structures, drive-through commercial lanes, landscaping, outdoor storage and display, vehicle fueling and washing, overhead commercial <b>service</b> <b>doors,</b> etc. The architectural components address architectural elements and materials.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{specific}} seating order to every formal dinner, based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The seat of honor, reserved for the host or oldest person, is usually {{the one in the}} center facing east or facing the entrance. Others with higher status then sit in close proximity to the seat of honor, while those with lower positions sit further away. The host takes the least prominent seat, generally the one nearest to the kitchen entrance or <b>service</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
25|$|Boeing 717-300X: Proposed {{stretched}} version, formerly MD-95-50; {{studies suggest}} typical two-class seating for 130 passengers, with overall length increased to 138ft 4 in (42.16 m) by addition of nine frames (five forward and four aft of wing); higher MTOW and space-limited payloads weights; additional <b>service</b> <b>door</b> aft of wing; and 21,000lb (93.4kN) BR 715C1-30 engines.

50|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{the accident was}} survivable, and the bodies of 15 of the 27 dead passengers were located near the rear <b>service</b> <b>door,</b> which could be manually opened by passengers. The door lock {{was found in the}} closed position. Medical examination was undertaken on 26 of the 27, and all had died from chemical asphyxiation or burns. The stewardess had also obtained fractures to the ribs, left clavicle and her third thoracic vertebrae. The accident report stated many of the passengers may have tried to leave the aircraft, but were overcome in doing so.|$|R
5000|$|In their {{analysis}} of the accident, the NTSB stated that, [...] "with {{the exception of the}} captain, who sustained fatal injuries on impact, everyone aboard this flight could have survived if rapid egress from the fire area had been possible or if flame propagation had been retarded." [...] They found that, because of the position of the bodies of the passengers, an unsuccessful attempt had been made to open the rear <b>service</b> <b>door.</b> The instructions, printed {{on the inside of the}} door, would have been difficult to read in the smoke.|$|R
5000|$|Nisman {{was found}} {{next to a}} Bersa gun, [...]22 caliber, in his 13th-floor {{apartment}} in the Torre del Parque building within the upscale Le Parc Puerto Madero development located in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires. At 3 a.m. on Monday, 19 January 2015, after Nisman's mother tried, with no success, to open the door, a locksmith could open the <b>service</b> <b>door</b> of his house, which was locked from inside. When they managed to get inside, Nisman's body was found lifeless in the bathroom, along with a pistol and a cap bullet.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{aircraft}} arrived from London earlier that morning, the previous flight crew had reported a frozen door seal and abnormal noises {{coming from the}} right aft <b>service</b> <b>door.</b> They requested a full inspection of the door.
