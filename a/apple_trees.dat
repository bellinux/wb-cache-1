40|$|International audiencePruning {{treatment}} {{is one of}} the important management practices of perennial fruit tree cultivation. Combining fruit tree growth theory with mathematics model and software development is an effective way in agricultural research. Virtual <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> is built as a case to study pruning treatment in this paper. First, architectural development of <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> was analyzed and stored in xml file. Then, the simulation software of <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> pruning is build based on the Qt framework and OpenGL graphics library. The interactive pruning and automatic pruning with setting conditions are realized in the software. Reaction laws of <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> pruning are extracted from the analysis on the experiment data. Stochastic 3 D <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> architectures after being pruned also can be simulated. Result indicates that simulation is efficient, accurate and timely judgment of pruning reaction is possible.

5|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>trees</b> are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management is the use of organic methods. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.|$|E

This reduced the soil depletion inherent to tobacco production, and allowed for the practice of crop rotation.

5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five <b>apple</b> <b>trees</b> planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E

As of 2013 grafts have been taken off all the fruit trees so that the garden can be restocked with these varieties when the garden is restored.
