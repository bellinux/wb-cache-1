The title {{made me think of}} an entire generation of Lolitas: someone—our parents? God?—needed us to be there, but the need felt neurotic and uncompassionate. In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed.</b> But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E

5000|$|You're <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> is {{the second}} studio album by soul musicians Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, {{released}} in August 1968 on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Highlighted by three hit singles written by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson (who composed {{two of the four}} hit songs on the first Gaye/Terrell duets LP, United), You're <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> was recorded throughout 1966 and 1967 and features two Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits, [...] "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing" [...] and [...] "You're <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> to Get By". It peaked at #60 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart. You're <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> was the two singers' final collaboration effort, as Terrell would become ill following recording, before succumbing to a brain tumor in 1970.|$|R

2500|$|Williams married four times. She met {{her first}} husband Leonard Kovner while {{attending}} Los Angeles City College. She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, much to my relief, that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. I had come to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner {{was not a man}} I could ever really love." [...] They divorced on September 12, 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{thinking}} behind his {{change of name}} when he converted to Islam he stated that he was [...] "latching on to something {{that was part of}} my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba, and their culture survived slavery... My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that's a terrible burden on black people, because they don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted." ...|$|E

Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, but it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd {{keep coming back to}} my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E

60|$|She bent {{her back}} in a clumsy bow, and with a growing humility {{wondered}} had I supped. I had not, but sooner would I have starved than have been poisoned by such foulnesses as they might have set before me. So I answered her that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> was a cup of wine.|$|E
60|$|One {{hand was}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed.</b> There was now nothing any unassisted man could do except keep the craft {{straight}} before wind and sea, {{but it was}} quite sufficient for one who had lost much of his dexterity with the tiller, and at times the boat twisted on a white crest in imminent peril of rolling over. Worse than all, the waves that smote the flat stern commenced to splash on board, and the water inside the boat rose rapidly. Already the floorings were floating, and I dare not for a second loose the tiller. It was Lucille Haldane who solved the difficulty.|$|E
60|$|And farm management! I {{know the}} waste of {{superfluous}} motion without studying a moving picture record of it, whether it be farm or farm-hand, the layout of buildings or {{the layout of the}} farm-hands' labour. There is my handbook and tables on the subject. Beyond the shadow of any doubt, at this present moment, a hundred thousand farmers are knotting their brows over its spread pages ere they tap out their final pipe and go to bed. And yet, so far was I beyond my tables, that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> was a mere look at a man to know his predispositions, his co-ordinations, and the index fraction of his motion-wastage.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have done}} foolish {{things in my}} life," [...] he went on, drawing her nearer to him. [...] "When I was young, I felt that I had the {{strength}} of a superman, and that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> in life was food for the brain. I placed woman in her wrong place. I sold myself and my chance of happiness that I might gain more power, a wider influence. It was a sin against life. It was a greater crime against myself. Now that the thunder is muttering and the time is coming for the last test, I see the truth as I have never seen it before. Nature has taken me by the hand--shows it me.--Tell me it isn't too late, Jane? Tell me you care? Help me. I have never pleaded for help before. I plead to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|As my {{wife had}} presumed, Pomona made no {{objections}} to remaining {{in charge of the}} house. The scheme pleased her greatly. So far, so good. I called that day on a friend who was in the habit of camping out {{to talk to him about}} getting a tent and the necessary [...] "traps" [...] for a life in the woods. He proved perfectly competent to furnish advice and everything else. He offered to lend me <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed.</b> He had a complete outfit; had done with them for the year, and I was perfectly welcome. Here was rare luck. He gave me a tent, camp-stove, dishes, pots, gun, fishing-tackle, a big canvas coat with dozens of pockets riveted on it, a canvas hat, rods, reels, boots that came up to my hips, and about a wagon-load of things in all. He was a real good fellow.|$|E
60|$|He looked haggard and thin, {{but seemed}} amiable enough. He {{was in his}} shirt-sleeves and he had {{come out with a}} gun in his hand. This he laid on a table near the wall. He wore no belt. I rode right up to the porch and, {{greeting}} them laconically, made a show of a somewhat tangle-footed cowboy dismounting. The moment I got off and straightened up, I asked no more. The game was mine. It was the great hour of my life and I met it as I had never met another. I looked and acted what I pretended to be, though a deep and intense passion, an almost ungovernable suspense, an icy sickening nausea abided with me. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed,</b> all I wanted was to get Sampson and Wright together, or failing that, to maneuver into such position that I had any kind of a chance. Sampson's gun on the table made three distinct objects for me to watch and two of them could change position.|$|E

60|$|I {{replied that}} nothing would please me better than to tell them, but that I was starving, and would fain eat {{something}} first. I was soon supplied with <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed,</b> and having satisfied my hunger I told them faithfully all that had befallen me. They were lost in wonder at my tale when it was interpreted to them, and said that adventures so surprising must be related to their king only by the man to whom they had happened. So, procuring a horse, they mounted me upon it, and we set out, followed by several strong men carrying my raft {{just as it was}} upon their shoulders. In this order we marched into the city of Serendib, where the natives presented me to their king, whom I saluted in the Indian fashion, prostrating myself at his feet and kissing the ground; but the monarch bade me rise and sit beside him, asking first what was my name.|$|E
60|$|I do not know, but I {{think they}} used that tank between the rooms to draw {{drinking}} water from; {{that did not}} occur to me, however, until I had dipped my baking head far down into its cool depths. I thought of it then, and superb as the bath was, I was sorry I had taken it, {{and was about to}} go and explain to the landlord. But a finely curled and scented poodle dog frisked up and nipped the calf of my leg just then, and before I had time to think, I had soused him {{to the bottom of the}} tank, and when I saw a servant coming with a pitcher I went off and left the pup trying to climb out and not succeeding very well. Satisfied revenge was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to make me perfectly happy, and when I walked in to supper that first night in Damascus I was in that condition. We lay on those divans a long time, after supper, smoking narghilies and long-stemmed chibouks, and talking about the dreadful ride of the day, and I knew then what I had sometimes known before--that it is worth while to get tired out, because one so enjoys resting afterward.|$|E
6000|$|H.M.S. Caryatid went to Portland to join Blue Fleet for manoeuvres. I {{travelled}} overland from London {{by way of}} Portsmouth, where I fell among friends. When I reached Portland, H.M.S. Caryatid, whose guest I was to have been, had, with Blue Fleet, already sailed {{for some}} secret rendezvous off {{the west coast of}} Ireland, and Portland breakwater was filled with Red Fleet, my official enemies and joyous acquaintances, who received me with unstinted hospitality. For example, Lieutenant-Commander A.L. Hignett, in charge of three destroyers, Wraith, Stiletto, and Kobbold, due to depart at 6 P.M. that evening, offered me a berth on his thirty-knot flagship, but I preferred my comforts, and so accepted sleeping-room in H.M.S. Pedantic (15,000 tons), leader of the second line. After dining aboard her I took boat to Weymouth to get my kit aboard, as the battleships would go to war at midnight. In transferring my allegiance from Blue to Red Fleet, whatever the Marine Captain may say, I did no wrong. I truly intended to return to the Pedantic and help to fight Blue Fleet. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> was a new toothbrush, which I bought from a chemist in a side street at 9:15 P. M. As I turned to go, one entered seeking alleviation of a gum-boil. He was dressed in a checked ulster, a black silk hat three sizes too small, cord-breeches, boots, and pure brass spurs. These he managed painfully, stepping like a prisoner fresh from leg-irons. As he adjusted the pepper-plaster to the gum the light fell on his face, and I recognised Mr. Emanuel Pyecroft, late second-class petty officer of H.M.S. Archimandrite, an unforgettable man, met a year before under Tom Wessel's roof in Plymouth. It occurred to me that when a petty officer takes to spurs he may conceivably meditate desertion. For that reason I, though a taxpayer, made no sign. Indeed, it was Mr. Pyecroft, following me out of the shop, who said hollowly: [...] "What might you be doing here?" ...|$|E
