5|$|As {{the rift}} between the players <b>and</b> <b>Brown</b> and between Modell <b>and</b> <b>Brown</b> grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} {{developed over the}} timing of the decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, <b>and</b> <b>Brown</b> began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E
5|$|Carty <b>and</b> <b>Brown</b> were, {{according}} to Brown, childhood friends who thought {{of each other}} as cousins.

Carty had one conviction for assaulting a police officer when he was 16 years old, and a caution for possessing cannabis. Brown had no previous convictions.

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI.
