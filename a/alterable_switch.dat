The shutter is capable of closing an aperture of 5 mm at a maximum speed of 1. 7 mm/ms with a timing jitter of less than 10 mus. When combined with polarization optics, our device {{can also be used}} as an <b>alterable</b> <b>switch</b> and adjustable attenuator. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
