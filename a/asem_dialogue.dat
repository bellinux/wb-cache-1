Is there an interaction between both types of players or is the <b>ASEM</b> <b>Dialogue</b> still dominated by state parties? And does the discussion of human rights within the <b>ASEM</b> <b>Dialogue</b> actually lead to more protection of these rights within the region of Southeast Asia? These are the research questions I have tried to answer in this paper on the <b>ASEM</b> <b>Dialogue</b> as an example of multilateral, international negotiation. Human rights are a controversial issue and have caused a sometimes troublesome relation between the European and East Asia continents. The case of Burma/Myanmar is a clear example in which both sides were, more or less, clear opponents. The {{reason for this is that}} the East Asian states have tried to keep the issue of human rights off the official ASEM agenda, while the European states were in favour of dealing with the issue in the Summits. Nonstate actors, like non-governmental organisations have held parallel sessions on general issues on the ASEM agenda, but have also organised specific meetings on human rights issues. Asian states have tried to prevent these parallel sessions from taking place, and have limited the possible role of non-governmental organisations in general, using a similar argument as for preventing the human rights dialogue. Despite these restraints, a slow increase in the role that NGOs can play in the region is occurring. The ASEM Summit can function as a legitimization for these non-state actors to increase their influence. And the European states should use this trend to get the issue of human rights discussed during the Summits, by letting the NGOs lobby for it. Through this interaction with European states, NGOs can increase their effectiveness and hopefully increase the level of human rights protection...|$|E
40|$|From {{its formal}} {{inception}} in Bangkok, in March 1996, the Asia-Europe Dialogue (ASEM) {{has been seen}} by Europeans {{as a means to}} reduce the threat of emergence of a block mentality in the two geographical areas. The <b>ASEM</b> <b>dialogue</b> distinguishes itself from other political and economic fora by the high level of its participants. The economic, political and cultural diversity of the ASEM Member States, as well as the constraints imposed by their belonging to two major regional institutional groupings, the European Union and ASEAN, make this dialogue and the creation of common institutions responding to the expectations of all stakeholders even more complex. In addition, ASEAN itself must be strengthened as a model of regional integration in order to effectively support the ASEM process, failing which the stability of Asia could be seriously jeopardized by endogenous factors related to the issue of sustainability of growth and of political handling of economic and political integration.

40|$|This CEPS Policy Brief {{is based}} on a larger study for the EEAS and European Commission, written by the same authors in the run-up of the Milan ASEM summit of 16 - 17 October 2014. The main idea of the study is to assess whether ASEM works and how, by verifying the factual {{evidence}} in detail. After all, ASEM has no institutions, no budget and no treaty, whilst dialogues and a loose improvement over time in Asia-Europe relations refer to process much more than genuine ‘results’. The stocktaking covers all ASEM activities since the 2006 Helsinki summit. Summit and foreign ministers’ declarations and ASEM calendar of activities (and interviews) are used to trace ASEM activities in the three ASEM pillars (political, economic, and peoples-to-peoples/cultural). All the ‘regular’ ASEM meetings at ministerial and other levels (many of which are only known to relatively few) have been mapped. Also the ASEM working methods, based on the 2000 AECF framework and many subsequent initiatives, have been scrutinised, including whether they are actually implemented or not or partially. Such methods refer to how to work together in areas of cooperation (beyond the typical <b>ASEM</b> <b>dialogue),</b> organisation, coordination and ASEM visibility. The main conclusion is that ASEM works reasonably well, once one accepts the ASEM of today, although some inefficiencies still characterise the ‘system’. There is a host of secondary conclusions on the three pillars, the foreign ministers, the strong government-to-government nature of ASEM and the working methods. We recommend that today’s ASEM needs no reform and that not having ASEM would entail political and diplomatic costs. We emphasise that ASEM is well placed to stimulate exchange of information between the mega-FTAs such as TPP, RCEP and TTIP. However, the ASEM of tomorrow might be different, given the great changes in geo-political and economic conditions since ASEM began in the mid- 1990 s. Moreover, the size of ASEM has become such that classical ways of operating with (after Milano) 53 countries (including the EU and ASEAN) cannot possibly be effective all the time. We suggest that, {{in the run-up to the}} 20 th ASEM birthday (2016), EU and Asian independent think-tanks get together to write an ‘options report’ reconsidering options for a new ASEM, as the basis for a profound and wide debate how to get more value-added out of ASEM...|$|E

40|$|ASEF {{has been}} {{acting as a}} bridge between the diverse peoples and states of Asia and Europe, {{supporting}} the Asia Europe Meetings or <b>ASEM.</b> Interfaith <b>dialogues,</b> bringing together cultures and civilizations, became a major interest of the ASEAN and the European Union after 9 / 11. ASEM has organized 4 conferences on interfaith dialogue over the last 10 years, involving governments and the religious. The ASEF “Talks on the Hill ” are dialogue retreats organized around selected issues, reflecting the common concerns of Asia and Europe. ASEF is planning up to six dialogue retreats around religion and interfaith issues. Why religion and interfaith issues? As ASEF explains, “Religion is, and will continue to be, a powerful element in the tensions and polarization between and within societies with differing cultural and religious values.
