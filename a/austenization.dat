Prototypic 9 % and 12 % Cr steels, grade 91 (9 Cr- 1 MoVNb) and type 422 stainless (12 Cr- 1 MoVW), respectively, were austenized at 925 °C and 1050 °C and tempered at 760 °C. The reduced <b>austenization</b> temperature was intended to simulate potential inadequate <b>austenization</b> during field construction of large structures and also the thermal cycle experienced in the Type IV region of weld heat affected zones (HAZ). The microstructure, tensile behavior, and creep strength were characterized for both steels treated at each condition. The reduced <b>austenization</b> temperature resulted in general coarsening of carbides in both steels and polygonization of the tempered martensite structure in type 422. For this steel, a marked reduction in microhardness was observed, while there was little change in microhardness for grade 91. Slight reductions in tensile strength were observed for both steels at room temperature and elevated temperatures of 450 and 550 °C. The strength reduction was greater for type 422 than for grade 91. At 650 °C the tensile strength reduction was minimal for both steels.

In present work, <b>austenization</b> process during intercritical annealing was studied in a Fe-C-Mn steel using Gleeble- 1500 thermal simulator and quantitative microscopy. The experimental {{results show that}} austenite formation is separated into three different stages: (i) growth of high carbon austenite into pearlite rapidly until pearlite dissolution is completed; (ii) slower growth of austenite into ferrite; (iii) very slow equilibration between ferrite and austenite. The thermodynamic and kinetic analyses show that growth of austenite into ferrite is controlled by carbon diffusion in austenite in the primary stage and manganese diffusion in ferrite in the subsequent stage because diffusion coefficient of Mn in ferrite is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of C in austenite. The slow final equilibration between ferrite and austenite is obtained by manganese diffusion through the austenite. Based on the analysis, one dimensional diffusion model of intercritical <b>austenization</b> was developed and solved using finite volume method {{on the assumption that}} solute flux was local balance at interface, and the kinetics calculated was compared with experimental results.

That conclusion was tested in the present investigation, which used high resolution scanning Auger microscopy to study the intergranular fracture surfaces. The fracture mode at liquid nitrogen temperature was found to be intergranular fracture whenever the alloy was quenched from the austenite field, irrespective of the <b>austenization</b> time or temperature. High resolution chemical analyses of the intergranular fracture surfaces failed to reveal any consistent segregation of P, S, 0, or N.

The experiments performed by means of microstructural, fractographic investigations and microchemical point analysis proved that preffered areas for void initiation are interdendritic segregations in the core of bloom. We observed vanadium carbide precipitates that are situated close to the cracks, whereas the content of vanadium was 7, 5 times more then in an average smelt composition. The further development of defects is connected with fast heating up to the <b>austenization</b> temperature in soaking pit. Our results confirm that marked decrease of defects can be achieved by optimization of production process, i. e. optimized casting speed, steel overheat above the liquidus temperature and/or application of M-EMS...|$|E
40|$|Nodular {{cast iron}} {{comes to be}} the most used {{material}} in manufacturing industry. Recently, a number of engineering to enhance the mechanical properties of nodular cast iron have been being given including through the heat treatment called single-step austempered. In general, the process of single-step heat treatment is conducted through <b>austenization</b> at the temperature of 900 °C with the holding time of 60 minutes and quenched at various austempered temperatures of 280, 310, and 340 °C in the holding time of 60 and 120 minutes. The observation on fatigue crack behaviour was performed in comparison of stress R= 0 and at 11 -Hz frequency. From the result of the research, a graphic about relationship of crack length (a) and the number of cycles (N), and the graphic of the fatigue crack growth rate (da/dN) with the stress intensity factor of (Δk). In addition, it is found that the single-step austempered heat treatment at the austempered temperature at 340 °C with the holding time of 120 minutes showed a slower fatigue crack growth rate in comparison to the temperature and time below. The slowness of the fatigue crack growth rate was caused by the higher percentage of the pearlite matrix phase in comparison to the ferrite matrix, nodular distance, and the relatively even nodule distribution...|$|E
