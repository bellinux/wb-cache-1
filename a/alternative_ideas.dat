25|$|Hypotheses {{suggesting}} that genocidal violence {{may have caused}} the extinction of Neanderthals have been offered by several authors, including Jared Diamond and Ronald Wright. However, several scholars have formed <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas</b> {{as to why the}} Neanderthals died off, with there being no clear consensus viewpoint in the scientific community.|$|E
25|$|Eugene has a {{significant}} population of people in pursuit of <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas</b> and a large original hippie population. Beginning in the 1960s, the countercultural ideas and viewpoints espoused by Ken Kesey became established as the seminal elements of the vibrant social tapestry that continue to define Eugene. The Merry Prankster, as Kesey was known, has arguably left the most indelible imprint of any cultural icon in his hometown. He {{is best known as}} the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and as the male protagonist in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, the Senior Management Board {{proposed}} {{the closure of}} its Physics Department to future undergraduate application. This was ascribed to financial reasons and lack of <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas</b> and caused considerable controversy, not least a debate in Parliament over the closure which prompted heated discussion of higher education issues in general. On 10 October the Senate voted to close the Department of Physics, a move confirmed by the Council on 20 November. Other departments closed in recent years include Music, Sociology, Geology, and Mechanical Engineering. The university council decided in March 2009 to close the School of Health and Social Care, a school whose courses have consistently been oversubscribed.|$|E

25|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects.|$|R
50|$|When {{architect}} Christian Christie {{presented his}} ideas for a {{restoration of the}} west section and the west front, an <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> was published by Macody Lund, introducing the screenfront and the rose window. Both of these ideas were included in Olaf Nordhagen's 1907 plan {{for the restoration of}} the cathedral.|$|R
25|$|The term crank {{magnetism}} {{was coined}} by physiologist and blogger Mark Hoofnagle on the Denialism Blog in 2007 {{to describe the}} propensity of cranks to hold multiple irrational, unsupported or ludicrous beliefs that are often unrelated to one another, referring to William Dembski endorsing both a Holocaust denier and a conspiracy theory put forward by Peter Duesberg. Crank magnetism may be considered to operate wherever a single person propounds a number of unrelated denialist conjectures, poorly supported conspiracy theories, or pseudoscientific claims. Thus, some of the common crank characteristics — such as the lack of technical ability, ignorance of scientific terminology, and claims that <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas</b> are being suppressed by the mainstream — may be operating on and manifested in multiple orthogonal assertions.|$|E
25|$|Association {{with the}} Infantry School increased, but {{inspection}} trips formerly used at Langley first became voluntary {{and then were}} discontinued. Only a handful of graduates {{had gone on to}} attend the Command and General Staff School, and as a result the Tactical School ended its role as a preparatory school. Instead the ACTS became the equivalent for Air Corps officers of C, and increased the emphasis on air subjects to {{more than half of the}} total course hours by 1934–1935, with an accompanying decrease in hours for ground and administrative subjects. Classroom studies were similarly altered. Lectures occupied only half of a classroom hour, with the remainder given over to discussion and debate of concepts presented and of <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these {{is the issue of}} power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas</b> (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E
50|$|The Communist International {{developed}} the <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> of transitional slogans, seeing the minimum/maximum division as leaving social democratic parties always campaigning {{only for their}} minimum programme and not clearly planning a route to achieve their maximum programme, though the eventual Programme was {{more in line with}} a maximum programme than with transitional slogans.|$|R

500|$|Hansell was {{promoted}} to first lieutenant on October 1, 1934 and entered the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field as {{a student in the}} comprehensive 845-hour, 36-week course, studying not only air tactics and airpower theory, which comprised {{more than half of the}} curriculum, but also tactics of other services, combined (joint) warfare, armament and gunnery, logistics, navigation and meteorology, staff duties, photography, combat orders, and antiaircraft defenses. [...] Among his instructors was Captain George, now director of the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy. George's classes were half lecture, half free discussion and conceptualizing, with George or his assistant Capt. Odas Moon expounding theories and having the students critically examine them for flaws and <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas,</b> debates that continued beyond the classroom as well.|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of the Indo-Aryan {{migration}} theory {{question it}} and instead promote {{the notion of}} Indigenous Aryans, which claims that speakers of Indo-Iranian languages (sometimes called Aryan languages) are [...] "indigenous" [...] to the Indian subcontinent. Within India, several such <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas</b> {{of the origins of}} the Indo-Iranian languages and cultures have been developed that purport to show indigenous origins. They are rejected by mainstream scholars, who point out that they neglect linguistic research, and are contradicted by a broad range of research on Indo-European migrations.|$|E
2500|$|Both England and France bid to {{host the}} tournament. The tender {{document}} for the 2007 bidding process was due out on 31 October 2001. Both England and France were invited to re-submit their plans. The International Rugby Board (IRB) stated that both countries must comply with tender document terms in one bid, but in their second option, could propose <b>alternative</b> <b>ideas.</b> The IRB said [...] "England's original proposal contained three plans for hosting the tournament with a traditional, new and hybrid format all on offer... The French bid, while complying with the tender document in all other respects, fell outside one of the `windows` in which the IRB wanted to stage an event". England's bids included a two-tier tournament and altering {{the structure of the}} qualifying tournament and France had a bid in September/October.|$|E
2500|$|Vice Verses {{garnered}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Christianity Today, Jeremy V.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} on {{the role}} of kitchen gardening by showing case studies in Bangladesh and Japan. Although situated in ecologically and economically different conditions, kitchengardens have persisted in both cases, mainly maintained by women. With the expansion of market economy, devaluation of such subsistence production has been occurring, but on the other hand, movement for reevaluation also can be observed with the disclosure of modern technologies’ limitation. Detailed reviewing and verification of subsistence agriculture is hastened in search for the <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> of development...|$|R
40|$|Forty {{years after}} the writing of "Art and Objecthood," this thesis {{presents}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> of objecthood that moves from Michael Fried's original association of the concept with the objects of literalist (minimalist) art to an idea of objecthood as a field (of both vision and action).

40|$|Idea {{association}} {{involves a}} dynamic linking process among ideas, cases and the links themselves. Based {{on the knowledge}} representation issue-concept-form proposed by Oxman (1994), design ideas, cases and links are elucidated. Furthermore, various and dynamic linking plays are involved in two steps: divergent, in which <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> entities are linked, and convergent, in which these idea entities are selected. These linking plays provide a computational mechanism for indexing prior design cases dynamically. Finally, an index prototype for supporting the linking process of idea association, called Mapmaker, is proposed in this paper...|$|R

50|$|The {{efforts of}} this group to {{organize}} against the American war effort came as a direct challenge to President Woodrow Wilson and supporters of the national military cause, and a boycott was launched to deny the People's Council use of a meeting hall in Minneapolis.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Price and Menzies’ defence of an agential {{theory of}} causation by analogy with the dispositional theory of colour, and their claim that causation {{should be treated}} as a secondary quality. Exploration of the objections to their theory that Price and Menzies discuss shows that causation should not be treated as a secondary quality. These objections are that the agential theory of causation confuses metaphysics with epistemology, that it is unavoidably circular, that it cannot account for causation in cases where agential manipulation is impossible, and that it is unacceptably anthropocentric. It is argued that although understanding causation as a secondary quality is supposed by Price and Menzies to solve these problems, this understanding does not in fact provide adequate responses to the four objections, and hence that treating causation as a secondary quality is under-motivated. It is argued, however, that the analogy made between causation and colour is nevertheless useful, because an idea from a different theory of colour presents a better option for understanding causation. This <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> uses agency, but does not bring the disadvantage of making causation metaphysically dependent on agency. The <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> is built on the argument for selectionism about colour. It is ultimately argued that although causation is not a secondary quality, it may yet be a tertiary quality...|$|R
30|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>idea</b> {{to explain}} the rapid decay of the ring current is a {{replacement}} of the ring current population with tenuous one. This can be achieved when the plasma sheet density rapidly decreases and the convection electric field remains high (Ebihara and Ejiri 1998; Ebihara and Ejiri 2000). During the large magnetic storm on 20 – 21 November 2003, the rapid recovery of Dst {{can be explained by}} the sudden decrease in the plasma sheet density Nps as shown in Fig.  1 (Ebihara et al. 2005 a). When the plasma sheet density is constant in time, Dst shows slow recovery.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> for valve-sparing {{technique}} combining {{the advantages of}} the reimplantation and the benefits of the remodeling techniques. We replace the sinuses of Valsalva using three Dacron skirts from inside of the aorta. The physiological anatomy of the Valsalva sinuses and their dynamic properties are preserved and the aortic commissures displacement avoided. The distal rim of each Dacron skirt was anchored to the aorto-ventricular junction using Ticron (2 - 0) U stitches placed from the ventricular side to the aortic side. We stabilize the base of the aortic annulus to prevent future dilation...|$|R
50|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that chicano derives from the indigenous population of Guanajuato, the Chichimecas, combined with the word Mexicano. An <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> {{is that it is}} an altered form of Chilango, meaning someone from Mexico City or Central Mexico (i.e. the highland states of México, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Puebla and Michoacán). A similar notion is that the word derives from Chichen Itza, the Mayan temple ruin (dating to around 1,500 years ago) its associated culture in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Chicano would thus be a Hispanized word for Chichen and Mayans, rather than the Aztec or Nahua people.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} new pivoting factorization {{methods for}} solving sparse symmetric indenite sys-tems. As opposed to many existing pivoting methods, our SupernodeBunchKaufman (SBK) pivoting method dy-namically selects and 	 pivots {{and may be}} supplemented by pivot perturbation techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the numerical accuracy of this algorithm and also show that a high performance implementa-tion is feasible. We will also show that symmetric maximum-weighted matching strategies add an additional level of reliability to SBK. These techniques {{can be seen as}} a complement to the <b>alternative</b> <b>idea</b> of using more complete pivoting techniques during the numerical factorization. Numerical experiments validate these conclusions...|$|R
