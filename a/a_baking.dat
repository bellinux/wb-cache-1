5|$|Enrollment grew to {{approximately}} 1,000 students by 1969, beyond {{the capacity of}} its original campus, so the school purchased the St. Andrew-on-Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park, New York in 1970. In 1971, the college began awarding associate degrees, and opened its doors in Hyde Park in the following year. From 1974 to 1979, the school built three residence halls, a culinary library, a career planning center, and a learning resources center. From 1982 to 1984, the American Bounty and Caterina de' Medici Restaurants and St. Andrew's Café opened. In 1984, the school's continuing education center (later named the J. Willard Marriott Education Center) opened, and the school improved its teaching kitchens and constructed an experimental kitchen and food laboratory. In 1990, the school opened <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> and pastry facility, named two years later as the Shunsuke Takaki School of Baking and Pastry. In 1993, the school opened its Conrad N. Hilton Library and began offering bachelor's degree programs. In 1995, the school's first branch campus opened, the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, California. In 1998, the Student Recreation Center was opened.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>baking</b> developed, {{the ability}} to {{increase}} the duration and storage of foods stuffs allowed longer distances to be travelled.

40|$|The {{performance}} of one option can entail the {{performance of}} another. For instance, <b>baking</b> <b>an</b> apple pie entails <b>baking</b> <b>a</b> pie. Now, suppose that both of these options—baking <b>a</b> pie and <b>baking</b> <b>an</b> apple pie—are permissible. This raises the issue of which, if either, is more fundamental than the other. Is <b>baking</b> <b>a</b> pie permissible because it’s permissible to bake an apple pie? Or is <b>baking</b> <b>an</b> apple pie permissible because it’s permissible to bake a pie? Or are they equally fundamental, as they would be if they were both permissible because, say, they both accord with Kant’s categorical imperative? I defend {{the view that the}} permissibility of an option that entails another is more fundamental than the permissibility of the option that it entails. That is, I defend maximalism: the view that if an agent is permitted to perform a certain type of action (say, <b>baking</b> <b>a</b> pie), this is in virtue {{of the fact that she}} is permitted to perform some instance of this type (say, <b>baking</b> <b>an</b> apple pie), where φ-ing is an instance of ψ-ing if and only if φ-ing entails ψ-ing but not vice versa. If maximalism is correct, then, as I show, most theories of morality and rationality must be revised...|$|R

25|$|Like {{many other}} peptides, {{aspartame}} may hydrolyze (break down) into its constituent amino acids {{under conditions of}} elevated temperature or high pH. This makes aspartame undesirable as <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in maltodextrin. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on pH. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its half-life is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its half-life {{is only a few}} days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as syrups for fountain beverages, aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as saccharin.|$|E
25|$|To raise revenue, Congress {{significantly}} raised {{tariffs on}} tea and coffee. Profits on these products declined; around 1880 A started to sell sugar in its stores. The company continued aggressive growth and by 1884 operated stores as far west as Kansas City {{and as far}} south as Atlanta. The company also operated wagon routes to serve rural customers. About this time, two of Hartford's sons, George (1864–1957) and John (1872–1951), joined the firm. A lore is that George convinced his father to expand the product line to include <b>A</b> <b>baking</b> powder. Over the next decade, the company added other A products, such as condensed milk, spices, and butter. As it expanded its offerings, the tea company was gradually creating the first grocery chain. By 1900, the firm had sales of $5 million from 198 stores as well as its mail order and wagon route operations. However, other grocery chains were expanding more rapidly and blanketing their respective areas while the tea company's stores were spread over a much larger area. A quickly found itself at a disadvantage.|$|E

2500|$|Heat {{can also}} by itself cause sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{to act as}} a raising agent in baking because of thermal decomposition, releasing carbon dioxide. When used this way on its own, without the presence of an acidic component (whether in the batter or by the use of <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> powder containing acid), only half the available CO2 is released. Additionally, in the absence of acid, thermal decomposition of sodium bicarbonate also produces sodium carbonate, which is strongly alkaline and gives the baked product a bitter, [...] "soapy" [...] taste and a yellow color. To avoid an over-acidic taste from added acid, non-acid ingredients such as whole milk or Dutch-processed cocoa are often added to baked foods.|$|E
2500|$|Founded in 1997 and {{originally}} {{called the}} Academy for Culinary Arts (ACA), ACAHA represented a culinary vocational {{program that was}} reworked to give students a more academic focus.

After being reorganized into academic, college-prep academies, the name changed to the present name in 2002 to reflect the change in emphasis and curriculum.

2500|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed {{that it had a}} sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and {{can be used as a}} tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, beverages, and chewing gum. [...] When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. [...] This makes aspartame undesirable as <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. [...] Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. [...] Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.|$|E
