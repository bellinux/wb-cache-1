5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more {{generally}} as bistatic radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in Bristol Blenheim L6622.

5|$|Authors {{of books}} {{left the country}} in droves and some wrote {{material}} critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of blood and soil.

5|$|The {{central office}} in Washington, which {{evolved into the}} National Meteorological Center and Weather Prediction Center (formally known as the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center), assumed {{hurricane}} warning/advisory responsibility at that time. This responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of the Atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year. Hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept and}} origin of Burnt Norton is {{connected}} to Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. The poem discusses the idea of time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> that only the present moment really matters because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown.|$|E

5|$|When the {{reactivation}} {{of the s}} {{was under}} consideration, a radical design for a battleship-carrier hybrid emerged that would have replaced the ship's rear turret with a flight deck, complete with a hangar and two ski jumps, for operating several Harriers. However, the USMC considered the need for naval gunfire support to be a greater priority than additional platforms for carrier operations, while the cost and delay associated with such elaborate conversions was significant, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E

The East Persian Cordon was established in July 1915 in the Sistan province of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan, and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from the Damani, Reki and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who may have been tempted by German gold. Among the commanders of the Sistan force was Reginald Dyer who led it between March and October 1916.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are {{abundant}} in the film, and its lead character {{has been seen as}} a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> {{of what it means to}} be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their career, the Grateful Dead {{were known}} to {{tolerate}} taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of taping shows appealed to the band's general community ethos. They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers. The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality. Other bands, including Pearl Jam, Phish and the Dave Matthews Band tolerate taping {{in a similar manner}} to the Dead, provided no profit is involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others.|$|E

25|$|Because the Egyptians rarely {{described}} theological ideas explicitly, {{the implicit}} ideas of mythology formed {{much of the}} basis for Egyptian religion. The purpose of Egyptian religion was the maintenance of maat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> that myths express {{were believed to be}} essential to maat. The rituals of Egyptian religion were meant to make <b>the</b> mythic events, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> they represented, real once more, thereby renewing maat. The rituals were believed to achieve this effect through the force of heka, the same connection between <b>the</b> physical <b>and</b> divine realms that enabled the original creation.|$|R
5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> of remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went {{through the process of}} mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{directors are}} allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games. When referring to this freedom, Tabata has compared the mythos <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> behind it to Greek mythology; a mythology with common themes and deities, but featuring a large variety of unrelated stories. Toriyama conceived a story for Final Fantasy XIII set primarily around the mythos' deities and their direct relations to the world. Tabata and Nomura both focused more on the human side of the story. Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in Type-0, while Nomura created a modern-day setting similar to contemporary Earth in XV, referring far less to the mythos' terminology. Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the subseries. In a 2007 interview, Hashimoto compared the planning of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series to film franchises such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: an expansive brand {{on which to build}} multiple Final Fantasy titles planned in advance. The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by Square Enix 1st Production Department. A trademark for Final Fantasy Haeresis XIII hinted at another entry, but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew.|$|E
