25|$|As {{officials}} of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were chroniclers and satirists whose job it was to praise their employers <b>and</b> <b>damn</b> those who crossed them. It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, glam dicin, could raise boils {{on the face of}} its target. However, much of their work would not strike the modern reader as being poetry at all, consisting as it does of extended genealogies and almost journalistic accounts of the deeds of their lords and ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Out of options, Constantine slits his wrists. As he bleeds out, Lucifer arrives to {{personally}} collect his soul. Constantine tells Lucifer of Mammon's plan to usurp him without his knowledge. Lucifer easily overpowers Gabriel, burns Gabriel's wings and banishes Mammon. In return for his help, Lucifer grants Constantine any wish. Constantine asks that Isabel {{be released to}} Heaven. Lucifer complies, but then realizes that he cannot take Constantine to Hell as a consequence. By selflessly sacrificing himself, Constantine is granted entry to Heaven. Infuriated, Lucifer heals Constantine's injuries and cures him of his lung cancer, hoping he will eventually make a mistake <b>and</b> <b>damn</b> himself again. Angela and Constantine depart, leaving the now human Gabriel. Sometime later, Constantine, now {{making an effort to}} quit smoking, entrusts the Spear to Angela and visits Chas' grave, where Chas appears in an angelic form and flies away.|$|E
500|$|The Cleveland premiere on {{the evening}} of April 20, 1953 saw a {{distinguished}} crowd turn out. When the stage backdrop failed to come down on time, Hammerstein was heard to mutter, [...] "Damn <b>and</b> <b>damn</b> <b>and</b> <b>damn!</b> This is a new way: they saved it for the performance!" [...] Nevertheless, the crowd gave the show a rousing welcome. The Cleveland critics thought well of the show, but were concerned about the weak story. After the Cleveland reactions and problems, according to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, [...] "what had seemed to be a show needing minor adjustments became a musical in serious trouble". Bigley remembered that she had just come from a hit and [...] "there just wasn't the same energy". Hammerstein had intended to omit the overture, with the audience to watch, after the curtain rose, a blank stage on which the play-within-the-play performers and crew drifted in and began their preparations. Expecting the orchestra to begin the evening, the audience talked throughout the initial scenes before being quieted by the internal show's overture; in response, the duo abandoned Hammerstein's concept and opened with an overture.|$|E

500|$|Leave Home was {{released}} on January 10, 1977 and was well received by critics. Although the album did not receive much initial reception, Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a favorable review in 1977, {{saying that it is}} very similar to their debut yet more experienced sounding. He sums up the album with: [...] "The Ramones are as direct and witty as before. They've also lost just a pinch of their studied rawness: whether this is a sign of maturity or sellout is a matter for debate. The Ramones make rousing music <b>and</b> <b>damn</b> good jokes, but they're in a bind: the hard rock of this group is so pure it may be perceived as a freak novelty by an awful lot of people." [...] In the 1979 book The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album was given 4.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers".

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than you might think. I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I'm glad it worked out." ...|$|E

[...] TV Squad wrote that the series' funnier material appears in [...] "Robot Hell— after Bender is 'born again' in the Temple of Robotology." [...] David Johnson of DVD Verdict described [...] "Hell Is Other Robots" [...] as [...] "not one of my favorites", criticizing the episode for focusing a large amount {{on the character of}} Bender.

500|$|... "The Problem Solvers" [...] {{was filmed}} on October 23, October 28, and October 29, 2009. Jack Donaghy hiring the robot street {{performer}} {{in the previous}} episode, [...] "Audition Day", was first introduced in the fourth season premiere episode [...] "Season 4", in which Jack explains that the TGS staff have become too elitist and need to change to survive in tough economic times, and informs Liz Lemon—the head writer on TGS—to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image. In this episode, the robot street performer is introduced to the TGS crew as Danny Baker, and was played by actor Cheyenne Jackson, who made his 30 Rock debut with this episode.

David Browne of Time wrote [...] "tracks like 'Dark Fantasy' and 'So Appalled' are built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings that sound as if West is marching into the apocalypse." [...] Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine stated that the song restored his admiration for West, and that the track {{lived up to the}} hype behind it, writing [...] "most of it is rather epic <b>and</b> <b>damn</b> good, especially this track with its classic RZA production and assistance from No I.D.." [...] J. Tinsley of The Smoking Section commented that the song served as a successful opener, viewing it as a [...] "boisterous firestarter combining sharp lyrics, a spurious Nicki Minaj English accent and an enormous chorus." [...] Chris Martins of Spin complimented West's lyricism and use of double entrendres, and mused that the track was the album's [...] "beyond luxe opener". Jonah Weiner Slate commented that West pulled off an impressive balancing act, and cited the song as an example of [...] "his marvelous, hungry ear". Andrew Barber of Complex compared the impact of the beat to that of a cannon, calling the production team of the song a [...] "dream team", describing the track as powerful in nature.|$|E

500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down <b>and,</b> <b>damn</b> you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E
500|$|An {{officer in}} one of the 38th Division's {{infantry}} battalions, who met Cubitt in early June, shortly after he took command, described him as [...] "a very large and fierce-looking major-general, with two rows of ribbons, and a gleam in his eye", who proceeded to interrogate a subaltern about the exact type and position of his unit's trench latrines, apparently something of a pet topic. A [...] "fire-eater with a marvellous flow of language", it was Cubitt's manner of speech, more than anything else, which made an impact on his contemporaries; a front-line officer in 1918 described watching him, during the October offensive, clearing a traffic jam with merely [...] "a magnificent gush of language". A colleague from his early days in the artillery described him as a [...] "perpetual joy to the soldier's world ... because of his picturesque language, which never gave offence because it was so absolutely natural and so aptly fitted the occasion", but under some circumstances it proved less suitable. Following a failed raid in 1918, he visited the offending battalion and harangued the officers collectively for some time, before demanding that they [...] "damn well had to do the raid over again, <b>and</b> <b>damn</b> well see that [...] made a proper job of it, or, by God, damn well go on raiding until [...] damn well did." [...] To the officers on the receiving end, already tired and dissatisfied, this was seen as a [...] "contemptible exhibition" [...] for a senior officer to make.|$|E

Robert Abele of LA Weekly wrote: [...] "Natalie Dormer presents a painterly exquisiteness and complexity in her portrayal of Anne Boleyn... her enigmatic, time-halting loveliness is a boon for The Tudors, <b>and</b> <b>damn</b> near worth losing your head over". After her character's death {{at the end of the}} second season, The Boston Herald noted: [...] "Dormer gave Anne Boleyn life, making her not just a beautiful schemer but a rebellious, defiantly independent tragic hero in the tradition of Rebel Without a Cause and Cool Hand Luke... her departure from The Tudors leaves a tremendous void." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Arminius' first tasks {{was given}} to him by Ecclesiastical Court of Amsterdam; namely, to refute the teachings of Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, who {{rejected}} the Beza's supralapsarian doctrine of God's absolute and unconditional decree to create men so as to save some <b>and</b> <b>damn</b> others, based on nothing in themselves. [...] The discussion had already begun with two ministers at Delft who had written [...] "An Answer to certain Arguments of Beza and Calvin, from a Treatise on Predestination as taught in the Ninth Chapter of Romans" [...] a document which contradicted both Beza and Coorhert. They proposed that although God's decree to save only some was indeed absolute and unconditional, it had occurred after the fall (proposing infralapsarianism rather than Beza's supralapsarianism). [...] Arminius was tasked with refuting both Coorhert and infralapsarianism theology. [...] He readily agreed to the task, but after greater study found himself in conflict over the matter. [...] He determined to spend greater time in study before continuing his refutation.|$|E

It's offensive, psyche-damaging, brutal, makes no sense, and is unforgiving and violent. <b>And</b> <b>damn</b> good fun." [...] Scott Osborne scored the PC version 4 out of 5, writing [...] "The Suffering offers a smooth blend of survival horror and shooter action." [...] Of the PC port, he wrote [...] "you'll {{find a few}} bugs, clipping problems, and occasional clunky moments when a character's important dialogue is interrupted by that of a scripted event, creating an audio muddle. It's a shame The Suffering didn't receive a bit more polishing and a major graphics upgrade for the PC. Still, with its well-designed levels, fluid pacing, and hyper-violent combat in eerie locales, The Suffering is a fun way to safely tap into your dark side." ...|$|E
