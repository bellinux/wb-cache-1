5|$|A Viking funeral {{could be}} a {{considerable}} expense, but the barrow and the grave goods were not considered to have been wasted.

The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> large tumuli that contained stone ships.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August.

Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E

The pay and allowance issues were resolved; many other conditions-of-service issues were identified, but not resolved. During the deployment few issues were brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised. During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' families had a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.|$|E

However, the film received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office, earning just under $67 million on a $60 million budget.|$|E
5|$|By 1951, {{the highway}} had been reconstructed {{generally}} along MT 87's present location, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been upgraded to an improved gravel road. In 1959, {{the road in}} the location of MT 87 was rapidly improved in order to serve as an alternate routing to U.S. Route 287. Portions of US 287 around Hebgen Lake collapsed and crumbled {{as a result of the}} 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. After US 287 was fixed, the highway's importance decreased. In 1962, the portions of the highway from the southern terminus to present-day milepost 8.395 were reconstructed along the current location. In 1967, the rest of the highway was reconstructed along the present location. By 1987, the highway had been numbered as MT 87. The route had also been paved.|$|E

5|$|By February {{the next}} year, {{construction}} had resumed. On 8 April 25men {{working on the}} bridge went on strike. This was of concern due to time dependent concreting being undertaken at that time. As the construction was considered unemployment relief, the constructing authority began to look for men who would do the work in their places. By 13 April, further details had emerged; {{the number of the}} men on strike was actually 32, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been caused by the alleged wrongful dismissal of three men who had left for their lunch break early. The strike continued until at least 21 April. Work had resumed by early May, and the bridge was reported as being a little over half completed at that time.|$|E

The film was touted as the director's magnum opus and was budgeted at 263.8 million, making {{it at the time}} of its release the most expensive South Indian film ever made.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} the city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the {{conclusion}} of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS) was created. Austria-Hungary transferred the vessels of the former Austro-Hungarian Navy to the new nation.
