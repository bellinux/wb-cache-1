Burroughs produced works with a surreal narrative that estranged the <b>action</b> <b>from</b> the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do. In 1959 he published Naked Lunch, {{the first of many}} works such as The Nova Trilogy and The Wild Boys in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities.|$|E

5|$|Desert Strike is a shoot 'em up game {{in which}} the player pilots an AH-64 Apache helicopter. The game is less frantic than typical shoot 'em ups, with the {{addition}} of greater strategic elements. The action takes place on open, multi-directional scrolling levels viewed from an isometric perspective. The player views the <b>action</b> <b>from</b> outside the helicopter, rather than from within the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an <b>action</b> <b>from</b> a list of such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} {{may be used in}} battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an <b>action</b> <b>from</b> {{a list of}} options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it {{will be returned to}} the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|During an {{overhaul}} in May 1942, at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, {{she had her}} remaining secondary battery of twelve 5–inch/51 guns removed to make space for more anti-aircraft guns. After the overhaul, which was completed on 1 August, she departed San Francisco to Hawaii to prepare for <b>action.</b> <b>From</b> 6 December to 22 March 1943, she escorted convoys and transports to the Fiji Islands. After that, she patrolled the southwestern Pacific, before returning to Pearl Harbor {{to get ready for}} the Aleutian Islands Campaign. After her training, on 17 May, she steamed to Adak, which would be her base for the attack on Attu. She later participated in the shelling of Kiska on 21 July, which preceded the Japanese evacuation of the island a week later.|$|E
5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) game {{in which}} the player guides a civilization through five historical periods, from the Middle Ages to World War II. As in many RTS titles, the player collects natural resources, erects buildings, and trains and maintains a military. Players use a mouse cursor interface (or hotkeys) to direct their units, which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player to view the <b>action</b> <b>from</b> any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} {{to calls for}} <b>action</b> <b>from</b> the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers joined together on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing {{that they would not}} accept the coin produced under Wood's patent. Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter the coin into the Irish economy. Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, Lord Shannon did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented the coin from being distributed.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} the war effort, India was left vulnerable to hostile <b>action</b> <b>from</b> Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived in Kabul in October 1915, with obvious strategic purpose. Habibullah Khan abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, {{in the face}} of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the Ottoman Sultan. Despite this, localised actions along the frontier still took place and included Operations in the Tochi (1914–15), Operations against the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis (1915), Kalat Operations (1915–16), Mohmand Blockade (1916–17), Operations against the Mahsuds (1917) and Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918).|$|E
5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an <b>action</b> <b>from</b> duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E

5|$|Like the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Guangzhou also {{attempted}} {{to raise the}} air quality of the city. The authority had pledged ￥600 million to fight the problem, and had ordered around 32 chemical plants to stop production {{by the end of}} 2009. A report shown on July 13, 2010 indicates that the air quality was rated at 95.07% in 2009, an increase of 12.01% since 2004; this improvement eventually cost authorities ￥24 billion. Later <b>action</b> <b>from</b> organisers to curb the pollution included decreasing the movement of vehicles up to 40 percent and banning barbecue stalls in 11 cities.|$|E
5|$|McDiarmid {{noticed that}} the script for Revenge of the Sith demanded more <b>action</b> <b>from</b> his {{character}} than in previous films. Lightsaber combat was {{a challenge to the}} 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid. Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Italian {{campaign}} was launched, and M3 guns saw <b>action</b> <b>from</b> {{the day of}} the Sicily landing on 10 July 1943. That day the 37mm guns demonstrated once again both their effectiveness against pre-war tanks—when they helped to repel an attack by Italian Renault R 35s—and inability to cope with modern threats in a subsequent encounter with Tiger Is from the Hermann Göring division. The Italian theater had a lower priority for reequipment than Northwest Europe, and some M3s were still in use in Italy in late 1944.|$|E

5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium {{plays an}} active role in federal and state politics, from {{sponsoring}} governmental legislation about the ocean to persuading voter <b>action</b> <b>from</b> its visitors and online followers. The aquarium was a leading sponsor for the statewide shark fin ban in 2011. After the ban’s success the aquarium shifted its efforts to focus on ocean plastic pollution. It produced advertisements, webpages, and podcasts in 2016 in support of California Proposition 67 for a statewide ban on single-use plastic grocery bags. The aquarium hosted a plastic pollution symposium through the Aquarium Conservation Partnership in December 2016, and, in July 2017, the aquarium {{and other members of the}} partnership began eliminating their own plastic products.|$|E
