5|$|Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John {{and forces}} him {{to lead him}} to the house. John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> and seals the door, leaving Eric to die.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Mr. Kolenkhov arrives and begins Essie's ballet lesson. Ed {{provides}} accompanying {{music on the}} xylophone. Rheba runs {{in and out of}} the kitchen cleaning. Grandpa takes this time to practice darts and feed the snakes. In the midst of all this hullabaloo, Tony <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> with Mr. Kirby and Mrs. Kirby. Before them is the entire eccentric spectacle. Apparently, Tony has forgotten for which night dinner was planned, and Alice is incredibly embarrassed.|$|E
500|$|To {{the rear}} and at right stands Don José Nieto Velázquez(8)—the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, {{and head of the}} royal {{tapestry}} works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. As the art critic Harriet Stone observes, it is uncertain whether he is [...] "coming or going". He is rendered in silhouette and appears to hold open a curtain on a short flight of stairs, with an unclear wall or space behind. Both this backlight and the open doorway reveal space behind: {{in the words of the}} art historian Analisa Leppanen, they lure [...] "our eyes inescapably into the depths". The royal couple's reflection pushes in the opposite direction, forward into the picture space. The vanishing point of the perspective is in the doorway, as can be shown by extending the line of the meeting of wall and ceiling on the right. Nieto is seen only by the king and queen, who share the viewer's point of view, and not by the figures in the foreground. In the footnotes of Joel Snyder's article, the author recognizes that Nieto is the queen's attendant and was required to be at hand to open and close doors for her. Snyder suggests that Nieto <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> so that the king and queen might depart. In the context of the painting, Snyder argues that the scene is the end of the royal couple's sitting for Velázquez and they are preparing to exit, explaining that is [...] "why the menina to the right of the Infanta begins to curtsy".|$|E
60|$|Miss Summersley Satchell <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> {{and became}} helpful.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} a manservant <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of <b>the</b> conservatory.|$|R
60|$|When she <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> Sir Andrew came at once up to her.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> in under-garment and a wrapper. She, [...] too, is fair, about thirty-five, rather delicious, and suggestive [...] of porcelain.|$|E
60|$|A {{burst of}} orchestral music, through which a {{powerful}} gong sounds, is {{heard from the}} temple. Zoo, in a purple robe, <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... (DR. JONATHAN {{goes with}} TIMOTHY and MINNIE {{as far as}} the door, [...] right, and then comes back thoughtfully to the bench, takes up a [...] test tube and holds it to the light. Presently ASHER PINDAR [...] <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> right.) ...|$|E
60|$|A small form <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> {{carrying}} <b>in</b> {{its right}} hand a neatly-folded note.|$|R
60|$|He rose to {{his feet}} as a man in bedraggled white uniform <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|R

60|$|ANNA--[Faintly.] Come in. [Then {{summoning}} her courage--more resolutely.] Come in. [The door {{is opened}} and CHRIS <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> He is {{in a very}} bleary, bedraggled condition, suffering from the after effects of his drunk. A tin pail full of foaming beer is in his hand. He comes forward, his eyes avoiding ANNA'S. He mutters stupidly.] It's foggy.|$|E
60|$|Stephen, who {{is quite}} close to it, looks at it rather scaredly, and moves away quickly to the cannon. At the same moment {{the door of the}} shed is thrown {{abruptly}} open; and a foreman in overalls and list slippers comes out on the little landing and holds the door open for Lomax, who <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
6000|$|FOOL. Do not stir! He {{asked for}} a sign {{that you might be}} saved. [All are silent for a moment.] Look what has come from his mouth. ... a little winged thing ... a little shining thing. It has gone to the door. [The ANGEL <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> {{stretches}} out her hands and closes them again.] The Angel has taken it in her hands... she will open her hands in the Garden of Paradise.|$|E
60|$|A few blows, and it {{suddenly}} opened, {{and two men}} dressed as fishermen <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|R
60|$|I had {{my hand on}} the knocker for {{the second}} time, when Puss <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... (His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> {{dressed in}} red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, {{cardinal}} sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs {{are stuck in}} his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with large wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:) ...|$|E
60|$|Anderson and Hawkins look round sociably. Essie, with a {{gleam of}} {{interest}} breaking through her misery, looks up. Christy grins and gapes expectantly at the door. The rest are petrified with {{the intensity of}} their sense of Virtue menaced with outrage by the approach of flaunting Vice. The reprobate <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> graced beyond his alleged merits by the morning sunlight. He is certainly the best looking member of the family; but his expression is reckless and sardonic, his manner defiant and satirical, his dress picturesquely careless. Only his forehead and mouth betray an extraordinary steadfastness, and his eyes are {{the eyes of a}} fanatic.|$|E
6000|$|BURKE--[Defiantly, as if {{challenging}} fate.] Oath or no oath, 'tis no matter. We'll be wedded in the morning, {{with the}} help of God. [Still more defiantly.] We'll be happy now, the two of us, in spite of the divil! [He crushes her to him and kisses her again. The door on the left is pushed open and CHRIS <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> He stands blinking at them. At first the old expression of hatred of BURKE comes into his eyes instinctively. Then a look of resignation and relief takes its place. His face lights up with a sudden happy thought. He turns back into the bedroom--reappears immediately with the tin can of beer in his hand grinning.] ...|$|E
60|$|They were expressing to Patsy their {{gratitude}} when old Donald suddenly <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> and beckoned to Uncle John.|$|R
60|$|A step sounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall, a knock, and the {{well-known}} gaunt form and spectacled face of McCrae <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's Aunt Larkins," [...] said Mrs. Johnson, as {{an elderly}} and stouter {{edition of the}} three young women <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|R
60|$|With arms locked {{they seek}} the {{seclusion}} of Amy's bedroom. Cosmo rushes in {{to tell them}} that there is a suspicious-looking cab coming down the street, but finding the room empty he departs again to reconnoitre. A cab draws up, a bell rings, and soon we hear the voice of Colonel Grey. He can talk coherently to Fanny, he can lend a hand in dumping down his luggage in the passage, he can select from a handful of silver wherewith to pay his cabman: all impossible deeds to his Alice, who would drop the luggage on your toes and cast all the silver at your face rather than be kept another minute from her darlings. 'Where are they?' she has evidently cried just before we see her, and Fanny has made a heartless response, for it is a dejected Alice that <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of the room.|$|E
60|$|It {{is eight}} {{o'clock in the}} evening. The {{curtains}} are drawn and the lamps lighted {{in the drawing room}} of Her flat in Cromwell Road. Her lover, a beautiful youth of eighteen, in evening dress and cape, with a bunch of flowers and an opera hat in his hands, comes in alone. The door is near the corner; and as he <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> he has the fireplace on the nearest wall to his right, and the grand piano along the opposite wall to his left. Near the fireplace a small ornamental table has on it a hand mirror, a fan, a pair of long white gloves, and a little white woollen cloud to wrap a woman's head in. On {{the other side of the}} room, near the piano, is a broad, square, softly up-holstered stool. The room is furnished in the most approved South Kensington fashion: that is, it is as like a show room as possible, and is intended to demonstrate the racial position and spending powers of its owners, and not in the least to make them comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--Good-night. [He {{picks up}} the can of beer and goes slowly into the room on left, his {{shoulders}} bowed, his head sunk forward dejectedly. He closes the door after him. ANNA turns over {{the pages of the}} magazine, trying desperately to banish her thoughts by looking at the pictures. This fails to distract her, and flinging the magazine back on the table, she springs to her feet and walks about the cabin distractedly, clenching and unclenching her hands. She speaks aloud to herself in a tense, trembling voice.] Gawd, I can't stand this much longer! What am I waiting for anyway?--like a damn fool! [She laughs helplessly, then checks herself abruptly, as she hears the sound of heavy footsteps on the deck outside. She appears to recognize these and her face lights up with joy. She gasps:] Mat! [A strange terror seems suddenly to seize her. She rushes to the table, takes the revolver out of drawer and crouches down in the corner, left, behind the cupboard. A moment later the door is flung open and MAT BURKE <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> He is in bad shape--his clothes torn and dirty, covered with sawdust {{as if he had been}} grovelling or sleeping on barroom floors. There is a red bruise on his forehead over one of his eyes, another over one cheekbone, his knuckles are skinned and raw--plain evidence of the fighting he has been through on his [...] "bat." [...] His eyes are bloodshot and heavy-lidded, his face has a bloated look. But beyond these appearances--the results of heavy drinking--there is an expression in his eyes of wild mental turmoil, of impotent animal rage baffled by its own abject misery.] ...|$|E
60|$|But at {{the first}} scratch of his toe-nails on the bark the sharp face of old Mrs. Possum <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|R
60|$|When she <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> Tilly, ancient {{but still}} in authority, would crane her skinny neck {{to see who}} it was.|$|R
60|$|She was all {{agitation}} now, eager, excited, {{and herself}} went forward {{to meet the}} quaint, little wizened figure which <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As Angel {{sits alone}} drawing {{pictures}} of Darla, when Wesley <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> and expresses his concern that Angel has become obsessed. Angel brushes him off. Meanwhile, Lindsey comes {{into a room}} to find Darla curled in a corner, bleeding, haunted by memories of her past.|$|E
50|$|During one of {{the first}} flashbacks of the novel, Cornelia is sent upstairs to put the cat in the attic when she unrolls a picture. When she realizes that the {{painting}} is her mother, nude, she becomes ashamed of her. As her mother <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> she runs past her.|$|E
50|$|After the {{rehearsal}} is finished, Annie decides to take Ash {{out for a}} quiet drink to discuss his career. The 'drink' ends in a seedy pole dancing club where Annie seduces Ash ("Once You've Tasted Love"). The next morning, Chloe appears at Ash's flat in Manchester to try to resolve their problems. Annie <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> inside half dressed. Chloe flees, distraught, and wanders off into the streets of Manchester ("Love Ain't Here Anymore").|$|E
6000|$|Dave, <b>the</b> colored waiter, <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of <b>the</b> dining-room. [...] "Mr. Arthurs, I done call yo' all. Lunch is sho' gittin' cold." ...|$|R
60|$|Miriam <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> She {{was nearly}} sixteen, very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes dilating {{suddenly}} like an ecstasy.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> woman Leridan <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> She held a {{guttering}} tallow candle {{high above}} her head. Its flickering light illumined Chauvelin's slender figure.|$|R
