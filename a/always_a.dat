5|$|Coal {{and other}} {{minerals}} were extracted {{in the west}} of Scotland from medieval times; getting the heavy product to market was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> challenge, and this encouraged the development of tracked systems; the earliest plateways {{in the vicinity of}} Ayr date from—at the latest—1775.|$|E

If the Sub-Dean also cannot participate, the senior Cardinal Bishop participating performs the functions.|$|E

5|$|A Venetian confidant on Hvar reported, in 1498, the Ottoman {{preparation}} of 25 ships for sea attack on Krajina and Kačićs. In the next year, they became Ottoman subjects. In 1500, the Split monarch reported to Venice that Ottomans captured several delegates from Split, and that safely arrived in Mostar only thanks to knez Juraj Marković, an Ottoman subject and Venetian friend. Marković wrote from Makarska to Venice {{that he was}} knez for 15 years and <b>always</b> <b>a</b> friend of the Venetians. In the Marković collection and archive, D. Papalić found the Croatian redaction of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja.|$|E
5|$|All {{terminals}} and hangars were on {{the square}} periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as <b>always.</b> <b>A</b> short runway (13R/31L) for light aircraft was added in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Although pranks that {{involved}} public locations, figures, and organisations were <b>always</b> <b>a</b> {{feature of the}} series, the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity, both positive and negative. Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E

The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father would have none of it.|$|E
5|$|At any time, {{there are}} four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one {{monitors}} passenger information, and one is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, there is <b>always</b> <b>a</b> team of linemen that can be dispatched to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} <b>always</b> <b>a</b> number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text {{is to the}} reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this would indicate that the candidate is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
50|$|A {{dominant}} estate is the parcel of real property {{that has an}} easement over another piece of property (the servient estate). The type of easement involved is almost <b>always</b> <b>an</b> appurtenant easement. Likewise, it is almost <b>always</b> <b>an</b> affirmative easement, that is, one that permits a person to do something. Estate is a common law concept.|$|R
50|$|No {{matter how}} many bytes wide a word is, there are <b>always</b> <b>an</b> even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of n bytes can contain up to (2n)−1 decimal digits, which is <b>always</b> <b>an</b> odd number of digits. A decimal number with d digits {{requires}} ½(d+1) bytes of storage space.|$|R

5|$|Dating from 1158 to {{the early}} 16th century, Oxford Cathedral was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> small cathedral and was made smaller by the {{destruction}} {{of much of the}} nave in the 16th century. The stone spire, from 1230, {{is one of the oldest}} in England and contributes to Oxford’s tradition as “the city of dreaming spires”. Its most unusual feature is the late-15th-century pendant vault over the Norman chancel.|$|E

Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, {{during the}} Haitian Revolution, Dermide {{arrived on the}} island-colony of Saint-Domingue with his parents, {{as part of the}} Saint-Domingue expedition. After his father's death of yellow fever later during the year, Dermide and Pauline were brought back to France. In 1803, Pauline remarried, this time to Italian nobleman Camillo Borghese, and she took up residence, along with her husband and son, in Rome. <b>Always</b> <b>a</b> frail child, Dermide died of a fever at the age of six, three months after his uncle became Emperor and two years before his mother's {{proclamation}} as Duchess of Guastalla.|$|E
5|$|Jack was {{not always}} {{the name of the}} Georgetown Hoyas' mascot, nor was the mascot <b>always</b> <b>a</b> bulldog, as other types of dogs, {{particularly}} bull terriers, were associated with the sports teams before 1962. In 2009, the American Kennel Club ranked Jack as the 8th most popular dog in American culture. Today, Georgetown is among thirty-nine American universities to use a bulldog as their mascot, with Georgia, Butler, Mississippi State, Yale and James Madison being the only others with a live bulldog. Jack is also portrayed by a costumed character Bulldog mascot, a tradition dating to 1977.|$|E

5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} are not <b>always</b> <b>a</b> disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis {{makes use of}} this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E
5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're <b>always</b> <b>a</b> Catholic—in {{terms of}} your {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
