50|$|<b>Avizafone</b> (Pro-Diazepam) is a {{water-soluble}} prodrug of diazepam. It can {{be administered}} intramuscularly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avizafone</b> is metabolised by enzymes in {{the blood}} to form the active drug diazepam. It is used mainly as an {{antidote}} to poisoning with organophosphate nerve agents.|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose:  The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relative}} bioavailability of diazepam after administration of diazepam itself or as a water-soluble prodrug, <b>avizafone,</b> in humans. Experimental approach:  The study was conducted in an open, randomized, single-dose, three-way, cross-over design. Each subject received intramuscular injections of <b>avizafone</b> (20  mg), diazepam (11. 3  mg) or <b>avizafone</b> (20  mg) combined with atropine (2  mg) and pralidoxime (350  mg) using a bi-compartmental auto-injector (AIBC). Plasma concentrations of diazepam were quantified using a validated LC/MS–MS assay, and were analysed by both a non-compartmental approach and by compartmental modelling. Key results:  The maximum concentration (Cmax) of diazepam after <b>avizafone</b> injection was higher than that obtained after injection of diazepam itself (231 vs. 148  ng·mL− 1), while area under the curve (AUC) values were equal. Diazepam concentrations reached their maximal value faster after injection of <b>avizafone.</b> Injection of <b>avizafone</b> with atropine–pralidoxime (AIBC) had no effect on diazepam Cmax and AUC, but the time to Cmax was increased, relative to <b>avizafone</b> injected alone. According to the Akaike criterion, the pharmacokinetics of diazepam after injection as a prodrug was best described as a two-compartment with zero-order absorption model. When atropine and pralidoxime were injected with <b>avizafone,</b> the best pharmacokinetic model was a two-compartment with a first-order absorption model. Conclusion and implications:  Diazepam had a faster entry to the general circulation and achieved higher Cmax after injection of prodrug than after the parent drug. Administration of <b>avizafone</b> in combination with atropine and pralidoxime by AIBC had no significant effect on diazepam AUC and Cmax...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Treatment of {{organophosphate}} poisoning with pralidoxime {{needs to}} be improved. Here we have studied the pharmacokinetics of pralidoxime after its intramuscular injection alone or in combination with <b>avizafone</b> and atropine using an auto-injector device. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The {{study was conducted in}} an open, randomized, single-dose, two-way, cross-over design. At each period, each subject received either intramuscular injections of pralidoxime (700  mg), or two injections of the combination: pralidoxime (350  mg), atropine (2  mg), <b>avizafone</b> (20  mg). Pralidoxime concentrations were quantified using a validated LC/MS-MS method. Two approaches were used to analyse these data: (i) a non-compartmental approach; and (ii) a compartmental modelling approach. KEY RESULTS The injection of pralidoxime combination with atropine and <b>avizafone</b> provided a higher pralidoxime maximal concentration than that obtained after the injection of pralidoxime alone (out of bioequivalence range), while pralidoxime AUC values were equivalent. Pralidoxime concentrations reached their maximal value earlier after the injection of the combination. According to Akaike and to goodness of fit criteria, the best model describing the pharmacokinetics of pralidoxime was a two-compartment with a zero-order absorption model. When <b>avizafone</b> and atropine were injected with pralidoxime, the best model describing pralidoxime pharmacokinetics becomes a two-compartment with a first-order absorption model. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The two approaches, non-compartmental and compartmental, showed that the administration of <b>avizafone</b> and atropine with pralidoxime results in a faster absorption into the general circulation and higher maximal concentrations, compared with the administration of pralidoxime alone...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide the {{auto-injector}} with {{the best and most}} potent acetylcholinesterase reactivator, the Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) received in the 1990 s a core funding from the federal government’s CBRN research and Technology Initiative (CRTI). Its ultimate result should be three products: (1) 3 -in- 1 auto-injector (atropine, HI- 6 dimethanesulphonate and <b>avizafone,</b> as anticonvulsant), (2) 2 -in- 1 auto-injector (atropine and HI- 6 dimethanesulphonate) and (3) HI- 6 dimethanesulphonate in a vial for administration by the medically trained personnel. Previous experimental and clinical experience suggests that, among the oximes mentioned, only trimedoxime and obidoxime can be used for acetylcholinesterase reactivation and antidotal protection against most of the organophosphorus insecticides. The search for an “omnipotent ” oxime, effective in reactivation of AChE inhibited with both nerve agents and organophosphorus insecticides, is still ongoing. KEY WORDS: acetylcholinesterase, nerve agents, organophosphorus compounds, reactivation Atropine seemed to be the only antidote available for the treatment of poisoning with organophosphorus compounds (OPC) until 1951, when Jandorf mad...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) procedure for the simultaneous determination of diazepam from <b>avizafone,</b> atropine and pralidoxime in human plasma is described. Sample pretreatment consisted of protein precipitation from 100 μl of plasma using acetonitrile containing the internal standard (diazepam D 5). Chromatographic separation was performed on a X-Terra® MS C 8 column (100 mm × 2. 1 mm, i. d. 3. 5 μm), with a quick stepwise gradient using a formate buffer (pH 3, 2 mM) and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0. 2 ml/min. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for drug quantification. The method was validated over the concentration ranges of 1 – 500 ng/ml for diazepam, 0. 25 – 50 ng/ml for atropine and 5 – 1000 ng/ml for pralidoxime. The coefficients of variation were always < 15 % for both intra-day and inter-day precision for each analyte. Mean accuracies were also within ± 15 %. This method has been successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of the three compounds after intramuscular injection of an avizafone–atropine–pralidoxime combination, in healthy subjects...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe organophosphorus {{nerve agent}} soman is an {{irreversible}} cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitor {{that can produce}} long-lasting seizures and seizure-related brain damage (SRBD) in which acetylcholine and glutamate are involved. Since these neurotransmitters play a key-role in the auditory function, {{it was hypothesized that}} a hearing test may be an efficient way for detecting the central effects of soman intoxication. In the present study, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), a non-invasive audiometric method, were used in rats administered with soman (70 μg/kg). Four hours post-soman, DPOAE intensities were significantly decreased. They returned to baseline one day later. The amplitude of the temporary drop of the DPOAEs was well related to the severity of the intoxication. The greatest change was recorded in the rats that survived long-lasting convulsions, i. e. those that showed the highest ChE inhibition in brain and severe encephalopathy. Furthermore, the administration, immediately after soman, of a three-drug therapy composed of atropine sulfate, HI- 6 and <b>avizafone</b> abolished the convulsions, the transient drop of DPOAEs at 4 h and the occurrence of SRBD at 28 h without modifying brain ChE inhibition. This showed that DPOAE change was not directly related to soman-induced inhibition of cerebral ChE but rather to its neuropathological consequences. The present findings strongly suggest that DPOAEs represent a promising non-invasive tool to predict SRBD occurrence in nerve agent poisoning and to control the efficacy of a neuroprotective treatment...|$|E
