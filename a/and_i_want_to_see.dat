[...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

This is the conversation. I want to see a cop shoot a white unarmed teenager in the back. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a white man convicted for raping a black woman. Then when you ask me, 'Is it over?', I will say yes." ...|$|E

In July 1986, on his 33 and a third birthday, Drummond repented his corporate involvement and resigned his job by way of a [...] "ringingly quixotic press release": [...] "I will be 33.5 (sic) years old in September, a time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world from the top..." [...] (In an interview in December 1990, Drummond recalled spending half a million pounds at WEA on the band Brilliant– for whom he envisioned massive worldwide success– only for them to completely flop. [...] "At that point I thought 'What am I doing this for?' and I got out.") ...|$|E

2500|$|The aerial {{campaign}} for Singapore {{began at the}} outset of the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8 December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese aircraft, such as the Mitsubishi G3M2 [...] "Nell" [...] and the Mitsubishi G4M1 [...] "Betty", based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the island's northern airfields. After this first raid, throughout the rest of December, there were a number of false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base, but no actual raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate, that one British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his Vickers machine gun at any aircraft that passed. He could only say: [...] "The bloody bastards will never think of looking for me in the open, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a bloody plane brought down." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Bill Drummond was an {{established}} figure within the British music industry, having co-founded Zoo Records, played guitar in the Liverpool band Big in Japan, {{and worked as}} manager of Echo & the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes. On 21 July of that year, he resigned from his position as an A man at record label WEA, citing that he was nearly 33⅓ years old (33⅓ revolutions per minute being significant to Drummond as {{the speed at which}} a vinyl LP revolves), and that it was [...] "time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world from the top". He released a well-received solo LP, The Man, judged by reviewers as [...] "tastefully understated," [...] a [...] "touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement" [...] encapsulating [...] "his bizarrely sage ruminations", and [...] "a work of humble genius: the best kind".|$|E
