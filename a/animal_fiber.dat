5000|$|Atrabiliarios is an {{installation}} that incorporates plywood, shoes, <b>animal</b> <b>fiber,</b> thread, and sheepskin all in six different niches. In her piece old shoes, in pairs and singles, are encased behind sheets of translucent animal skin inside alcoves or niches {{in the gallery}} wall. The skin is crudely stitched to the wall with medical sutures. On the floor underneath are some small boxes made from the same animal skin. The worn shoes all belonged to women who 'disappeared', and were donated to Salcedo by the victims' families. The use of these shoes in Atrabiliarios is meant to echoe the memory of those whose fate and whereabouts is unknown. Salcedo describes this a being [...] "permanently suspended between {{the present and the}} past". Therefore, Atrabiliarios is [...] "not only a portrait of disappearance, but a portrait of the survivors' mental condition of uncertainty, longing and mourning." [...] Salcedo is seeking not only to express the horror of violence but also to investigate the way people prevail in times of torture, repairing their physical and psychological wounds, as well as raising resistance and remembering those who are missing.|$|E
5000|$|The tricorne or tricorn is a {{style of}} hat that was popular during the 18th century, falling out of style by 1800, though {{actually}} not called a [...] "tricorne" [...] until the mid 1800s. During the 18th century hats of this general style were referred to as [...] "cocked hats".

Typically made from <b>animal</b> <b>fiber,</b> the more expensive being of beaver-hair felt and the less expensive of wool felt, the hat's most distinguishing characteristic was that three sides of the brim were turned up (cocked) and either pinned, laced or buttoned in place to form a triangle around the crown. The style served two purposes: first, it allowed stylish gentlemen to show off the most current fashions of their wigs, and thus their social status; and secondly, the cocked hat, with its folded brim, was much smaller than other hats and therefore could be more easily tucked under an arm when going inside a building, where social etiquette dictated that a gentleman remove his hat. Tricornes with laced sides could have the laces loosened and the sides dropped down to provide better protection from the weather, sun and rain.|$|E

They represent the two types of fibers used in the manufacture of textiles. The leaves represent our vegetable fibers used in the making of our cotton and linen cloth.

40|$|Perishable {{technologies}} – objects {{made from}} soft, organic materials that often decay {{quickly in the}} archaeological record – {{are known to be}} both ubiquitous and abundant in contemporary and historic societies, regardless of variation in social and economic organization or local environment. They are commonly made by women, children and elders, members of society that are often underrepresented in reconstructions of the past. However, their perishable nature means that these objects are recovered from the archaeological record at low rates, relative to that of more durable materials. Consequently, most evidence for these technologies is indirect. Use wear on the surface of bone tools provides indirect evidence of perishable materials, as these tools are frequently used in the manufacture of basketry, nets, mats, webbing, and woven fabrics and in the joining of perishable elements to make more complex objects, such as clothing, bags, or structural elements. This dissertation focuses on identifying differences between use wear from plant and <b>animal</b> <b>fibers</b> on bone tools, using a methodologically innovative multi-scalar approach. Analysis is organized at the scale of the working surface and assessed with a predictive tribological model that uses the known properties of different fibers to understand the accumulation of diagnostic attrition. Three kinds of worked bone surfaces are analyzed: experimental, ethnographic and archaeological. While experimentation is standard for use wear analysis, the introduction of systematic, comprehensive, microscopic study of a broad ethnographic sample is significant. Ethnographic and experimental samples demonstrate that function cannot be identified by artifact form and that tribological predictions are a powerful means for identifying wear diagnostic of plant and <b>animal</b> <b>fibers.</b> An archaeological case study from three Magdalenian and Azilian sites in Northern Spain – Entrefoces, El Perro, El Juyo – is presented. Analysis of use wear on osseous artifacts from these sites indicates that both plant and <b>animal</b> <b>fibers</b> were manipulated, a significant result, as evidence for the use of plant fibers at these sites is otherwise absent. This evidence is important for understanding the labor of Late Upper Paleolithic individuals beyond large game hunting and suggests some activities that may have been carried out by women, children and elders.
