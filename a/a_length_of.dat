50|$|Males average 20.1 in (51 cm) long, while females average 22.1 in (56 cm); {{they are}} {{distinguished}} from the black caracara by larger size and plumage that is mainly black, with the belly, tibal feathers, and undertail feathers being white. Both their faces and throats are bare with a few black feathers scattered on the throat; the exposed skin is red. Both male and female red-throated caracaras are similar in appearance.

5|$|While {{very large}} by the {{standard}} of modern predators, Daspletosaurus was not the largest tyrannosaurid. Adults could reach <b>a</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> 8–9meters (26–30ft) from snout to tail. Mass estimates have centered on 2.5tonnes (2.75short tons) but have ranged between 1.8 and 3.8 tonnes (2.0 and 4.1 short tons).|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which <b>a</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> DNA on one chromatid is swapped with <b>a</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E

5|$|The braking a is from {{an initial}} speed u {{to a final}} speed v, over <b>a</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time t.

The stopping distance s is also shortest when acceleration a is at the highest possible value compatible with road conditions: the equation s = ut + 1/2 at2 makes s low when a is high and t is low.|$|E
5|$|The hardnose shark (Carcharhinus macloti) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, so named because of the heavily calcified cartilages in its snout.

5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has <b>a</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> 388 millimetres.

On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low.
