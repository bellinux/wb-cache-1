5|$|The Liber Eliensis is a 12th-century English chronicle and history, {{written in}} Latin. Composed in three books, {{it was written}} at Ely Abbey {{on the island of}} Ely in the fenlands of eastern Cambridgeshire. Ely Abbey became the cathedral of a newly formed bishopric in 1109. Traditionally the author of the <b>anonymous</b> <b>work</b> has been given as Richard or Thomas, two monks at Ely, one of whom, Richard, has been {{identified}} with an official of the monastery, but some historians hold that neither Richard nor Thomas was the author.|$|E

25|$|The {{author of}} the Gospel of John may have known the {{synoptic}} gospels, {{but he does not}} use them in the way that Matthew and Luke used Mark. This is the last of four canonical gospels, usually dated to AD 90–110. Christian tradition identified the author as John the Apostle, but most modern scholars treat it as an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Copyright law of 1993 had {{specified}} {{a general}} duration of copyrights of 50 years beyond an author's death, or 50 {{years since the}} publication of an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work.</b> The implementation act for the law made the new law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights (and neighbouring rights) on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. In 2004, this copyright term was extended to 70 years for all works still copyrighted.|$|E

25|$|Among {{literary}} {{sources in}} other languages, the most informative ones are Greek and Roman {{accounts of the}} maritime trade between the Roman empire and the kingdoms of Tamilakam. Strabo and Pliny the Elder give {{the details of the}} trade route between the Red Sea coast and the western coast of South India. Strabo (c. 1st century BCE) mentions the embassies sent by the Pandyas to the court of Augustus, along with a description of the ambassadors. Pliny (c. 77 CE) talks about the different items imported by the Romans from India and complains about the financial drain caused by them. He also refers to many Tamil ports in his work The Natural History. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 60 - 100 CE) an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work,</b> gives an elaborate description of the Tamil country and the riches of a 'Pandian Kingdom'.|$|E
500|$|Orosius' wording {{is echoed}} by the Origo Constantini Imperatoris, an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work</b> usually dated {{to the late}} 4th century. [...] "Constantine {{was also the first}} Christian emperor, with the {{exception}} of Philippus, who seemed to me to have become a Christian merely in order that the one-thousandth year of Rome might be dedicated to Christ rather than to pagan idols." [...] ("Item Constantinus imperator primus Christianus, excepto Philippo, qui Christianus admodum ad hoc tantum constitutus fuisse mihi visus est, ut millesimus Romae annus Christo potius quam idolis dicaretur", tr. J.C. Rolfe) The scholar Samuel N. C. Lieu holds that this passage is a later interpolation, designed to give the work's pagan core a Christian gloss. According to Lieu, this passage, along with others, was probably taken from Orosius' history and inserted into the Origo Constantini during the reign of Constantine III (r. 417–21), a period that witnessed substantial anti-pagan polemic. Shahîd argues that, since the author of the Origo Constantini was a biographer of Constantine, and not a historian of the 3rd and 4th centuries, his reference to Philip is unnecessary. The conflicting claims of Philip and Constantine to primacy may have been at issue {{at the turn of the}} 5th century, when the Origo Constantini and Historia adversum paganos were written.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's role in {{revealing}} {{the nature of}} the hoax was not enough to keep the satirist Charles Churchill from mocking his apparent credulity in his 1762 work The Ghost. [...] He resented Johnson's lack of enthusiasm for his writing and with the character of 'Pomposo', written as one of the more credulous of the ghost's investigators, used the satire to highlight a [...] "superstitious streak" [...] in his subject. [...] Johnson paid this scant attention, but was said to have been more upset when Churchill again mocked him for his delay in releasing Shakespeare. [...] Publishers were at first wary of attacking those involved in the supposed haunting, but Churchill's satire was {{one of a number of}} publications which, following the exposure of Parsons' deception, heaped scorn on the affair. [...] The newspapers searched for evidence of past impostures and referenced older publications such as Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584). [...] The ghost was referenced in an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work</b> entitled Anti-Canidia: or, Superstition Detected and Exposed (1762), which sought to ridicule the credulity of those involved in the Cock Lane case. [...] The author described his work as a [...] "sally of indignation at the contemptible wonder in Cock-lane". [...] Works such as The Orators (1762) by Samuel Foote, were soon available. [...] Farcical poems such as Cock-lane Humbug were released, theatres staged plays such as The Drummer and The Haunted House.|$|E

2500|$|The Book of Joshua is an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work.</b> The Babylonian Talmud, {{written in}} the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, was the first attempt to attach authors to the holy books.

This idea was rejected as untenable by John Calvin (1509–1564), and by the time of Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) it was recognised that the book must have been written much later than the period it depicted.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1025 and 1028, Ibn al-Haytham {{wrote his}} Al-Shukuk ala Batlamyus (meaning [...] "Doubts on Ptolemy"). While {{maintaining}} the physical {{reality of the}} geocentric model, he criticized elements of the Ptolemic models. [...] Many astronomers took up the challenge posed in this work, namely to develop alternate models that resolved these difficulties. [...] In 1070, Abu Ubayd al-Juzjani published the Tarik al-Aflak. In his work, he indicated the so-called [...] "equant" [...] problem of the Ptolemic model. Al-Juzjani even proposed a solution for the problem.

The work consists of 7 volumes (6 volumes and an index) illustrated by Hans Holbein. This research was carried out by the scholar Julien Baudrier in the sixties. Recently scholar González Echeverría has graphically proved the existence of this work, and demonstrating that contrary to what experts Barón and Hillard thought, this work is also anonymous.|$|E
2500|$|The {{usage of}} saudade as a theme in Portuguese music {{goes back to}} the 16th century, the golden age of Portugal. Saudade, as well as love suffering, is a common theme in many villancicos and cantigas {{composed}} by Portuguese authors; for example: [...] "Lágrimas de Saudade" [...] (tears of saudade), which is an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work</b> from the Cancioneiro de Paris. Fado is a Portuguese music style, generally sung by a single person (the fadista) along with a Portuguese guitar. The most popular themes of fado are saudade, nostalgia, jealousy, and short stories of the typical city quarters. Fado and saudade are intertwined key ideas in Portuguese culture. The word fado comes from Latin fatum meaning [...] "fate" [...] or [...] "destiny". Fado is a musical cultural expression and recognition of this unassailable determinism which compels the resigned yearning of saudade, a bitter-sweet, existential yearning and hopefulness towards something over which one has no control.|$|E

2500|$|Frances Burney's first novel, Evelina or the History of a Young Lady's Entrance {{into the}} World, was {{published}} anonymously in 1778, without her father's knowledge or permission, by Thomas Lowndes, who voiced his interest after reading its first volume {{and agreed to}} publish it upon receipt of the finished work. The novel had been rejected by a previous publisher, Robert Dodsley, who refused to print an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work.</b> Burney, who worked as her father's amanuensis, had copied the manuscript in a [...] "disguised hand" [...] to prevent any identification of the book with the Burneys, thinking that her own handwriting might be recognised by a publisher. It was unthinkable {{at the time that}} a young woman would deliberately put herself into the public eye by writing, and Burney's second attempt to publish the work involved the collusion of her eldest brother, who posed as its author to Lowndes. Inexperienced at negotiating with a publisher, James Burney only extracted twenty guineas (£21) as payment for the manuscript.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the authors of the Carmina Burana. Only a few songs can be {{ascribed}} to specific authors, such as those by Hugh Primas of Orléans (d. [...] 1160), by the Archipoeta (d. [...] 1165), by the Frenchman Walter of Châtillon (d. [...] 1201), and by the Breton Petrus Blesensis (d. [...] 1203). Additionally, the attached folio contains German stanzas that mention specific authors, so they can be ascribed to the German Minnesinger Dietmar von Aist (d. [...] 1170), to Heinrich von Morungen (d. [...] 1222), to Walther von der Vogelweide (d. [...] 1228) and to Neidhart (d. [...] 1240). The only signed poems are contained in the attached folio, and they are by the so-called Marner, a wandering poet and singer from Swabia. Many poems stem from works written in antiquity by Ovid, Horace, Juvenal, and Ausonius; however, the majority of the poems (about two-thirds) appear not to be derivative works. The text is by-and-large an <b>anonymous</b> <b>work,</b> and it appears to have been written by Goliards and vagrants, who were either theology students travelling between universities or who were clerics who had not yet received a prebendary (or they had the poor fortune of losing their clerical position and its regular income). Presumably these individuals scrounged and begged for a living—which would explain why {{a good portion of the}} moral songs are dedicated to condemning those who aren't generous givers of alms (for example, CB 3, 9, 11 and 19–21). The authors demonstrate a broad knowledge of ancient mythology, which they employ to rich effect through metonymical and allegorical references, and which they effortlessly weave into scenes from the Bible. For example, in CB 194, Lyaeus (a byname for the god of wine Dionysus) casually makes an appearance at the Marriage at Cana, where Jesus performed the miracle of transforming water into wine (...)
