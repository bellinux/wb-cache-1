50|$|Seatbelts that {{automatically}} {{move into position}} around <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> once the adjacent door is closed and/or the engine is started were developed as a countermeasure against low usage rates of manual seat belts, particularly in the United States.

50|$|This has {{led many}} {{countries}} to adopt mandatory seat belt wearing laws.

5000|$|Over time, various {{manufacturers}} have used different terms for airbags. In the 1970s, General Motors marketed its first airbag modules under the unwieldy name [...] "Air Cushion Restraint System (ACRS)". Common terms in North America {{refer to a}} nominal role {{as a supplement to}} [...] "active" [...] restraints, i.e. seat belts. Because no action by <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> is required to activate or use the airbag, it is considered a [...] "passive" [...] device.

5000|$|Automatic belt systems {{also present}} several {{operational}} disadvantages. Motorists who would normally wear seat belts must still fasten the manual lap belt, thus rendering redundant the automation {{of the shoulder}} belt. Those who do not fasten the lap belt wind up inadequately protected only by the shoulder belt; in a crash without a lap belt such <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> is likely to [...] "submarine" [...] (be thrown forward under the shoulder belt) and be seriously injured. Motorized or door-affixed shoulder belts hinder access to the vehicle, {{making it difficult to}} enter and exit—particularly if the occupant is carrying items such as a box or a purse. Vehicle owners tend to disconnect the motorized or door-affixed shoulder belt to relieve the nuisance of entering and exiting the vehicle, leaving only a lap belt for crash protection. Also, many automatic seat belt systems are incompatible with child safety seats, or only compatible with special modifications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{position}} and orientation of <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant's</b> pelvis {{are important for}} seat design {{and the provision of}} safety belts. However, the direct measurement of pelvis location in <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> seat is difficult due to interference from the vehicle and its seat structure, as well as driver factors such as abdomen adiposity. An optimization method was developed to locate the driver's pelvis based on the kinematic relationships between the pelvis bony landmarks, body landmarks, and skeletal joint locations measured in a laboratory “hardseat” that allows access to posterior landmarks. The method accounts for variation in flesh margins at pelvis landmarks. Body landmark locations were measured using a coordinate measurement machine for 90 {{men and women in the}} hardseat and <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> seat set to 9 driver package conditions.

To assess the performance of the method, the intra-subject standard deviations (SD) of each participant's fitted ASIS flesh margins were evaluated.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of Brand Engineering, the {{requirement}} for vehicles {{to have the right}} sound has never been more important. Given the scale of this engineering task, it is essential to follow a logical process which combines test and CAE data to create a “virtual vehicle ” {{that can be used to}} simulate sound. A key step in this process is the ability to decompose the sound experienced by <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> into its constituent parts (engine, intake, road, tyre, wind etc.). Once the source contributions have been separated, subjectively evaluated and objectively characterised, meaningful targets can be set and the task of engineering a particular sound quality becomes a possibility. This paper sets out a philosophy and methods by which the sound recorded inside the passenger compartment of a vehicle during normal driving conditions can be decomposed into the contribution of each major source. It also describes the process for resynthesising those separated source sound contributions back into the original binaural sound. Finally, it illustrates these concepts with examples and discusses the use of these techniques...|$|E

The models can be employed for control design and real-time injury prediction, the main components of controlled restraint systems. Several low-order models are constructed with first principles of physics and through knowledge obtained from a sensitivity analysis of validated, complex occupant models. The biomechanical responses of the low-order models, related to neck and thoracic injury criteria are validated with the results of the complex models.

40|$|Attenuation of {{the load}} {{transmitted}} to <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> by the structure, either by modifying structural assembly, changing geometry of its elements, or adding specific load limiting devices to help dissipate kinetic energy was studied.

The subfloor structure, designed to crush at an appropriate force level, can be used to advantage in a crash by dissipating energy through plastic buckling of the floor beams and frames. Simple closed form solutions to predict the mean crushing force levels of subfloor designs is useful in engineering practice. The crushing process of thin walled, plate formed, open structures with particular emphasis on L and cruciform shapes was analyzed. Lower and upper bound solutions for the mean crushing strength of cruciforms are obtained by considering modes of deformation which account for both bending and extensional deformation.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel concept of {{congestion}} pricing based on voluntary peer-to-peer exchange of money between motorists {{in exchange for}} one ceding priority to another in a traffic stream. While in the classical congestion charging paradigm payments are compulsory and flow only towards the system operator, in the proposed marketplace participation is voluntary and motorists directly compensate each other. A particular motorist may find that he/she is a ‘payer’ at certain points in a given journey and a ‘payee’ at others. Humans would {{not be expected to}} successfully seek, negotiate and execute a continuous series of peer-to-peer trades involving micro-payments while also handling the cognitively-demanding task of driving; real-world implementation will therefore require vehicles operating under fully-automated control in both the longitudinal and lateral dimensions during the time periods that they seek and engage in trades. The automated vehicle control algorithms must be sufficiently intelligent and adaptable to enable alternative maneuvers on short timescales, given the inherent uncertainty of whether or not a potential trade will in fact be executed. The peer-to-peer trading would be executed algorithmically, subject to strategic-level guidance given by <b>a</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>occupant(s)</b> regarding the occupant’s relative valuation of money and priority in the traffic stream. In this paper we detail the prospective marketplace and present a simple simulation model to expose its properties. We show that the proposed peer-to-peer marketplace could lead to both desirable and undesirable outcomes; which of these would be predominant is a matter requiring empirical study.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} a novel approach to measuring neck muscle load and activity in vehicle collision conditions. A series of sled tests were performed on 10 healthy volunteers at three severity levels to simulate low-severity frontal impacts. Electrical activity—electromyography (EMG) —and muscle mechanical tension was measured bilaterally on the upper trapezius. A novel mechanical contraction (MC) sensor was used to measure the tension on the muscle surface. The neck extensor loads were estimated based on the inverse dynamics approach. The results showed strong linear correlation (Pearson’s coefficient = 0. 821) between the estimated neck muscle load and the muscle tension measured with the MC sensor. The peak of the estimated neck muscle force delayed 0. 2 ± 30. 6 ms on average vs. the peak MC sensor signal compared to the average delay of 61. 8 ± 37. 4 ms vs. the peak EMG signal. The observed differences in EMG and MC sensor collected signals indicate that the MC sensor offers an additional insight into the analysis of the neck muscle load and activity in impact conditions. This approach enables a more detailed assessment of the muscle-tendon complex load of <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> in pre-impact and impact conditions...|$|E
40|$|In April 2009, the U. S. Supreme Court in Arizona v. Gant {{narrowed the}} scope of an {{automobile}} search incident to arrest. Prior to Gant, officers were permitted to search the entire automobile passenger compartment incident {{to the arrest of}} <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> for any offense. The Gant Court rejected this broad interpretation and limited officers’ ability to search to two circumstances: (1) when an arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the vehicle or (2) when it is reasonable for officers to believe the vehicle might contain evidence related to the crime of the arrest. The Gant decision raises several new issues including the circumstances required to consider an arrestee secure. Is an arrestee considered unsecure until officers place the arrestee in a police car? Can an arrestee be considered secure if officers do not handcuff the arrestee? How many officers are required to secure an arrestee? What are the relevant factors to consider? Since the Supreme Court decided Gant, numerous lower courts have cited Gant to determine whether officers secured an arrestee prior to an automobile search incident to arrest. This Note examines how lower courts have inconsistently applied the “secure” aspect of the holding. Additionally, this Note offers a test for determining whether officers have secured an arrestee under Gant in order to clarify the inconsistency among lower courts, to ensure that defendants receive equal treatment, and to prevent confusion among law enforcement officials...|$|E
40|$|Background: Road traffic {{injuries}} are major public {{health problems and}} {{a leading cause of}} death and injury around the world. Approximately 1. 2 million people are killed each year in road crashes worldwide, with up to 50 million more injured. Over 95 % of these deaths and injuries occur in the low- and middle-income countries of the world. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the impact of the use of seat-belts in reducing the severity of injuries from road traffic crashes and to determine the compliance and awareness of the importance of the use of seat-belts among Nigerian motorists. Patients and Methods: The injury patterns and outcome of care in 140 patients who were seen at the emergency department of our tertiary hospital were evaluated. Initial care and resuscitation was carried out on all patients using the advanced trauma life support protocol. Results: A total of 81 (57 %) patients used seat-belts, while 59 (42. 1 %) did not. Nineteen (13. 6 %) patients died as a result of their injuries; 4 (21. 1 %) of these had used seat-belts, while 15 (79 %) had not (P = 0. 001). The mortality rate of 79 % for patients who did not use seat-belt was statistically significant. Conclusions: The seat-belt is an effective safety tool that not only saves lives, but also significantly reduces the severity of the injury that <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> may have sustained if they were not wearing the device. More public enlightenment is needed to increase the awareness and compliance of use of seat-belts among Nigerian motorists...|$|E

40|$|Vision-based 3 -D head {{detection}} and tracking {{systems have been}} studied in several applications like video surveillance, face-detection systems, and occupant posture analysis. In this paper, we present {{the development of a}} topology-based framework using a 3 -D skeletal model for the robust {{detection and}} tracking of <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant's</b> head position from low-resolution range image data for a passive safety system. Unlike previous approaches to head detection, the proposed approach explores the topology information of a scene to detect the position of the head. Among the different available topology representations, the Reeb graph technique is chosen and is adapted to low-resolution 3 -D range images. Invariance of the graph under rotations is achieved by using a Morse radial distance function. To cope with the particular challenges such as the noise and the large variations in the density of the data, a voxel neighborhood connectivity notion is proposed. A multiple-hypothesis tracker (MHT) with nearest-neighbor data association and Kalman filter prediction is applied on the endpoints of the Reeb graph to select and filter the correct head candidate out of Reeb graph endpoints. A systematic evaluation of the head detection framework is carried out on full-scale experimental 3 -D range images and compared with the ground truth. It is shown that the Reeb graph topology algorithm developed herein allows the correct detection of the head of the occupant with only two head candidates as input to the MHT. Results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is robust under the large variations of the scene. The processing requirements of the proposed approach are discussed. It is shown that the number of operations is rather low and that real-time processing requirements can be met with the proposed method...|$|R
