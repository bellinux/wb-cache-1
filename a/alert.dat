40|$|The study {{examined}} how <b>alerting</b> and executive attention interact in a task involving conflict resolution. We proposed a tentative {{scenario in which}} an initial exogenous phasic <b>alerting</b> phase is followed by an endogenous tonic <b>alerting</b> phase, and hypothesized that these two processes may have distinct effects on conflict resolution. Phasic <b>alerting</b> was expected to increase the conflict, whereas tonic <b>alerting</b> was expected to decrease the conflict. Three experiments were conducted using different variants of the flanker task with visual <b>alerting</b> cues and varied cue-target intervals (SOA), to differentiate between effects of phasic <b>alerting</b> (short SOA) and tonic <b>alerting</b> (long SOA). The results showed that phasic <b>alerting</b> consistently decreased the efficiency of conflict resolution indexed by response time and accuracy, whereas tonic <b>alerting</b> increased the accuracy of conflict resolution, but at a cost in the speed of processing the conflict. The third experiment additionally showed {{that the effects of}} phasic <b>alerting</b> may be modulated by the psychophysical strength of <b>alerting</b> cues.

40|$|Abstract- Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is {{the most}} {{powerful}} system that can handle the intrusions of the computer environments by triggering <b>alerts</b> to make the analysts take actions to stop this intrusion, but the IDS is triggering <b>alerts</b> for any suspicious activity which means thousand <b>alerts</b> that the analysts should take care of it.

These <b>Alerts</b> has different severities and most of them don’t require big attention because of the huge number of the false <b>alerts</b> among them. Monitoring and identifying risky <b>alerts</b> is a major concern to security administrator. Deleting the false <b>alerts</b> or reducing the amount of the <b>alerts</b> (false <b>alerts</b> or real <b>alerts)</b> from the entire amount <b>alerts</b> lead the researchers to design an operational model for minimization of false positive alarms, including recurring alarms by security administrator.
