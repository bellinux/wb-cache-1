50|$|The <b>Africa</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>Party</b> is a South African Muslim {{political}} party.

5000|$|In the 2006 local {{government}} election, the DA {{was the largest}} single party, ahead of the ANC, but with no party holding a majority. The newIndependent Democrats (ID) led by Patricia de Lille was in third place. The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) initiated negotiations with five other smaller parties who together formed a kingmaker block of fifteen councillors, collectively known as the Multi-Party Forum parties.

Andrew Arnolds of the ACDP was elected executive deputy mayor and Jacob [...] "Dirk" [...] Smit of the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) was elected speaker. The initially fragile position of this new DA-led coalition, also known as the Multi-Party Government, was improved in January 2007 with the introduction of the ID following the expulsion of the small <b>Africa</b> <b>Muslim</b> <b>Party</b> for conspiring with the ANC. As a result of the ID's support, the coalition significantly increased its majority, resulting in a much more stable city government. The ID's Charlotte Williams became executive deputy mayor. However, she resigned just a few months later, and the post then went to Grant Haskin of the ACDP in late 2007. [...] The DA would also bolster its position through by-election victories and floor crossing defections. With the ID and DA together holding a firm council majority, several of the smaller coalition partners were dropped from the city government by the time of the 2009 general elections, including the ACDP and FF+. The DA's Ian Neilson became deputy mayor, while Dirk Smit, who had defected to the DA, retained the position of speaker. Both still hold their positions.
