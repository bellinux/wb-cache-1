5|$|Although the {{marriage}} had been strained from the beginning, Teresa Cristina continued striving to {{be a good}} wife. Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, along with the birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and their concern for <b>and</b> <b>delight</b> in their children created a sense of family happiness. That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. After the birth of their first son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{generally}} impress <b>and</b> <b>delight</b> (5, 6, 7, 8), {{often by}} including unusual, colourful costumes (6, 7). Sometimes they also commemorate (5, 8) or celebrate (1, 4, 8, 9, 10). Sometimes {{they have a}} serious purpose, such as when the context is military (1, 2, 5), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or {{have a role to}} play (6, 7, 9). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away (10), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.|$|E

The text recommends boiling the water before use and using the water so in a day.

5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure <b>and</b> <b>delight.</b> It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E

25|$|The {{result of}} such an {{approach}} is to invest the sculptures with greater psychological energy. The viewer finds it easier to gauge the state of mind of the characters and therefore understands the larger story at work: Daphne's wide open mouth in fear and astonishment, David biting his lip in determined concentration, or Proserpina desperately struggling to free herself. In addition to portraying psychological realism, they show a greater concern for representing physical details. The tousled hair of Pluto, the pliant flesh of Proserpina, or the forest of leaves beginning to envelop Daphne all demonstrate Bernini's exactitude <b>and</b> <b>delight</b> for representing complex real world textures in marble form.|$|E
25|$|At the 1981 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the {{strength}} of the MP4/1 was given a very public test when John Watson suffered a massive crash in his MP4/1 coming out of the second Lesmo turn. Many feared the worst for the Irishman as crashes like that in Formula One often led to the death of the driver. However, {{the strength}} of the Carbon Fibre monocoque (which many in F1 had been sceptical of) saw Watson survive unhurt to the surprise <b>and</b> <b>delight</b> of many, not the least being Watson himself and Barnard. Within months the design had been copied by many of McLaren's rivals. In , Barnard pioneered the 'coke-bottle' shape of sidepods still visible to this day.|$|E
25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure <b>and</b> <b>delight</b> {{in the perception of}} the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, {{this has to do with}} the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E

25|$|The {{second section}} turns to {{different}} kinds of poems: heroic, pastoral, tragedy, comedy, satire and lyric. The third and longest section discusses poetic practice: what to write about, what the distinctive qualities of good poetry are, and what rules apply to individual genres. Scott uses a variety of examples from classical and modern poetry to illustrate how poetry achieves its purpose to teach, move <b>and</b> <b>delight.</b> Scott, following Julius Caesar Scaliger, dwells in particular on the four virtues of poetry that apply to both the poet's choice of material and style: Scott writes that Scaliger observes that to strike with the pleasure of our poem the doors of men's sense these four virtues are especially requisite: first a proportionableness or uniformity; secondly variety; thirdly sweetness; lastly that energeia, force effectualness, or vigour, which is the character of passion and life of persuasion and motion' (p. 33).|$|E
