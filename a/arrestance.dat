50|$|High {{efficiency}} particulate air (HEPA), originally called high-efficiency particulate absorber {{but also}} sometimes called high-efficiency particulate arresting or high-efficiency particulate <b>arrestance,</b> {{is a type}} of air filter. Filters meeting the HEPA standard have many applications, including use in medical facilities, automobiles, aircraft and homes. The filter must satisfy certain standards of efficiency such as those set by the United States Department of Energy (DOE).|$|E
50|$|High-efficiency {{particulate}} <b>arrestance</b> (HEPA) filters remove {{at least}} 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles {{and are usually}} more effective at removing larger particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a clean room, must be arranged so that no air bypasses the HEPA filter. In dusty environments, a HEPA filter may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the HEPA filter needs cleaning or replacing less frequently. HEPA filters do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts in course of operation.|$|E
40|$|Access to the {{rainforest}} canopy of Biosphere 2 presented a unique challenge {{to design and}} build a fall <b>arrestance</b> system that would {{meet the needs of}} the ecological research community and ensure a high degree of safety for users. The system was based on technology typically used in canopy research in field settings, but differed due to the presence of the steel spaceframe that enclosed the mesocosms of Biosphere 2. This paper reports the design of a fall <b>arrestance</b> system that meets federal regulations for health and safety and an example of gas exchange data collected in the canopy of the Biosphere 2 rainforest. The preliminary results from leaf gas exchange measurements indicated distinct differences between under-story and canopy plants, emphasizing the importance of access to the canopy for experimen...|$|E

40|$|Researches {{has shown}} that climate change may spark global epidemics. The {{objectives}} of hospital design consistent with a high standard of sustainable architecture must not only be the tropicalization of buildings but also a system to confront the impact of infectious diseases which arise from climate change. Infection control is the discipline concerned with preventing nosocomial or healthcare-associated infection. Infection control addresses factors related {{to the spread of}} infections within the hospital building, including prevention, monitoring and management measures. As the application of new technologies such as the Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC) with high-efficiency particulate <b>arrestance</b> (HEPA) has application range within stamina, the study suggests the need to adopt an integrated adaptive hospital design strategy to prevent infection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAir {{handling}} processors with structure packing {{are widely}} utilized in the air-conditioning system, in which coupled heat and mass transfer occurs between air and water/desiccant. As an additional benefit, the processor could remove particles {{at the same}} time. An experimental setup for a cross-flow packed processor was established to investigate the filtration efficiency, in which air-water and air-desiccant were chosen as flow media. Effects of air and water/desiccant parameters on the filtration performance were experimentally analyzed. The results show that for typical air-to-liquid flow rate ratio (≈ 1), PM 5 <b>arrestance</b> efficiency of packed processor with water is 40 %∼ 50 % while that with LiBr solution is 20 %∼ 30 %. The filtration efficiency with LiBr solution is higher than that with water when splash effect of liquid is omitted...|$|E
40|$|Human {{exploration}} of Mars {{will require the}} optimal utilization of planetary resources. One of its abundant resources is the Martian atmosphere that can be harvested through filtration and chemical processes that purify and separate it into its gaseous and elemental constituents. Effective filtration needs {{to be part of}} the suite of resource utilization technologies. A unique testing platform is being used which provides the relevant operational and instrumental capabilities to test articles under the proper simulated Martian conditions. A series of tests were conducted to assess the performance of filter media. Light sheet imaging of the particle flow provided a means of detecting and quantifying particle concentrations to determine capturing efficiencies. The media's efficiency was also evaluated by gravimetric means through a by-layer filter media configuration. These tests will help to establish techniques and methods for measuring capturing efficiency and <b>arrestance</b> of conventional fibrous filter media. This paper will describe initial test results on different filter media...|$|E
40|$|Traditional air {{particulate}} filtering in manned spaceflight (Apollo, Shuttle, ISS, etc.) {{has used}} cleanable or replaceable catch filters such as screens and High-Efficiency Particulate <b>Arrestance</b> (HEPA) filters. However, the human mission to Mars architecture {{will require a}} new approach. It is Martian dust that is the particulate of concern but the need also applies to particulates generated by crew. The Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) high-lighted this concern in its Mars Science, Goals, Objectives, Investigations and Priorities document [7], by saying specifically that one high priority investigation will be to "Test ISRU atmospheric processing systems to measure resilience with respect to dust and other environmental challenge performance parameters that are critical {{to the design of}} a full-scale system. " By stating this as high priority the MEPAG is acknowledging that developing and adequately verifying this capability is critical to success of a human mission to Mars. This architecture will require filtering capabilities that are highly reliable, will not restrict the flow path with clogging, and require little to no maintenance. This paper will summarize why this is the case, the general requirements for developing the technology, and the status of the progress made in this area...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{outbreak}} of Q fever {{was linked to}} an intensive goat and sheep dairy farm in Victoria, Australia, 2012 - 2014. Seventeen employees and one family member were confirmed with Q fever over a 28 -month period, including two culture-positive cases. The outbreak investigation and management involved a One Health approach with representation from human, animal, environmental and public health. Seroprevalence in non-pregnant milking goats was 15 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 7 – 27]; active infection was confirmed by positive quantitative PCR on several animal specimens. Genotyping of Coxiella burnetii DNA obtained from goat and human specimens was identical by two typing methods. A number of farming practices probably contributed to the outbreak, with similar precipitating factors to the Netherlands outbreak, 2007 - 2012. Compared to workers in a high-efficiency particulate <b>arrestance</b> (HEPA) filtered factory, administrative staff in an unfiltered adjoining office and those regularly handling goats and kids had 5 · 49 (95 % CI 1 · 29 – 23 · 4) and 5 · 65 (95 % CI 1 · 09 – 29 · 3) times the risk of infection, respectively; suggesting factory workers were protected from windborne spread of organisms. Reduction {{in the incidence of}} human cases was achieved through an intensive human vaccination programme plus environmental and biosecurity interventions. Subsequent non-occupational acquisition of Q fever in the spouse of an employee, indicates that infection remains endemic in the goat herd, and remains a challenge to manage without source control...|$|E
40|$|Significant strides {{have been}} made in {{optimizing}} the design of filtration and pressurization systems used on the enclosed cabs of mobile mining equipment to reduce respirable dust and provide the best air quality to the equipment operators. Considering all of the advances made in this area, one aspect that still needed to be evaluated was a comparison of the efficiencies of the different filters used in these systems. As high-efficiency particulate <b>arrestance</b> (HEPA) filters provide the highest filtering efficiency, the general assumption would be that they would also provide the greatest level of protection to workers. Researchers for the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) speculated, based upon a previous laboratory study, that filters with minimum efficiency reporting value, or MERV rating, of 16 may be a more appropriate choice than HEPA filters in most cases for the mining industry. A study was therefore performed comparing HEPA and MERV 16 filters on two kinds of underground limestone mining equipment, a roof bolter and a face drill, to evaluate this theory. Testing showed that, at the 95 -percent confidence level, there was no statistical difference between the efficiencies of the two types of filters on the two kinds of mining equipment. As the MERV 16 filters were less restrictive, provided greater airflow and cab pressurization, cost less and required less-frequent replacement than the HEPA filters, the MERV 16 filters were concluded to be the optimal choice for both the roof bolter and the face drill in this comparative-analysis case study. Another key finding of this study is the substantial improvement in the effectiveness of filtration and pressurization systems when using a final filter design.

40|$|A {{voluntary}} {{indoor air}} quality certification scheme has been proposed in Hong Kong for assessing and evaluating the {{indoor air quality}} level {{in a variety of}} public places like offices, restaurants and pubs. The scheme intends to promote the public well being, however, its technical and financial practicality has led to serious discussions among the government officials, practitioners and premises owners. Accordingly, this study intends to develop a protocol for examining its financial viability by linking the appropriate dose-response and economic data with the results from indoor micro-environment models. The financial viability of the scheme is evaluated by examining the cost and benefit associated with compliance on the different prescribed indoor particulate (PM 10) levels. According to our analysis, the indoor action level of 180 μg/m 3 as 8 -h mean (with the objective of protecting the health of general public) does not require office owners to improve beyond the base setting. Nevertheless, owners should consider altering the base settings in their air conditioning systems so as to secure more benefit on every dollar they spent. On the contrary, the 20 μg/m 3 level as 8 -h mean (with the objective of providing comfort) is not considered to be financially viable for office owners as they will incur financial loss on compliance. Subsequent sensitivity analysis indicates that the total net benefit derived have a great dependency on the value-of-life estimates used. If conservative health estimates are adopted, the optimum level determined to be beneficial to both owners and the society will be 55 μg/m 3, which can be obtained by operating the air conditioning system with a ventilation rate of 10 l/s, primary filters of 80 - 85 % efficiency and secondary filters efficiency of 60 - 65 % <b>arrestance.</b> This information should be extremely valuable for government officials and policy makers in assessing the financial viability of the voluntary indoor assessment scheme.

40|$|Exposure to traffic-generated {{ultrafine}} particles (UFP; particles < 100 nm) {{is likely}} {{a risk factor}} for cardiovascular disease. We conducted a trial of high-efficiency particulate <b>arrestance</b> (HEPA) filtration in public housing near a highway. Twenty residents in 19 apartments living < 200 m from the highway participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover trial. A HEPA filter unit and a particle counter (measuring particle number concentration (PNC), a proxy for UFP) were installed in living rooms. Participants were exposed to filtered air for 21 days and unfiltered air for 21 days. Blood samples were collected and blood pressure measured at days 0, 21 and 42 after a 12 -hour fasting period. Plasma was analyzed for high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor alpha-receptor II (TNF-RII) and fibrinogen. PNC reductions ranging from 21 % to 68 % were recorded in 15 of the apartments. We observed no significant differences in blood pressure or three of the four biomarkers (hsCRP, fibrinogen, and TNF-RII) measured in participants after 21 -day exposure to HEPA-filtered air compared to measurements after 21 -day exposure to sham-filtered air. In contrast, IL- 6 concentrations were significantly higher following HEPA filtration (0. 668 pg/mL; CI = 0. 465 – 0. 959) compared to sham filtration. Likewise, PNC adjusted for time activity were associated with increasing IL- 6 in 14 - and 21 -day moving averages, and PNC was associated with decreasing blood pressure in Lags 0, 1 and 2, and in a 3 -day moving average. These negative associations were unexpected and could be due to a combination of factors including exposure misclassification, unsuccessful randomization (i. e., IL- 6 and use of anti-inflammatory medicines), or uncontrolled confounding. Studies with greater reduction in UFP levels and larger sample sizes are needed. There also needs to be more complete assessment of resident time activity and of outdoor vs. indoor source contributions to UFP exposure. HEPA filtration remains a promising, but not fully realized intervention...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Internationally, 9. 2 {{million new}} cases and 1. 7 million deaths {{occurred}} from tuberculosis (TB) in 2006. The {{vast majority of}} TB deaths occurred in the developing world, that is, Asia and Africa (WHO, 2008). The risk of infection is worsened by overcrowding of healthcare facilities which share re-circulated air without high efficiency particulate <b>arrestance</b> (HEPA) filtration or effective decontamination devices. With emerging and re-emerging infectious agents, {{the importance of the}} microbial influence on indoor air quality is gaining momentum around the world. The transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a recognized occupational hazard and the mode of airborne transmission in risk settings needs to be investigated. The current study examined the efficacy of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the early detection of airborne MTB using three types of filters: Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Polycarbonate (PC) and Gelatine, and a sedimentation gel (impaction method). A total of 520 samples, 68 internal positive controls and 68 internal negative controls were tested using two different PCR detection methods. The four different sampling types were each exposed to samples containing an avirulent strain of MTB (H 37 Ra) and negative controls exposed to aerosolized distilled water in an uncontrolled environment. The air was filtered at a flow rate of 2. 5 L/min for a specified time. The filter membranes and sedimentation gel were removed from their respective holders, washed and analysed using conventional and real time (RT) PCR. An additional step using magnetic bead separation was used to assess its performance in overcoming inhibition. The sampling methods used included an in - house preparation of sedimentation gel. This sampling method was used in a study by Vadrot and colleagues in 2004 for detection of airborne MTB using the PCR method. Commercially available filters that were used as sampling methods included PTFE, PC and Gelatine. The detection methods included conventional PCR which detected the MTB complex in three hours, RT-PCR which detected MTB species in 70 minutes and RT-PCR coupled to magnetic bead separation (RT-PCR M) which detected MTB species in 90 minutes. The magnetic bead separation method purified the nucleic acids in the sample by eliminating the inhibitors that were present. The current study showed that by using the magnetic bead capture assay in conjunction with RT-PCR, gave excellent results of 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity when using PTFE, PC and Gelatine sampling methods. The sedimentation gel showed results of 90 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity. The Gelatine sampling method results showed 100 % inhibition with conventional PCR. In conclusion, the use of conventional PCR is limiting for the detection of airborne MTB, possibly due to inhibition factors. In addition, the PTFE filter demonstrated excellent results for all detection methods used. The sedimentation gel did not perform well with PCR and RT-PCR, however gave excellent results with RT-PCR M. The PC filter can be considered the second sampling method of choice after PTFE filter, showing superior results for all diagnostic parameters using RT-PCR M, followed by RT-PCR and then PCR. The greatest application of using this validated method will be in the area of infection control. Environmental practitioners and occupational hygienists would be able to use this method to evaluate environmental control measures and monitor the air quality in healthcare facilities and other workplaces...|$|E
