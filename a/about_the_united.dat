Following McCarthy's departure from the race, Republicans renewed their efforts to recruit Ryan as a candidate. Boehner personally called Ryan twice to ask him to run, and Chaffetz said that he would not run against Ryan if he chose to enter the race. Ryan also received calls from Mitt Romney and Trey Gowdy, among others, encouraging him to run for Speaker. Additional Ryan endorsements came from Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, 2016 Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise from Louisiana. On October 9, close aides of Ryan confirmed that Ryan was reconsidering the possibility of a run.|$|E
5|$|Nancy never lacks money, and {{in later}} {{volumes of the}} series often travels to faraway locations, such as France in The Mystery of the 99 Steps (1966), Nairobi in The Spider Sapphire Mystery (1968), Austria in Captive Witness (1981), Japan in The Runaway Bride (1994), Costa Rica in Scarlet Macaw Scandal (2004), and Alaska in Curse of The Arctic Star (2013). Nancy is also able to travel freely <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, {{thanks in part to}} her car, which is a blue {{roadster}} in the original series and a blue convertible in the later books. Despite the trouble and presumed expense to which she goes to solve mysteries, Nancy never accepts monetary compensation; however, by implication, her expenses are often paid by a client of her father's, as part of the costs of solving one of his cases.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Smith and rising {{opposition}} in the west, the Mormons decided to relocate their center from Nauvoo, Illinois to the California region outside of the United States border. The plans for the large exodus began and Mormon leadership moved westward leaving Brannan the highest ranking religious leader in New York. As such, he was faced with the large responsibility of evacuating the eastern Mormons to California. Brannan chartered the ship Brooklyn and persuaded the Mormons of New York to join the expedition to California. The Brooklyn set sail for upper California via Cape Horn in January 1846. Brannan {{was in charge of}} the expedition and the highest presiding religious leader on the ship. He brought along an antiquated printing press and a complete flour mill to make colonization easier. While the living conditions aboard the Brooklyn were strenuous for many, Brannan lived lavishly in the ship's officers' quarters. The ship stopped on June 20, 1846 in Honolulu, Hawaii to resupply and be inspected by Commodore Stockton. Brannan expected the inspection to go badly but instead Commodore Stockton spoke to Brannan <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States planned assault of the Mexicans at Monterey. This information along with Commodore Stockton's quiet encouragement lead Samuel Brannan to the idea of taking the port town of Yerba Buena. Brannan's dreams of colonization and success were underway and after leaving Hawaii, the Brookyln changed routes, landing on July 31, 1846, at the Mexican port town of Yerba Buena. Upon arrival they were met by Commander John B. Montgomery and the Portsmouth who had taken Yerba Buena only a few days before much to Brannan's dismay. The Mormons began colonizing the area (present-day San Francisco) and tripled the population of the pueblo.|$|E

The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Constitution, and its language was not incorporated into that document.

[...] Believing Trump had {{the makings of a}} president, Dunbar pitched Trump the idea of speaking at an event for Republican candidates in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. [...] According to Dunbar in a later interview, Trump was receptive to this idea. [...] Then a registered Democrat, Trump officially changed his registration to Republican in July 1987.

[...] The advertisements reflected Trump's concerns that Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait were taking advantage of American money and protection without providing any benefit to the United States. [...] The next month, as Dunbar had proposed, Trump appeared at a Rotary Club luncheon in New Hampshire. [...] There, he delivered what The New York Times described as an [...] "impassioned speech," [...] in which he expressed concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States being [...] "pushed around" [...] by its allies and proposed that [...] "these countries that are ripping us off pay off the $200 billion deficit." [...] In the audience, college students held placards reading [...] "Trump for President." [...] Nevertheless, Trump proclaimed, [...] "I'm not here because I'm running for President. I'm here because I'm tired of our country being kicked around and I want to get my ideas across." [...] Later, Trump appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. [...] After the appearance, he received a letter from former President Richard Nixon in which Nixon explained that his wife Pat, [...] "an expert on politics," [...] had seen Trump on the show and [...] "predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!"
