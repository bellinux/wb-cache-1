This study utilized video clips as a means to <b>anchor</b> <b>instruction</b> and assist struggling middle-level readers in comprehending text. Participants in this study were 17 seventh- and eighth-grade students from a rural middle school. The study used a single-subject reversal design. During the baseline phase of the study, students read four different titles before a stable baseline could be established. The data collected were the combined mean scores of the teacher-created comprehension assessments and commercially produced computer-based assessments at the completion of reading each title during all phases of the study. In the second and fourth phases (books 5 and 7), no treatment was used and the regular instructional routine was followed. In the third and fifth phase (books 6 and 8), the treatment (video clips) was introduced to assist the reader with background knowledge pertinent to the content of the book being read. Books 6 and 8 were taught in combination with the viewing of video clips, class discussion of the materials viewed, and the regular instructional routine. Findings from the study were analyzed to explore (a) what effect did viewing video clips as a means to <b>anchor</b> <b>instruction</b> have on the mean classroom scores of combined teacher-developed and commercially developed comprehension assessments for remedial, struggling middle-level readers; and (b) how did viewing video clips related to text topics affect individual student scores on combined teacher-developed and commercially developed end-of-book comprehension questions.

40|$|Minimalism in a {{nutshell}} Carroll’s minimalism signaled a distinctly new approach to supporting {{the knowledge and skills}} development of computer users. Contrary to most approaches (that depart from a feature-oriented point of view), the key idea in the minimalist approach is to adapt as much as possible to the users’ desire for quick and hand-on experience. This notion is put into practice by combining concise instruction with ample opportunities for the users to engage in meaningful interactions with the software. More specifically, the minimalist approach consists of four design-principles: (a) allow for active learning, (b) <b>anchor</b> the <b>instruction</b> in the task domain, (c) support error-recovery, and (d) support reading to do, study and locate (Carroll, 1990; Lazonder, 1994; Van der Meij & Carroll, 1995). Each principle is specified into a set of heuristics: guides and grist for designing minimalist tutorials (Van der Meij & Carroll, 1995). The effectiveness of these principles and heuristics seems beyond questioning. In teaching novice users the basics of computer programs, minimalist tutorials have repeatedly been found to lead to faster training and better learning as compared to ‘traditional...|$|R

Answering to mounting calls for the crucial need of independent direct replications of published findings to ensure the self-correcting nature of our science, we sought to corroborate Slepian et al. ’s finding in two extremely high-powered, preregistered studies that were very faithful to all procedural and methodological details of the original study (i. e., same cover story, study title, manipulation, measures, item order, scale <b>anchors,</b> task <b>instructions,</b> sampling frame, population, and statistical analyses).

50|$|The goal of <b>anchored</b> <b>instruction</b> is the {{engagement}} of intention and attention. Through authentic tasks across multiple domains, educators present situations that {{require students to}} create or adopt meaningful goals (intentions). One of the educator’s objectives can be to set a goal {{through the use of}} an anchor problem. A classic example of <b>anchored</b> <b>instruction</b> is the Jasper series. The Jasper series includes a variety of videodisc adventures focused on problem formulation and problem solving. Each videodisc used a visual narrative to present an authentic, realistic everyday problem. The objective was for students to adopt specific goals (intentions) after viewing the story and defining a problem. These newly adopted goals guided students through the collaborative process of problem formulation and problem solving.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anchored</b> <b>Instruction</b> is a {{technology}} centered learning approach, which {{falls under the}} social constructionism paradigm. It {{is a form of}} situated learning http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/situated-learning.html that emphasizes problem-solving within an integrated learning context, which can be examined from multiple perspectives. [...] "In other words, the learning is contextualized to provide students with realistic roles that serve to enhance the learning process", (Fried, Zannini, Wheeler, Lee, & Cortez, 2005). During teaching, activities are designed or tied around an [...] "anchor", such as an adventure or story, with a problem at the end, that needs to be resolved. The connection made between the content and the authentic context is referred to as [...] "anchoring". These models typically embed all the information needed for the problem to be solved, such data and hints. <b>Anchored</b> <b>instruction</b> is akin to Problem-based learning (P.B.L.) with the exception of its open-endedness.|$|E
50|$|Since {{situated}} cognition views knowing as {{an action}} within specific contexts and views direct instruction models of knowledge transmission as impoverished, {{there are significant}} implications for pedagogical practices. First, curriculum requires instructional design that draws on apprenticeship models common in real life.

Classroom practices such as project-based learning and problem-based learning would qualify as consistent with the situated learning perspective, as would techniques such as Case Base Learning, <b>Anchored</b> <b>Instruction,</b> and cognitive apprenticeship.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe spatial bias {{of neglect}} {{patients}} has been assumed {{to result from}} the alteration of a body-centred representation which underlies actions within personal and extra-personal spaces. This deficit seems to correspond to the ipsilesional deviation of the subjective straight-ahead (SSA), often described in neglect patients. However, several recent studies have failed to show significant correlations between the SSA deviation and performance in standard visuo-spatial tests of neglect. Since methodological choices could explain these negative results, the present study re-investigated the question. SSA, assessed by manual pointing, was <b>anchored</b> by <b>instructions</b> to a precise median body part. A body-centred line bisection task was also carried out, during the same session and in similar experimental conditions. Sixteen right brain-damaged patients with (n = 8) or without (n = 8) neglect, and 8 control subjects free of any neurological problem were included. Taken as a group, the neglect group stood out from the others in both tasks. Moreover, in neglect patients only, SSA position significantly correlated with bisection error for long lines, even if dissociations between SSA shift and bisection error were found in two cases. Results are discussed {{with regard to the}} nature of the tasks proposed in the different studies and to methodological aspects that could at least partly explain the aforementioned failures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract ⎯ Problem-based Learning (PBL) <b>anchors</b> {{learning}} and <b>instruction</b> in concrete problems. We believe that PBL {{is well suited}} to educating undergraduate and graduate students within the interdisciplinary field of biomedical engineering (BME). BME draws upon many traditional disciplines to address a range of problems, from biotechnology to clinical medicine. A challenge for BME educators is to balance this broad base of fundamentals with the analytical, in depth problem solving necessary to be successful bioengineers. The ability to adapt, be innovative, and acquire and integrate relevant information is not efficiently learned in a lecture format, but rather in a small group setting that encourages self-directed learning, such as PBL. We have developed a graduate BME program with PBL {{as one of the}} pivotal components and are embarking on the introduction of this methodology to undergraduate sections. We have found PBL to be an effective vehicle for instruction, retention of material, and introduction of topics necessary for professional development...|$|R

50|$|Narrative-based {{learning}} is a learning model grounded in the theory that humans define their experiences {{within the context of}} narratives - which serve as cognitive structures and a means of communication, as well as aiding people in framing and understanding their perceptions of the world.

This model aligns with the constructivist ideals of situated learning—which theorises that active learning takes place within {{the context in which the}} knowledge must be applied. <b>Anchored</b> <b>Instruction</b> is a type of situated learning that presents students with a realistic narrative within a specific context.

5000|$|<b>Anchored</b> <b>instruction</b> is {{grounded}} in a story or narrative that presents a realistic (but fictional) situation and raises an overarching question or problem (compare with an essential question posed by a teacher). This approach is designed to 1) engage the learner with a problem or series of related problems, 2) require the learner to develop goals and discover subgoals related to solving the problem(s), and 3) provide the learner with extensive and diverse opportunities to explore the problem(s) in a shared context with classmates. For example, a Spanish teacher uses a video drama series focused on {{the murder of a}} main character. Students work in small groups to summarize parts of the story, to create hypotheses about the murderer and motive, and to create a presentation of their solution to the class. Stories are often paired so that across the set students can detect the invariant structure of the underlying knowledge (so 2 episodes about distance-rate-time, one about boats and one about planes, so students can perceive how the distance-rate-time relationship holds across differences in vehicles). The ideal smallest set of instances needed provide students the opportunity to detect invariant structure has been referred to as a [...] "generator set" [...] of situations.|$|E
