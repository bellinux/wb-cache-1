40|$|The rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> {{of manual}} chest {{percussion}} as applied by 35 physiotherapists was investigated. The influence of gender, body weight, {{body mass index}} (BMI), rate and frequency of usage on force were examined. Percussion was applied to a healthy male for 35 seconds and the rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> were measured using a force platform. The rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> varied among subjects. The mean (SD) rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> of percussion were 6. 60 (1. 00) Hertz and 58. 10 (15. 32) Newtons respectively. There was no relationship between <b>force</b> <b>and</b> 1) gender, 2) body weight, 3) BMI or 4) frequency of usage of percussion. A weak relationship was found between rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> (r = - 0. 358, p = 0. 034). Thirty-two subjects demonstrated a hand dominance...|$|R
5|$|According to Diodorus, Philip {{marched on}} his enemies in this {{alliance}} {{before they had}} chance to combine, <b>and</b> <b>forced</b> them to ally to Macedon instead.

5|$|After half an {{hour the}} Russians finally stormed the ramparts of Fort 74 and {{defeated}} the Polish battalion defending it. This forced the Polish mobile artillery in Czyste, until then shelling the advancing Russian columns and their Grand Battery, to fall back. Meanwhile, the Russian right column was approaching Fort 72. Defended by only 200 men, the fort was approached by the Russian spearhead formed by the reinforced Nieśwież Regiment. Seeing this, the Polish commander ordered his cavalry reserve to charge the Russian infantry. Russian grenadiers stormed the ramparts of Fort 72, but were repelled <b>and</b> <b>forced</b> back behind the moat, where the Polish cavalry charged them. The Russians formed infantry squares, but were defeated <b>and</b> <b>forced</b> to retreat. To counter the threat to Russian infantry, General Nostitz charged his own cavalry reserve under General Georg von Sass, and a cavalry battle ensued.|$|E

40|$|Closed-loop {{systems of}} an {{electro-hydraulic}} servo system including position, acceleration, <b>and</b> <b>force</b> closed-loop systems <b>and</b> their closed-loop transfer functions based on parameter model are adaptive identified using a recursive extended least-squares algorithm. The position <b>and</b> <b>force</b> closed-loop tracking controllers are {{designed by a}} proportional–integral–derivative controller and are tuned by the position <b>and</b> <b>force</b> step signals. The acceleration closed-loop tracking controller is designed by a three-variable controller and the three states include position, velocity, and acceleration. Experimental results of the estimated position, acceleration, <b>and</b> <b>force</b> closed-loop transfer functions are performed on an actual electro-hydraulic servo system using xPC rapid prototyping technology, which clearly demonstrate {{the benefit of the}} adaptive identification method...|$|R
