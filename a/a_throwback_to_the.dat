5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a missing link. Carter was {{inspired}} to write the episode by an essay by E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a previous project was used for the costume of the creature.|$|E
5|$|Forgoing the {{downloadable}} content {{model used}} in previous Guitar Hero games, Guitar Hero Live adds songs {{to the game}} via Guitar Hero TV (GHTV), an online game mode offered free of charge in Guitar Hero Live. Instead of playing the immersive first-person view that the main career mode presents, songs on GHTV are played over the music video or footage of the band playing at a concert. Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation, similar to a music video channel, allowing the player to drop in and out, but the player can use collected in-game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation. FreeStyleGames found that this approach, {{in contrast to the}} traditional downloadable content model, made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs, as well as <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heyday of music video channels like MTV.|$|E
5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E

500|$|Snake Eater was a {{commercial}} success and sold 3.6 million copies worldwide by August 2005. Although this is considerably lower than , which has sold 7 million copies to date, critics were {{pleased with the}} new protagonist, Naked Snake—who strongly resembles the series protagonist Solid Snake—after fans were disappointed by Raiden in MGS2. Some critics, who found the lengthy dialogues and multitude of plot twists in Sons of Liberty to be detrimental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game experience found the storyline of Snake Eater <b>a</b> pleasing <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original Metal Gear Solid, with less of the [...] "philosophical babble" [...] present in Sons of Liberty.|$|R
25|$|The Funstar (stylised as FUNStar) is a pick-up {{concept car}} {{based on the}} Mk3 Fabia. It was {{designed}} by Škoda Auto University students as <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Felicia Fun, a compact pick-up car produced during the 1990s. It was shown at the annual 2015 Worthersee GTI fan meeting.|$|E
25|$|The ZEN Neeon was {{released}} on May 17, 2005. It is <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old Zen Xtra, but in a much smaller size. The 5GB model has an SNR of 98 dB and a battery life of 16 hours (19 hours with new firmware version). The front has a piano black finish, and the back is anodized aluminium that comes in ten colors. and the LCD screen has a 7 color backlight.|$|E
25|$|The given name(s) {{normally}} {{comes before}} the surname. However, in {{a list of}} people sorted alphabetically by surname, the surname usually comes first. Hence some people may also use this order in spoken language (e.g. introducing themselves as Kowalski Jan instead of Jan Kowalski), but this is generally considered incorrect or <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Communist era when this order was sometimes heard in official situations. In many formal situations, the given name is omitted altogether.|$|E
50|$|The {{death penalty}} {{in this country is}} largely <b>a</b> quaint <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> days when {{everyone}} else had one. As we no longer have a hangman, and almost the only country in the world in a position to train one is South Africa, there is no immediate prospect of execution in this jurisdiction. That being said, the abolition of the death penalty would represent a strong political minus in the eyes of certain right-wing groupings, including the gardaí, the RUC and the DUP. While the step would be practically meaningless, it could be used in a politically damaging way.|$|R
50|$|The game {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. It has {{an average}} rating of 95.61% at GameRankings, {{making it the}} best-rated game for the Game Boy Color on the site, and achieved a perfect 10/10 score on video game website IGN. Nintendo Power listed it as the 11th best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for successfully bringing elements from the three dimensional games. Game Informers Ben Reeves called it the eighth best Game Boy game and considered it <b>a</b> good <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MSX2. GamesRadar listed Metal Gear Solid {{as one of the}} titles they want in the 3DS Virtual Console.|$|R
50|$|The {{animated}} character Marge Simpson {{is depicted}} as having blue hair. Rolf from Cartoon Network's Ed Edd n Eddy is depicted to have dark blue hair. Jok Church's character, Beakman, also has blue hair, which is <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> reference, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creator, <b>to</b> an older version of Superman, who also had a blue tint to his hair.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to the punk fashion of the mid-late 1970s, there was <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> late 1950s Ivy League style. This revival came to be definitively summarized in an enormously popular paperback released in 1980: The Official Preppy Handbook. Popular preppy clothing for men included Oxford shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, polo shirts with popped collars, khaki slacks, argyle socks, dress pants, Hush Puppies Oxford shoes, brogues, suspenders, seersucker or striped linen suits, corduroy, and cable knit sweaters that were often worn tied around the shoulders.|$|E
25|$|In some releases, {{the first}} disc of the DVD set {{opens with a}} CGI short created to promote the movie's tie-in video game, with Flux taking on the {{likeness}} of the Charlize Theron version. The short, which ran about the same length {{as one of the}} Liquid Television shorts, sees Flux conducting an unclear mission, killing many Breen soldiers while pursuing some small, insect-like robots. In <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ongoing theme of the original shorts, the character is ultimately killed due to human error.|$|E
25|$|Macleod had {{intended}} {{at first to}} be a reforming Minister of Labour – he attempted, {{in the teeth of}} resistance from the TUC, to negotiate a Workers’ Charter (<b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Charter of the late 1940s) in return for a Contract of Service. He also hoped to take a tougher line with strikes than his predecessor Walter Monckton, whose explicit remit had been to appease the unions. The unions were beginning to become more militant, under the leadership of Frank Cousins, boss of the TGWU.|$|E
50|$|After 30 {{years of}} {{conservative}} clothing styles, the '60s saw <b>a</b> kind of <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1920s with women once again adopting a childlike look with bobbed haircuts and progressively less modest clothing. At {{the start of}} the decade skirts were knee-length, but steadily became shorter and shorter until the mini-skirt emerged in 1965. By {{the end of the decade}} they had shot well above the stocking top, making <b>the</b> transition <b>to</b> tights inevitable.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1991 Supreme Court decision resuscitating {{the presumption}} against extraterritoriality [hereinafter “PAE” or “presumption”], EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co. (Aramco), Larry Kramer described the presumption as <b>an</b> anachronism—a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strict territorialist approach to {{choice of law}} that prevailed before the mid-Twentieth Century but has been mostly abandoned since then. The title of his scathing article, Vestiges of Beale, referred <b>to</b> Joseph Beale, <b>the</b> Harvard Law professor and reporter of the First Restatement of Conflict of Laws, whose since-discredited theories underlay that Restatement’s approach to choice of law. In the cases since Aramco, the Court has strengthened and expanded the presumption. With its decision in RJR Nabisco v. European Community, it is fair <b>to</b> say, <b>the</b> Court has out-Beale’d Beale...|$|R
50|$|Anderson often {{returned}} to libertarianism and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> business leader as hero, most notably his character Nicholas van Rijn. Van Rijn is, however, {{far from the}} modern type of business executive, being <b>a</b> kind of <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> merchant venturer of the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century. If he spends any time in boardrooms or plotting corporate takeovers, the reader remains ignorant of it, since virtually all his appearances are {{in the wilds of}} a space frontier.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, the soundboards of both {{northern}} and Italian virginals were pierced with a rose, sometimes {{two or three}} in early days. The rose had no acoustic function, and was purely decorative. Although these were <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rose in the medieval lute, they were never carved integrally {{as part of the}} soundboard. In Italian instruments they were usually constructed by combining multiple layers of pierced parchment, so that the final result looked like a gothic rose window, or an inverted wedding cake. In Flemish instruments, the rose was usually cast from lead and gilded, and usually incorporated the maker's initials.|$|E
25|$|The Coens {{directed}} the 2003 film Intolerable Cruelty, starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> romantic comedies of the 1940s. It focuses on hotshot divorce lawyer Miles Massey {{and a beautiful}} divorcée whom Massey managed to prevent from receiving any money in her divorce. She vows to get even with him while, at the same time, he becomes smitten with her. Intolerable Cruelty received generally positive reviews, although it {{is considered one of}} the duo's weaker films. Also that year, they executive produced and did an uncredited rewrite of the Christmas black comedy Bad Santa, which garnered positive reviews.|$|E
25|$|Following {{decades of}} coming second in {{television}} ratings to Nine News Melbourne and Ten Eyewitness News Melbourne (previously Ten Evening News, Ten News: First at Five, Ten News at Five and Ten News at Six), Seven News Melbourne {{went into a}} tight contest to win the ratings battle in 2005. Seven News overtook the rival Nine bulletin in the ratings in 2007. This was subsequently followed {{by a series of}} advertisements and promos which have touted Seven News Melbourne as Melbourne's New #1 and Nine altering their promotions to simply say Melbourne's Best News - <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1980s when National Nine News Melbourne was being beaten in the ratings by ATV-10's Ten Eyewitness News. As of 2011, Seven has lost its ratings lead at 6 pm to 9 pm.|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{ideas in}} Michael Gove’s recent, much-publicised Brexit speech was that the UK could rely on {{membership}} of a European free trade zone. This idea constitutes <b>a</b> bizarre historical <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early years of Britain’s relationship with what was then called the European Economic Community, or Common Market. But the relevance of his attempt <b>to</b> dismiss <b>the</b> economic case for continued EU membership in a 21 st century context is highly questionable, writes Piers Ludlow...|$|R
5000|$|... "You" [...] was {{released}} as a 7" [...] Single in November 1980 in the UK as an edited version (3:55). The B-side contained the full album version of [...] "Pride". UK Cat No: CBS A1204. UK Jazz Funk and Soul DJs, led by Robbie Vincent and Chris Hill, flipped the single and preferred to play [...] "Pride" [...] on their radio shows and at clubs/venues. [...] "Pride" [...] {{was and is}} still considered the stronger track, being <b>a</b> retro <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth Wind & Fire sound associated with early hits such as [...] "Saturday Nite" [...] and [...] "Mighty Mighty". The 7" [...] version of [...] "You" [...] was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album {{with a number of}} other bonus tracks when the album was remastered and updated to CD in 2010.|$|R
2500|$|In his absence, 1969's 20/20 {{consisted}} substantially of key Smile outtakes ("Cabinessence" [...] and [...] "Our Prayer") {{along with}} the long-germinating [...] "Time <b>to</b> Get Alone". <b>The</b> album's lead track, the Wilson/Love-authored [...] "Do It Again", was <b>an</b> unabashed <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's earlier surf hits, and had been an international hit {{in the summer of}} 1968, reaching number 20 in the US charts and number 1 in the UK and Australia while also scoring well in other countries. During this phase, Wilson also collaborated with his father (credited under the pseudonym of Reggie Dunbar) on [...] "Break Away", the band's final single for Capitol Records under their original contract; although relatively unsuccessful in the US (peaking at number 63 in Billboard), the song reached number 6 on the British singles chart.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style that Dog Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just For The Fun Of It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, {{as part of the}} Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E
25|$|This updated and {{improved}} version was the Model B200, which entered production in 1981. It was fitted with PT6A-42 engines, still rated at , but with improvements {{that resulted in}} greater aircraft performance. Other changes included increased maximum pressurization (to 6.5 psi differential) and changes to the cockpit layout. The Model 200C {{gave way to the}} Model B200C the same year, with the first Model B200T and Model B200CT being modified from a B200 and B200C respectively, the following year. Commencing in 1984 the B200, B200C and their derivatives were fitted with a revised landing gear retraction mechanism, actuated by hydraulic rams powered by an electric pump installed in the LH wing. This replaced the earlier electro-mechanical retraction system of gearboxes, driveshafts and chains and sprockets that was <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Twin Bonanza. At the same time the propellers fitted were changed from 3-bladed Hartzells to 3-bladed McCauleys. Forty-seven B200Cs built that year were delivered to the U.S. military, with dozens more of a similar standard ordered in subsequent years, but not given official civil model designations.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{temperature}} control stainless steel fermentation tanks radically changed the wine industry in warm climate regions like Andalucia, La Mancha and the Levante, allowing winemakers to make fresher and fruitier styles of wine-particularly whites. While many producers focused on these crisp, fresh styles {{in the early}} 1990s there was a resurgence in more active use of barrel fermenting whites as <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional, more oxidized styles of the 19th century. The use of oak {{has a long tradition}} in Spanish winemaking, dating back even centuries before the French introduced the small 59gallon (225liter) barrica style barrels. Gradually Spanish winemakers in the late 19th and early 20th century started to develop a preference for the cheaper, and more strongly flavored, American oak. Winemakers in regions like the Rioja found that the Tempranillo grape, in particular, responded well to new American oak. In the 1990s, more winemakers started to rediscover the use of French oak and some wineries will use a combination of both as a blend. Most DOs require some minimum period of barrel ageing which will be stipulated on the wine label by the designations-Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva depending on how long it spends in the barrel. The tradition of long barrel and bottle ageing has meant that most Spanish wines are ready to drink once they hit the market. A new generation of winemakers have started to produce more vino joven (young wines) that are released with very little ageing.|$|E
50|$|The first {{incarnation}} of the band that would become The Nova Saints formed in Hereford in 2003 as Spencer, a modish garage band, albeit with a heavy shoegaze influence. The band was initially formed purely to provide a support act to a friend's band. The primary members were John Banks, Steve Waterhouse, Dom Gallagher and Tom Chillcott and <b>the</b> name was <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> band <b>the</b> four members played in as teenagers. In 2004 Spencer expanded their line-up by adding keyboardist Matt Goddard to augment their increasingly shoegaze influenced sound.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, {{after years}} of {{speculation}} and lack of business, Nathan's announced it was moving to a smaller location {{on the corner of}} Long Beach Road and Merle Avenue (near the former Chwatsky's). This move was greeted with controversy as many feared that the traffic from deliveries would interfere with <b>the</b> traffic headed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school during weekdays. Eventually, the Town of Hempstead approved this move and The original building was officially closed on January 4, 2015. The third Nathan's opened in early 2015, and was built as <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> first and second locations as well as having a contemporary feel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interior.In 2016, a massive blizzard slammed into the island and dumped nearly 2 feet of snow, and flooded many of the towns around it and some portions of <b>the</b> town closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> channel.|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{has one of}} {{the highest}} rates of {{unemployment}} in the world. Job creation is a national priority, yet labor-intensive options are derided by the trade union movement as <b>an</b> unacceptable <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> “cheap labor” policies of apartheid, and effectively ruled out by the government in its recent National Development Plan (NDP). Instead, minimum-wage setting in South Africa continues to contribute to job destruction (as evidenced most recently in the clothing industry). Policy-makers hope that support for high-productivity firms and rapid economic growth will make up for job losses and solve the unemployment problem. Unfortunately, South Africa’s economic performance has been comparatively disappointing and constrained by negative investor sentiment, especially with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> labor market. The NDP has called for a social accord between labor and capital. But the prospects are not promising, and unemployment is likely to remain a significant feature of the South African economic landscape...|$|R
500|$|Other {{writers were}} less enthusiastic. [...] Q {{magazine}} {{felt that the}} song was weak and that [...] "Bono falls back on his old habit of trying to be 'inspirational' by banging up the heat from simmer to meltdown between the verse and chorus." [...] U2 chroniclers Bill Graham and Caroline van Oosten de Boer also see the song as <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> group's earlier sound, but say that [...] "the band doesn't sufficiently develop the initial idea to warrant the five minutes of 'Ultra Violet'".|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?", <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rock {{music of the}} 1950s to late 1960s. The lyrics name several famous musicians of this era, {{including}} Jerry Lee Lewis, John Lennon, and T. Rex, and also cite The Ed Sullivan Show. Many instruments that were previously rarely—if ever—used in punk rock were featured in the song's score, including the saxophone and electronic organ. The lyrics, written by Dee Dee, depict his childhood in Germany where he would secretly listen to rock radio stations at night.|$|E

2500|$|... "Teenage Dream" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Katy Perry. It was {{released}} as the second single from her third studio album {{of the same name}} on July 23, 2010. Perry and Bonnie McKee wrote many songs with youthful themes in mind, but they were rejected by producers Benny Blanco and Dr. Luke. Blanco showed them The Teenagers' single [...] "Homecoming", and McKee imagined [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> song <b>to</b> <b>the</b> euphoric feelings of being in love as a teenager. They met with Max Martin in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California and started writing the track at Playback Recording Studio, which Perry later described as a pure moment for her. After Perry recorded her vocals, McKee presented her idea and the chorus was rewritten. Perry also described the song as reminiscent of her youth while contemplating her future marriage to Russell Brand.|$|R
500|$|The song's {{production}} is primarily centered around hi-NRG beats, [...] "stuttering synthesizers", and hard snares. Robbie Daw of Idolator {{noted that the}} [...] "opening, pulsating synths are <b>a</b> straight-up <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 'Poker Face' intro— albeit slightly sped up— while the handclap-laden chorus swells and soars with the same pop frenzy that made 'Paparazzi' such a delight." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described the song's composition as [...] "brilliantly camp– all squelchy synths and juddering beats" [...] and likened it to a [...] "ridiculous glam-rock song given a techno makeover". The chorus has been noted to contain [...] "a solid mixture of EDM-influenced pop, glitchy k-pop-lite euphoria and just a twinkle of that original joy of The Fame" [...] and features Gaga singing the lines, [...] "Give me the thing that I love (I'll turn the lights on) / Put your hands up make 'em touch (Make it real loud)". Her vocal acrobatics during the song's verses have been compared to those of David Bowie, Annie Lennox, and Grace Jones.|$|R
