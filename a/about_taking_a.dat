500|$|After World War II, Koval was {{discharged}} from the Army. He returned to New York and CCNY, where he received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering on February 1, 1948. Telling his friends he was thinking <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> trip to Poland or Israel, Koval secured a passport for six months' travel to Europe. According to the Russian publication Rossiyskaya Gazeta, he might have left because American counter-intelligence agents had discovered Soviet literature about his parents after being tipped off about the leak by a Soviet defector. He left by sea in October 1948 and never returned to his birth country. In Russia, he left the Soviet military with discharge papers as an untrained rifleman and the rank of private. His foreign background and service record made him [...] "a very suspicious character", he wrote to Kramish. Turned down for education and research positions, Koval turned to his old GRU contact, who secured him {{a job as a}} laboratory assistant at the Mendeleev Institute. Eventually, Koval managed to obtain a teaching job there; his students often laughed at his foreign pronunciations for technical terms.|$|E

In answer to prosecutor's questions she stated that [...] the documents in her bag on terror plans and weapons had been given to her, and that she did not know that the boy who was with her in Ghazni was her son.

When counterparty risk is not observable, I show that central clearing leads to higher collateral requirements for two different reasons. Without collusion <b>about</b> risk <b>taking,</b> <b>a</b> CCP offering diversification of risk cannot selectively forgo incentives for transactions that use collateral only for insurance. With collusion <b>about</b> risk <b>taking,</b> <b>a</b> CCP needs to charge collateral in line with the worst counterparty quality to control risk taking.

I knew my folk music would take off, if I put hip-hop beats behind it." [...] He had also perceived similarities between Delta blues and hip hop, which helped to inspire the song. The A.V. Club's Annie Zaleski opines that the song imitates abstract hip hop, while James Reed from The Boston Globe called it an alternative rock anthem, and Veronica Chambers for Vibe magazine described the song as a [...] "folk-based hip hop song." [...] "Loser" [...] revolves around several recurring musical elements: a slide guitar riff, Stephenson's sitar, the bassline, and a tremolo guitar part. The song's drum track is sampled from a Johnny Jenkins cover of Dr. John's [...] "I Walk on Gilded Splinters" [...] from the 1970 album Ton-Ton Macoute!. During the song's break, there is a sample of a line of dialogue from the 1994 Steve Hanft-directed film Kill the Moonlight, which goes [...] "I’m a driver/I’m a winner/Things are gonna change, I can feel it". Hanft and Beck were friends, and Hanft would go on to direct several music videos for Beck, including the video for [...] "Loser".|$|E

It was an extremely difficult decision to make but I felt this was the best time to go. I've had alternative job offers in the past, but I've always stuck with EastEnders.

[...] At the time, a BBC spokesperson would not confirm the departure saying, [...] "Gilly is in discussions <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> possible break.

She was completely against it through the entire process due to previous bad experiences working with Dr. Luke, stating he's difficult to work with, demeaning and a liar, thus [...] "making the artist look bad". Clarkson eventually gave in claiming the label wouldn't put out her record otherwise. Yet, she was unsatisfied with the original version of the song, which she says differed greatly from the final version and included lyrical references to marijuana, so the writers assisted her in making the song more personal to her and [...] "better than it was," [...] according to Clarkson. After the song was finalized and significant changes to the lyrics had been made, Clarkson said RCA approached her <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> proper writing credit for the track, which she refused {{in order to make}} a point to the label as they failed to meet her one request which was not to have her work with Luke again.|$|E
