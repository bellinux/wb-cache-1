5|$|This type {{of small}} white terrier {{dates back to}} the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795. In 1819 he {{purchased}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> and tan terrier bitch named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford. She formed the basis for his breeding programme, and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of Fox Terrier.|$|E
5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E

5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, {{not even in the}} presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> cloth to the top of the wig, representing the coif.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the house}} sparrow is mostly {{different}} shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts. The male has a dark grey crown {{from the top of}} its bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores). It has <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes {{at the base of the}} head. The upper back and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while the lower back, rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} two men street dancing in a white hall, with {{speakers}} and chairs scattered around. Shots of an audience lead to Roberts walking to a microphone positioned on a stage before she starts lip-synching, wearing a 1970s style outfit. After knocking over the microphone stand, Roberts performs a routine with three female back-up dancers in front of multiple speakers. During the chorus, she dances with the same three dancers, whilst shots of men watching them are shown. Roberts then leads the three women through the hall before they perform a dance section in {{the bridge of the}} track. Three men marching in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> room are shown, leading to a shot of Roberts marching alongside a marching band of drummers. She is then shown in a multi-coloured sweater-dress, stood atop a speaker and surrounded by dancers. Final shots show Roberts producing shapes of letters L, O, V, and E with cheerleaders. The video ends with Roberts casually interacting with her dancers.|$|E

5|$|The modern Labrador's {{ancestors}} originated on {{the island}} of Newfoundland, now part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The founding breed of the Labrador was the St. John's water dog, a breed that emerged through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century. The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known but were likely a random-bred mix of English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The Newfoundland (known then as the Greater Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog breeding with mastiffs brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th century. The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was used for retrieval and pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of the Labrador Retriever. The white chest, feet, chin, and muzzle - known as tuxedo markings - characteristic of the St. John's Dog often appear in modern Lab mixes, and will occasionally manifest in Labradors as <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> spot on the chest (known as a medallion) or stray white hairs on the feet or muzzle.|$|E

A total of 18 people ignored her, some {{going so far as to}} walk around the blood. The girl was left for seven minutes before a recycler, Chen Xianmei, picked up the toddler and called for help. The child died eight days later.|$|E

50|$|Females of both P. a. aegeus and P. a. ormenus {{have three}} forms; regular, pale and dark. The pale form has yellow {{spots on the}} hindwings, {{compared}} to the usual red spots. The forewings are almost completely white. The front wings of the dark form are almost completely black and the hindwings have <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>white</b> patch.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are grey, mottled {{with dark}} brown spots and with <b>a</b> few <b>small</b> <b>white</b> spots. An irregular white fascia, angulated {{in the middle}} towards the apex, crosses the wing {{at the beginning of}} the ciliae. The apex is dark brown, with <b>a</b> row of <b>small</b> <b>white</b> spots around the base of the ciliae, which themselves are pale luteous, dusted with dark brown. The hindwings pale fuscous.|$|R
25|$|Mantle (in some {{countries}} {{referred to as}} Bostons due to the similar coloration and pattern as a Boston Terrier): The colour is black and white with a solid black blanket extending over the body; black skull with white muzzle; white blaze is optional; whole white collar preferred; a white chest; white on part or whole of forelegs and hind legs; white tipped black tail. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> marking in the black blanket is acceptable, as is {{a break in the}} white collar.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{have long}} pink legs {{and a long}} thin black bill. They are white below and have black wings and backs. The tail is white with some grey banding. A {{continuous}} area of black extends from the back along the hindneck to the head. There, it forms a cap covering the entire head from the top to just below eye-level, {{with the exception of}} the areas surrounding the bill and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> spot above the eye. Males have a greenish gloss to the back and wings, particularly in the breeding season. This is less pronounced or absent in females, which have a brown tinge to these areas instead. Otherwise, the sexes look alike.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} Larson {{shooting}} Minogue in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> room. After the shoot, {{she leaves the}} studio, wearing the leather jacket with a red heart featured on the single's artwork, and starts singing the song. She then walks through various London back-alleys, bumping into a man carrying a boombox, and taking a phone off a café table—showcasing a camera angle inspired by Instagram—, and arrives at a nightclub. Dancing there, she leaves the nightclub and continues walking down Old Compton Street, Soho. The street scenes are interspersed with distorted shots of Minogue dancing in a brightly lit, white room. Minogue then climbs into {{a car with a}} male driver, and the pair travel through London, along busy streets, where Minogue greets one of her fans in a nearby car.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with the Mckay’s bunting (Plectrophenax hyperboreus) due to the similar colouration of their plumage. Even more, the challenge of identification becomes harder when this two species hybridize in the boundaries of their territories. Another similar species is the horned lark, although it has a larger black tail and it has <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>white</b> patch on the wings.|$|R

25|$|The cathedral {{has had a}} {{properly}} constituted, surpliced choir since 1854, {{when it was first}} endowed with £1,000 by John Hardman. Hardman was for many years cantor of the choir, and is commemorated by <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> figure of him in the lower left-hand corner of a stained glass window of 1868 located in the north aisle and depicting the Immaculate Conception, with a line of plainchant along the bottom, being the Introit for the feast of the Immaculate Conception. Currently, the four-part, robed choir comprises around adult men and women who lead the worship at the Sunday Solemn Mass (at 11:00 am). They also lead the worship during Holy Week and Easter, when the Archbishop presides. The choir specialises in the Latin polyphonic music of the renaissance, but sings a wide repertory of Masses and motets in English and Latin. The choir sings occasional concerts and has featured in television and radio broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|When {{ceremonial}} {{or religious}} items are made, {{all aspects of}} the making from materials to colors to designs are important as they are identified with particular gods and meanings. Mesquite and the color reddish brown belong to Tatewari, who is of the earth and the wood of the Brazil tree is related to Tayuapa or “Father Sun.” Symbols such as the golden eagle and macaws are related to Tatewari. Shapes such as the deer, coyote, pine tree or whirlwind can be associated with Tamat’s Kauyumari, who shaped the world. The salate tree, the armadillo and the bear are associated with Takutzi Nakahue, the mother of all gods and of corn. The toto is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>white</b> flower with five petals associated with the rainy season. Sashes and belts often have designs that mimic the markings on the backs of snakes, which are also associated with rain, along with good crops, health and long life. The zigzag lines that emanate from all living things represent communication with the deities. The butterfly motif is reminiscent of the Itzpapolotl or Obsidian Butterfly, a principal deity of the classical Aztecs.|$|E
