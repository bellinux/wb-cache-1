We keep hearing {{intelligence}} assessments that {{he is about to}} go down. In my opinion, the current situation is the best one for us. Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with whom do you talk and who do you hold accountable?" [...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought that it might be the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [...] might not just survive but even regain territories." [...] The statement was met with a cool reception by the foreign and defense ministries.|$|E

"Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have.

My heart calls me to you, it is true, day and night it calls, how loudly I will not tell; yet I would not yield myself to that alone. But Egypt calls me also, since I have been shown in a dream while I watched in the sanctuary, that you are the only man who can free her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> dream came from on high.

"The {{testimony}} of the Duke of Berwick, and of the other honourable and well-known Irish gentlemen, as to the striking likeness between yourself and Mr. James O'Carroll, cannot but carry immense weight {{in the minds of}} all unprejudiced persons. They prove too, conclusively, that James O'Carroll left an infant boy behind him, and the statement of the nurse goes a long way to prove you are that son; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is substantiated by the conduct of John O'Carroll; first in receiving you and undertaking your care; secondly, in the neglect, and I should almost say the dislike, he manifested towards the child he had sheltered; and thirdly, in the extraordinary step that he, a professedly loyal subject of Her Majesty, took in sending you off to enlist in the brigade composed of the devoted adherents of the son of James the Second.|$|E

6000|$|Sometimes {{it seems}} to me that this love, which I feel is eternal, [...] Must have begun with my life, and that only an absence was ended [...] When we met and knew in our souls that we loved one another. [...] For from the first was no doubt. The {{earliest}} hints of the passion, [...] Whispered to girlhood's tremulous dream, may be mixed with [...] misgiving, [...] But, when the very love comes, it bears no vagueness of meaning; [...] Touched by its truth (too fine to be felt by the ignorant senses, [...] Knowing but looks and utterance) soul unto soul makes confession, [...] Silence to silence speaks. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> subtile assurance, [...] Yet unconfirmed from without, is even sweeter and dearer [...] Than the perfected bliss that comes when the words have been [...] spoken. [...] --Not that I'd have them unsaid, now! But 't was delicious to [...] ponder [...] All the miracle over, and clasp it, and keep it, and hide it,-- [...] While I beheld him, you know, with looks of indifferent languor, [...] Talking of other things, and felt the divine contradiction [...] Trouble my heart below! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 619. All the {{phenomena}} connected with this subject press upon my mind {{the conviction that}} the effects in question are entirely incidental and of a secondary nature; that they are dependent upon the natural conditions of gaseous elasticity, combined with the exertion of that attractive force possessed by many bodies, especially those which are solid, in an eminent degree, and probably belonging to all; by which they are drawn into association more or less close, without at the same time undergoing chemical combination, though often assuming the condition of adhesion; and which occasionally leads, under very favourable circumstances, as in the present instance, to the combination of bodies simultaneously subjected to this attraction. I am prepared myself to admit (and probably many others are of the same opinion), both with respect to the attraction of aggregation and of chemical affinity, that the sphere of action of particles extends beyond those other particles with which they are immediately and evidently in union (523.), and in many cases produces effects rising into considerable importance: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> kind of attraction is a determining cause of Döbereiner's effect, and of the many others of a similar nature.|$|E
60|$|One {{is sure to}} {{be struck}} by the liberal way in which Australasia spends money upon public works--such as {{legislative}} buildings, town halls, hospitals, asylums, parks, and botanical gardens. I should say that where minor towns in America spend a hundred dollars on the town hall and on public parks and gardens, the like towns in Australasia spend a thousand. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> ratio will hold good in the matter of hospitals, also. I have seen a costly and well-equipped, and architecturally handsome hospital in an Australian village of fifteen hundred inhabitants. It was built by private funds furnished by the villagers and the neighboring planters, and its running expenses were drawn from the same sources. I suppose {{it would be hard to}} match this in any country. This village was about to close a contract for lighting its streets with the electric light, when I was there. That is ahead of London. London is still obscured by gas--gas pretty widely scattered, too, in some of the districts; so widely indeed, that except on moonlight nights it is difficult to find the gas lamps.|$|E

60|$|As to {{any attempt}} at {{invasion}} of Canada by the Americans, or idea of punishing the alleged injuries {{suffered by the}} States from Great Britain by the annexation of those provinces, I {{do not believe that}} any sane-minded citizens of the States believe in the possibility of such retaliation. Some years since the Americans thought that Canada might shine in the Union firmament as a new star; but that delusion is, I think, over. Such annexation, if ever made, must have been made not only against the arms of England, but must also have been made in accordance with the wishes of the people so annexed. It was then believed that the Canadians were not averse to such a change, and there may possibly have then been among them the remnant of such a wish. There is certainly no such desire now, not even a remnant of such a desire; and the truth on this matter is, I think, generally acknowledged. The feeling in Canada is one of strong aversion to the United States government and of predilection for self-government under the English Crown. A faineant governor and the prestige of British power is now the political aspiration of the Canadians in general; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is understood in the States. Moreover, the States have a job of work on hand which, as they themselves are well aware, is taxing all their energies. Such being the case, I do not think that England needs to fear any invasion of Canada authorized by the States government.|$|E

The printer had not {{received}} my letter, and so he brought up dozens apiece of the Prophecy; but I ordered him to part with no more. 'Tis an admirable good one, and people are mad for it. The frost still continues violently cold. Mrs. Masham invited me to come to-night and play at cards; but our Society did not part till nine. But I supped with Mrs. Hill, her sister, and there was Mrs. Masham and Lord Treasurer, and we stayed till twelve. He is endeavouring to get a majority against next Wednesday, when the House of Lords is to meet, and the Whigs intend to make some violent addresses against a peace, if not prevented. God knows {{what will become of}} us.--It is still prodigiously cold; but so I told you already. We have eggs on the spit, I wish they may not be addled. When I came home tonight I found, forsooth, a letter from MD, N.24, 24, 24, 24; there, do you know the numbers now? {{and at the same time}} one from Joe,(13) full of thanks: let him know I have received it, and am glad of his success, but won't put him to the charge of a letter. I had a letter some time ago from Mr. Warburton,(14) and I beg one of you will copy out what I shall tell you, and send it by some opportunity to Warburton. 'Tis as follows: The Doctor has received Mr. Warburton's letter, and desires he will let the Doctor know where(15) that accident he mentions is like soon to happen, and he will do what he can in it.--And pray, madam, let them know that I do this to save myself the trouble, and them the expense of a letter. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is enough for one that comes home at twelve from a Lord Treasurer and Mrs. Masham. Oh, I could tell you ten thousand things of our mad politics, upon what small circumstances great affairs have turned. But I will go rest my busy head.|$|E

[...] She also indicated a belief that the league is likely to change to conventional uniforms in the future: [...] "You look back at basketball, you used to have to wear skirts.
