25|$|While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be {{shielded}} from ambient light {{to prevent their}} destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. Another option is to add overcurrent protection in the external circuit, {{so that when the}} measured <b>anode</b> <b>current</b> exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Although {{thermionic}} emission was originally reported in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie, it was Thomas Edison's apparently independent {{discovery of the}} phenomenon in 1883 that became well known. Although Edison {{was aware of the}} unidirectional property of current flow between the filament and the anode, his interest (and patent) concentrated on the sensitivity of the <b>anode</b> <b>current</b> to the current through the filament (and thus filament temperature). Little practical use was ever made of this property (however early radios often implemented volume controls through varying the filament current of amplifying tubes). It was only years later that John Ambrose Fleming utilized the rectifying property of the diode tube to detect (demodulate) radio signals, a substantial improvement on the early cat's-whisker detector already used for rectification.|$|E

2500|$|Franck and Hertz's {{original}} paper reported <b>anode</b> <b>currents</b> up {{to about}} 15 V, as {{illustrated in the figure}} above. Additional maxima and minima occur when current is measured to higher voltages. This paper notes that the spacing between the minima and maxima isn't exactly 4.9 V, but increases for higher voltages and varies with temperature, and provides a model for this effect.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{conventional}} thyristor, {{once it has}} been switched on by the gate terminal, the device remains latched in the on-state (i.e. does not need a continuous supply of gate current {{to remain in the}} on state), providing the <b>anode</b> <b>current</b> has exceeded the latching current (IL). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the <b>anode</b> <b>current</b> falls below the holding current (IH). In normal working condition the latching current is always greater than holding current. In the above figure IL [...] has to come above the IH on y-axis since IL>IH.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} vacuum tube, the diode, {{contains only}} a heater, a heated electron-emitting cathode (the filament itself [...] {{acts as the}} cathode in some diodes), and a plate (<b>anode).</b> <b>Current</b> can only flow in one direction through the device between the two electrodes, as electrons emitted by the cathode travel through the tube and are collected by the anode. Adding one or more control grids within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode {{to be controlled by}} the voltage on the grid or grids.|$|E
2500|$|One {{reliability}} {{problem of}} tubes with oxide cathodes {{is the possibility}} that the cathode may slowly become [...] "poisoned" [...] by gas molecules from other elements in the tube, which reduce its ability to emit electrons. Trapped gases or slow gas leaks can also damage the cathode or cause plate (<b>anode)</b> <b>current</b> runaway due to ionization of free gas molecules. Vacuum hardness and proper selection of construction materials are the major influences on tube lifetime. Depending on the material, temperature and construction, the surface material of the cathode may also diffuse onto other elements. The resistive heaters that heat the cathodes may break {{in a manner similar to}} incandescent lamp filaments, but rarely do, since they operate at much lower temperatures than lamps.|$|E

30|$|Both the {{corrosion}} potential distribution {{and the current}} density distribution around pipeline 2 change significantly {{with an increase in}} the <b>anode</b> output <b>current.</b> When the <b>anode</b> output <b>current</b> increases, a large current flows into the lower end (− 800  m) of pipeline 2 (consistent with Fig.  12 b) and the potential decreases gradually. Because a large current flows into the lower end of pipeline 2, a large current will flow out of pipeline 2 from the intersection. The potential will increase and become greater than the self-potential, and the DC interference becomes more severe. Interestingly despite the increase in the <b>anode</b> output <b>current,</b> both the potential distribution and the current density distribution for the upper end (800  m) of pipeline 2 remain unchanged.|$|R
40|$|The {{versatility}} of {{gold for}} electrode manufacture {{suggests that it}} could be an ideal material for some microbial fuel cell applications. However, previous studies have suggested that microorganisms that readily transfer electrons to graphite do not transfer electrons to gold. Investigations with Geobacter sulfurreducens demonstrated that it could grow on gold <b>anodes</b> producing <b>current</b> nearly as effectively as with graphite <b>anodes.</b> <b>Current</b> production was associated with the development of G. sulfurreducens biofilms up to 40 microm thick. No current was produced if pilA, the gene for the structural protein of the conductive pili of G. sulfurreducens, was deleted. The finding that gold is a suitable anode material for microbial fuel cells offers expanded possibilities for the construction of microbial fuel cells and the electrochemical analysis of microbe-electrode interactions...|$|R

An SiD scintillator based muon system prototype has 256 strips and was constructed from extruded strips, WLS fibers, clear fibers, and multianode photo multiplier tubes (MAPMT) Hamamatsu H 7546 B. Six MAPMTs were used. As {{a first step}} to understand strip output, the response of every anode to a given brightness of light and applied voltage must be measured. For the test, a custom made light source was used. Each MAPMT output was measured independently. The <b>anode</b> <b>currents</b> were measured at constant (green) input light brightness and the same photocathode to anode voltage (800 V). The <b>anode</b> <b>currents</b> have a wide spread; for all tubes the maximum value is 5. 23 {{times larger than the}} minimum value. The MAPMT cross talk was measured for one of the central inputs. The maximum cross talk value is about 4. 9 %. The average cross talk for the nearest four neighboring channels is 3. 9 %, for the farthest four is 1 %. To assure the reproducibility and repeatability of the measurements, the double reference method was used...|$|R

30|$|Upon {{increasing}} {{either the}} <b>anode</b> output <b>current</b> or the soil resistivity, the corrosion {{potential of the}} DC-interfered pipeline becomes very uneven. The corrosion potential of the pipeline near the intersection has a large positive offset, and pipeline corrosion becomes worse. However, the corrosion potential and the current density distribution {{at the far end}} (800  m) of pipeline 2 remain unchanged after increasing the <b>anode</b> output <b>current.</b> Change in resistivity just changes the degree of corrosion of the affected section but does not change the location and length of the affected pipe sections.|$|R

The observed substrate bias current for different operating parameters is not found to be normal. The behaviour is explained on the bias of ionisation at the respective electrodes.

Although this circuit was designed specifically for monitoring photomultiplier currents in a ground-based very high energy gamma-ray telescope, it would be useful in many other applications where cost is a consideration. An interesting consequence of this technique is that, by measuring the pulse-to-pulse time interval, it is possible to synthesize the kind of measurements usually performed with lock-in amplifiers. Tests show that with a few seconds integration time, a 1 kHz modulated signal can be detected at a level of 10 - 5 of the ambient current...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} whether the finite element (FE) or the finite difference (FD) method is better suited for the simulation of semiconductor devices, may loose its importance if one realizes that the most successful FE approaches can be described by FD formulas. A unique and simple formulation is presented that covers combined rectangular and triangular grids. The successive line overrelaxation method (SLOR) has been adapted to the irregular matrix structure that results from a FE like mesh. The method {{was found to be}} very interesting, because it is economic in both CPU time and memory requirements. The numerical approaches are applied to the static analysis of a gate controlled power rectifier in the on-state. The device behaviour is essentially two-dimensional and, for the considered <b>anode</b> <b>currents,</b> it is very sensitive to the gate bias and current. Anglai...|$|R
