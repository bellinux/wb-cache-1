In 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced the Gallions Reach Crossing, a replacement ferry service running further east from Beckton to Thamesmead expected to open in 2017. The option of a bridge is still popular, with an alternative option of a tunnel in the area.

If the pair do not breed, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> further wild sightings, the species can be considered functionally extinct in Malaysia. In Indonesia, meanwhile, a seventh rhino increased the group at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, in Way Kambas NP. A female was born on 12 May 2016.|$|E
5|$|State Route 125 (SR 125) is a {{state highway}} in the US state of California. As a freeway, it runs from Otay Mesa Road (former SR 905) in Otay Mesa near the U.S.–Mexico border to SR 52 in Santee. SR 125 serves as an {{additional}} north–south route in the San Diego metropolitan area, also connecting SR 54, SR 94, and Interstate 8 (I-8).

5|$|The Martinique macaw {{is one of}} {{thirteen}} extinct macaw species that have been proposed to {{have lived in the}} Caribbean islands. Many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> extant endemic macaws on the islands today. Macaws were frequently transported between the Caribbean islands and the South American mainland in both prehistoric and historic times, so {{it is impossible to know}} whether contemporaneous reports refer to imported or native species.|$|E

5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> infinitesimals.|$|E
5|$|The two {{then follow}} a small {{path through the}} woods until they come to {{a house with a}} stake fence around it. The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|TypeIa supernovae {{are thought}} to be {{potentially}} the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi (see below). Recent estimates predict that a TypeII supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs (26light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone layer, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> such candidates closer than about 500 light years.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} {{would have no}} {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and {{it was hoped that}} players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> right or wrong choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E

Both Chew Valley Lake and Blagdon Lake provide extensive fishing under permit from Bristol Water. The River Chew and most of its tributaries also have fishing but this is generally under licences to local angling clubs. Chew Valley Sailing Club is situated on Chew Valley Lake and provides dinghy sailing at all levels and hosts national and international competitions.

5|$|According to {{contemporary}} descriptions, {{the body of}} the Lesser Antillean macaw was red and the wings were red, blue and yellow. The tail feathers were between 38 and 51cm (15 and 20 in) long. Apart from the smaller size and the all-red coloration of the tail feathers, it resembled the scarlet macaw and may therefore have been a close relative of that species. The bird ate fruitincluding the poisonous manchineel, was monogamous, nested in trees and laid two eggs once or twice a year. Early writers described it as being abundant in Guadeloupe, but it was becoming rare by 1760, and only survived in uninhabited areas. Disease and hunting by humans are thought to have eradicated it shortly afterwards. The Lesser Antillean macaw is one of 13 extinct macaw species that have been proposed to have lived in the Caribbean islands. Many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> extant endemic macaws on the islands today.|$|E
