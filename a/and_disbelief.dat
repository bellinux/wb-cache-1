5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and {{some argue that}} the opposite {{seems to be the}} case. A study published by the author and illustrator Gregory S.

The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E

25|$|The Lancet {{surveys are}} said to be {{controversial}} because the mortality figures are higher than in several other reports, including those of the Iraqi Health Ministry and the United Nations, as well as other household surveys such as the Iraq Living Conditions Survey and the Iraq Family Health Survey. The 2007 ORB survey of Iraq War casualties estimated more deaths than the Lancet, though it covered a longer period of the conflict. The Lancet surveys have triggered criticism <b>and</b> <b>disbelief</b> from some journalists, governments, the Iraq Body Count project, some epidemiologists and statisticians and others, but have also been supported by some journalists, governments, epidemiologists and statisticians.|$|E

Another night, when I was {{with him in his}} own lodging, more than one turned up to talk over their beliefs <b>and</b> <b>disbeliefs,</b> <b>and</b> sun them as it were in the subtle light of his mind.

25|$|Southern's {{failure was}} met with anger <b>and</b> <b>disbelief</b> by its board of directors. Although the IBA gave its {{standard}} reason for these decisions, that the competitor offered a better mix of programmes and greater investment, it was believed the station's non-local ownership may have swayed the balance against it. Another factor {{may have been the}} company's very conservative (and possibly dull) nature and that, with a new decade just dawned, the south of England would be a radically different area; it was felt that Southern Television's application was, understandably, more of the same tried and tested formula, which in time would not have reflected the possibilities for the area. Yet another possible factor was the incumbent's complacency: its original application was a mere 16-pages long. Tactfully the IBA invited Southern Television to re-submit, this time asking the company to go into more depth with its plans.|$|E

This all sounds clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! {{is not as}} much fun as it should be. Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul is not in the humor". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said [...] "Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's jolting sight gags (I may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended." ...|$|E

He disappeared on a solo mission the same day. It was later learned {{that he had been}} killed over Liévin during combat with three Fokker Triplanes from Jagdstaffel 14, probably by its commander, Leutnant Johannes Werner. There are several theories as to how he died. The common elements are that he was on patrol near the front line when he pounced on a German plane flying at a lower level, that there might have been another unknown British pilot in trouble, and that the Germans who shot Dallas down had dived from a still higher altitude. Medics near his crash site at Absalom Trench ventured into no man's land and retrieved his body, while a patrol of eight volunteers salvaged his personal effects from the fallen aircraft.

She drove with two women passengers in Ar Rass and was detained by traffic {{police in the}} presence of the CPVPV. She was released after signing a statement that she would not drive again. In reaction to al-Sharif's arrest, several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days. On 26 May, authorities said that al-Sharif would remain in detention until 5 June 2011, according to Waleed Abu Al-Khair. Al-Sharif was conditionally freed on 30 May. Her lawyer Adnan al-Saleh said that she had been charged with [...] "inciting women to drive" [...] and [...] "rallying public opinion". The conditions of Al-Sharif's release include bail, returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media. As possible reasons for al-Sharif's early release, The National cited al-Sharif having written a letter to King Abdullah, 4,500 Saudis signing an online petition to the King, and [...] "an outpouring of indignation <b>and</b> <b>disbelief</b> by both Saudis and critics abroad that Ms al-Sharif was jailed for something that is not a moral or criminal offence." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{a week of}} {{denunciation}} in China's English-language media, {{with most}} journals silent about the award except for perfunctory quotes from the foreign ministry, the country's Chinese-language media launched a concerted assault on Liu and the award, accompanied by renewed attacks in the English-language media. Xinhua argued on 17 October that the Communist Party had made [...] "unremitting efforts to promote and safeguard human rights", and questioned how Liu's actions had contributed to human rights progress for the Chinese people. The agency cited a journal from Saudi Arabia, and one from Russia, that had denounced the award; it quoted the Pakistani Foreign Office as saying, [...] "the politicization of the Nobel Peace Prize {{for the purposes of}} interference in the domestic affairs of states is not only contrary to the recognized principles of inter-State conduct, but also a negation of the underlying spirit conceived by the founder of the Prize." [...] In what was described by Chinese media–watchers as a surprise because of its historical professionalism, China Youth Daily published an article containing Beijing students' expressions of anger <b>and</b> <b>disbelief</b> over the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu. The journal employed the traditional hard-liner phrase [...] "people with ulterior motives" [...] (别有用心的人)—directed to at least one student.
