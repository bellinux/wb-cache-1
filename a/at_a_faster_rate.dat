5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> of speed.|$|E

5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa on September 3. It quickly developed an area of deep convection with a well-defined circulation, which prompted it being classified a tropical depression on September4. At the time it was situated hundreds of miles south of Cape Verde at a very low latitude of 7.2°N. Initial intensification was slow as the system moved northwestward, a movement caused by a large mid-level trough over the central Atlantic. On September5 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isidore. Subsequently, it intensified <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate,</b> becoming a hurricane on September6. The following day, satellite estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested a peak intensity of 100mph (165km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg).|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine (RSMC Nadi designation: 12F, JTWC designation: 10P) was a {{powerful}} and long-lived annular tropical cyclone that affected several countries, particularly Vanuatu and Tonga, over a 16-day span in February 2012. The system was the second cyclone and the only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively quiet 2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Jasmine developed from an area of disturbed weather on 1February in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Initially, the storm moved towards the east and across the Cape York Peninsula. As it moved across the South Pacific, earlier existing wind shear conditions lessened, and Jasmine began to strengthen <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate.</b> Steadily intensifying, Jasmine reached peak intensity on 8February as a Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, while beginning to show annular characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Clara, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Rubing, left {{flooding}} in the northern Philippines and southern China during September1981. An area of disturbed weather was first detected on September11 near Ponape. After moving westward, the system gradually became better organized and thunderstorm activity increased. On September16, the system attained tropical storm status. Two days later, Clara attained typhoon intensity and subsequently began to deepen <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate.</b> On September19, Clara reached maximum intensity, before making landfall along {{the northern tip of}} Luzon. Clara steadily weakened after interacting with land, but by late on September20, Clara leveled off in intensity over the South China Sea. The next day, Clara moved ashore to the east-northeast of Hong Kong while still at typhoon intensity before rapidly dissipating over land.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis {{inherited}} his father's estate. He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop the coastal area {{on the east side}} of the stream. Bournemouth's first hotel, later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel, opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing. Bournemouth started to grow <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton. Despite enormous investment, the town's share of the market remained modest. In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay. Granville was the author of The Spas of England, which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of the book, and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E

5|$|Simulations suggest that, {{while the}} disk had a {{relatively}} high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tenths of a percent) {{of the mass of}} Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it. However, the disk mass of only 2% that of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites. Thus there may have been several generations of Galilean-mass satellites in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter, due to drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula. By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned out {{to the point that it}} no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits. The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> than Europa or Io.|$|E
5|$|This {{impacted}} amphibians {{in particular}} {{in a number of}} ways. The enormous drop in sealevel due to greater quantities of the world's water being locked into glaciers profoundly affected the distribution and size of the semiaquatic ecosystems which amphibians favored, and the significant cooling of the climate further narrowed the amount of new territory favorable to amphibians. Given that among the hallmarks of amphibians are an obligatory return to a body of water to lay eggs, a delicate skin prone to desiccation (thereby often requiring the amphibian to be relatively close to water throughout its life), and a reputation of being a bellwether species for disrupted ecosystems due to the resulting low resilience to ecological change, amphibians were particularly devastated, with the Labyrinthodonts among the groups faring worst. In contrast, reptiles - whose amniotic eggs have a membrane that enables gas exchange out of water, and which thereby can be laid on land - were better adapted to the new conditions. Reptiles invaded new niches <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> and began diversifying their diets, becoming herbivorous and carnivorous, rather than feeding exclusively on insects and fish. Meanwhile, the severely impacted amphibians simply could not out-compete reptiles in mastering the new ecological niches, and so were obligated to pass the tetrapod evolutionary torch to the increasingly successful and swiftly radiating reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E
