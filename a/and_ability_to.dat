5|$|Æthelric was consecrated {{bishop in}} 1058 by Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Æthelric was consecrated by Stigand, {{unlike most of}} the English bishops of the time period, because at that point, Stigand held a valid pallium, or symbol of an archbishop's {{authority}} <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> consecrate bishops.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} robot {{inspired by}} the forelegs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects.

5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was confident {{in his ability to}} perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E
5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine pre-service teachers' beliefs, dispositions, <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> {{integrate}} social justice into the mathematics classroom during a one-semester mathematics methods course at a small, liberal arts university in the Midwest. The study examined their initial beliefs, attitudes, <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> before engaging in a semester-long study of mathematics taught through a critical, social justice lens. Through purposeful modeling of social justice in the mathematics classroom, the study then gauged participants beliefs, dispositions, <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> integrate social justice concepts into the elementary mathematics curriculum...|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized for not having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform well in big games.|$|E
5|$|Earl Christian Campbell (born March 29, 1955) is {{a former}} American {{football}} running back who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the Houston Oilers and New Orleans Saints.

5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} more {{vulnerable}} to predation than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which spend {{much of the time}} lying down in cover. Since the presence of a mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> defend themselves even from lions.|$|E

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its use in folk medicine, P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; {{they can also be}} crushed to yield a blue colorant that can be employed in cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years at Marseille, Nasri was {{deployed}} in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily {{on the right side}} as he was deemed too small to play {{in the middle of the}} park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally admitted that playing centrally is his preference. However, as a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court {{at a very}} early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush was an {{offensive}} defenceman who carried the puck up the ice, {{making use of}} his stick handling, passing skills <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> read the play. Over {{the course of his}} career, he was considered one of the elite rushing defenceman in the NHL. He was a solid checker, but relied more on positioning and discipline than physical play.
