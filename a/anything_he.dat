5|$|After Stiller {{worked with}} Owen Wilson in Zoolander, they joined {{together}} again for The Royal Tenenbaums. Over {{the next two}} years, Stiller continued with the lackluster box office film Duplex, and cameos in Orange County and Nobody Knows <b>Anything!</b> <b>He</b> also guest-starred on several television shows, including an appearance in an episode of the television series The King of Queens in a flashback {{as the father of}} the character Arthur (played by Jerry Stiller). He also made a guest appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment's WWE Raw.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Grant {{suggested}} {{to his colleagues}} that they should {{catch up with the}} presidential limousine. Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, however, used {{not only}} {{intimidation}} but also cajoling and generosity {{to achieve his}} goals. Ferdinand Marian requested compensation of 50,000 marks for taking {{on the role of}} Süß, an amount double <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> had received for previous roles. When asked to approve this amount, Goebbels did so citing the importance of the film and the need for a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E

5|$|In 1932 Vaughan Williams {{was elected}} {{president}} of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. From September to December of that year he was in the US as a visiting lecturer at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania. The texts of his lectures were published under the title National Music in 1934; they sum up his artistic and social credo more fully than <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> had published previously, and remained in print for most of the remainder of the century.|$|E
5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E
5|$|Ella tells Thomas {{about the}} deal with Rumpelstiltskin. Seeking to avoid {{fulfilling}} this deal, Thomas, Charming, Grumpy, and The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) {{come up with a}} plot to capture Rumpelstiltskin by luring him into signing another contract. Hours later, Ella and Rumpelstiltskin meet to sign the deal. Ella lies to him and says she is expecting twins and will give him both of the babies in exchange for improving the crops and wealth of the kingdom. A skeptical Rumpelstiltskin agrees, but as he signs the contract, he is rendered powerless due to a special red quill pen, that was created by The Blue Fairy. He is captured, but Thomas disappears soon after. Ella demands that Rumpelstiltskin tell her what has happened, but he claims not to have done <b>anything.</b> <b>He</b> reminds her that all magic has a price, and that until her debt is paid she will never see Thomas again.|$|E

5|$|Gordon later calls Sam and Dean, {{threatening}} {{to kill a}} young woman {{if they do not}} meet him. They head to the location and find the woman, but Gordon uses a roller door to separate the brothers. The woman is revealed to be a vampire turned by Gordon, and Dean is forced to shoot her with the Colt—a mystical gun capable of killing <b>anything.</b> <b>He</b> then attempts to help Sam, but Gordon prepares to bite him. Sam prevents this and garrotes Gordon with a razor wire, decapitating the vampire. Sam and Dean later stop {{on the side of the}} road to check a rattling noise made by the Impala. Sam is confused when Dean starts explaining the engine's problem. Dean, however, reasons that Sam should know how to fix the car when his remaining time runs out, and also notes that, as his older brother, he should be showing him the ropes.|$|E
5|$|His {{father was}} {{released}} after three months, on 28 May 1824, but the family's financial situation remained poor and Dickens had {{to continue working}} at the factory, something for which he reportedly never forgave his mother. Years later Dickens wrote about the Marshalsea and other debtors' prisons in The Pickwick Papers (1836–1837), David Copperfield (1849–1850), and most extensively in Little Dorrit (1855–1857), whose main character, Amy, is born in the Marshalsea. Trey Philpotts writes that every detail about the Marshalsea in Little Dorrit reflects the real prison of the 1820s. According to Philpotts, Dickens rarely made mistakes and did not exaggerate; if <b>anything,</b> <b>he</b> downplayed the licentiousness of Marshalsea life, perhaps to protect Victorian sensibilities.|$|E
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, and he wanted to see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> is acting in.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{said that}} the show would {{continue}} to cover modern themes in a science fiction way as had the first series, saying that these could include hijacking, nationalism and radicalization of both individuals and groups. He also wanted to show 23rd-century Earth for the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him {{if there had been}} <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> wanted to do on The Original Series but could not. A further change was to be the number of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E
5|$|When Tracy {{causes a}} stir {{at a public}} event, Jack assures him that as a movie star, he can do <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> wants, except for dog fighting. Jack finds Tracy disobeying his order, but Tracy shouts that Jack is not his dad. Jack and Tracy meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, Tracy, and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, {{conveying}} the message that even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts Tracy, and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, {{and he needs to}} stay away from them. Tracy hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.|$|E

5000|$|The San Francisco Chronicle {{described}} Gray's Anatomy as an unremarkable story. [...] "There's something intrinsically insincere {{about the}} whole quest. This creeping sense that Gray isn't really interested in <b>anything</b> <b>he's</b> talking about - that he, alone, {{is the subject of}} his own obsession gives Gray's Anatomy a distasteful edge." ...|$|R

5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn <b>anything,</b> <b>he</b> suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, the Evil Queen mourns {{the death}} of her husband, Snow White's father, {{although}} she herself is responsible for his death. Snow (Goodwin) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss. The Queen consults her magic mirror (Esposito) to ask how she can kill Snow, who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne. She says that the king's knights will not kill his daughter, and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman. As Graham saw in his flashbacks, the Huntsman (Dornan) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods. The Huntsman kills only for himself to live, and has no compassion for humans, who do not understand the wild. As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern, the other patrons begin harassing him, prompting him to successfully defend himself. His performance is viewed in the magic mirror by the Queen, who is greatly impressed. She summons the Huntsman to offer him <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> wants on the condition that he brings her Snow's heart. He agrees to this deal, in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest.|$|E
5|$|The king's reign {{was marked}} by a drought lasting seven years that caused a famine in much of Imerina. According to oral history, the king {{attempted}} to purchase rice from his fief at Ambohipiainana. The town had a surplus but the local leader refused to sell rice to Andriamasinavalona, claiming none was available. The king then sent porters to purchase rice from Antsahatovoka, where the residents declared that while the land was his and it was thus unnecessary for the king to purchase what already belonged to him, there was no rice available to share. Finally Andriamasinavalona sought to purchase rice in Andraisisa. His money was refused by the local leader, Andriandrivotra, who willingly gave the king large shares of food and a tribute of silver. To reward {{the leader of the}} fief, Andriamasinavalona promised to give him <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> liked. Andriandrivotra declared that all he desired was the love of his sovereign. To show his appreciation, Andriamasinavalona declared that he would make Andriasisa into a great fief, and gave Andriandrivotra a large piece of land {{to the west of the}} territory. He then undertook a major expansion of the Betsimitatatra rice fields around Antananarivo, significantly increasing their rice production to feed the populace.|$|E
