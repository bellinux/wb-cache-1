Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width <b>beater</b> <b>bar,</b> and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.|$|R
2500|$|The present-day {{instruments}} {{fall into}} four categories. [...] First are the campanas (Brea and Millet 1993:181), which are instruments of metal struck with <b>metal</b> <b>beaters.</b> Preferably, brake drums from older model American vehicles (1950s or older) are used. Originally, before brake drums were available, frying pans were used (Pérez I 1988:310, Pérez II 1988:23, etc.) and possibly plow blades as well (Pérez I 1988:106 and 134).|$|R
50|$|Upright vacuum {{cleaners}} are {{popular in the}} United States, Britain and numerous Commonwealth countries, but very unusual in Continental Europe. They {{take the form of}} a cleaning head, onto which a handle and bag are attached. Upright designs generally employ a rotating brushroll or <b>beater</b> <b>bar,</b> which removes dirt through a combination of sweeping and vibration. There are two types of upright vacuums; dirty-air/direct fan (found mostly on commercial vacuums), or clean-air/fan-bypass (found on most of today's domestic vacuums).|$|R
50|$|On a {{triangle}} instrument, {{one of the}} angles is left open, with {{the ends of the}} bar not quite touching. This causes the instrument to be of indeterminate or not settled or decided pitch. It is either suspended from one of the other corners by a piece of, most commonly, fishing line, leaving it free to vibrate, or hooked over the hand. It is usually struck with a <b>metal</b> <b>beater,</b> giving a high-pitched, ringing tone.|$|R
5000|$|The dhantal {{is played}} by {{striking}} a metal rod (usually iron or steel) with a <b>metal</b> <b>beater</b> shaped like a horseshoe. Its timbre is sharply metallic and provides a clearly defined tal (beat or pulse) to help the ensemble stay in rhythmic sync. The basic rhythm of the dhantal is an ostinato consisting of two sixteenth-notes followed by an eighth-note. This rhythm has a similar [...] "feel" [...] to the merengue music of the Dominican Republic, which itself {{was based on an}} African rhythm brought to the Caribbean through the Afro-Caribbean diaspora. An example of how the Dhantal works {{can be seen in the}} Dhantal Lesson YouTube video.|$|R
25|$|Cotton mills get {{the cotton}} shipped {{to them in}} large, 500 pound bales. When the cotton {{comes out of a}} bale, it is all packed {{together}} and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes. It is called an Opener. In order to fluff up the cotton and remove the vegetable matter, the cotton is sent through a picker, or similar machines. The cotton is fed into a machine known as a picker, and gets beaten with a <b>beater</b> <b>bar</b> in order to loosen it up. It is fed through various rollers, which serve to remove the vegetable matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers till it emerges as a continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap.|$|R
25|$|Scutching {{refers to}} the process of {{cleaning}} cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel <b>bars</b> called <b>beater</b> <b>bars</b> or <b>beaters.</b> The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|R

5000|$|Hoover's {{business}} {{began to}} flourish, and, {{a year after}} Hoover acquired the patent from Spangler, he established a research and development department for his new business. By 1926, Hoover had developed the 'beater bar' - a metal bar attached to the rotating brush roll, situated in the floor nozzle cavity of the upright vacuum cleaner. [...] Introduced on Models 543 and 700, the <b>beater</b> <b>bars</b> alternated with the sweeping brushes to vibrate the carpet while sucking. It provided a more distinct 'tap' than the bristle tufts used on the former machines, {{and led to a}} 101% increase in efficiency. This cleaning action was marketed by Hoover as [...] "Positive Agitation". 'It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans' rang more true now than ever. In 1929, Hoover introduced the Model 200 Duster. This would be their first attempt at a cylinder cleaner. It used a Model 575 motor with a modified suction impeller, which was mounted on a unique aluminum body with runners, allowing the cleaner to be pulled behind the user. The Duster was produced for only three months and roughly 9,000 were made.|$|R
5000|$|In 1906 James B. Kirby {{developed}} his {{first of many}} vacuums called the [...] "Domestic Cyclone". It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions {{came to be known}} as the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner. In 1907 department store janitor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915) of Canton, Ohio invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner, obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper on June 2, 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife's pillow cases, Spangler's design utilized a rotating brush to loosen debris. Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local leather goods manufacturer William Henry Hoover (1849-1932), who had Spangler's machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the Hoover Company. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60. Subsequent innovations included the <b>beater</b> <b>bar</b> in 1919 ("It beats as it sweeps as it cleans"), disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an upright vacuum cleaner in 1926.|$|R
