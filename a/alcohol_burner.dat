50|$|An <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> or {{spirit lamp}} {{is a piece}} of {{laboratory}} equipment used to produce an open flame. It can be made from brass, glass, stainless steel or aluminium.|$|E
50|$|The stove {{works very}} well with small sticks, wood {{chippings}} and pine cones as fuel. When using the <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner,</b> the Svea burner unit may advantageously be replaced with a Trangia replacement burner, {{which appears to be}} more efficient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alcohol</b> <b>burners</b> are {{preferred}} {{for some}} uses over Bunsen burners for safety purposes, as their flame {{is limited to}} approximately two inches (5 centimeters) in height, with a comparatively lower temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Denatured {{alcohol is}} used as a solvent and as fuel for <b>alcohol</b> <b>burners</b> and camping stoves. Because of the {{diversity}} of industrial uses for denatured alcohol, hundreds of additives and denaturing methods have been used. The main additive has traditionally been 10% methanol, giving rise to the term [...] "methylated spirits". Other typical additives include isopropyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and denatonium.|$|R

50|$|Also in 1868, a French {{engineer}} Louis-Guillaume Perreaux patented {{a similar}} steam powered single cylinder machine, the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede, with an <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> and twin belt drives, which was possibly invented independently of Roper's. Although the patent is dated 1868, nothing indicates the invention had been operable before 1871.|$|E

5000|$|He got {{his start}} in inventing early. In seventh grade he reinvented the steam engine. [...] "It was a crude sort of steam engine that he made from a tin can, an <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner,</b> and a paddle wheel." [...] He honed his inventing talent while {{creating}} a steaming process to open clams under the employment of his brother's seafood company.|$|E
5000|$|Perreaux {{experimented with}} a small steam engine in a bicycle frame, {{contributing}} to {{the invention of the}} first motorcycle. Perreaux patented this design under number 83,691 on 16 March 1869 (and continued to improve his invention until 1885). The design featured a brass-plated single-cylinder steam engine with an <b>alcohol</b> fuel <b>burner</b> under the saddle of a French-made Michaux velocipede bicycle. Drive was by twin belts, and it was capable of about 9 mph. [...] The original machine is on display in the Musée de l’Île-de-France at the Château de Sceaux.|$|R
50|$|Stoves differ {{widely in}} {{their size and}} portability. The {{smallest}} models are generally termed backpacking stoves. They are designed for use in backpacking and bicycle touring, where light weight and small size are paramount considerations. Backpacking stoves consist only of the burner, fuel tank and pot supports. The legs - if any - are often collapsible to minimize the space required. The weight may range from about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 g) for simple alcohol stoves, 11 to 14 oz for MSR-type stoves (without fuel weight) and canister stoves (with gas cartridge), and up to 1 lb for larger stoves. Single <b>burner</b> <b>alcohol</b> stoves, beverage can stoves, and small liquid fuel and gas canister stoves are well suited for backpacking.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A 85 mm Chance Brothers Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation which {{produced}} the light for the Sumburgh Head lighthouse until 1976. The lamp (made in approx. 1914) burned vaporized kerosene (paraffin); the vaporizer was heated by a denatured <b>alcohol</b> (methylated spirit) <b>burner</b> to light. When lit {{some of the}} vaporised fuel was diverted to a Bunsen burner to keep the vaporizer warm and the fuel in vapor form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so. This in turn pressurized the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp. The [...] "white sock" [...] is in fact an unburnt mantle on which the vapor burned.|$|R
50|$|Test {{tubes are}} {{convenient}} containers for heating {{small amounts of}} liquids or solids with a Bunsen burner or <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner.</b> The tube is usually held by its neck with a clamp or tongs. By tilting the tube, the bottom can be heated to hundreds of degrees in the flame, while the neck remains relatively cool, possibly allowing vapours to condense on its walls. A boiling tube is a large test tube intended specifically for boiling liquids.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name comes}} {{from that of the}} {{original}} manufacturer, S. Sternau & Co. of Brooklyn, New York, a maker of chafing dishes, coffee percolators and other similar appliances since 1893. It had previously applied the name to its [...] "Sterno-Inferno" [...] <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner.</b> In 1918, it promoted its Sterno Stove as being a perfect gift for a soldier going overseas. In his book With the Old Breed, E. B. Sledge describes its use on the battlefields of the Pacific Theatre in 1944 and 1945.|$|E
50|$|The {{inoculation}} needle is sterilized {{using the}} aseptic technique. An open flame from an incinerator, a bunsen burner, or an <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> {{is used to}} flame along the tip {{and the length of}} the needle that is to be in contact with the inoculum. For ease of manipulation it is common practice to hold the needle with the dominant hand as if handling a pencil. The needle will be flamed at a downward angle through the flame’s inner cone until it is red-hot. The downward angle will minimize the amount of microbial aerosols created.|$|E
5000|$|The use {{of single}} <b>burner</b> <b>alcohol</b> stoves for camping, {{similar to the}} {{contemporary}} Trangia brand, was reported as early as 1919. For many years alcohol-based stoves were used on sailboats rather than stoves using kerosene for safety reasons; these have since been largely replaced by stoves using compressed gas (such as liquefied petroleum gas, butane or propane) in disposable or refillable canisters. Stoves designed for military use, such as the World War II-era G.I. Pocket Stove, were designed to run on gasoline. So-called [...] "white gas" [...] or naphtha is commonly used as a fuel for camping and backpacking stoves, such as the compact Svea 123. Newer camping stoves are capable of burning multiple types of fuel, which makes them well suited for international travel where some particular types of fuel may not be readily available.|$|R
50|$|Like many musicians with a {{commitment}} to new music, his existence was frugal. For broadcasts he would be paid as little as $5, which went up to $25 when he played the premiere of the Henze Piano Concerto 'because of the special difficulty of the piece'. He lived in a hotel 'with a window facing a wall so that I had to go outside {{to see what the}} weather was. There was room only for a bed and a piano and a little <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> to make stew on.' Around this time he became a close friend of the French painter , whom he described as an important influence.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{the light}} was {{provided}} with a three-mantle oil vapor lamp. To start the lamp, a supplementary <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> was required, {{and this was the}} source of a tragedy in 1925. The first and second assistant keepers were changing watches {{in the wee hours of}} April 25 when the former suggested to the latter that the alcohol reservoir be filled. This was accomplished, but some of the alcohol spilled. The first assistant lit a match, triggering an explosion. The second assistant was standing in the doorway and escaped serious injury, but the first assistant, Alexander Toomey, was badly burned and died the next day. His pregnant wife gave birth to a daughter shortly thereafter, and three months later she, too, died.|$|E
50|$|The Swedish (m/42) mess kit is a {{complete}} package, similar in design to a German mess kit, but larger. It breaks down into two parts, the first part being a steel stand/windshield/wood-burning stove (with a Svea <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> unit), whilst the other part consists of two pots (usually aluminium). The larger pot has a wire handle, or bail, for suspending over a fire; the smaller has hinged handle. The two pots nest together and stow inside the windshield. The set is completed by a small plastic fuel bottle. It is recommended that the fuel bottle and burner unit be stored separately, outside the pots (since alcohol may otherwise seep out). A Swedish army plastic mug can also be fitted inside the pots.|$|E
50|$|One may {{not disturb}} others or damage property, disturb {{breeding}} birds (or their nests or young), or disturb reindeer or game animals. One may not cut down or damage living trees, or collect wood, moss or lichen on other people's property, nor may one light open fires without the landowner's permission (except in an emergency). It is acceptable, however, {{to use an}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner,</b> wood stove or similar device that has no hot parts touching the ground. One may not disturb the privacy of people's homes by camping too near to them or making too much noise, nor litter, drive motor vehicles off-road without the landowner's permission, or fish (excluding angling) or hunt without the relevant permits. In the autonomous province of Åland the right to camp is not necessarily recognized.|$|E
50|$|The climb was {{the first}} known {{to reach the top}} of the Mont Blanc, and {{included}} around 20 people including De Saussure, his servant and several guides and carriers. The climbing mission was a scientific expedition, during which De Saussure undertook research (among other things) on the boiling point of water at different heights. He calculated the height at each of his experiments by measuring how long it took an <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> to boil an amount of water, and by these means he determined the height of the mountain to be 4775 metres. (This later turned out to be 32 metres less than the actual height of 4807 metres). For these experiments De Saussure brought specific scientific equipment, such as a barometer and thermometer. His calculated boiling temperature of water {{at the top of the}} mountain was fairly accurate, only off by 0.1 Kelvin.|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{demonstrate the}} generation of lasing action in the laminar ethanol/air flame on an <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> array using femtosecond laser filament excitation. By probing the backward emissions of combustion species, {{it is found that}} as the interaction length of the filament in the flame increases, the signal's intensity at the 388 nm band for the B- 2 Sigma - X- 2 Sigma transition of CN increases exponentially, but that at the 474 nm band for A(3) Pi(g) - X'(3) Pi(u) transition of C- 2 increases linearly. The exponential behavior of the CN emissions is ascribed to amplified spontaneous emission, which opens up a way to overcome the quenching effect of specific species in combustion diagnosis.

40|$|Authors: Greenfield Sluder, Joshua J. Nordberg, Frederick J. Miller and Edward H. Hinchcliffe This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “A Sealed Preparation for Long-Term Observations of Cultured Cells,” Chapter 18, in *Live Cell Imaging* (eds. Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The continuous long-term observation of cultured cells on the microscope {{has always been a}} technically demanding undertaking. This protocol describes a sealed preparation that allows the continuous long-term observation of cultured mammalian cells on upright or inverted microscopes without environmental CO 2 control. The preparation allows for optical conditions consistent with high-quality imaging and good cell viability for at least 100 hours. The preparation is an aluminum support slide with a square aperture cut in its center. The coverslip bearing the cells is attached {{to the top of the}} slide with a thin layer of silicone grease, and the bottom of the slide is similarly covered with a clean coverslip of the same size. The thickness of the slide is intended to coordinately maximize the volume of the medium while maintaining optical properties that allow Koehler illumination with standard condensers. The chamber is filled in equal parts with HEPES-buffered media containing fetal calf serum and a low-viscosity fluorocarbon oil. These oils have a high solubility for atmospheric gases. The inclusion of the oil in the preparations is intended to provide a source of oxygen and perhaps a sink for some of the CO 2 produced by the cells. Although the inclusion of fluorocarbon oil in the preparation may not be necessary for short-term (~ 24 hr) observations, particularly with cells that are sparsely plated, long-term cell viability is ensured when the oil is present. ### RELATED INFORMATION Support slides should be prepared as described in [A Sealed Preparation for Long-Term Observations of Cultured Cells: Details of Support Slide Construction]([URL] ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Cells for analysis - *This protocol has been used extensively for BSC- 1, CV- 1, COS- 7, CHO, mouse embryo fibroblasts, and hTERT RPE 1 cells. The FC 47, FC 40, FC 43, and FC 77 oils (see below) all work well for these cells. Most cells appear viable and have normal interphase morphology at 250 hours. Normally, observations of cells stop after 70 - 120 hours because by that time the cells have become confluent. Over the course of 100 hours, all of the cell types show constant motility, and mitoses continue for the duration of the observations with no noticeable prolongation of the cell cycle at later times. Note, however, that at later times, cells often develop small spherical inclusions that are phase-bright. The identity of these inclusions remains obscure, but they may be large pinocytotic vesicles. In any case, they do not appear to have an adverse impact on cell motility, mitosis, or gross morphology*. - Culture medium - *This protocol uses culture medium appropriate for each cell type supplemented with 12. 5 mM HEPES, 10 % fetal calf serum, and a 1 : 100 dilution of the antibiotic/antifungal reagent sold by GIBCO (catalog no. 15240 - 062) *. - Ethanol (70 %, 95 %) - Fluorocarbon oil - *The oils we use are manufactured by 3 M Corp. and are part of its Fluorinert series of performance liquids ([3 M Fluorinert product guide, 1997]([URL] These are short (primarily eight-carbon) hydrocarbons that are fully substituted with fluorine. They are extremely inert and immiscible with water, and they do not present any recognized significant health hazards. However, it is recommended that all users consult the Material Safety Data Sheets provided by 3 M Corp. for potential health hazards before using these oils. These oils are available from three manufacturers’ representatives in three-quarter gallon (or 11 pound) amounts. 3 M Corp. does not directly sell anything but truckload quantities of these oils. Small sample quantities are available from Acuity Technical Sales (New Hampshire), AMS Materials (Florida), and Semitorr (Oregon) *. - Vaseline:lanolin:paraffin, melted and combined 1 : 1 : 1 (VALAP) ### Equipment 1. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> - Aluminum support slide - Beaker, 1 liter - Controlled-temperature environment - *Since this preparation is sealed, control of environmental CO 2 is not needed. However, the cells under observation need to be maintained at 37 °C. This can be achieved by enclosing the entire microscope in a box and using a proportional feedback control apparatus to blow warmed air into the enclosure. Cardboard boxes work well when configured so that the video camera and the mercury arc lamp (when present) are external to the enclosure. The oculars should project from the top edge of the box. A more elegant and user-friendly setup is a Plexiglas enclosure with sliding doors custom-fabricated for the particular microscope. Again, the oculars, camera, and arc lamp housing should be located outside of the box. Three alternative heating strategies include placing the microscope in a 37 °C room, enclosing the volume around the stage with a custom-built Plexiglas box, and warming the preparation alone with a temperature-controlled support apparatus on the stage. This last strategy suffers because there will be a temperature gradient from the margins of the preparation to the cells under observation. The gradient is particularly severe when a water or oil immersion objective is used, unless the objective is equipped with a heated collar or other heating device*. - Coverslip jars - Coverslips, size 1. 5 - Culture dish, 100 × 20 mm - Forceps - Pipettes, 1 ml - Silicone vacuum grease (High Vacuum Grease; Dow Corning) - Spatula - Squirt bottle containing distilled H 2 O - Tissue culture hood - UV light source - Water bath, preset to 37 °C ### METHOD 1. Clean the coverslips used in the construction of this preparation prior to use by sonicating them in distilled H 2 O containing a small amount of detergent and then rinsing the coverslips several times in distilled H 2 O. Store cleaned coverslips in jars containing 95 % ethanol. - *Although the utility of these preparations is not sensitive to coverslip thickness, use number 1. 5 (i. e., 0. 17 mm thick) coverslips, because microscope objectives (without coverslip correction collars) are designed for this thickness of glass. Use of number 1 or number 2 coverslips introduces spherical aberration that degrades image quality*. - To prepare the coverslips for use in growing cells, pass each coverslip through the flame of an <b>alcohol</b> <b>burner</b> to burn off excess ethanol. - To ensure a uniform and lasting seal, do not apply silicone grease to the margins of wet coverslips coming out of a tissue culture dish. Instead, grease the margins of the coverslips before the cells are grown on them by applying a thin and uniform coating of silicone vacuum grease to the margins of the coverslip with a small spatula. - Place the coverslips in a 100 × 20 -mm tissue culture dish. To ensure sterility, place the dish with coverslips in a tissue culture hood, and expose it to UV light for 10 minutes. - Following sterilization, plate the cells onto coverslips and culture them in ~ 10 ml of media. - *For our applications, we use the media appropriate for each cell type supplemented with 12. 5 mM HEPES, 10 % fetal calf serum, and a 1 : 100 dilution of the antibiotic/antifungal reagent sold by GIBCO*. - Wipe the aluminum support slide with a tissue soaked with 70 % ethanol, and then briefly pass the slide through a flame to remove residual alcohol. - Use a small spatula to apply a thin rim of silicone grease around the top and bottom margins of the opening. - Use a thin, even layer of silicone grease. Thicker layers, although they may work well, can lead to dimensional instability as the preparation “settles” at 37 °C. This can lead to a constantly changing focus for the first few hours, even though the microscope may have a stable focus mechanism. - Flame a cleaned blank coverslip (from Step 1) to remove the alcohol, and attach the coverslip to the bottom of the support slide. Use the back of a pair of curved forceps to gently tamp the coverslip to ensure a good seal. - Place the prepared slide in a plastic culture dish, and expose it to UV light for 10 minutes in a tissue culture hood. - Warm the media and fluorocarbon oil to 37 °C in a water bath. - Use a sterile 1 -ml pipette to fill the chamber halfway with oil (~ 350 μl). - Use a fresh sterile 1 -ml pipette to add medium until the oil at the margins of the opening just barely overflows from the chamber (again, ~ 350 μl). - Remove a coverslip with cells from the culture dish, and aspirate off excess medium. Quickly place the coverslip, silicone-grease-side down, on the chamber. Tamp the coverslip with forceps to ensure a good seal. Aspirate off any excess media and oil that may have flowed over onto the top of the coverslip. - Wash the top of the preparation prior to use to prevent salts from the medium forming crystals on the coverslips once they air dry. - Fill a 1 -liter beaker with 37 °C water, and place a squirt bottle of distilled H 2 O in it to warm. - When the water is warm, take the assembled chamber out of the incubator. Use a small spatula to apply a small amount of melted 1 : 1 : 1 vaseline:lanolin:paraffin (VALAP) to the edges of the top coverslip to provide an extra seal. Use the squirt bottle to gently wash the top coverslip, and aspirate off any excess water. - *Keep the amount of VALAP used to a minimum to reduce the chance that any will catch on the objective when the preparation is in use. This soft, waxy material is difficult to remove from optical surfaces*. - Proceed with microscopy [...] the culture preparation is now ready for observation. *See Movie 1, which illustrates BSC- 1 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells imaged by time-lapse video microscopy*. ![Movie 1]([URL] "Movie 1 ") **Movie 1. ** BSC- 1 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells imaged by time-lapse video microscopy. The sequence shows an individual cell and its subsequent daughter cells undergoing three rounds of cell division (mitosis). The cells are imaged by phase contrast microscopy.
