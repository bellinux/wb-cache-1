5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Leon's superior officer, Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons, had been bribed by Umbrella to hide {{evidence of the}} company's experiments in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He also concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon has multiple encounters with a Tyrant monster air-dropped into the Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant in the police department. Thereupon, Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada comes upon Sherry <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on his duty to protect her. They encounter a middle-aged woman who fires at Ada, but Leon dives between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed creature that is now chasing Sherry. Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later– taken over by her emotions– returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.|$|E
500|$|After {{emerging}} from the hypoglossal canal, the hypoglossal nerve gives off a meningeal branch <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> branch from the anterior ramus of C1. [...] It then travels close to the vagus nerve [...] and spinal division of the accessory nerve, spirals downwards behind the vagus nerve and passes between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein lying on the carotid sheath.|$|E

500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "Sun Tea" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{included}} on 30 Rocks season four DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes bonus feature. Frank Rossitano is told to stop peeing in jars in his office and forced to use the bathroom. After exiting a bathroom in the 30 Rock building Frank runs into Kenneth and tells him [...] "They can make me use the bathroom, Kenneth, but they will NEVER stop me from eating food in the garbage." [...] Frank then sees a janitors cart <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> half-eaten egg muffin, eats it, and goes through the garbage in search for more food.|$|E
500|$|The father {{opens the}} door <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> fire axe to fight against zombies. He rescues his {{daughter}} and brings her inside the hotel room. After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who are breaking into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck. [...] To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws {{her out of the}} window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies. The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room {{in the beginning of the}} game.|$|E
500|$|The immense {{volume of}} water in the five Great Lakes holds heat that allows the lakes to remain {{relatively}} warm for much later into the year and postpones the Arctic spread in the region. During the autumn months, two major weather tracks converge over the area. Cold, dry air moves south/southeast from the province of Alberta and northern Canada; warm, moist air moves north/northeast from the Gulf of Mexico, along the lee of the central Rocky Mountains. The collision of these masses forms large storm systems {{in the middle of the}} North American continent, including the Great Lakes. [...] When the cold air from these storms moves over the lakes, it is warmed by the waters below <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> spin. As the cyclonic system continues over the lakes, its power is intensified by the jet stream above and the warm waters below.|$|E

500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
2500|$|... 2007 – Bill Plummer, {{the former}} {{manager of the}} Diamondbacks' former Double-A affiliate, the Tennessee Smokies, takes over as skipper for the Sidewinders in 2007. Randy Johnson pitches the home opener {{as part of a}} brief rehab stint with the Sidewinders, <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> win for the team in his second outing on April 20. Hampered by low {{attendance}} and concerns over the location and playing field maintenance at Tucson Electric Park, Tucson Baseball LLC sells the Tucson Sidewinders to SK Baseball LLC for $15 M in June 2007. Tucson finishes the 2007 season with a 75–67 record, the second most wins in Sidewinders history. Tucson Baseball LLC completes sale of the team to SK Baseball LLC on September 12, 2007. Also in September, outgoing Sidewinders owner Zucker announces the formation of a new Tucson baseball team with an old name: the Tucson Toros, to begin play in 2009 as part of the Golden Baseball League.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theatrical}} cut of {{the film}} does not explicitly reveal that Denethor had a palantír in his possession. [...] His comment to Gandalf, [...] "Do you think {{the eyes of the}} White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know." [...] (paraphrased from the book) may be an allusion to his use of the palantír. This is more explicit in the book, where it is implied certain visions are technically true but cast in an ambiguous or outright negative light by Sauron's influence. [...] In the Extended Edition of the film, however, Aragorn approaches Denethor's seat in the throne room <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> palantír swaddled in some robes. [...] Aragorn proceeds to use this palantir to contact Sauron and goad him into concentrating on Aragorn's diversionary attack (it is not clear whether this is the Orthanc stone or the Anor stone). [...] Even the Extended Edition does not fully explain in dialogue the backstory of the palantíri, or how they came into the possession of Sauron, Saruman, and Denethor.|$|E

[...] He puts it down at the left, and takes up the address for the young man's roses on the right; he stares at the two {{addresses}} in a stupefaction. [...] "That is very sdrainche too. Well!" [...] He drops the papers with a shrug, and goes on arranging the flowers.|$|E

6000|$|There is a {{woman who}} has several times passed through this Hanover Street, in which we live, {{stopping}} occasionally to sing songs under the windows; and last evening, between nine and ten o'clock, she came and sang [...] "Kathleen O'Moore" [...] richly and sweetly. Her voice rose up out of the dim, chill street, and made our hearts throb in unison with it as we sat in our comfortable drawing-room. I never heard a voice that touched me more deeply. Somebody told her to go away, and she stopped like a nightingale suddenly shot; but, finding that S----- wished to know something about her, Fanny and one of the maids ran after her, and brought her into the hall. It seems she was educated to sing at the opera, and married an Italian opera-singer, who is now dead; lodging in a model lodging-house at threepence a night, and being a penny short to-night, she tried this method, in hope of getting this penny. She takes in plain sewing when she can get any, <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> trifle about the street by means of her voice, which, she says, was once sweet, but has now been injured by the poorness of her living. She is a pale woman, with black eyes, Fanny says, and may have been pretty once, but is not so now. It seems very strange, that with such a gift of Heaven, so cultivated, too, as her voice is, making even an unsusceptible heart vibrate like a harp-string, she should not have had an engagement among the hundred theatres and singing-rooms of London; that she should throw away her melody in the streets for the mere chance of a penury, when sounds not a hundredth part so sweet are worth from other lips purses of gold.|$|E
