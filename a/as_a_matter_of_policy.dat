They were founded by Chief Minister of Dominica Edward Olivier Leblanc in 1965, and promote the traditional music and dance of Dominica. The government of Dominica also promotes Dominican music through the Dominican Broadcasting Station, which broadcasts between 20% and 25% local music <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} was organized along similar {{lines to the}} British and American {{armed forces of the}} time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first line of defense relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> the {{military was}} to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.|$|E

5000|$|Judgment {{notwithstanding}} the verdict, also called judgment non obstante veredicto, or JNOV, {{is a type}} <b>of</b> judgment <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law (JMOL) that is sometimes rendered {{at the conclusion of}} a jury trial. In U.S. federal civil court cases, the term has been replaced by the renewed judgment <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law, which emphasizes its relationship to the judgment <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law (formerly called a directed verdict).

25|$|Although short-lived, one of {{the first}} empires known to history was that of Eannatum of Lagash, who annexed {{practically}} all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b> Eannatum's Stele of the Vultures depicts vultures pecking at the severed heads and other body parts of his enemies.

25|$|The {{strategy}} of the German colonial forces, led by Lieutenant Colonel (later Generalmajor) Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, was to divert Allied forces from the Western Front to Africa. His strategy achieved only mixed results after 1916, when he was driven out of German East Africa and Allied forces became composed almost entirely of South African, Indian and other colonial troops. Black South African troops were not considered for European service <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> while all Indian units had been withdrawn from the Western Front {{by the end of}} 1915; the campaign in Africa consumed considerable amounts of money and war material that could have gone to other fronts.|$|E

Eventually the two men agreed to a showdown in which LaMountain made one of his free flights. The flight was a success as a reconnaissance flight with LaMountain being able to go where he would.

25|$|Ambassador Goldberg briefed King Hussein on US assurances {{regarding}} territorial integrity.

The US would use its influence to obtain compensation to Jordan for any territory it {{would be required to}} give up. Finally, although <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> the US did not agree with Jordan's position on Jerusalem, nor with the Israeli position on Jerusalem, the US was prepared to use its influence to obtain for Jordan a role in Jerusalem.

25|$|Following {{the success}} of Lester Pearson and the Liberal Party in the 1963 federal election, and through the {{successive}} governments of Pierre Trudeau, the federal cabinet commuted all death sentences <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b> Hence, the de facto abolition {{of the death penalty}} in Canada occurred in 1963. On November 30, 1967, Bill C-168 was passed creating a five-year moratorium {{on the use of the}} death penalty, except for murders of police and corrections officers. On January 26, 1973, after the expiration of the five-year experiment, the Solicitor General of Canada continued the partial ban on capital punishment, which would eventually lead to the abolition of capital punishment. On July 14, 1976, Bill C-84 was passed by a narrow margin of 130:124 in a free vote, resulting in the de jure abolition of the death penalty, except for certain offences under the National Defence Act. These were removed in 1998.|$|E
25|$|The Polish {{civilian}} population suffered under German occupation in several ways. Large numbers were expelled from land intended for German colonisation, {{and forced to}} resettle in the General-Government area. Hundreds of thousands of Poles were deported to Germany for forced labour in industry and agriculture, where many thousands died. Poles were also conscripted for labour in Poland, and were held in labour camps all over the country, again with a high death rate. There was a general shortage of food, fuel for heating and medical supplies, {{and there was a}} high death rate among the Polish population as a result. Finally, thousands of Poles were killed as reprisals for resistance attacks on German forces or for other reasons. In all, about 3 million (non-Jewish) Poles {{died as a result of}} the German occupation, more than 10% of the pre-war population. When this is added to the 3 million Polish Jews who were killed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> by the Germans, Poland lost about 22% of its population, the highest proportion of any European country in World War II.|$|E

25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> that it was worth it to buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and it {{might not be able to}} defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish crown at {{the time}} ruled through a system of royal councils. The most {{significant}} of these were the Councils of State and its subordinate Council for War, that were in turn supported by the seven professional councils for the different regions, and four specialised councils for the Inquisition, the Military Orders, Finance and the Crusade tax. These councils were then supplemented by small committees, or juntas, as necessary, such as the 'junta of the night' through which Philip II exercised personal authority {{towards the end of}} his reign. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> Philip had tried to avoid appointing grandees to major positions of power within his government and relied heavily on the lesser nobles, the so-called 'service' nobility. Philip II had taken the traditional system of councils and applied a high degree of personal scrutiny to them, especially in matters of paperwork, which he declined to delegate – the result was a 'ponderous' process. To his contemporaries, the degree of personal oversight he exercised was excessive; his 'self-imposed role as the chief clerk to the Spanish empire' was not thought entirely appropriate. Philip first started to become engaged in practical government at the age of 15, when he joined Philip II's private committee.|$|E
25|$|No tactical-technical section {{existed in}} either the RLM or Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL), with a near-complete lack of any system for a direct manner for combat pilots to place field {{requests}} for improvements to existing weapons systems, and to address improved tactics for their use. The Luftwaffe was therefore unable to provide appropriate equipment for the task asked of its units. Starting in 1940, all planning was short-sighted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b> The need for technical improvements was resisted as pushing through upgrades would have reduced production rates of standard aircraft. Hardware {{would have to be}} turned over to the production of new types, causing a drop in output. This meant obsolete sub-variant or main types were kept in production too long. The OKL failed to produce adequate numbers of aircraft and refused to cut bomber production in favour of fighters until mid-1944. Even when these events were corrected, procurement was poor. As one key example late in the war, the Messerschmitt Me 262 was unable to be introduced rapidly enough. Partly through the pioneering nature of its axial-flow jet engines, the first ever placed in production, requiring much development time to make them reliable enough for front-line use, and too much time was wasted between operational testing, tactical-doctrinal development and training. General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters) Adolf Galland took responsibility for this failure.|$|E
