50|$|The American Bearing Manufacturers Association is an {{industry}} trade group that deals with all aspects of bearing technology. It was founded in 1917 as an informal group of manufacturers {{with the purpose of}} aiding bearing manufacturing during World War I. 1933 saw the ratification of Articles of Incorporation, by the then current members, as the <b>Anti-Friction</b> <b>Bearing</b> Manufacturers Association (AFBMA). In 1934 the AFBMA was incorporated as an organization in New York City. In 1993 the organization formally changed its title to the American Bearing Manufacturers Association in order to better serve its members and to expand membership eligibility.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pillow block}} usually {{refers to a}} housing with an {{included}} <b>anti-friction</b> <b>bearing.</b> A pillow block refers to any mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A pillow block may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of pillow block. These differ from [...] "plumber blocks" [...] which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing.|$|E

5000|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{was one of}} {{the major}} reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, U.K. “ A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton. A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration. Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together. A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”Better lubrication, such as from petroleum oils, reduced friction losses in mills and factories.

50|$|Osaka was {{the second}} largest city in Japan, with a {{population}} of 3,252,340 in 1940. Traditionally, it was the most important industrial concentration in the Far East. Osaka was one of the principal centers of heavy industry, noted for its shipbuilding, iron, steel, rolling stock works, as well as non-ferrous metals enterprises (notably copper and aluminum). In addition, it was outstanding for its production of aircraft propellers and governors, munitions and ordnance, textiles, special steels, wires, electrical equipment, chemicals, instruments, and machines and machine tools, particularly <b>anti-friction</b> <b>bearings.</b> It had also become a transportation center, and ranked third as a port. Much work had been done to develop its naturally shallow harbor. Lastly, it was the center of an extensive system of railways.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 33 <b>Anti-friction</b> <b>bearings</b> {{in process}} pumps, by design {{frequently}} utilize oil sump lubrication technology. For many years, {{it was an}} accepted condition that the lubricating oil used in oil sump bearing lubrication needed to be changed {{on a regular basis}} to prevent high levels of contamination that can lead to premature bearing failure, contributing to equipment downtime. Often, the indicators used to determine change intervals were based on visual elements of oil, such as color. As simple as this method is there are many critical elements that will degrade the overall performance of the lubricant, resulting in premature component failure. Understanding how these elements work together to provide reliable lubrication and, more importantly, increased equipment life and performance are explained. Contained in this document is the compilation of pump manufacturer and component producer design specifications, end user focus group input, new tribology data, laboratory tests, case history studies, and best practice recommendations...|$|R
50|$|Lacking {{research}} and design resources {{and unable to}} manufacture competitive products, the company entered bankruptcy and went into receivership in 1923. One year later President J. B. Bartholomew died. Former officers of the bankrupt Avery company organized a new, smaller firm in late 1925 as the Avery Power Machinery Co., acquiring {{a large portion of}} the original plant in Peoria. They developed and manufactured a new line of advanced all-steel threshers and combine harvesters employing <b>anti-friction</b> <b>bearings.</b> They also manufactured parts for all of the previous Avery machines, for which there was still considerable demand. The competition for track-type farm equipment increased in 1925 when the Holt Manufacturing Co. and the C. L. Best Co. of San Leandro, California merged to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. When wheat dropped to 25 cents a bushel in 1931, farmers could not afford new farm implements and the new Avery Power Machinery company could not pay its debts. Banks with an interest in the company placed a manager in charge in late 1931, who gradually liquidated the company's assets.|$|R

50|$|The U.S. bearing {{industry}} {{by this point}} was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of <b>anti-friction</b> <b>bearings,</b> including needle, ball, roller, and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, spokes and nipples, drill bits, surgeon needles, hooking and felting needles, swaging machines, and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer—a company that had earned the respect of competitors—and now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began {{to attract the attention}} of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern.|$|R

5000|$|Design of the Train of Tomorrow {{began in}} 1944, as a {{collaboration}} between General Motors (GM) and Pullman-Standard. According to author Brian Solomon, the train [...] "was strictly intended as an innovation showcase, and...the automotive manufacturer {{had no interest in}} building its own passenger trains." [...] According to a contemporary Life magazine article, its development cost approximately $1.5 million. GM had no less than five of its divisions involved with the train: the Electro-Motive Division (EMD) built its E7A locomotive, the Detroit Diesel Division and the Delco Products Division collaborated on the train's generating equipment, the Frigidaire Division built its air conditioning system, the Hyatt Bearings Division built its <b>anti-friction,</b> journal-box <b>bearings,</b> and GM's Styling Division concentrated on its interior design. GM did not, however, foray into the field of building passenger railroad cars, until its introduction of the Aerotrain a decade later.|$|R
40|$|An <b>anti-friction</b> Babbitt alloy-coated <b>bearing</b> made by {{a casting}} process is a journal bearing, which is used in an ore cone crusher {{eccentric}}. The main purpose of the Babbitt coated eccentric {{is to provide a}} low friction to support and guide a rotating shaft. Despite the fact that the Babbitt-coated eccentric offers a low friction coefficient and can be operated without a continuous supply of lubricant, it suffers from mining environments and short service life. In this study, an ultrasonic nanocrystalline surface modification (UNSM) technique was used to further reduce the friction coefficient, to increase the wear resistance, and to extend the service life of the Sn-based Babbitt metal. The friction and wear behavior of the Sn-based Babbitt metal was investigated using a block-on-ring tester under both dry and oil-lubricated conditions. The results of the experiments revealed that the friction and wear behavior of Sn-based Babbitt metal could be improved by the application of the UNSM technique. The friction and wear mechanisms of the specimens were explained and discussed in terms of changes in surface properties—microstructure, surface hardness, surface roughness, etc...|$|R
