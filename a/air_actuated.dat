40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent gasket and retaining ring (retaining ring is also called snap ring), loading the new snap ring and gasket into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of snap rings from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate <b>air</b> <b>actuated</b> retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new gasket, the snap ring loader is used to load a new snap ring into a groove in the gasket installation tool. A new gasket is placed on the installation tool and retained by custom springs. An MSM lifts the installation tool and presses the mounted gasket against the connector block. Once the installation tool is in position, the gasket and snap ring are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements.

The traditional [...] "hand push" [...] process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The <b>air</b> is <b>actuated</b> by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control.

The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.|$|R

The several factors {{to affect the}} performance of air-breathing PEM fuel cell such as air flow rate, opening ratio and cathode open type in the cathode side were studied. Especially, an air flow rate is critical condition to improve its performance. In this paper, we developed a synthetic jet air blower to supply a high stoichiometric air flow. The synthetic jet mechanism is a zero mass flux device that converts electrical energy into the momentum. The synthetic jet actuation is usually generated by a traditional PZT actuator, which consists of a small cylindrical cavity, in/outlet channel and PZT diaphragms. The flow rate of the fabricated synthetic jet air blower was 400 cc/min at 550 Hz and its power consumption was very low under 0. 3 W. The proposed air-breathing PEM fuel cell which installed synthetic jet air blower was higher performance and stability during continuous operation than the air-breathing fuel cell without auxiliary device to supply the air.

50|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled, an {{electronic}} microswitch sends {{a signal to}} the marker's electronic board telling it to begin the firing sequence. The board then actuates the solenoid which is provided with air from the LPR. When the solenoid valve is <b>actuated,</b> <b>air</b> that normally holds the hammer in the full-back position is re-routed through the ram assembly and now drives the hammer forward at a rapid rate. The hammer then pins open the valve for a period of 6-16ms(this time is called the dwell). Since the marker's bolt is linked to the hammer, it travels forward at the same time carrying a paintball forward, passed the detents, into the firing position. Air travelling upwards through the, now open, valve is routed through the bolt and the paintball is shot out the barrel through a combination of air pressure and kinetic energy imparted from the bolt movement. Once the dwell time has passed, the solenoid returns the hammer (and thus the bolt) to the full-back position by routing the LPR-sourced air back through the default passage.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} theory {{to design a}} controller which estimates and cancels unknown sinusoidal disturbances forcing a linear time-invariant system by using only measurement of state-derivatives of the system. Our design {{is based on the}} following steps; parametrization of the sinusoidal disturbance as the output of a known feedback system with an unknown output vector that depends on both unknown disturbance parameters and unknown plant parameters, design of an adaptive disturbance observer, and finally design of an adaptive controller. We extend the results for unmatched disturbances by using a backstepping procedure. We employ the developed controller {{to solve the problem of}} cargo transfer in high sea states over a ramp from a large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessel to a smaller connector vessel of a surface effect ship (SES) type. Our aim is to reduce ramp motion between the LMSR and SES in order to provide a safer environment for cargo transfer. We design an <b>air</b> cushion <b>actuated</b> controller to estimate and cancel the wave disturbance and stabilize the heave of the SES via heave acceleration feedback with actuation of the louver area for the case where the hydrodynamic and other parameters of the SES are not known a priori and the pressure dynamics of the air-cushion contains nonlinearly parameterized unknown terms. We also consider a two- chamber air-cushion SES model and design an adaptive controller to regulate heave and pitch simultaneously. In addition a tracking algorithm is proposed to keep the ramp stationary during the cargo transfer. We demonstrate the effects of our control designs in simulations in a time- domain seakeeping code, named AEGIR. We also implement the developed controller on a scale model SES. We perform several experiments in a wave tank to test the performance of the controller. It is shown that the experimental results we have obtained are consistent with the developed theor...|$|R
