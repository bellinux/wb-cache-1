It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you really do feel that there's something else that got you there.

25|$|At 9:45a.m., a {{neighbor}} {{noticed that the}} Ruettens' garage door was open, with no car visible. Approximately 15 minutes later, Ruetten made {{the first of several}} unanswered calls home {{over the course of the}} day. Rasmussen's sister also called without answer. At noon, two men, who the neighbor believed were gardeners in the compound, gave her and her husband a purse they had found that turned out to be Rasmussen's. A maid cleaning a nearby unit said she heard something that sounded like two people fighting, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> falling, at around 12:30p.m.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} about the [...] "rebirthing" [...] scene, Kit Harington {{said that it}} intended to mirror the Daenerys Targaryen scene {{at the end of}} the third-season episode [...] "Mhysa" [...] when Daenerys is held up by freed Yunkai slaves; in [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Jon Snow emerges from the crushing crowd of the battle: [...] "When the crush starts happening, he slows down, and there's that thing of peace where he thinks: 'I could just stay here and let it all end.' <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again, which I found weirdly reflective of the scene where Dany is held aloft at the end of season three." ...|$|E

500|$|On 19 September, Groves went to Donald Nelson, the {{chairman}} of the War Production Board, and asked for broad authority to issue a AAA rating whenever it was required. Nelson initially balked but quickly caved in when Groves threatened to go to the President. Groves promised not to use the AAA rating unless it was necessary. It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944. According to Groves, [...] "In Washington you became {{aware of the importance of}} top priority. Most everything proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> else would get top priority".|$|E
500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", and for the past two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>something</b> happens and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". In terms of writing the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create not just what we are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E
2500|$|With {{interest}} fading, {{the team}} struggled on and played one odds match at Saltaire in 1876. There were no matches {{at all in}} 1877 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> of a revival in 1878 when they played eight, followed by nine in 1879. The last of the UNEE's first-class matches was played in June 1879 against a London United Eleven at Birmingham. The UNEE team in this match was very strong: ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 20, 2012, {{the band}} stated via their Facebook page {{that they were}} {{recording}} their new album. Tumult that surfaced during the recording of the album provided inspiration for the LP's title. Homme explained to Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "We'd have these great victories <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> would go south for a bit, and we'd go, 'It's like clockwork!' I think a sick sense of humor is what's always been our preservation mechanism, so this time we're using that sick sense of humor for a title." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2010 interview, BET co-founder Sheila Johnson {{said that}} she herself is [...] "ashamed" [...] of what the network has become. [...] "I don't watch it. I suggest to my kids that they don't watch it," [...] she said. [...] "When we started BET, {{it was going to}} be the Ebony {{magazine}} on television. We had public affairs programming. We had news... I had a show called Teen Summit, we had a large variety of programming, but the problem is that then the video revolution started up... <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> started happening, and I didn't like it at all. And I remember during those days we would sit up and watch these videos and decide which ones were going on and which ones were not. We got a lot of backlash from recording artists...and we had to start showing them. I didn't like the way women were being portrayed in these videos." ...|$|E

60|$|He coughed, {{put on his}} glasses, {{arranged}} them fastidiously, coughed again, {{and wished}} something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure. Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a leisurely manner. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> did happen.|$|E
60|$|He felt a soft, warm pad {{upon the}} fingers {{of one of his}} hands where they circled the branch to which he clung, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> reached down out of the {{blackness}} above and dragged him up among the branches of the tree.|$|E
