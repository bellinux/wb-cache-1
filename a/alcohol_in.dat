5|$|After World War I, the {{nationwide}} prohibition of <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> 1919 brought heavy losses to the St. Louis brewing industry. Other industries, such as light manufacturing of clothing, automobile manufacturing, and chemical production, filled {{much of the}} gap, and St. Louis's economy was relatively diversified and healthy during the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{impressions}} of drinking <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> the Biden and Finnegan families {{and in the}} neighborhood led to Joe Biden becoming a teetotaler.

5|$|After the game, the NBA {{suspended}} nine {{players for}} a total of 146 games, which led to $11 million in salary being lost by the players. Five players were also charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service. Five fans also faced criminal charges and were banned from attending Pistons home games for life. The fight also led the NBA to increase security between players and fans, and to limit the sale of <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> games.|$|E
5|$|Although Vainio {{himself did}} not consume alcohol, he was {{tolerant}} about others' alcohol use and could {{spend time with}} his friends even if they drank, keeping <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> his house in case his friends came over. He also began discussing the topic of drinking in his lyrics. Getting rid of his alcohol problem did not solve Vainio's domestic problems; he and Taina ended up divorcing.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} <b>alcohol.</b> <b>In</b> the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E

5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} {{what is going}} on with Michael. They both see it as a coping mechanism, and both insist that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as PahWongso, was {{recognised}} in West Java for his promotion of social causes. These included promoting monogamy {{and faith in}} western medicine, as well as combating gambling {{and the use of}} opium and <b>alcohol.</b> <b>In</b> conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese wayang golek (a form of rod puppet), as the local people were generally unable to read. He was able to speak Dutch, Malay, and Javanese fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. This social work was funded predominantly from PahWongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (kacang goreng).|$|E

5000|$|Because of {{the large}} size of the α-pinenyl substituents, diisopinocampheylborane only hydroborates {{unhindered}} alkenes.

5|$|Devout Baptists and teetotalers, Governor and Mrs. Leslie did {{not serve}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> the governor's mansion and were given a silver service set at the {{expiration}} of his term by the Good Templars of Kentucky for their charity to the needy.

In March 1918, Cotillo opposed the proposed prohibition of <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> the state. Although he believed in temperance, he doubted if that would be achieved by prohibition; he advocated education and not infringing on civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E

5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with <b>alcohol,</b> <b>in</b> each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} in a {{fermentation}} process to make yoghurt, cheese, curd, kefir, ayran, xynogala, {{and other types of}} food. Fermentation cultures provide flavor and aroma, and inhibit undesirable organisms. They are used to leaven bread, and to convert sugars to <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> wine and beer.
