5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> was constructed to help <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the tropical cyclone watches and warnings, several other actions were taken as Chantal approached. More than 600oil workers were moved inland, though a man drowned while attempting to evacuate <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mayor of Port Arthur Malcolm Grant asked 800residents to evacuate Sabine Pass, due to potential coastal flooding isolating the area. Shelters were opened at various schools in Port Arthur and Beaumont. In nearby Orange, crews at emergency centers distributed sand bags. About 8,500residents of Cameron Parish, Louisiana evacuated, with at least 67people taking shelter at a school in Lake Charles. An additional 2,500people fled Grand Isle, as {{the threat of the}} only road to the island flooding loomed.|$|E
5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the Shaft of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene. Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.|$|E

5|$|Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, {{discovering}} that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One. Stark saves some surviving {{passengers and crew}} but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the president and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian. After the battle, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit {{as a sign of}} his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing he will always be Iron Man.|$|E

25|$|A ship {{may also}} have one or more slots for rigs, modules that require no power grid or CPU, but instead require a ship {{resource}} called calibration. Installing <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> is a semi-permanent action, as <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> cannot {{be removed from the}} ship without being destroyed. Rigs come in four sizes: small, medium, large, and capital which roughly correspond {{to the size of the}} ship, and are used to affect other aspects of the ship such as maximum speed or cargo capacity, or to augment the capabilities of other modules installed in the ship. Most rigs also incur a penalty to certain aspect of the ship; for example, armor rigs reduce the maximum velocity of the ship.|$|E

25|$|Mushing is a {{sport or}} {{transport}} method powered by dogs. It includes carting, pulka, scootering, sled dog racing, skijoring, freighting, and weight pulling. More specifically, it implies {{the use of}} one or more dogs to pull a sled on snow or <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> on dry land.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the {{theoretical}} tension {{acting on the}} belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation {{can be compared to}} the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> to know how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of {{accidents}} (including two fatal ones) {{were reported by}} Ontario Provincial Police by the Sûreté du Québec across Ontario, Quebec and across several US States including a pile-up that involved at least seven tractor-trailers on Highway 401 near Cornwall which temporarily closed the road. A second pile-up on Highway 401 near Kingston caused <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> to leaked over 300 liters of fuel into a creek. Another pile-up involving a tractor-trailer was reported on Autoroute 40 west of Montreal forcing the shutdown {{of it as the}} trailer overturned and spilled kerosene on the roadway. Autoroutes 20 and 440 and Highways 132, 138 and 175 north and east of Quebec City were shut down due to heavy and blowing snow.|$|E

25|$|This farm steading, {{previously}} {{known as}} Over Dunlophill Montgomerie, has a U-shaped plan {{and has been}} little modernised since the 19th century, leaving evidence for earlier phases plainly visible. The farm buildings comprise a two-storeyed farmhouse flanked to the south by stables, a harness room and a forge and to the north by a byre and a dairy. A barn and a cart shed are in a detached range to the rear (to the east) of the main block and a small watermill is to the north, adjacent to the dairy. The farm steading is built of whinstone rubble and has slate roofs. It was visited by the RCAHMS in 1993. In the surrounding fields can be seen the earthworks of <b>a</b> <b>rig,</b> some of which is slightly reverse-S in plan. The farm buildings are notable, if not exceptional, for the numerous date stones and marriage stone incorporated into {{various parts of the}} buildings.|$|E
500|$|After {{the move}} to MSR, Beyoncé and her {{production}} team began travelling. In the United Kingdom, they worked at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Wiltshire—particularly using Gabriel's multi-instrument room—to create [...] "Love on Top". Soon after, Beyoncé joined Jay-Z in a Sydney mansion, as {{he was working on}} his collaboration album Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West. There they created a [...] "primitive studio" [...] using a microphone, <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> out and Pro Tools software to record.

500|$|A {{flash flood}} watch was issued {{in advance of}} Debra {{for the whole of}} Louisiana. ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, and other oil {{companies}} shut down operations and evacuated about 1,000 employees from offshore oil rigs in Texas and Louisiana. Despite these evacuations, a [...] wave killed a person at <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> [...] offshore from Cameron. Three evacuation centers in Lake Charles, were set up to help those needing shelter and departing the Cameron area, and the Red Cross opened four shelters at the Calcasieu Parish Public Schools. In Louisiana, more than six thousand people were evacuated from Cameron Parish, as well as an undetermined number from Vermilion Parish.|$|E
500|$|The ships' {{propulsion}} system {{consisted of two}} horizontal 2-cylinder double expansion engines in a single engine room. The engines drove a pair of 3-bladed screws. Steam for the engines was provided by eight coal-fired locomotive boilers. After refits in the early 1890s, the ships' boilers were replaced with newer, more efficient models; Blitz received eight transverse cylindrical boilers, while Pfeil had eight cylindrical boilers installed. The ships were supplied with electrical power with a single [...] generator that operated at 67volts. As built, the ships were fitted with a schooner rig with a sail area of [...] to supplement her steam engines, but this was later reduced to <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> of auxiliary sails with an area of , and the sails were removed entirely by 1900.|$|E
500|$|Like Crazy {{was filmed}} over four weeks—the first three in Los Angeles {{and the last}} in London. The {{production}} budget was $250,000, which included the cost of airfares for the cast and crew. The film was shot on a Canon EOS 7D still camera with cinema lenses, mounted on <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> constructed by cinematographer John Guleserian. He chose the 7D for its portability and the ease it provided for shooting improvised scenes, where he found other cameras too cumbersome. Guleserian said {{that many of the}} film's scenes were shot [...] "really far away from our characters [...] really tight close ups" [...] due to the technological limitations of the camera, but he noted that this added to the tone of the film.|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky saw Hugh Jackman {{perform as}} Peter Allen in the Broadway musical The Boy from Oz and was {{impressed}} with his performance. The director met with Jackman, who sought [...] "a role that could show a lot of dimension," [...] and cast him into the lead role in The Fountain. Jackman starred previously as the muscular character Wolverine in the X-Men films, so for The Fountain, he exercised to adopt a slimmer figure. Jackman practiced t'ai chi for seven months to demonstrate it in a 30-second scene. He also practiced yoga {{for over a year}} to achieve the lotus position for scenes set in space. For these scenes when he is seen in the position in mid-air, he was immersed in a swimming pool and harnessed to <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> that rotated him 360 degrees so his clothes floated freely about him.|$|E
500|$|For a fight scene {{taking place}} {{on top of a}} {{speeding}} bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a greenscreen.

Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Martin Hill said the team adopted a [...] "Google Street View method", explaining [...] "But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built <b>a</b> <b>rig</b> that had eight 45 degree angle Red Epic [...] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if we shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required." ...|$|E
