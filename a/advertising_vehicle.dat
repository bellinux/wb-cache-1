2500|$|Bianca's {{impact on}} daytime {{television}} is considered significant for various reasons: She is {{cited as a}} gay icon by soap opera and gay/lesbian media, and is credited as the first long-term lesbian character on an American soap opera. AfterElton.com, a website {{that focuses on the}} portrayal of gay men in the media, addressed Bianca's impact on viewers. They noted All My Children creator Agnes Nixon having told The Advocate in 2000 that out-lesbian Chastity Bono's memoir was the inspiration for the Bianca storyline, and that she hoped that outing an already-established character as gay would make for a more integrated storyline. AfterElton.com said the representation of gay and lesbian characters in the media is important when taking into account that the viewing audience for soap operas [...] "is enormous." [...] Cited was The Museum of Broadcast Communications' assertion that soap opera is [...] "the most effective and enduring broadcast <b>advertising</b> <b>vehicle</b> ever devised. It is also the most popular genre of television drama in the world today and probably in the history of world broadcasting..." [...] The museum states that [...] "no other form of television fiction has attracted more viewers in more countries {{over a longer period of}} time." [...] Author C. Lee Harrington, in her book Homosexuality on All My Children: Transforming the Daytime Landscape, stated that when [...] "resident villainess" [...] Greenlee Smythe uttered [...] "Bianca is gay" [...] during Bianca's coming-out storyline, it transformed the daytime landscape and ABC's All My Children entered [...] "uncharted territory" [...] for daytime television by revealing a core character as a lesbian.|$|E

5000|$|The {{contents}} of the International Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine have been strongly criticised.

50|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century in the United States, {{baseball}} and photography were both gaining popularity. As a result, baseball clubs began to pose for group and individual pictures, much like members of other clubs and associations posed. Some of these photographs were printed onto small cards similar to modern wallet photos. As baseball increased in popularity and became a professional sport during the late 1860s, trade cards featuring baseball players appeared. These were used {{by a variety of}} companies to promote their business, even if the products being advertised had no connection with baseball. In 1868, Peck and Snyder, a sporting goods store in New York, began producing trade cards featuring baseball teams. Peck and Snyder sold baseball equipment, and the cards were a natural <b>advertising</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The Peck and Snyder cards are sometimes considered the first baseball cards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>advertising</b> of <b>vehicles</b> {{has been}} studied from a safety {{perspective}} but {{not in terms of}} vehicle air pollutants. We aimed to examine the content and trends of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution-related information, in light passenger vehicle advertisements. Methods Content analysis of the two most popular current affairs magazines in New Zealand for the five year period 2001 – 2005 was undertaken (n = 514 advertisements). This was supplemented with vehicle data from official websites. Results The advertisements studied provided some information on fuel type (52 %), and engine size (39 %); but hardly any provided information on fuel efficiency (3 %), or emissions (4 %). Over the five-year period the reported engine size increased significantly, while fuel efficiency did not improve. For the <b>vehicles</b> <b>advertised,</b> for which relevant official website data could be obtained, the average "greenhouse rating" for carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions was 5. 1, with a range from 0. 5 to 8. 5 (on a scale with 10 being the best and 0. 5 being the most polluting). The average CO 2 emissions were 50 % higher than the average for cars made by European manufacturers. The average "air pollution" rating for the <b>advertised</b> <b>vehicles</b> was 5. 4 (on the same 1 – 10 scale). The yearly averages for the "greenhouse" or "air pollution" ratings did not change significantly over the five-year period. One <b>advertised</b> hybrid <b>vehicle</b> had a fuel consumption that was under half the average (4. 4 versus 9. 9 L/ 100 km), as well as the best "greenhouse" and "air pollution" ratings. Conclusion To enhance informed consumer choice and to control greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions, governments should introduce regulations on the content of vehicle advertisements and marketing (as started by the European Union). Similar regulations are already in place for the marketing of many other consumer products. </p...|$|R

50|$|In 1935, Baseball Commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis orchestrated a radio {{deal that}} covered the World Series. All three {{networks}} were involved, and baseball made US$400,000. Landis, as ever, was imperious; he dismissed Ted Husing as games announcer despite the fact that, with five World Series, Husing was {{second only to the}} ubiquitous Graham McNamee in Series-announcing experience. The amount of money involved in baseball broadcasting was growing. Gillette, the razor blade manufacturer {{and one of the first}} companies to realize the power of sports as an <b>advertising</b> <b>vehicle,</b> tried to flex its muscles by offering Red Barber a substantial amount to walk out on his Dodger contract and join Gillette on a new Yankees/Giants network. Barber refused. It's no wonder Gillette felt powerful; in 1946 the company was rich enough to sign a 10-year, $14-million deal for exclusive radio sponsorship of the World Series and All-Star Games.|$|E
50|$|Avalon Hill {{continued}} {{to produce more}} than just wargames, priding itself on other themes, such as party games, sports titles, and children's games. Dunnigan's focus remained primarily on military history, and he {{felt that there was}} a market for detailed historical articles as an accompaniment to detailed and accurate games. (A single experiment in using the S&T game format to explore the use of strategy and tactics in professional sports, Scrimmage, in issue #37, was not repeated.) S&T now embarked on providing six new games a year, and at a much lower cost per game than was to be found elsewhere, with the magazine itself almost being a bonus. There was no middleman {{in the form of a}} local games store; subscribers got their games delivered right to their homes. Circulation of the magazine was substantial and games that might not otherwise sell went to subscribers automatically, eclipsing expected independent sales of most titles. SPI also benefited from having the magazine as an <b>advertising</b> <b>vehicle</b> for boxed (i.e. non-magazine) games, sold directly or through local games stores.|$|E
5000|$|MKE was {{a weekly}} {{publication}} in Milwaukee, Wisconsin published by Journal Communications. Launched on October 28, 2004 as a zero-news-content cross between an alternative weekly and a weekly entertainment magazine aimed at readers under 35, it (along with the online version, MKEOnline.com) {{also served as}} a secondary <b>advertising</b> <b>vehicle</b> for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, its parent publication. At the time of its launch, it was seen as competing for the same readership as the Shepherd Express. A representative for the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies (of which the Shepherd Express was a member) was quoted as saying that three dozen daily newspapers had rolled out weekly free publications during the past year alone. He characterized them as [...] "usually pretty fluffy" [...] and presented with [...] "faux hipness," [...] and said of MKE: [...] "Milwaukee's a little different because they've actually come out and said there's no news at all," [...] and predicted most of the new free newspapers would fail in the long run because they lacked the [...] "idiosyncrasies and oddball charm" [...] of true alternative weeklies.|$|E
