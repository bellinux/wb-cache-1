5|$|Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's 2/2nd Infantry Battalion {{found that}} it was best to keep skirmishing forward {{throughout}} this advance, because going to ground for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time meant sitting {{in the middle of the}} enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.|$|E
5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E
5|$|While the {{original}} settlement at Sheriff Hill developed through {{the growth of}} industry in the area, the suburb today is predominantly residential with no significant industry. The suburb was once considered affluent, but as of 2012, {{almost half of the}} working age population are economically inactive and less than half of households own a car. The area has than higher levels of unemployment in comparison with Gateshead and England: at Broadway, Pottersway and the Avenue, only 23.8% of adults have full-time employment and 10.09% have part-time jobs. Around 3.1% of the population are self-employed. Those in employment work outside the area, except those employed in the suburb's public houses, betting shops or fast-food outlets. Other small shops provide some local employment, but few are open for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time as they cannot compete with larger retailers elsewhere in Gateshead.|$|E

5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time, or if she is in {{certain areas of the}} castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Engelbert Zaschka, a {{pioneering}} German engineer, invented a combined helicopter and autogyro. The principal {{advantage of the}} Zaschka machine is {{in its ability to}} remain motionless in the air for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time and to descend in a vertical line, so that a landing may be accomplished on the flat roof of a large house. In appearance, the machine does not differ much from the ordinary monoplane, but the carrying wings revolve around the body.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{hovering}} {{tests showed}} {{problems and the}} V1 was not to fly until 1940. The engine initially specified, a BMW Bramo 323D proved too fragile when run at high speed for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time, and was replaced with a more robust 1,000hp Bramo 323Q3 in the later prototypes to improve reliability and lifting capability. The biggest problem, however, was the severe vibration caused by unbalanced driveshafts when the rotors moved out of phase, and this could only be fixed by greater attention to detail {{on the part of}} BMW.|$|E
25|$|The roller beam loom is used {{in larger}} Turkish manufactures, but {{is also found in}} Persia and India. It {{consists}} of two movable beams to which the warps are attached.

25|$|The {{fate of the}} French fugitives from Fort Caroline was various and eventful. When Laudonnière {{reached the}} forest, he found there a party of men who had escaped like himself, and {{three or four of}} whom were badly wounded. A {{consultation}} was held as to what steps should be taken, for it was impossible to remain where they were for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time, without food, and exposed at every moment to an attack from the Spaniards. Some of the party determined to take refuge among the natives, and set out for a neighboring Indian village. These were subsequently ransomed by Menéndez and returned by him to France.|$|E
25|$|Those nations {{who managed}} to {{maintain}} their ownership of good lands often farmed successfully. Indigenous people living near the Cowichan and Fraser rivers, and those from Saskatchewan managed to produce good harvests. Since 1881, those First Nations {{people living in the}} prairie provinces required permits from Indian Agents to sell any of their produce. Later the government created a pass system in the old Northwest Territories that required indigenous people to seek written permission from an Indian Agent before leaving their reserves for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time. Indigenous people regularly defied those laws, as well as bans on Sun Dances and potlatches, in an attempt to practice their culture.|$|E

25|$|The strike lasted 172 days, at {{the time}} making it ({{at the time}}) the longest in UAW history and the longest strike in International Harvester history. International Harvester made key errors—including using inexperienced negotiators, going public with {{bargaining}} demands, and attacking key union issues such as seniority {{and the lack of}} mandatory overtime without giving itself room to negotiate—which greatly prolonged the strike. The seeming arrogance of top company officials is {{considered by many to be}} a serious strategic error. Company officials seemed surprised that the union could hold out for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time, and McCardell appeared to assume that the international union staff (not rank and file members) were pushing for a strike.|$|E
25|$|Performance {{art is a}} {{performance}} presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for <b>any</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.|$|E
