5|$|One of {{the roof}} beams has <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> it, a result of cannon fire in the Civil War, when Dunster Castle was a besieged Royalist stronghold for five months {{under the command of}} Colonel Wyndham.

50|$|<b>A</b> pritchel <b>hole</b> is <b>a</b> round <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> anvil. Its {{primary purpose}} is to provide {{clearance}} for punching tools, {{but it can also}} be used to hold tools that have round shanks. Pritchel tools are tools such as punches whose functions do not require them to be held at a particular orientation. <b>A</b> square <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> anvil is called <b>a</b> Hardy <b>hole,</b> not to be confused withtapered square <b>holes</b> seen <b>in</b> tinsmith's equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Hawsehole is a {{nautical}} {{term for}} <b>a</b> small <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> {{the hull of}} a ship through which hawsers may be passed.

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage. Capt. Willis of the Lucinda saw no one other than Jackalow (whom he blamed for the collision) on board the Spray, and Jackalow refused to be rescued and taken aboard the Lucinda. Willis observed that {{the deck of the}} Spray was strewn with bedding and other articles from the cabin.|$|E
5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It!

5|$|Bond {{encounters}} Chinese agent Wai Lin, {{who is also}} {{investigating the}} matter and the two agree to work together. They discover that Carver had used the GPS encoder to push the British ship off course and into Chinese waters to incite a war for ratings. With the British fleet {{on their way to}} China, Bond and Wai Lin find Carver's stealth ship, board it and prevent the firing of a British cruise missile at Beijing. They blow <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.|$|E
5|$|Dibnah {{had watched}} the {{activities}} of steeplejacks throughout his childhood, and witnessed his first chimney felling from his father's allotment near Bolton's greyhound track at Raikes Park. The steeplejacks first removed {{the top of the}} chimney and then created <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> its base, propped with blocks of wood. They then lit a fire, destroying the supports and causing the chimney to collapse. Unfortunately, on this occasion the chimney fell in the wrong direction, onto the greyhound track's dog kennels, a local cafe and a series of power cables.|$|E
5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> {{the upper part of}} the ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E

5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} a {{classified}} S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, tensions among the agents are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to double-cross Coulson and secure the 0-8-4 for her government. Together, the agents devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing the agents to subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training. Skye secretly confirms her allegiance to the hacktivist group the Rising Tide.|$|E
5|$|Following the victory, Maryland {{patrolled the}} {{southern}} approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks. On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a kamikaze aircraft surprised and struck Maryland. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turrets No. 1 and 2, piercing the forecastle, main, and armored decks and blowing <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the 4-inch steel, causing extensive damage and starting fires. In all, 31 men {{were killed and}} 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed but still functional.|$|E
50|$|In quantum mechanics, {{the black}} hole emits Hawking {{radiation}} and so can come to thermal equilibrium with a gas of radiation (not compulsory). Because a thermal-equilibrium state is time-reversal-invariant, Stephen Hawking argued that the time reverse of <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> thermal equilibrium is again <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> thermal equilibrium. This may imply that black holes and white holes are the same object. The Hawking radiation from <b>an</b> ordinary black <b>hole</b> is then identified with the white-hole emission. Hawking's semi-classical argument is reproduced in a quantum mechanical AdS/CFT treatment, where <b>a</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> anti-de Sitter space is described by a thermal gas in a gauge theory, whose time reversal {{is the same as}} itself.|$|R

5|$|Following this action, Frederick sent Wunsch into Saxony with a {{corps of}} 10,00012,000 men {{in his first}} {{independent}} command. There he participated in the Battle of Hoyerswerda with General Frederick August Finck. Prince Henry, in overall command of the army, surprised von Daun at Hoyerswerda by punching <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the Austrian defensive line. This success gave Frederick the first good news he had had in weeks and confirmed to Frederick that Wunsch had been worthy of the trust placed in him.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, {{a scarlet}} ibis {{escaped from the}} zoo and went on the loose in the city after a {{squirrel}} had chewed <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the netting {{at the top of}} its cage. Keepers noticed it was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 miles away in Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006 Krka {{was damaged}} during an {{overhaul}} at the Šibenik Shipyard. While being lowered to the sea, the winch of the syncrolift {{pulled out of}} the concrete causing the ship to fall down, creating <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries.|$|E
