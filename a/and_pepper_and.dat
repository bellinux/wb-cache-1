5|$|The Gangavadi region {{consisted}} of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, betel leaves, cardamom <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>and</b> the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds {{and it was also}} the base for cattle farming. The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane, paddy, coconut, areca nut (adeka totta), betel leaves, plantain and flowers (vara vana) were common. Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (Katta). Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} recipes for cholent. Ingredients vary {{according}} to the geographic areas of Europe where the Jews lived and especially the personal preferences of the cook. The core ingredient of a traditional cholent is beef, usually shoulder, brisket, flanken, or any other cut that becomes tender and flavorful in long slow cooking. The meat is placed in a pot with peeled potatoes, any type or size of beans, and grains (barley, hulled wheat, rice). The mixture is lightly seasoned, mainly salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper,</b> <b>and</b> water is added to the pot to create a stew-like consistency during slow cooking.|$|E
500|$|Basic {{preparation}} of a Caesar follows the [...] "one, two, three, four" [...] rule. [...] The recipe calls for 1–1½ oz of vodka, two dashes of hot sauce, three dashes {{of salt and}} pepper, four dashes of Worcestershire sauce and topped with 4–6 oz of caesar mix and served with ice. [...] The ingredients are poured into a glass rimmed with celery salt or a mixture of salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>and</b> garnished with a celery stalk and lime. The Caesar is an unusual drink in {{that it can be}} mixed in bulk and stored {{for a period of time}} before drinking.|$|E

Although he never publicly revealed the recipe, he admitted to the use of salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper,</b> <b>and</b> claimed that the ingredients [...] "stand on everybody's shelf". After being recommissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by Governor Lawrence Wetherby, Sanders began to dress the part, growing a goatee and wearing a black frock coat (later switched to a white suit), a string tie, and referring to himself as [...] "Colonel". His associates went along with the title change, [...] "jokingly at first and then in earnest", according to biographer Josh Ozersky.|$|E

500|$|Sanders was {{dissatisfied}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, {{but he did not}} want to deep fry. Although a much faster process, in Sanders' opinion it produced dry and crusty chicken that was unevenly cooked. On the other hand, if he prepared the chicken in advance of an order, there was sometimes waste at the end of the day. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, predominantly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to prepare chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, yet, in Sanders' opinion, retained the quality of pan-fried chicken. In July 1940, Sanders finalized what came to be known as his Original Recipe of 11 herbs and spices. Although he never publicly revealed the recipe, he admitted to the use of salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper,</b> <b>and</b> claimed that the ingredients [...] "stand on everybody's shelf".|$|E

[...] Many recipes use only vinegar <b>and</b> <b>pepper,</b> <b>and</b> rely on the smoking process for the overall flavor.|$|E

2500|$|A {{high-quality}} hamburger patty is made {{entirely of}} ground (minced) beef and seasonings; {{these may be}} described as [...] "all-beef hamburger" [...] or [...] "all-beef patties" [...] to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added flour, textured vegetable protein, ammonia treated defatted beef trimmings (which the company Beef Products Inc, calls [...] "lean finely textured beef"), advanced meat recovery, or other fillers. In the 1930s ground liver was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like eggs or breadcrumbs. Seasonings may include salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>and</b> others like as parsley, onions, soy sauce, Thousand Island dressing, onion soup mix, or Worcestershire sauce. Many name brand seasoned salt products are also used.|$|E
