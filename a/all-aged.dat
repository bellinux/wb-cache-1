5|$|Nagle {{acquired}} {{her first}} Irish Setter, whom she named Sulhamstead D'Or, in 1924 {{to keep a}} wolfhound puppy company. In April 1930 she entered him into the <b>All-Aged</b> Stakes at the Kennel Club field trials. In August 1932 she entered a dog named Sulhamstead Token D'Or into the Scottish Field Trials in the same category. At the Kennel Club field trials of April 1933, Nagle entered Sulhamstead Bob D'Or into the <b>All-Aged</b> Stakes and the judge awarded her the prize presented by the Irish Setter Association of England. In September 1934, she entered her Irish Setter Sulhamstead Snip D'Or into the Novice Stake of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society's 12th working trials at Pynes, near Exeter.|$|E
25|$|Back in Sydney for {{the autumn}} of 2000, Sunline powered through the rain-affected {{going to win the}} Apollo Stakes (1,400 metres) first-up. Remarkably, in her entire career, she was never beaten over the distance. She then carried the maximum topweight (60 {{kilograms}}) to win the first of two Coolmore Classics - at the time, Australia's only Group One race for fillies and mares (three years and over). At her next start, she carried 57.5 kilograms (9 st. 1lb.) in the Doncaster Handicap and was narrowly defeated by the lightly weighted three-year-old Over. Meeting again a week later, in the <b>All-Aged</b> Stakes, Sunline relished the return to weight for age conditions - easily accounting for Georgie Boy, with Over in third place, to make it three wins from four starts this campaign.|$|E
25|$|Four {{months after}} his run in Dubai, Heart's Cry {{appeared}} at Ascot Racecourse in England for Britain's most prestigious <b>all-aged</b> race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Lemaire claimed {{to be full of}} confidence before the race and Heart's Cry's participation attracted a large Japanese media contingent. Starting the 3/1 second favourite, he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the final furlong and finished third behind Hurricane Run and Electrocutionist. After his race at Ascot, Heart's Cry did not run again until the Japan Cup on 29 November. He started the 5.8/1 second favourite but ran disappointingly, finishing tenth of the eleven runners behind Deep Impact. After the race the Japan Racing Association announced that the horse had developed breathing problems which may have affected his performance, and his retirement was announced in early December.|$|E
25|$|Three {{weeks after}} her disappointing {{run in the}} Eclipse, Time Charter was one of nine horses to contest the thirty-third running of Britain's most prestigious <b>all-aged</b> race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over {{one and a half}} mile at Ascot. The 48-year-old veteran Joe Mercer took over from Newnes, who had been seriously injured in a fall on the {{training}} gallops nine days earlier. She started third favourite at odds of 5/1 behind the three-year-olds Caerleon and Sun Princess with the other runners including Awaasif, Lemhi Gold, Diamond Shoal and Lancastrian. Mercer held the filly up {{at the back of the}} field and was still five lengths behind the leaders when Diamond Shoal struck for home two furlongs from the finish. Time Charter made rapid progress on the outside to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by three-quarters of a length and a length from Diamond Shoal and Sun Princess.|$|E
500|$|In July 1935 Nagle {{entered the}} field {{trials of the}} Irish Setter Association near Ruabon in North Wales, {{competing}} in the Open Stake for Irish Setters and the Puppy Stake for Irish Setters, for puppies which were born the previous year. At the 35th International Gun Dog League trials held at Douglas Castle in August 1935, she was awarded a diploma in the Champion Stakes for Pointers and Setters. The following month, Nagle took the silver perpetual challenge trophy in the Open Stake of the field trials of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society at Newlyn, near Newquay, competing with her Irish Setter Sulhamstead Baffle D'Or. At the Kennel Club field trials for pointers and setters in April 1936, she entered Sulhamstead Bluff D'Or into the <b>All-Aged</b> Stake and was awarded the Penheale Challenge Cup by Captain N. R. Colville for the [...] "best constitutioned dog or bitch, displaying the greatest game-finding ability". At the 18th annual Scottish Field Trial Association's field trials for pointers and setters at Yester estate in Gifford, East Lothian, Scotland in August 1936, Nagle won first prize in the Brace Stake with Sulhamstead Bluff D'Or. The Kennel Club own a pastel painting by Cecil Aldin of two of Nagle's Irish Setters, the Field Trial Champions Sulhamstead Sheilin D'Or and Sulhamstead Valla D'Or. Field trials saw a general downturn in popularity of Irish Setters competing in the 1930s; during the following decade the breed was principally represented by Nagle's dogs. Nagle had eighteen Irish Setter field trial champions during the period she {{was active in the}} breed from the 1920s to the mid-1960s. The male dog Harlequin of Knockalla was pivotal in the revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed in the 1970s; he was a descendant of Nagle's Irish Setter Sulhamstead Natty D'Or, so the Sulhamstead bloodline is behind most modern day red and whites. Nagle withdrew from the field-trial scene in the mid-1960s following the retirement of her handler, George Abbott.|$|E
2500|$|At {{her next}} start, {{she carried the}} number one saddlecloth to victory in Doncaster Handicap. With 58 kilos, she {{defeated}} Shogun Lodge (who also carried 58 kilos) and Defier (who carried 51.5 kilos but was trapped wide). She closed her campaign with a six length victory in the weight-for age <b>All-Aged</b> Stakes. By winning these races, {{she became the first}} horse in Australasia to pass the $11 million mark in career earnings and with 13 Group One wins, she was within one of Kingston Town's record of 14 Group One races.|$|E
2500|$|At Doncaster in September Lord Lyon {{defeated}} Savernake [...] "by sheer gameness and stamina" [...] in the St Leger, winning by a head {{after what}} {{was described as}} one of the most exciting races seen in many years. The win completed what is now known as the Triple Crown, although it was not referred to as such in contemporary sources. On the day following his win in the St Leger, he finished second to Rama in the Doncaster Cup over two and a half miles. In October, Lord Lyon was sent to Newmarket, where he won the Select Stakes and the Grand Duke Michael Stakes and was second to the two-year-old colt Friponnier in the <b>All-aged</b> Stakes. Also at Newmarket he ran a match race against Rustic and reversed the result of his Ascot defeat to take the £1,000 stake by a margin of 20 lengths.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 September, Kingcraft started 2/1 {{favourite}} for the St Leger at Doncaster {{ahead of}} Palmerston and Sunlight. Tom French held Kingcraft {{up in the}} early stages before producing him on the inside {{to take the lead in}} the straight. He looked the likely winner until Hawthornden emerged with a strong challenge on the wide outside. Inside the final furlong Kingcraft was overtaken and beaten half a length in an exciting finish. Later at the same meeting he ran in the Doncaster Stakes over one and a half miles in which he started favourite at 7/4 but finished fourth of the five runners behind Enterprise. In October, Kingcraft ran four times at Newmarket, but his only success came when he walked over in the Select Stakes. He finished second in a Triennial Stakes, fourth in the Newmarket St Leger and fourth in the <b>All-Aged</b> Stakes. His performances led to speculation that his hard race in the St Leger had [...] "subdued his spirit" ...|$|E
2500|$|In autumn, Price sent Carry Back to France {{to prepare}} for a run in Europe's most famous <b>all-aged</b> race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. This was a very unusual move in 1962, when trans-Atlantic travel for race horses was a {{difficult}} process. American horses such as Reigh Count and Omaha had been successful in Europe, but only after long periods of acclimatization. Arriving in France in mid-September, Price had only three weeks to prepare Carry Back for the unfamiliar conditions including the turf surface and clockwise track. Price booked the British-based Australian rider Scobie Breasley to ride the American challenger, a move that attracted the approval of experts including Eddie Arcaro who stated that an American jockey would be [...] "buried riding low on that Longchamp track". Breasley placed Carry Back on the wide outside of the field, (following Price's orders to [...] "stay out of trouble") and was never in contention. He finished tenth, beaten by five and a half lengths by the 40/1 long-shot Soltikoff. Price was unhappy at the result and issued a challenge to the owners of the first five horses for a winner-take-all rematch at $25,000 each. The connections of the filly Monade accepted, but the other owners declined.|$|E
2500|$|Six {{weeks later}} (on 13 November 1862) Archer won his second Melbourne Cup {{carrying}} [...] – – at 2–1 odds {{in a time}} of 3:47.0. The race, held before a crowd of about 7,000 (nearly double the previous year's crowd), had 20 starters– the largest field of horses ever to start in Australia at that time. Again it was an exciting race; Cutts initially reined Archer back so that he was running last by several lengths, and appeared {{to be out of the}} running. He then gradually passed his opponents until reaching the leaders, when the long-striding horse galloped into first place. Archer won by eight lengths, with Mormon again running second. His winning margin is the Melbourne Cup record, unmatched until 1969 by Rain Lover. With a larger field meaning a larger sweepstake, Archer won 810 gold sovereigns and a trophy (a hand-beaten gold watch). Winning the Melbourne Cup two years in a row was a feat not repeated until Peter Pan won the race twice more than 70 years later. Two days later, Archer won the one-mile <b>All-Aged</b> Stakes at Flemington. Archer, Exeter and de Mestre arrived back in Sydney on the steamer Wonga Wonga on 29 November. The following week they caught another steamer to Wollongong, and traveled overland the 50 miles (80km) to Terara.|$|E
2500|$|... from a {{penicillin}} allergy. Fifth-born and {{youngest daughter}} Rosemary {{won the first}} talent contest she entered - an <b>all-aged</b> event at St Columb's Hall when she was six. During her childhood she was taught {{to play the piano}} and violin, taught herself to play the acoustic guitar, sang in the school choir, and at one point, after years of ballet practice, considered becoming a ballet teacher. She took part in many more music and dance contests. In the early 1960s, she began performing with her sisters Eileen and Susan in charity concerts organised by their father. Then Eileen left the trio to become a hairdresser, leaving the others as a duo, who later managed to secure a summer season at the Portrush Palladium. Their Aunt Rosaleen in 1964 contacted a friend in the music business, arranger Frank Barber, and that led to Decca Records offering them a recording contract. Susan declined the offer, choosing instead to get married and emigrated to the United States with her husband, a member of the USAF. In 1965, the now solo Rosemary Brown took part in a local talent contest at the Embassy Ballroom, where she won first prize – a chance to record a demo tape. Tony Johnston, a headmaster and part-time promoter who sponsored the competition, took her under his wing while she continued with her studies at Thornhill College, the Roman Catholic grammar school for girls she joined in 1963.|$|E
