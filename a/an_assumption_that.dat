5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|Gleason's theorem {{implies the}} nonexistence of {{certain types of}} hidden {{variable}} theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John von Neumann. Von Neumann had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> quantum systems obeyed a form of additivity of expectation for noncommuting operators that might not hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem {{could be used to}} remove this extra assumption from von Neumann's argument.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} album credits, Harrison {{was listed as}} producer, writer and arranger but was not included among the performers, leading to <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> he did not play on the recordings. After consulting Barham in 2002 for his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Leng credited Harrison as a performing musician, and Spizer also recognised him in his track-by-track list, published in 2005. The performer credits in the 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music rectified the situation, and list Harrison on piano and guitar.|$|E

5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of a painting by American artist Bob Gill in which, as in Massot's film, two contrasting worlds are separated by a wall, with only a small gap allowing visual access between them. Harrison omitted his name {{from the list of}} performing musicians, leading to <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> he had merely produced and arranged the music. The 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music recognises his contributions on keyboards and guitar. The album was first remastered for CD release in 1992, for which former Apple executive Derek Taylor supplied a liner-note essay.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Rob LaZebnik, {{inspired}} by when his teenage son came out. Critical reception was mixed: the emotionally touching aspects of LaZebnik's script and Harry Shearer's portrayal of Smithers were praised. However, criticisms included the plot possibly ending the innuendo-driven humor involving Smithers' secret love of Burns, and <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the character was being retconned due to changing attitudes on homosexuality since the series' debut. The episode was covered by international media.|$|E
5|$|The first area {{of major}} dispute was the manner {{by which the}} lower house would be apportioned. A {{minority}} {{wanted it to be}} apportioned so that all states would have equal weight, though this was never seriously considered. Most wanted it apportioned in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its difficulty, and <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> property would closely correlate to population.|$|E
40|$|There is <b>a</b> deeper <b>assumption</b> {{underlying}} adoption {{studies that}} is often not acknowledged by either adoption study researchers or their critics, and it is <b>an</b> <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> {{is at least as}} important as the two considered by Richardson and Norgate: the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the heritability statistics generated by adoption studies are informative about something of consequence. Although Richardson and Norgate’s paper presents several valid criticisms of adoption studies of IQ that lead them to suggest a ‘radical reappraisal’ of such studies, a reappraisal even more radical than the one they suggest might, in fact, be warranted...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} problem asks {{to construct}} a reactive finite-state system from an ω-regular specification. Initial specifications are often unrealizable, which {{means that there is}} no system that implements the specification. A common reason for unrealizability is <b>that</b> <b>assumptions</b> on the environment of the system are incomplete. We study the problem of correcting an unrealizable specification ϕ by computing <b>an</b> environment <b>assumption</b> ψ such <b>that</b> the new specification ψ → ϕ is realizable. Our aim is to construct <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> ψ <b>that</b> constrains only the environment and is as weak as possible. We present a two-step algorithm for computing assumptions. The algorithm operates on the game graph that is used to answer the realizability question. First, we compute <b>a</b> safety <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> removes <b>a</b> minimal set of environment edges from the graph. Second, we compute <b>a</b> liveness <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> puts fairness conditions on some of the remaining environment edges. We show that the problem of finding a minimal set of fair edges is computationally hard, and we use probabilistic games to compute a locally minimal fairness assumption...|$|R

5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E
5|$|WASP-44 is a G-type star in {{constellation}} Cetus {{that has}} the Jupiter-size planet WASP-44b in orbit. The star is slightly less massive and slightly smaller than the Sun; it is also slightly cooler, but is more metal-rich. The star was observed by SuperWASP, an organization in search of planets, starting in 2009; manual follow-up observations used WASP-44's spectrum and measurements of its radial velocity led {{to the discovery of}} the transiting planet WASP-44b. The planet and its star were presented along with WASP-45b and WASP-46b on May 17, 2011 by a team of scientists testing the idea that Hot Jupiters tend to have circular orbits, <b>an</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> is made when the orbital eccentricity of such planets are not well-constrained.|$|E
