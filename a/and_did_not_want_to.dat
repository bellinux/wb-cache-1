5|$|For {{the opening}} credits, Maurice Binder had {{disagreements}} with the producers <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> return. Designer Robert Brownjohn stepped into his place, and projected the credits on female dancers, inspired by constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy projecting light onto {{clouds in the}} 1920s. Brownjohn's work started the tradition of scantily clad women in the Bond films' title sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} physical release features 25 tracks. The music {{begins on}} track 13 and ends on track 25, starting the album with 12 hidden tracks consisting of five seconds of silence each, totaling 60 seconds of silence {{out of respect}} for a deceased fan, who also had track 10, or track 22, (Justin) named after him. Later prints move the silent tracks after the music. In interviews Jon Davis also mentioned he was very superstitious <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> end an album on track 13.|$|E
5|$|Badmotorfinger was Soundgarden's {{first album}} with bassist Ben Shepherd, {{who joined the}} group in April 1990. Shepherd {{replaced}} previous bassist Jason Everman. The album was recorded {{in the spring of}} 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again seeing as the band had a good relationship with him <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go through the pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E

5|$|Iwane Matsui {{was born}} in Nagoya on July 27, 1878. He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, an impoverished samurai and former {{retainer}} to the daimyō of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After completing elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father's debts <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> burden him financially. Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted {{for a career in}} the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E
5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> deviate from them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnati Reds drafted Mottola in {{the first}} round of the 1992 Major League Baseball draft with the fifth overall {{selection}}, one selection ahead of Derek Jeter. He signed with the Reds the day of the draft, receiving a signing bonus of $400,000, as he attended the United States national baseball team tryouts for the 1992 Summer Olympics, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have his contract status on his mind during the tryouts. He was the first UCF athlete to be selected {{in the first}} round of an MLB draft.|$|E

5|$|The Region 1 disc is by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, and was {{released}} on February 20, 2007, and is available on DVD and BD formats. The Warner Bros. Region 2 DVD {{was released}} on March 12, 2007. It is also available in both BD and regionless HD DVD in Europe (before HD DVD was cancelled). Special features are minimal, with the documentary Director's Notebook: The Prestige – Five Making-of Featurettes, running roughly twenty minutes combined, an art gallery and the trailer. Nolan did not contribute to a commentary as he felt the film primarily relied on an audience's reaction <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> remove the mystery from the story.|$|E
5|$|When the Communists won the Civil War and {{established}} the People's Republic in 1949, Hu Lanqi was in Shanghai with her Communist friends. She celebrated when the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai. Her fiancé Chen Yi, {{whom she had}} not seen since 1937, was appointed Shanghai's first mayor under the new regime. However, when she tried to contact Chen, she was told that he had already married <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> meet her. Disappointed, she helped some Buddhist friends set up a vegetarian restaurant in Shanghai, before moving to Beijing, where an old friend from her European days helped her secure a job as an accountant in a college.|$|E
5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, {{though he did not}} tell the Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see him gain high office.|$|E

5|$|Still Impressed with Riefenstahl's work, Hitler {{asked her}} to film Triumph des Willens ("Triumph of the Will"), a new {{propaganda}} film about the 1934 party rally in Nuremberg. More than one million Germans participated in the rally. Initially, according to Riefenstahl, she resisted <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> create further Nazi Party films, instead wanting to direct a feature film based on Hitler's favourite opera, Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland ("Lowlands"). Riefenstahl received private funding {{for the production of}} Tiefland, but the filming in Spain was derailed and the project was cancelled. Hitler was able to convince her to film Triumph des Willens on the condition that she would not be required to make further films for the party, according to Riefenstahl. The motion picture was generally recognized as an epic, innovative work of propaganda filmmaking. The film took Riefenstahl's career to a new level and gave her further international recognition.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{air forces}} began pre-invasion raids on western New Britain on 13November. Few attacks {{were made on}} the Arawe area, however, as the Allies hoped to achieve {{tactical}} surprise for the landing <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> alert the Japanese to their intentions. Instead, heavy attacks were made against Gasmata, Ring Ring Plantation and Lindenhafen Plantation on New Britain's south coast. The Arawe area was struck {{for the first time}} on 6December and again on 8December; little opposition was encountered on either occasion. It was not until 14December—the day before the landing—that heavy air attacks on Arawe were conducted; Allied aircraft flew 273 sorties against targets on New Britain's south coast that day. In addition to these air raids, a force comprising two Australian and two American destroyers (designated Task Force74.2) bombarded the Gasmata area during the night of 29/30November.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons {{to turn down the}} Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} for a military co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> jeopardize these negotiations. In addition, the violent collectivization, purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union had given the country a bad reputation. Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore seem to be a reliable contracting party. The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E

5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him {{for the rest of the}} shoot.|$|E
