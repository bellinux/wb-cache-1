5|$|Hans Peter Waldmann (24 September 1922 – 18 March 1945) was a German Luftwaffe (Air Force) fighter ace and {{recipient}} of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. Waldmann received the award after he had shot down 85 enemy aircraft. In total, he was credited with 134 aerial victories <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> 527 combat missions.|$|E
5|$|In central Oregon, Siletzia forms a {{platform}} {{on which the}} older, now defunct volcanoes of the Western Cascades rest. The younger High Cascades to the east are believed to rest on sediments that <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the basin between Siletzia and the continent.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Wales {{is complex}} and varied. The {{earliest}} outcropping rocks are from the Precambrian era, some 700 Mya, and are found in Anglesey, the Llŷn peninsula, southwestern Pembrokeshire and in places near the English border. During the Lower Palaeozoic, as seas periodically flooded the land and retreated again, thousands of metres of sedimentary and volcanic rocks <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> a marine basin known as the Welsh Basin.|$|E

5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|An Environmental Protection Act in 1991 {{prohibited}} importing {{radioactive material}} for long-term storage or burial in Russia, but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage {{was passed by}} the Russian Parliament and signed by President Putin in 2001. In the long term, the Russian plan is for deep geologic disposal. Most {{attention has been paid to}} locations where waste has <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> temporary storage at Mayak, near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains, and in granite at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.|$|E
5|$|An {{argument}} against herding is that juvenile remains are very uncommon at this site, unlike modern cases with herd mortality. They more likely were the periodic victims of flash floods whose carcasses <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> a lake or marshy setting. The Nehden find, however, with its greater span of individual ages, more even mix of Dollodon or Mantellisaurus to Iguanodon bernissartensis, and confined geographic nature, may record mortality of herding animals migrating through rivers.|$|E

By November, {{a backlog of}} 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment intended for the Philippines had <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels. In addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as Station CAST, had an ultra secret Purple cipher machine, which decrypted Japanese diplomatic messages, and partial codebooks for the latest JN-25 naval code. Station CAST sent MacArthur its entire output, via Sutherland, the only officer on his staff authorized to see it.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E

Translating mRNAs {{can be found in}} polysomes, mRNAs stalled <b>in</b> translation initiation <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> stress granules and mRNAs targeted for degradation or translation repression can <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> P bodies. Partitioning of mRNAs between polysomes, stress granules, and P bodies affects rates of translation and mRNA degradation. Host proteins within P bodies and stress granules can enhance or limit viral infection, and some viral RNAs and proteins <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> P bodies and/or stress granules. Thus, an important interplay among P bodies, stress granules, and viral life cycles is beginning to emerge...|$|R

5|$|Problems {{with water}} quality {{in some of}} the former Manchester Docks basins became {{apparent}} with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality {{to such an extent that}} the number of invertebrate species present, like freshwater shrimp, increased by more than30. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|The Plague of Justinian and the Arab conquests would {{represent}} a substantial reversal of fortunes contributing to a period of stagnation and decline.

5|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy {{to be harvested}} to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere and {{gave rise to the}} ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The final rankings {{were based}} on points <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> matches against the other teams in the medal round. Despite the common {{misconception}} that the Americans won gold the night they beat the Soviets, this did not occur until February 24 when they defeated Finland 4–2 and finished the tournament undefeated. The Soviets finished with silver; Sweden won the bronze. In 2008, the IIHF picked the Miracle on Ice as the top international hockey story of the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of general population poisoning as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing. In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations contaminated the Jinzū River in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including proteinuria and glucosuria.|$|E

40|$|The {{cytoplasm}} {{seems to}} provide an environment that favors conversion of the prion protein (PrP) to a form with the physical characteristics of the PrPSc conformation, which is associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. However, {{it is not clear}} whether PrP would ever exist in the cytoplasm under normal circumstances. We report that PrP <b>accumulates</b> <b>in</b> the cytoplasm when proteasome activity is compromised. The accumulated PrP seems to have been subjected to the normal proteolytic cleavage events associated with N- and C-terminal processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that it arrives in the cytoplasm through retrograde transport. In the cytoplasm, PrP forms aggregates, often in association with Hsc 70. With prolonged incubation, these aggregates <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> an “aggresome”-like state, surrounding the centrosome. A mutant (D 177 N), which is associated with a heritable and transmissible form of the spongiform encephalopathies, is less efficiently trafficked to the surface than wild-type PrP and <b>accumulates</b> <b>in</b> the cytoplasm even without proteasome inhibition. These results demonstrate that PrP can <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> the cytoplasm and is likely to enter this compartment through normal protein quality-control pathways. Its potential to <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> the cytoplasm has implications for pathogenesis...|$|R
