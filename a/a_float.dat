5|$|Python {{provides}} a round function for rounding <b>a</b> <b>float</b> {{to the nearest}} integer. For tie-breaking, versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0. Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) is 2, round(2.5) is 2.|$|E
5|$|Donatian {{stands in}} front of a set of windows that are just outside the {{pictorial}} space. He holds a jewelled processional cross in his left hand, and a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right. The wheel is his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the Tiber, but was saved after Pope Dionysius threw him a carriage wheel he was able to use as <b>a</b> <b>float.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by <b>a</b> <b>float</b> if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>floating</b> {{exchange}} rate or fluctuating exchange or flexible {{exchange rate}} {{is a type of}} exchange-rate regime in which a currency's value is allowed to fluctuate in response to foreign-exchange market mechanisms. A currency that uses <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rate is known as <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> currency. <b>A</b> <b>floating</b> currency is contrasted with a fixed currency whose value is tied to that of another currency, material goods or to a currency basket.|$|R

5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between <b>a</b> <b>float</b> at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) {{side of the}} home, near the {{carriage}} house, is a miniature Stick style house known as Little House. Little House is 13 feet (4 m) by 15 feet (4.6 m) and stands 14 feet (4.3 m) above its concrete foundation. The Little House's roof is an exact replica of the original roof of the Ellwood House. Little House was built in 1892 with assistance from every carpenter in DeKalb; the house was {{to be used as}} <b>a</b> <b>float</b> in a local parade. After the parade Isaac Ellwood's son, Will, bought the house and had it placed on the Ellwood House property in the same location it stands today. The house was used by Will's two daughters and later by Perry Ellwood's children.|$|E

25|$|The {{floating}} charge cannot normally be enforced {{until it has}} crystallised (and thus, effectively, become a fixed charge) and so most statutes provide that the priority of a fixed charge that was created as <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge is treated as <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge.|$|R
5|$|The America's Response Monument, a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue {{commemorating the}} actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces {{in the first few}} weeks of the War in Afghanistan, was {{unveiled}} to the public during the Veteran's Day Parade in New York City on November 11, 2011. The statue was displayed on <b>a</b> <b>float,</b> which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street. It was dedicated that same day, in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan. It was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero.|$|E

50|$|Re Brightlife Ltd 1987 1 Ch 200 is a UK {{insolvency}} law case, concerning {{the conversion of}} <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge into <b>a</b> fixed charge ("crystallisation"). It held that an automatic crystallisation clause {{was part of the}} parties’ freedom of contract. It could not be limited by court created public policy exceptions. The significance of the case was largely outpaced by the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251, which said <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge was one that was created as <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge.|$|R
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>floating</b> {{dormitory}} is <b>a</b> water-borne {{vessel that}} provides, as its primary function, living quarters for students enrolled at an educational institution. [...] <b>A</b> <b>floating</b> dormitory {{functions as a}} conventional land-based dormitory in all respects except that the living quarters are aboard <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> vessel. [...] <b>A</b> <b>floating</b> dormitory is most often moored in place near the host educational facility and is not used for water transport. [...] Dormitory ships may also refer to vessels that provide water-borne housing in support of non-academic enterprises such as off-shore oil drilling operations. [...] Other vessels containing living quarters for students as ancillary support to the vessel's primary function — such as for providing maritime or other training given aboard the vessel — are more appropriately categorized as training ships.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{decision}} was handed down the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 was passed into law as a response. [...] The effect of that statute was to provide that certain classes of preferred creditors would take priority over the claims of a secured creditor under <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge. However, the effectiveness of that Act was limited {{by the fact that}} <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge crystallises into a fixed charge prior to enforcement, and so {{it was not until the}} Insolvency Act 1986 modified the provision to state that <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge include any charge which was created as <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> charge (i.e. irrespective of subsequent crystallisation) that priority of the preferred creditors was promoted ahead of the floating chargeholders.|$|R

25|$|Once <b>a</b> <b>float</b> {{lands on}} a beach, it may {{roll in the}} surf and become etched by sand. Many glass floats show {{distinctive}} wear patterns from the corrosive forces of sand, sun, and salt water. When old netting breaks off of <b>a</b> <b>float,</b> its pattern often remains {{on the surface of}} the glass where the glass was protected under the netting. Other floats have small amounts of water trapped inside of them. This water apparently enters the floats through microscopic imperfections in the glass while the floats are suspended in Arctic ice or held under water by netting.|$|E
