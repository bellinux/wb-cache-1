50|$|An <b>actant</b> {{can also}} be {{described}} as a binary opposition pairing, such as a hero paired with a villain, a dragon paired with a dragon slaying sword, a helper paired with an opponent. Actantal relationships are therefore incredibly useful in generating problems within a narrative that have to be overcome, providing contrast, or in defining an antagonistic force within the narrative. However, the same character can simultaneously have a different <b>actant</b> (or way of concern) in regard to a different sequence of action, event or episode in the story. Therefore, it should be distinguished from a character's consistent role in the story like the archetype of a character. The concept of <b>actant</b> is important in structuralism of narratology to regard each situation as the minimum independent unit of story.|$|E

40|$|The central aim of {{this book}} is to present a new {{approach}} to “the field of musical improvisation” (FMI), a theory which understands improvisation as a nonlinear dynamic and complex system. The study provocatively argues that during an improvisation more <b>actants</b> are “at work” than musicians alone: space, acoustics, instruments, audience, technicians, musical and socio-cultural backgrounds, technology, and the like all play a significant role. However, not all of these <b>actants</b> determine every improvisation to the same extent; some are more prominent and active than others in certain situations (periods, styles, cultures, as well as more singular circumstances). Therefore, the FMI theory will prove {{to be more than a}} theory dealing with improvisation “in general”. Rather, FMI emphasizes singularity: each improvisation thus yields a different network of <b>actants</b> and interactions, a unique configuration or assembly...|$|R
50|$|Tesnière {{used the}} word actants to mean what are now widely called {{arguments}} (and sometimes complements). An important aspect of Tesnière's understanding of valency was that the subject is an <b>actant</b> (=argument, complement) of the verb {{in the same manner}} that the object is. The concept of subcategorization, which is related to valency but associated more with phrase structure grammars than with the dependency grammar that Tesnière developed, did not originally view the subject as part of the subcategorization frame, although the more modern understanding of subcategorization seems to be almost synonymous with valency.|$|E
5000|$|Algirdas Julien Greimas (1917-1992), {{professor}} of semiotics, is widely credited with producing the actantial model in 1966.

[...] Each of these roles fulfill an integral {{component of the}} story, or, narrative. Without the contribution of each <b>actant,</b> the story may be incomplete.

50|$|Within a meta-narrative {{systematic}} review {{of research in}} the field, there exist a number of different philosophical approaches to the EHR. The health information systems literature has seen the EHR as a container holding information about the patient, and a tool for aggregating clinical data for secondary uses (billing, audit etc.). However, other research traditions see the EHR as a contextualised artifact within a socio-technical system. For example, actor-network theory would see the EHR as an <b>actant</b> in a network, while research in computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) sees the EHR as a tool supporting particular work.|$|E
5000|$|Rhizomeatic/assemblage antenarrative, is the antenarrative {{process that}} is not {{theoretically}} causal, but rather combinatorial. It builds on the theoretical tradition of quallia which allows for assemblages of interacting processes. When a narrative is forming but still maintains a level of ambiguity regarding the multiple linear potentials, all of which interact during the formation, then the antenarrative is rhizomatic. As David Boje has said: form a storytelling method standpoint, [...] "an assemblage (rhizome) has visible runners and invisible roots that connect agents (usually people, but also animals, and the fire of the forge) with <b>actants</b> (usually material things, such as the iron, the carbon, the subatomic stuff).

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss the ontological status of <b>actants.</b> <b>Actants</b> are argued {{as being the}} basic constituting {{entities}} of networks {{in the framework of}} Actor Network Theory (Latour, 2007). I introduce two problems concerning <b>actants</b> that have been pointed out by Collin (2010). The first problem concerns the explanatory role of <b>actants.</b> According to Collin, <b>actants</b> cannot play the role of explanans of networks and products of the same newtork at the same time, at pain of circularity. The second problem is that if <b>actants</b> are, as suggested by Latour, fundamentally propertyless, then it is unclear how they combine into networks. This makes the nature of <b>actants</b> inexplicable. I suggest that both problems rest on the assumption of a form of object ontology, i. e. the assumption that the ontological basis of reality consists in discrete individual entities that have intrinsic properties. I argue that the solution to this problem consists in the assumption of an ontology of relations, as suggested within the framework of Ontic Structural Realism (Ladyman & Ross, 2007). Ontic Structural Realism is a theory concerning the ontology of science that claims that scientific theories represent a reality consisting on only relation, and no individual entities. Furthermore I argue that the employment of OSR can, at the price of little modification for both theories, solve both of the two problems identified by Collin concerning ANT. Throughout the text I seek support for my claims by referring to examples of application of ANT to the context of networked learning. As I argue, the complexity of the phenomenon of networked learning gives us a convenient vantage point from which we can clearly understand many important aspects of both ANT and OSR. While my proposal can be considered as an attempt to solve Collin's problems, it is also an experiment of reconciliation between analytic and constructivist philosophy of science. In fact I point out that on the one hand Actor Network Theory and Ontic Structural Realism show an interesting number of points of agreement, such as the naturalistic character and the focus on relationality. On the other hand, I argue that all the intuitive discrepancies that originates from the Science and Technology Studies’ criticism against analytic philosophy of science are at a closer look only apparent...|$|R
40|$|Blended and {{networked}} learning discourses tend {{to focus}} on relations among learners, tutor/professor/teachers, peers, and material learning resources. While in higher educational contexts there is logic to this discursive practice, the roles of non-educator and technological <b>actants</b> in blended learning networks are often neglected or relegated to marginal positions. Non-educators’ contributions to commercial assemblages of blended learning networks can be perceived as out-sider performances, in which values are more aligned to neo-liberal, managerial practices. The roles of technological <b>actants</b> across contexts remain under theorised. We trace interactions among sales and service staff, technological actors, and learners in a commercial blended learning assemblage and problematise a commodified performance of blended learning in relation to blended and networked learning theorised practices. Using Callon’s notion of socio-technical capacities and assemblages, we redeploy attributes of a blended-learning network where interactions among sales and service staff, learners, technological artefacts and <b>actants</b> are described. The roles sales and service staff and technological agents in a second language enterprise perform blended learning as an assemblage that binds companies, human personnel, and learners. Using this approach, informed by material- semiotics, we follow the sequence of transformations that are involved in the production, distribution, and consumption of blended learning. Non-educator and non-human <b>actants</b> in sales, service, and administrative roles actively work to strengthen blended learning assemblages, making them more - or less - durable over time, while having little or nothing to do with supporting cooperative or collaborative learning activities central to theorised blended and network learning practices. Yet these <b>actants</b> perform key roles in performing blended learning as a product and a service in commercial settings that connect theories of blended learning...|$|R

In a novel deployment this research uses an Actor Network Theory (ANT) lens to reanalyse case study data from three disaster theatres. It reveals the impact of nonhuman <b>actants</b> upon human <b>actants,</b> and their consequences for recovery efforts and resilience outcomes. In particular it exposes the potential economic retardation that food aid can inflict on fragile societies; the value of coherent policies and processes for resilient reconstruction in highly structured societies, and; the mixed blessings arising from the presence of TV cameras in disaster theatres.

This article explicates each of these elements—the Four A’s—in the context of cross-media news work, a perspective that lends equal emphasis to editorial, business, and technology as key sites for studying the organizational influences shaping journalism. We argue for developing a sociotechnical emphasis for the study of institutional news production: a holistic framework through which to make sense of and conduct research about the full range of actors, <b>actants,</b> and audiences engaged in cross-media news work activities. This emphasis addresses two shortcomings in the journalism studies literature: a relative neglect about (1) the interplay of humans and technology, or manual and computational modes of orientation and operation, and (2) the interplay of editorial, business, and technology in news organizations.

Within this network central concepts like nature and wild life conservation are remarkably contested and are subject to negotiation. Differing translations of these terms and unsuccessful negotiations can result in controversies and conflicts among the <b>actants.</b> In this thesis conservation should be understood as a concept which contains both natural and human aspects.

Interactions and controversies among the <b>actants</b> constantly shape and transform the network and its functioning. Yet, when controversies are deeply rooted and based on crucial differences it stagnates the network rather than transforming it, which can result in dysfunctionality of the network. To create movement and progression with regard to the protection of sea turtles, the dominant <b>actants</b> in the field need to congregate and develop a clear set of principles of conservation by which they accommodate the livelihoods of the local population in Commewijne and the Kaliña in Galibi in Surinam as well.
