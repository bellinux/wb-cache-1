5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of the}} 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> original strength).|$|E
25|$|So, {{with the}} score at 75 for 6, England once again needed a big partnership, {{this time from}} Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. The pair saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had {{suffered}} a shoulder injury and looked in obvious pain. In the first over after lunch, Jones gave an edge to Ponting – seven down for 101. Giles batted responsibly, padding up to Warne, but eventually {{felt the need to}} play at one, which Hayden held with relative ease. Harmison came and went, facing one delivery, and it was <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to see England to a challenging target.|$|E

It's <b>All</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> You features vocals by Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore, although Kyser's {{participation in this}} recording is disputed, record label showing Axel Stordahl as conductor. Kyser had intended to retire {{following the end of}} the war, but performance and recording contracts kept him in show business for another half decade. During this time, Kyser made a cameo appearance in a Batman comic book. Kyser was first to introduce the new sonic audio process called the 'sonovox', a singing electronic voice triggered by music. The Sonovox would be used by Jingle Companies such as PAMS and JAM Creative Productions, and said jingles would be used in heavy rotation by rock radio stations such as WABC, WMEX, WXYZ, KONO, WKDA, and WHTZ.|$|E

[...] In exploring these ideas, Neo spent over two years researching and editing the script [...] checking scenes for accuracy, verifying facts, and drafting dialogue.

500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but {{the way that you}} get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit."

And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of [...] "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Wen and his empress had {{converted}} to Buddhism to legitimize imperial authority over China and {{the conquest of}} Chen.

2500|$|After {{two more}} albums with Traffic, the group took a short break, {{allowing}} Capaldi to record Whale Meat Again, which was slightly less successful than his debut {{both in terms}} of reviews and sales. The title track was a thoroughly hard rocking and unapologetic environmentalist tirade; aggressive sociopolitical-themed songs became a recurring theme in Capaldi's work. He began work on his third solo album, Short Cut Draw Blood, alongside recording When the Eagle Flies with Traffic. As the band set off on the supporting tour, an early single from Short Cut, [...] "It's <b>All</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> You", made the UK Top 40. Though Capaldi's first major solo hit, it proved only a prelude to the album's chief success. Traffic disbanded after the tour, leaving Capaldi to focus all his efforts on his solo career. Short Cut Draw Blood appeared the following year. In October 1975, a single taken from the album, a cover version of The Everly Brothers' [...] "Love Hurts", reached number four in the UK chart and charted worldwide. The album is {{considered by many to be}} his masterpiece, tackling issues such as the environment, government corruption and drugs. He also embarked on a very brief acting career, appearing in the rarely seen 30-minute short film Short Ends (1976), which was directed by Esther Anderson and co-starred Judy Geeson and Hilary Baker.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} 1865 that Southerton {{developed}} the slow bowling {{for which he was}} to gain belated fame and set many records. At a time when bowling was mainly fast round-arm, Southerton’s slower speed with its deceptive flight and sharp break was a challenge for batsmen that they did not adapt to easily. Southerton had much more than spin and flight, however. He was able to vary his pace and pitch very well, often deceiving batsmen by bowling a ball outside the off stump which turned on the under-prepared pitches of his time viciously into the right-handed batsmen. Southerton typically would then bowl a faster, straighter ball as a contrast, and was exceptionally strong at knowing what ball would be most difficult for each individual batsman. Like Lancashire’s Alec Watson, who was often called [...] "the Southerton of the North", the fairness of Southerton’s delivery was sometimes called into question, though he was never criticised as severely as the powerful Lancashire attack of the early 1880s. He had hardly bowled at <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1864, but in August 1865 with six for 50 against Middlesex and seven for 45 aided by six dismissals from wicket-keeper George Ubsdell against the team for whom he was later to carry out most of his major bowling feats, Southerton established himself as a permanent fixture in top-class cricket at the age of thirty-eight.|$|E
2500|$|Except where {{everyday}} use survives {{in some regions}} of England, the air of informal familiarity once suggested {{by the use of}} thou has disappeared; it is used often for the opposite effect with solemn ritual occasions, in readings from the King James Bible, in Shakespeare and in formal literary compositions that intentionally seek to echo these older styles. Since becoming obsolete in most dialects of spoken English, it has nevertheless been used by more recent writers to address exalted beings such as God, a skylark, Achilles, and even The Mighty Thor. In The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader addresses the Emperor with the words: [...] "What is thy bidding, my master?" [...] In Leonard Cohen's song [...] "Bird on the Wire", he promises his beloved that he'll reform, saying [...] "I will make it <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> thee." [...] The Kaiser Chiefs song [...] "I Predict a Riot" [...] is mentioned below. In Diana Ross's song [...] "Upside Down" [...] (written by Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards) we hear the lyric [...] "Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin'." [...] These recent uses of the pronoun suggest something far removed from intimate familiarity or condescension, while they could be seen as mirroring the mode of address used with the Deity in the Bible as discussed above; {{or in the case of}} [...] "Upside Down", may simply allow a catchy rhyme. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry to demonstrate extreme intimacy.|$|E

He batted [...]372 over his first 14 games but hit just [...]048 over his next seven. When May started, Bochy benched him in favor of Gregor Blanco. On July 18, {{in an interview with}} Henry Schulman of the San Francisco Chronicle, he said that Bochy had told him in May that he did not view him as an everyday player. He said that, while he did not ask for a trade, [...] ""I think whatever the best fit for the team and me is would be ideal. I can't really make those decisions.

[...] That weekend, he started three games against the Philadelphia Phillies in right field, partly because Blanco and Ángel Pagán had been struggling. On July 22, Schierholtz hit two home runs against Joe Blanton, the second of which forced the game into extra innings. However, the Giants would lose 4–3 in 12 innings. In 77 games (175 at bats), Schierholtz hit [...]251 with 44 hits, four doubles, five triples, five home runs, and 16 RBI. At the trade deadline on July 31, Schierholtz was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with minor league catcher Tommy Joseph and minor league pitcher Seth Rosin for outfielder Hunter Pence.|$|E
