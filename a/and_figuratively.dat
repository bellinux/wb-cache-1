5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{planned to}} distinguish The Last Remnant from the Final Fantasy series and other role-playing games through {{its focus on}} the battle system. The art direction of the game was focused on making all of the characters stand out on the battlefield, and in making the Remnants stand {{out in the world}} screens. The cities were designed to not look very fantastical, so as to make the Remnants more prominent, and were designed early on in the development process {{to give the impression that}} the people of the city were living both literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> under the power of the gigantic Remnants. The game marked several firsts for Square Enix, as it was their first game to be released on the same day in both Japan and internationally, as well as the first to use motion captures of Western actors. This resulted in the characters' lips speaking English synced to the spoken dialogue, rather than Japanese. The game had always been intended to be released simultaneously worldwide and was to be targeted to players worldwide, which impacted the character design and art direction. The design and dialogue were created to appeal to international players as well as Japanese players, rather than being focused on the norms of the Japanese video game market alone.|$|E

Though the book received negative comments from some reviewers, it received average ratings on both Amazon and GoodReads.com.|$|E
25|$|Cost over-runs and differing tastes {{made the}} centre {{politically}} controversial, the design often being {{described as a}} large hole in the ground, both literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively.</b> Despite this and a NZ$204 million price tag, it has won numerous design awards and is internationally recognised for its innovative but heritage-sympathetic architecture. The main source of contention was the relatively great expense of this public transport development in the Auckland Region, where for many decades the focus had been on private vehicle ownership and travel.|$|E
25|$|The Royals {{recorded}} a season-high 19 runs against the Chicago White Sox on August 2 in a 9-7 win. The following day, Kansas City closed out the series against Chicago by winning 14-3. In two days, the Royals recorded 38 total hits {{for the first}} time in franchise history. The Royals finally fought back against the White Sox—who have dominated the Royals in years past—both literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively.</b> Four players and both teams' managers were ejected from the game after confrontations over wild pitches.|$|E

25|$|The Lords Chamber is {{the site}} of nationally {{televised}} ceremonies, the most important of which is the State Opening of Parliament, which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both Government Ministers, and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of Lords Commissioners.|$|E

500|$|According to Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{by the end}} of {{the first}} episode, it becomes clear that Underwood both literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> uses meat as his metaphor of choice. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because [...] "I'm feelin' hungry today!", and he depicts his life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak" [...] and plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time". He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, as he tells the audience, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." ...|$|E

The men had no trouble in catching punts, and football was played on its merits, without the handicaps of a wet field or a strong wind. Toward {{the end of the second}} half it got very dark, and the spectators were treated to a novelty in the shape of football by electric light." ...|$|E
500|$|Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{notes that}} by the end of the first episode Frank establishes that his metaphor of choice is meat because both literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> it is his preference. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because [...] "I’m feelin’ hungry today!", but also he describes life with meat metaphors: he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak."; he plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time."; and he endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, he tells us, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." [...] Poniewozik notes that all of this comes from a character whose name, Underwood is a reference to the hallmark deviled ham of the William Underwood Company.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the interpretive}} {{methodology}} favored by Syriac Christian scholars -- typological analysis -- the authors decode the writing as {{having to do}} with Jesus (Joseph) and Mary Magdalene (Aseneth). The narrative then becomes the story of their courtship, marriage, the children they had and concludes with a plot against their lives (Joseph's two sons Ephraim <b>and</b> Manasseh <b>figuratively</b> representing the children of Jesus and Mary Magdalene).|$|R
40|$|The general {{concerns}} of "The Brightened" lie {{with a family}} and their lineage of violence which permeates its generations through oral history <b>and</b> blood (<b>figuratively</b> <b>and</b> genetically). The family issues are further magnified by another set of beings which inhabit the "body" of the family members. These beings deal {{in a world of}} color and sound, where the images of the outer experiences transcribe themselves in a lager "spiritual" text. The core thematic concern is the relation between the "outside" world and the "inside," and where these two positions interact and relate, whether metaphysically or in the violent designs of a dying world. Moreover, "The Brightened" is a work of language, where language can overtake plot device and character development to further the narrative progress of the prose...|$|R

500|$|Farsari {{and other}} 19th-century {{commercial}} photographers generally concentrated on {{two types of}} subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the [...] "manners and customs" [...] of its inhabitants. Such subjects, {{and the ways in}} which they were literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō [...] "per head", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting [...] "manners and customs".|$|E
500|$|Swift annexed [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] to {{a revised}} set {{list for the}} {{continuation}} of her Fearless Tour in 2010. During the performances, which was the penultimate of each concert, Swift was usually costumed in a black cocktail dress with a v-neck cut and black, leather boots. She performed with a rhinestoned acoustic guitar center-stage as a forest was projected on the stage; concluding the performance, clips from Valentine's Day were depicted and, following its completion, confetti dropped from the ceiling. At the May 22, 2010 concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Jane Stevenson of The Toronto Sun said that Swift wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey [...] "didn't hurt [...] popularity either in this hockey-mad town." [...] Molly Trust of Billboard noted the performance at the tour's final concert on June 5, 2010 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts [...] "sported a touch of a hometown feel, as Swift literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> played to the crowd in a Patriots shirt." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the story Tomiko describes Osden's relationship with the planet, saying [...] "He had taken the fear into himself, and, accepting, had transcended it. He had given up his self to the alien, and unreserved surrender, that left no place for evil. He had learned the love of the Other and thereby had been given his whole self." [...] Osden achieves a completely empathetic relationship with the planet, [...] "both literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> in touch with the forest;" [...] which also grants him temporary goodwill towards humans, as he says [...] "Listen, I will you well" [...] before leaving his colleagues. Le Guin makes another reference to Marvell's poetry at {{the conclusion}} of the story, which refers to the notion of a planetary consciousness. Marvell's poem [...] "The Garden" [...] speaks of [...] "a green thought in a green shade"; Le Guin describes World 4470 as [...] "one big green thought." [...] Le Guin's depiction of the planetary vegetative intelligence is of something that is [...] "whole, undifferentiated and unconscious." [...] Thus, it finds the very concept of other beings terrifying, and it is qualitatively different from animal intelligences.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{of these}} three artists had his own style, yet they shared certain tendencies. They did not paint {{directly}} from observation, but from memory and imagination; as Bernard Chaet put it, they favored [...] "the conceptual over the perceptual". Like the Abstract Expressionists, they rejected the photographic naturalism preferred by the Nazis; in fact, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, who had seen Bloom's work in Americans 1942, considered Bloom [...] "the first Abstract Expressionist artist in America." [...] Yet Bloom never embraced pure abstraction. To varying degrees, Bloom, Levine, <b>and</b> Zerbe painted <b>figuratively,</b> <b>and</b> for this reason their school of painting is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Boston figurative expressionism".|$|R
500|$|The {{video was}} {{included}} on many {{lists of the}} best music videos of 2011. Out of 50 videos, [...] "We Found Love" [...] ranked at number 21 on NMEs Best Music Videos of 2011. A reviewer for NME called it, [...] "an artful mini-movie of a promo, an ode to crazy, youthful love." [...] It ranked at number 12 out of 25 on Slant Magazine's Top 2011 Music Videos. A reviewer for Slant Magazine praised Matsoukas' directorial skills, writing, [...] "Melina Matsoukas's video projects (literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively)</b> the fleeting rush of both young love and drugs—and the often fatal cocktail that's produced when the two are combined." [...] The video was included on The Guardians 2011 list, entitled [...] "The best pop videos of 2011". As of January 2015, Billboard named the video as the second best music video of the 2010s (so far). The video received three MTV Video Music Award nominations, including Best Pop Video, and won the award for Video of the Year.

500|$|Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times {{said the}} series worked because it played [...] "with the absurdities of the {{television}} business lightly". Stanley felt that 30 Rock was at its best when it revolved around the characters, and not the show itself. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that although Tracy and Jenna [...] "had their moments in two rather weak storylines", the [...] "unfunny and distracting 'Where's Waldo?' casting [...] " [...] disrupted {{the flow of the}} episode. He enjoyed the improvement of the show, and said that [...] "though not every story this week was stellar, you didn't go long without a decent laugh." [...] Canning gave [...] "Jack Meets Dennis" [...] a 7.5 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich said the episode was [...] "one of the stronger episodes thus far", citing that [...] "veryone got funny stuff to do, the Jack-Liz scenes were crackling and teaming with Liz-induced self-humiliation, and we even got a Rachel Dratch cameo (as that angry, angry Liz Taylor)." [...] Mitovich who had not been a fan of the Jenna character, said that he enjoyed her in this episode. Alan Pergament for The Buffalo News wrote, [...] "The extent that stars go to literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> maintain their images probably sounded funny on paper , but most of it falls flat and illustrates why 30 Rock has been sinking like a rock". Pergament gave this episode two out of four stars. Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald enjoyed Dean Winters' appearances on 30 Rock, noting that he did a [...] "hilarious turn" [...] as Dennis. Matt Roush for TV Guide reported that Alec Baldwin [...] "stole the show" [...] in this episode.|$|E
500|$|The Imperial {{court in}} Vienna criticized Daun for {{his failure to}} act; the Empress and her ministers worried that the Russians and the French would {{drop out of the}} {{coalition}} if there were no action. [...] Daun, a cautious and diligent commander, took his time to make his plans. The Strohmberg, one of the heights abutting Hochkirch, anchored Daun's left flank, and he deployed the remainder of his force southward across the road between Bautzen and Loebau. This also gave him control of an important junction between Görlitz in the east and Zittau in the south. He anchored the far right end of his line in another wooded hill south of the road, called the Kuppritzerberg. The Prussians neither increased their security nor deployed their troops in response to the Austrian presence. Daun also took into account that his men were eager to fight a battle and that they outnumbered the Prussians by more than two-to-one. His men made a great production of hewing the trees in a nearby forest, action which Frederick interpreted as efforts to create field works, not, as it was actually intended, to build a road through the thick wood. Daun also had discovered a secret weakness of Frederick's. His own personal secretary had been sending Frederick information on Daun's plans, secreted in deliveries of eggs; upon discovering this, Daun promised the man his life in return for his cooperation in continuing to send Frederick misinformation. Daun's plan, which he had kept secret, was an early morning sweep through the woods with 30,000 specially picked troops, around Frederick's flank, to enclose him. The Prussian army would be asleep, both literally <b>and</b> <b>figuratively,</b> when the Austrian army struck.|$|E

50|$|When Charles the Bald visited Corbie in 843, he {{apparently}} met Ratramnus and requested {{an explanation of}} the Eucharist. It was to the emperor, then, that Ratramnus addressed his work, also entitled De corpore et sanguine Domini. In this book, Ratramnus advocated a spiritual view in which the bread and the wine of the Eucharist represent Christ’s body <b>and</b> blood <b>figuratively</b> <b>and</b> serve as a remembrance of him, but are not truly (perceptible by the senses) Christ’s body and blood in truth. Ratramnus used the same two terms (figura and veritas) to describe the Eucharist as Paschasius, but used them differently. For him, veritas meant “perceptible to the senses,” so the Eucharist could not truly be Christ’s body and blood, as it - according to the senses - did not change in appearance, but remained bread and wine, nor was it literally Christ’s historical incarnate body.|$|R
