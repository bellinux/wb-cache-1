5|$|<b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>into</b> development, Activision {{proposed}} that Black Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover cop in a criminal organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the innovations in Black Lotus could revitalize the franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed {{it to the public}} as True Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E
5|$|Although Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886, {{it was not until}} 1897 that the club {{appointed}} a permanent manager in charge of first-team affairs, with Thomas Mitchell universally recognised as Arsenal's first professional manager. Mitchell joined Arsenal five months after resigning from Blackburn Rovers in October 1896. The Scotsman's time at Woolwich Arsenal was brief and he left his post barely <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>into</b> his contract, though he did manage to take the club from tenth to fifth in the league. Mitchell guided Arsenal through a respectable cup run which culminated in the first round proper. William Elcoat succeeded Mitchell as manager in April 1898, and set about reviving the squad with new additions. The changes did not have the desired effect; his team finished seventh in a league of 18 and were beaten 6–0 by Derby County in the FA Cup first round. He departed in February 1899, and like his predecessor only remained for a season.|$|E

By <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>into</b> the production, {{millions of dollars}} had been spent, yet almost no usable footage had been created; Abel and Associates was not experienced in motion picture production and the steep learning curve worried the producers. Due to contract obligations, Trumbull served {{as a consultant to}} Abel and Associates, while effects artist Richard Yuricich acted as a liaison between Abel and Paramount. To speed up the work, Abel passed off miniature and matte painting tasks to Yuricich. Despite being relieved of nearly half the effects work, it became clear by early 1979 that Abel and Associates {{would not be able to}} complete the remainder on time. Creative differences grew between Abel and Associates and the Paramount production team, and by mid-February 1979 the two companies parted ways.|$|E

His first match was away against Queensland where he scored 22 and 45, making three stumpings, taking one catch and {{performing}} one run out, followed by scores {{of one and}} 33 in the home match, together with two stumpings. He scored 35 and four at home against Victoria, and then 45 in the second innings of the away match.

In his final match before the outbreak of World War II, Saggers scored 63 runs against South Australia. He ended the season with 18 catches with the gloves and 13stumpings.|$|E

25|$|Less than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>into</b> the presidency, {{cabinet members}} {{representing}} other {{political parties in}} the coalition began to resign in protest of an alleged {{lack of respect for}} transparency and the constitution. The last major party to sever its ties to the ruling party was Adhaalath Party. Another issue taken up by the opposition parties was that Nasheed's government, allowed spas and resort islands to be exempt from the laws that prohibited alcohol and pork products elsewhere in the largely Muslim nation. Protests became a frequent occurrence in the streets of the capital city of Malé after the president’s coalition slowly dissolved. President Nasheed's own Finance Minister Ahmed Inaz was assaulted by President Nasheed's party activist after meeting an opposition leader, current President Yameen Abdul Gayoom.|$|E

25|$|Less than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>into</b> Hashimoto's {{second term}} in September 1997, the LDP regained a slim {{majority}} in the lower house due to defections from, and eventual break up of the opposition New Frontier Party, although the government maintained its alliance with the SDP and NPS. Several days later, Hashimoto conducted a cabinet reshuffle, which backfired when he was severely criticised for his appointment of Koko Sato, who {{had been convicted of}} bribery in relation to the Lockheed Scandal. This criticism forced Sato to resign after only 11 days in office. The government was damaged further when Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka resigned in January 1998 because of a corruption scandal that had been uncovered in the Finance Ministry. At the same time, as part of efforts to close the budget deficit, Hashimoto's government raised the consumption tax in 1998, which negatively affected consumer demand and caused a recession at a time of high unemployment.|$|E
