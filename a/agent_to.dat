5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> make a contract {{on his behalf}} with a third party. In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, {{even though he was}} not privy to the original contract. The right of an <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

One {{of the criteria}} this essay focuses on is to provide incentives <b>to</b> <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> be flexible. A meeting scheduling system should encourage <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> voluntarily acquiesce in exchange for future powers in the decision making process. This essay proposes a voting by veto mechanism which allows <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> trade vetoes throughout rounds <b>to</b> allow <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> be more flexible. ii Table of Contents Abstract [...] . i...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn a multiagent system, {{coalition}} {{formation is}} a coordination method for <b>agents</b> aiming <b>to</b> form groups of interest. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the particular context of hedonic games. In hedonic games, the objective of the <b>agents</b> is <b>to</b> form coalitions, which are groups of agents. The satisfaction of an agent depends on other members of its coalition. In this context, autonomous agents need strategical behaviors to efficiently form their coalitions. In this article, we describe two types of strategies which could be used by agents: proposal acceptance strategies, used by <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> decide to join a coalition and proposal selection strategies, based on the analysis of the history of a negotiation, used by <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> select interesting coalitions to propose <b>to</b> other <b>agents.</b> Then we present our experiments and discuss the results we have obtained. We underline that a compromise between high and low selectivity allows <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> obtain a higher probability to form coalitions with a satisfying utility. Our proposal selection strategies allow <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> reduce the number of proposals to send during the coalition formation process without losing much utility. This speeds up considerably the process...|$|R

His experiments showed the toxic <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we focus}} on {{avoiding}} undesired information collection and information processing in Multi-agent Systems. In order to avoid undesired information collection we propose a decision-making model for <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> decide whether disclosing personal information <b>to</b> other <b>agents</b> is acceptable or not. We also contribute a secure Agent Platform that allows <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> {{communicate with each other}} in a confidential fashion. In order to avoid undesired information processing, we propose an identity management model for agents in a Multi-agent System. This model avoids undesired information processing by allowing <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> hold as many identities as needed for minimizing data identifiability...|$|R
40|$|This paper extends Diamond’s OG {{model by}} {{allowing}} the <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> make the retirement decision. Earning a higher wage income when young not only enables the <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> save more. It also induces more <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> retire early and gives an additional incentive to save more for retirement. This leads to a higher capital-labor ratio in the following period, and hence {{the next generation of}} agents earns a higher wage income when young. Due to this positive feedback mechanism, endogenous retirement magnifies the persistence of growth dynamics and even generates multiple steady states for empirically plausible parameter values...|$|R
