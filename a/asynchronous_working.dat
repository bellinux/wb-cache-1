The paper highlights {{a number of}} areas for consideration that arise when studying coordination within an organizational setting. The focus of the analysis is on two types of tasks: decision-making tasks and routine office processes. The paper argues that a number of (conflicting) options exist when developing the coordination aspects of group systems; they are classified across the following axes: specification and implementation of coordination; use of synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working</b> phases; information exchange and information sharing; support of sequential and concurrent processing; support of negotiation and conflict resolution; support of analytical modelling; and description of the organizational environment...|$|E

The paper describes the course and how wiki activities were incorporated. The paper then discusses the initial feedback from the students which shows that the wiki has been largely effective for developing students ’ understanding of the course concepts, the effectiveness of team working in Requirements Engineering and the use of wikis in practice. However, there are particular issues related to <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working</b> in distance education/eLearning that need to be better addressed. We conclude with a discussion of how we are tackling these issues and developing the use of the wiki on the course based on the students’ feedback...|$|E

This paper describes the first step, i. e. how to verify the chaotic theory simulated result by a practical test. This first step is the oscillating machine unit. The <b>asynchronous</b> motor <b>working</b> point is moving from the stable part of its torque characteristic to the labile part due to the enormous loading. In the labile part the speed slows down and loading has to be decreased. Then the motor moves back to the stable part of characteristic. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{collaborative}} design, we {{can distinguish}} between synchronous and asynchronous methods of collabora-tive working. Both {{are important and}} complementary in AEC. We will show that an explicit product model and a multi-layered system, with components linked together by an information logistics system, are the necessary prerequisites to effectively tackle {{the complexity of the}} information flow for <b>asynchronous</b> collaborative <b>working.</b> The information flow requires well-grounded model-based coordination to enable transparent and guided discussion and decision-making processes. The corresponding product model management services are identified and discussed. These are (1) model view extraction, (2) mapping to design specific models, (3) backward mapping after the design session, (4) identifica-tion of design changes through matching, (5) reintegration of extracted and changed models and (6) merging of the mutual design changes and identification of conflicts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cloud’s unrivaled cost {{effectiveness}} {{and on the}} fly opera-tion versatility is attractive to enterprise and personal users. However, the cloud inherits a dangerous behavior from virtualization systems that poses a serious security risk: resource sharing. This work exploits a shared resource optimization technique called memory deduplication to mount a powerful known-ciphertext only cache side-channel attack on a popu-lar OpenSSL implementation of AES. In contrast to the other cross-VM cache attacks, our attack does not require synchronization with the tar-get server and is fully <b>asynchronous,</b> <b>working</b> in a more realistic scenario with much weaker assumption. Also, our attack succeeds in just 15 sec-onds working across cores in the cross-VM setting.

Compared with previous research using the same scenario, the new MGD techniques produced substantial increases in the amount that, and distance over which, participants communicated. With VT participants chose {{to listen to a}} quarter of the conversations of their predecessors while performing the task. The embedded VT conversations led to a reduction in the rate at which participants traveled around, but an increase in live communication that took place. Taken together, the studies show how CVE interfaces can be improved for synchronous and asynchronous collaborations, and highlight possibilities for future research. ...|$|E
40|$|With many {{engineering}} companies {{changing their}} focus from product delivery towards through-life service support, the realisation {{is that much}} of the information and knowledge being generated throughout each stage of the design process can aid in both product lifecycle support and also the development of new products. To support these activities, information and knowledge capture systems and models are required, which allow the information to be stored and used thirty years or more into the future. The dichotomy of interest in this paper is that of synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working,</b> where engineers may work as part of a group or as individuals and where different forms of record are necessary to adequately capture the processes and rationale employed in each mode. This paper looks at each mode of working in turn and proposes complimentary approaches to information and knowledge capture. The combination of information and knowledge capture performed during both asynchronous and synchronous activities has the potential to create a significantly enhanced overall design process model and record enhancing not only the through-life support of the product but also subsequent projects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{recent years}} a slow but {{progressive}} {{increase in the}} world’s temperatures has been consistently recorded. To oppose this global warming trend, two especially important actions are the monitoring and reduction of greenhouse emissions, in large quantity caused by global electric energy production. To this regard an algorithm is proposed to estimate the particles released into the atmosphere {{as a consequence of}} the electric energy produced for the operation of asynchronous motors, which in industrialized countries absorb as much as 60 % of the total electric energy generated. The described procedure can also help to evaluate the possibility to supply motors with electric energy produced from renewable sources instead of from thermal power plants supplying traditional public networks, which would of course reduce the environmental impact of motors to almost zero. Emissions linked to electric energy generation were evaluated on the basis of statistics collected from the main electric utilities. The proposed algorithm was validated by means of laboratory tests performed on a single <b>asynchronous</b> motor <b>working</b> under different operating conditions.

40|$|The word {{problem of}} a finitely {{generated}} group is commonly defined to be a formal language over a finite generating set. The class of finite groups has been characterised as the class of finitely generated groups that have word problem decidable by a finite state automaton. We give a natural generalisation {{of the notion of}} word problem from finitely generated groups to finitely generated semigroups by considering relations of strings. We characterise the class of finite semigroups by the class of finitely generated semigroups whose word problem is decidable by finite state automata. We then examine the class of semigroups with word problem decidable by asynchronous two tape finite state automata. Algebraic properties of semigroups in this class are considered, towards an algebraic characterisation. We take the next natural step to further extend the classes of semigroups under consideration to semigroups that have word problem decidable by a finite collection of <b>asynchronous</b> automata <b>working</b> independently. A central tool used in the derivation of structural results are so-called iteration lemmas. We define a hierarchy of the considered classes of semigroups and connect our original results with previous research...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new perspective}} for managing and delivering a global design class, and a clear alternative to the traditional joint project for participating institutes. The ‘task-based approach’ used to structure a Global Design class at the University of Strathclyde is described. This entailed {{the creation of a}} series of short design exercises to be run in conjunction with three partner institutions: the University of Malta in Msida, Malta; Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia; and Stanford University in Palo Alto, USA. These exercises focussed on specific aspects of distributed working, including synchronous working, <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working</b> and digital library support, according to the location and facilities afforded by each institution. This {{provides a}} number of pedagogical and organisation benefits. Students are required to take a more strategic approach to their design work, developing a higher evaluative understanding of the tools and processes required to produce a successful design. Staff members have a greater level of control afforded by a shared collaborative class component, including assessment, timetabling and learning objectives, rather than simply having a joint project. This potentially makes global design classes a more flexible and viable option for institutions interested in participating in such programme...|$|E
40|$|This paper charts the {{development}} of a system architecture designed to address the challenges associated with creating accurate and re-usable records of synchronous design activities. It begins by describing the context of through-life support of engineering products, then presents the Knowledge Enhanced Notes system development work undertaken and provides direction for future research work in this area. An empirical research approach was adopted for this work incorporating 11 experimental episodes, ethnographic studies and case-based evaluation of the developed system. The approach and development of the system architecture within this research build upon and extend existing {{research in the area of}} knowledge and information capture. The proposed system architecture is proven to enhance the record of engineering design activities, demonstrating that the implementation of software-based tools can have a positive impact on the creation of a more accurate and complete record of activities. This research is focused on one category of design activities – synchronous; therefore, future research that focuses on <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working,</b> leading to an overall enhancement of design working, is needed.

40|$|To aid the {{creation}} and through-life support of large, complex engineering products, organizations are placing {{a greater emphasis on}} constructing complete and accurate records of design activities. Current documentary approaches are not sufficient to capture activities and decisions in their entirety and can lead to organizations revisiting and in some cases reworking design decisions in order to understand previous design episodes. Design activities are undertaken in a variety of modes; many of which are dichotomous, and thus each require separate documentary mechanisms to capture information in an efficient manner. It is possible to identify the modes of learning and transaction to describe whether an activity is aimed at increasing a level of understanding or whether it involves manipulating information to achieve a tangible task. The dichotomy of interest in this paper is that of synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working,</b> where engineers may work alternately as part of a group or as individuals and where different forms of record are necessary to adequately capture the processes and rationale employed in each mode. This paper introduces complimentary approaches to achieving richer representations of design activities performed synchronously and asynchronously, and through the undertaking of a design based case study, highlights the benefit of each approach. The resulting records serve to provide a more complete depiction of activities undertaken, and provide positive direction for future co-development of the approaches...|$|E

40|$|Using optical {{technology}} {{for the design of}} high-performance packet switches offers several advantages such as scalability, high bandwidth, lower power con-sumption, and reduction in cost. However, reconfiguring the optical fabric of these switches requires significant time using current technology (micro-electro-mechanical system MEMS, tunable elements, bubble switches, etc.). As a result, conventional slot-by-slot scheduling may severely cripple the performance of these optical switches due to the frequent fabric reconfiguration that it may entail. This thesis undertakes a comprehensive study on the scheduling of optical packet switches with reconfiguration delay. We consider the scheduling of both synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> optical fabrics, <b>working</b> with unicast or multicast traffic. The general solution is to reduce the scheduling rate to compensate for the reconfiguration delay. The scheduling problems for both synchronous and asynchronous optical fabrics are formally defined and proven to be NP-hard. As a result, efficient heuristic scheduling algorithms are proposed for both types of fabrics. Specifically, a burst scheduling approach and a self-adjustable time slot assignment (TSA) approach are suggested for synchronous fabric scheduling. On the other hand, a non-preemptive dense scheduling approach is proposed when the fabric is asynchronous. All of the proposed algorithms are shown to achieve 100 % throughput under different unicast traffic patterns. In addition, a multi-rack switch architecture with passive optical fabric and active local crossbars is proposed and evaluated for multicast traffic. It makes good use of the available switching capacity and is practical to be implemented using current technology...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This research investigates computer-based collaborative design environments, in particular issues of real-time collaborative 3 D CAD. The thesis first presents a broad perspective of collaborative design environments with a preliminary case study of team design activities in a conventional and a computer mediated setting. This study identifies the impact and the feasibility of computer support for collaborative design and suggests four kinds of essential technologies for a successful collaborative design environment: information-sharing systems, synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> co- <b>working</b> tools, project management systems, and communication systems. A new conceptual framework for a real-time collaborative 3 D design tool, Shared Stage, is proposed based upon the preliminary study. The Shared Stage {{is defined as a}} shared 3 D design workspace aiming to smoothly incorporate shared 3 D workspaces into existing individual 3 D workspaces. The addition of a Shared Stage allows collaborating designers to interact in real-time and to have a dynamic and interactive exchange of intermediate 3 D design data. The acceptability of collaborative features is maximised by maintaining consistency of the user interface between 3 D CAD systems. The framework is subsequently implemented as a software prototype using a new software development environment, customised by integrating related real-time and 3 D graphic software development tools. Two main components of the Shared Stage module in the prototype, the Synchronised Stage View (SSV) and the Data Structure Diagram (DSD), provide essential collaborative features for real-time collaborative 3 D CAD. These features include synchronised shared 3 D representation, dynamic data exchange and awareness support in 3 D workspaces. The software prototype is subsequently evaluated to examine the usefulness and usability. A range of quantitative and qualitative methods is used to evaluate the impact of the Shared Stage. The results, including the analysis of collaborative interactions and user perception, illustrate that the Shared Stage is a feasible and valuable addition for real-time collaborative 3 D CAD. This research identifies the issues to be addressed for collaborative design environments and also provides a new framework and development strategy of a novel real-time collaborative 3 D CAD system. The framework is successfully demonstrated through prototype implementation and an analytical usability evaluation.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} carried out in {{cooperation}} with a company which develops mobile sensor platforms. The sensors measure different types of data such as temperature, pressure etc [...] They will communicate through the internet with a server that stores data in a database. This system will be controlled and monitored through a web page. The project's aim has been to develop this system and to implement a server, a database, a website and a client application that simulates sensor signals. In addition, the performance of the server should be measured and a usability test should be performed. To measure the performance of the server, different variants of the client program, which continuously sent data from an increasing number of clients to the server, were developed. In the usability test the participants had to solve a number of tasks after which they answered a survey and were interviewed. The result is a communication system that works according to the requirements and a client program that is also used for testing the server. The investigation of the server performance showed a maximum bandwidth of about 370 kb/s while serving up to 70 clients. The database consumed 95 % of the bandwith. However, with a rising number of clients there was a continous decline in the performance. In usability tests, there was a big difference in how people perceive computer programs depending on their experience and education. For this application, the server worked well, but if the project is to be developed into a large scale, it then becomes relevant to move onto an <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working</b> server instead of a thread-server. Queries to a database (MySQL) considerably decreases bandwidth and should be optimized where possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{scenario}} of multiple {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) systems working closely, synchronously or asynchronously with phase difference often occurs in power supply for household appliances and electric vehicles in parking lots. Magnetic field leakage from the WPT systems is also varied due to unpredictable <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working</b> conditions. In this study, the magnetic field leakage from parallel WPT systems working with phase difference is predicted, and the induced electric field and specific absorption rate (SAR) in a human body standing in the vicinity are also evaluated. Computational results are compared with the restrictions prescribed in the regulations established to limit human exposure to time-varying electromagnetic fields (EMFs). The {{results show that the}} middle region between the two WPT coils is safer for the two WPT systems working in-phase, and the peripheral regions are safer around the WPT systems working anti-phase. Thin metallic plates larger than the WPT coils can shield the magnetic field leakage well, while smaller ones may worsen the situation. The orientation of the human body will influence the maximum magnitude of induced electric field and its distribution within the human body. The induced electric field centralizes in the trunk, groin, and genitals with only one exception: when the human body is standing right at the middle of the two WPT coils working in-phase, the induced electric field focuses on lower limbs. The SAR value in the lungs always seems to be greater than in other organs, while the value in the liver is minimal. Human exposure to EMFs meets the guidelines of the International Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), specifically reference levels with respect to magnetic field and basic restrictions on induced electric fields and SAR, as the charging power is lower than 3. 1 kW and 55. 5 kW, respectively. These results are positive with respect to the safe applications of parallel WPT systems working simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} web based {{distance}} learning concept has recently gained {{more and more}} significance has required the establishment of virtual campuses at universities {{and the provision of}} synchronous and asynchronous education facilities to be used in these campuses. While applying distance learning methods, the universities should adopt genuine learning management systems that could reflect their own characteristics and meet their own needs which are also adaptable to mid and long-term technological changes. The universities should also have synchronous education facilities integrated to the system. 1. Methodology As is required {{by the nature of the}} research problem itself, this study bears a qualitative feature. “Action research”, which is one of the qualitative research approaches has been used in this study. Documents and observations have been used as data collection instruments. The diaries of the students who participated to the research during the design of the system have been analysed using document analysis technique. The research has been conducted with the participation of 14 M. A. students from Karadeniz Technical University, Fatih Faculty of Education, Department of Computer and Instructional Technologies during 2008 - 2009 spring term. During the research students‟ individual diaries, have been coded and qualitatively analysed. The results of the qualitative analysis indicate similar and different cases experienced by two different students groups during the study. 2. System Design Process It has turned out that specific software with synchronous and asynchronous features should be employed in order to ensure effective use of the present distance learning system. The preparation of synchronous and asynchronous chapters has required different coding and design features therefore two different groups have been formed. The synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working</b> groups have made a literature review regarding their own fields of study. The structure of Learning Management System (LMS) has been investigated by the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>working</b> group. A needs analysis has been conducted so as to determine the features of the system to be designed later throughout the process. In the light of the data achieved, the minimum software knowledge to be possessed by the members of the group has been defined. Following the literature review, the synchronous working group has examined the structure of the synchronous interfaces used in the existing distance learning systems. The characteristics of these systems as well as their capabilities were then determined. 3. Findings Within the framework of this research, the findings achieved from the logs (diaries) of the participants reflect their experiences both before and during the design process of the distance learning system. As a result of the qualitative analysis, through the study processes themes such as „preparedness, expectations, preparations, problems, solutions and recommendations‟ have been formed. 4. Conclusion and Recommendations The most important criteria for achieving success in designing a distance learning system is to conduct a good analysis of situation, elucidate the differences between current state and requirements conduct a group work for finding solutions for determined defeicincies. Despite the fact that a needs analysis has been conducted and the operation plan of the system has been prepared prior to the design of the system. However, the participants still encounter some problems during the process. This is because any study conducted prior to the design of such complicated systems only contribute to the formation of the infrastructure of the system and thus be beneficial for the participants. Not only the synchronic level but also the platform through which the system shall be supported is also very important while designing the system. Therefore, it is very crucial at this point that the LMS is designed as a dynamic one. Distance learning systems are formed either using the synchronous and asynchronous systems individually or in an integrated form. The system has been planned as a web based LMS enabling synchronous and asynchronous education, thus paving the way for an effective education environment. Such studies should be elaborated in detail considering the service requirements of the relevant organization, should be subject to a sound needs analysis and performed within a convenient time period with the participation of a professional team.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Collaborative {{virtual environment}}s (CVEs) extend {{existing}} virtual environment (VE) technology to {{enable it to}} run over a network (e. g. the Internet), and introduce mechanisms that allow multiple people to co-exist, be aware of each other’s presence (e. g. through avatars) and communicate. CVEs are useful for when teams {{of people want to}} collaborate when they are geographically separated, e. g. in games [14], social communication [65], visualisation [120], computational steering [17], or alternatively people might be spatially collocated in the real world but wish to work together in a VE, e. g. military training [99]. The dream is for interaction in CVEs to be more effective than interaction in the real world. The increase in globalisation and geographically distributed personnel who need to collaborate, act as a driving force for the development of effective collaborative technologies, which would allow businesses to save time and money, help distributed communities stay in touch, and reduce the impact on the world’s environment. The work presented in this thesis aims to make collaborative interaction in virtual environments more effective, more like that of face-to-face interaction, without unnecessarily restricting virtual collaboration to the naturalistic constraints of the ‘real world’ (cf. [79], [39]). This thesis describes the implementation and evaluation of techniques to support synchronous and asynchronous collaborations in virtual environments. The techniques were evaluated {{in the context of an}} urban planning application, where proposed developments could be modelled in 3 D and evaluated by members of the public (and potentially clients, architects) to decide if they support or object to the designs (e. g. [30]). Synchronous collaborations were supported by a suite of techniques called Mobile Group Dynamics (MGDs), which were introduced and evaluated in two stages (Chapters 4 and 5). First, a novel ‘group graph’ metaphor was used to explicitly show the groups that people had formed themselves into (and help people locate the whereabouts of their collaborators), and techniques were provided to help people move around together and communicate over extended distances. The techniques were evaluated by providing one batch of participants with MGDs and another with an interface based on conventional CVEs. Participants with MGDs spent nearly twice as much time in close proximity (within 10 m of their nearest neighbour), communicated seven times more than participants with a conventional interface, and exhibited real-world patterns of behaviour such as staying together over an extended period of time and regrouping after periods of separation (Chapter 4). Second, three additional techniques were introduced (teleporting, awareness and multiple views) which, when combined, produced a four times increase in the amount that participants communicated in the CVE and also significantly increased the extent to which participants communicated over extended distances in the CVE (Chapter 5). <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>working</b> in CVEs was assisted using the metaphor of Virtual Time (VT), where the utterances of previous users were embedded in a CVE as conversation tags (Chapter 6). With VT, participants chose to listen to a quarter of the conversations of their predecessors while performing the task. The embedded conversations led to a reduction in the rate at which participants travelled around, but an increase in the live communication that took place. Taken together, the studies have implications for CVE designers, because they provide quantitative and qualitative data on how group dynamics functioned in a CVE, and how synchronous and asynchronous groupwork was improved by using MGDs and VT techniques. In addition, the rich complexity of possible functionality for VT highlights a number of possibilities for future research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
