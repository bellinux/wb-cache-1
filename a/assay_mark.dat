40|$|Polarized {{microtubule}} (MT) {{growth in}} the leading edge is critical to directed cell migration, and is mediated by Rac 1 GTPase. To find downstream targets of Rac 1 that affect MT assembly dynamics, we performed an RNAi screen of 23 MT binding and regulatory factors and identified RNAi treatments that suppressed changes in MT dynamics induced by constitutively activated Rac 1. By analyzing fluorescent EB 3 dynamics with automated tracking, we found that RNAi treatments targeting p 150 (glued), APC 2, spastin, EB 1, Op 18, or MARK 2 blocked Rac 1 -mediated MT growth in lamellipodia. MARK 2 was the only protein whose RNAi targeting additionally suppressed Rac 1 effects on MT orientation in lamellipodia, and thus {{became the focus of}} further study. We show that GFP-MARK 2 rescued effects of MARK 2 depletion on MT growth lifetime and orientation, and GFP-MARK 2 localized in lamellipodia in a Rac 1 -activity-dependent manner. In a wound-edge motility <b>assay,</b> <b>MARK</b> 2 -depleted cells failed to polarize their centrosomes or exhibit oriented MT {{growth in the}} leading edge, and displayed defects in directional cell migration.

The goal {{of this study was to}} increase awareness of this disease by describing the clinical and laboratory findings in four young border collies with inherited cobalamin deficiency. The median age of the dogs was 11. 5 mo (range, 8 - 42 mo), and two of the four dogs were full siblings. Clinical signs included intermittent lethargy (n = 4), poor body condition (n = 4), odynophagia (n = 2), glossitis (n = 1), and bradyarrhythmia (n = 1). Pertinent laboratory abnormalities were mild to moderate normocytic nonregenerative anemia (n = 3), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity (n = 3), and mild proteinuria (n = 3).

40|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 6 (HHV- 6) {{was examined}} in vitro for its sensitivity {{to a broad}} range of nucleoside analogues, including acyclovir (ACV), ganciclovir (GCV), penciclovir (PCV), buciclovir (BCV), brivudin (BVDU), the N 7 -isomer of 6 -deoxyganciclovir (S 2242), foscarnet (phosphonoformic acid, PFA), and several acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (ANP) analogues such as (S) -HPMPA, (S) -HPMPC, PMEA and PMEDAP. Antiviral efficacy was monitored microscopically by the inhibitory effect of the compounds on HHV- 6 -induced cytopathic effect in human T-lymphoblastoid HSB- 2 cells. In addition, a newly developed immunofluorescence/flow cytometric assay (FACS) was used to determine HHV- 6 -specific antigen expression. A close correlation was observed between the antiviral data obtained by the microscopic assay and the flow cytometric <b>assay.</b> <b>Marked</b> antiviral efficacy was noted for S 2242, PFA and the ANP analogues (S) -HPMPA, (S) -HPMPC, (S) -cHPMPC, (S) - 3 -deaza-HPMPA, (S) - 3 -deaza-cHPMPA, (S) -HPMPG and (R) -HPMPG. Also, PMEA and PMEDAP proved highly active against HHV- 6 infection, whereas (S) -FPMPA and (R) -PMPDAP were inactive.

40|$|Activation of T {{cells in}} the {{intestinal}} mucosa in response to gluten exposure is thought to {{play a key role}} in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. Moreover, the response of the rectal mucosa to gluten challenge has been considered a useful predictor of gluten sensitivity in coeliac disease. In the present study, we assessed early changes in the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes and the T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ repertoire in the rectal mucosa of coeliac disease patients following experimental gluten challenge. Cytokine gene expression was assessed in rectal mucosal biopsies from coeliac disease subjects and controls before and after rectal gluten challenge using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, and the TCR Vβ repertoire was characterized using a multiprobe RNase protection <b>assay.</b> <b>Marked</b> up-regulation of expression of the C-X-C chemokine IL- 8, the proinflammatory cytokine IL- 1 β, and the C-C chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 occurred within 2 – 4 h of rectal gluten challenge in coeliac disease subjects, but not in controls. Furthermore, these changes occurred in the absence of parallel changes in the expressed repertoire of TCR Vβ genes in the rectal mucosa. Thus, an increased expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes precedes the expansion of antigen-specific T cell populations in the early period following experimental exposure of the rectal mucosa of coeliac disease patients to gluten. These findings provide new insights into pathways that may be involved in the activation or reactivation of coeliac disease...|$|R

40|$|Deciphering the {{molecular}} mechanisms driving the phenotypic differences {{between humans and}} primates remains a daunting challenge. Mutations found in protein coding DNA alone {{has not been able}} to explain these phenotypic differences. The hypothesis that mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA are responsible for altered gene expression leading to these phenotypic changes has now been widely supported by differential gene expression experiments. Yet, comprehensive identification of all regulatory DNA elements across different species has not been performed. To identify the genetic source of regulatory change, genome-wide DNaseI hypersensitivity <b>assays,</b> <b>marking</b> all types of active gene regulatory element sites, were performed in human, chimpanzee, macaque, orangutan, and mouse. Many DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) sites were conserved among all 5 species, but we also identified hundreds of novel human- and chimpanzee-specific DHS gains and losses that showed signatures of positive selection. Species-specific DHS gains were enriched in distal non-coding regions, associated with active histone modifications, and positively correlated with increased expression - indicating that these are likely to be functioning as enhancers. Comparison to mouse DHS data indicate that human or chimpanzee DHS gains are likely to have been a result of single events that occurred primarily on the human- or chimpanzee-specific branch, respectively. In contrast, DHS losses are associated with events that occurred on multiple branches. At least one mechanism contributing to DHS gains and losses are species-specific variants that lead to sequence changes at transcription factor binding motifs, affecting the binding of TFs such as AP 1. These variants were functionally verified by DNase footprinting and ChIP-qPCR analyses. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Previously we had {{determined}} that neo-natal neutrophils had decreased interaction with monolayers expressing P-selectin compared to adult cells. In {{this study we}} examined the function of neonatal P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 (PSGL- 1). A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the amino terminus of human PSGL- 1 was pro-duced and purified (3 RB-PSGL- 1). Neonatal neu-trophils expressed the epitope recognized by 3 RB-PSGL- 1 and expression was decreased compared with adult neutrophils (20 %, P F 0. 05). In addi-tion neonatal neutrophils had decreased interac-tion with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) -P-selectin under both shear conditions and static adhesion (P F 0. 05). Treatment of both neonatal and adult neutrophils with 3 RB-PSGL- 1 similarly inhibited the interaction with P-selectin monolayers under shear conditions, effects similar to treatment with O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (OSGE). Neur-aminidase treatment of neonatal and adult cells also markedly inhibited the interaction. In a detach-ment <b>assay</b> <b>marked</b> differences were noted between neonatal and adult cells treated with either 3 RB-PSGL- 1 or neuraminidase. Such treatments {{had little effect on}} adult neutrophils until shear stress exceeded 2. 8 dynes/cm 2. Treated neonatal neutro-phils were exquisitely sensitive to shear stress with a marked decrease in interaction noted at a shear stress as low as 0. 6 dynes/cm 2. Thus the adhesive mechanisms that remain after treatment with neur-aminidase or 3 RB-PSGL- 1 have a relatively low avidity and function less well in neonatal neutro-phils compared to adult neutrophils. We speculate that this may account for the less efficient adhesion of neonatal neutrophils to P-selectin under condi-tions of flow. J. Leukoc. Biol. 67 : 73 – 80; 2000.

In the Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal in Leiden this medal is shown in a display on city history, but there is a little silver ring attached to the eyelet, probably meaning that this medal was worn on a silver chain in later days.These medals were also worn by the Sea Beggars at the capture of Den Briel in 1572.The medal itself and its background doubtless is older than 1572. Wearing half moons was already in practice in and around Antwerp by attendants of “hagepreken”, open-air sermons, by Herman Modet. Modet created the slogan “Liever Turks dan paaps” (“Rather Turkish than Papist”), or anyhow was the one who spread it.
