For example, until the 1980s, antitrust matters were not arbitrable in the United States. Matters relating to crimes, status and family law are generally not considered to be arbitrable, as the power of the parties to enter into an agreement upon these matters is at least restricted. However, most other disputes that involve private rights between two parties can be resolved using arbitration. In some disputes, parts of claims may be arbitrable and other parts not. For example, in a dispute over patent infringement, a determination of whether a patent has been infringed could be adjudicated upon by an arbitration tribunal, but the validity of a patent could not: As patents are subject to a system of public registration, an <b>arbitral</b> <b>panel</b> would have no power to order the relevant body to rectify any patent registration based upon its determination.|$|E

40|$|With the {{new wave}} of claims against {{corporations}} for human rights violations – particularly in the context of aiding and abetting government abuse – there are unusually difficult problems of joint tortfeasor liability. In many circumstances, one tortfeasor – the corporation – is a deep-pocketed defendant, easily subject to suit, but only marginally involved in the unlawful conduct. Another tortfeasor – the sovereign – is a central player in the unlawful conduct, but, with limited exceptions, is immune from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. A third tortfeasor – the low-level security personnel – accused of actually committing the atrocity, is beyond the jurisdictional reach of the forum and is an insolvent, judgment-proof defendant. How should an adjudicator apportion responsibility among these joint tortfeasors? Does it matter that the principal players are immune or insolvent, while the marginal player is not? In apportioning responsibility, is it relevant that one tortfeasor simply knew of the misconduct or was negligent with respect to its likely occurrence, although it did not intend for the violation to occur? Despite the saliency of these questions, international law does not provide the answers. These problems are only exacerbated by the fact that international law violations can be pursued in multiple arenas – in national courts, international tribunals, and international arbitral bodies. As a general rule, international tribunals will resolve the question of apportioning liability using public international law, while domestic courts will resolve the question by recourse to private international law, and <b>arbitral</b> <b>panels</b> will rely on the governing law of the contract.

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{unprecedented}} bloom of investment arbitration, arbitrators and scholars have increasingly faced {{the challenge of}} systematizing the growing body of case law. The difficult task {{is complicated by the}} fact that there is no single investment agreement to apply, but a panoply of bilateral and regional instruments, with sophisticated clauses and technical specificities. Lawyers recur to a different methods to analyse and systematize the congeries of decisions. Traditionally in common law legal systems, a precedent or authority is a decision establishing a principle or a rule that courts will follow when deciding subsequent cases with analogues issues. Civil lawyers theoretically have a different approach as previous case law is not formally considered as a source of law. However, as a matter of fact civil lawyers do look and study previous jurisprudence. As every civil lawyer well knows, judges show reverential consideration for national supreme courts decisions. [1] Cases are relevant and have to be cited in the course of proceedings. This paper analyses the question whether the doctrine of binding precedent can be transplanted to investment arbitration. A traditional feature of arbitration is that tribunals are not bound by precedents. Thus, similar issues may be treated in an entirely different way with the consequent potential to generate conflicting rulings, and contribute to considerable uncertainty for investors and host states alike. [2] As <b>arbitral</b> <b>panels</b> have not a permanent nature, the issue of consistency becomes even more problematic. This paper argues that the doctrine of binding precedent should not be viewed as a panacea or an end in itself. On the contrary, it should be considered as a tool for creating consistency and predictability. Thus, this paper will argue that, due to the intrinsic characteristics of investment arbitration, the doctrine of persuasive precedent is a more attuned tool to achieve consistency and justice in concrete cases. This paper argues that precedents should not be binding, but considered as persuasive. The difference between the two concepts is subtle, but important. To clarify the idea a few metaphors may help. As a philosopher once put it, 'law is like art in that typically it is made to be interpreted. '[3] a binding precedent is like copying a statue. A persuasive precedent is very much like using the master's tools to create something new. Indeed, the most recent awards seem to validate the theory of persuasive precedent: on the one hand, arbitrators do analyze previous cases, on the other, they reaffirm their independence and lack of institutional subordination. This approach has to be welcomed as it can provide flexibility and high quality awards. The paper will thus focus on judicial reasoning and legal methodology with a look at the recent case la...|$|R

The continents themselves dissolve and pass to the sea, in grain after grain of eroded land. So the rains that rose from it return again in rivers. In its mysterious past it encompasses all the dim origins of life and receives in the end, after, it may be, many transmutations, the dead husks of that same life. For all at last returns to the sea-to Oceanus, the ocean river, like the ever-flowing stream of time, {{the beginning and the}} end. Since the dawn of humanity, the sea {{has been a source of}} sustenance, providing food and avenues of trade. The earliest civilizations used the sea as an avenue to search for wealth in the form of spices, minerals, and other natural resources. The search for natural resources and wealth resulted in the establishment of the maritime industry that would continue in some form or another until the present. The long history of the the maritime industry is dotted with both success and disputes. In the maritime industry, arbitration has served as a common tool for the settlement of disputes for several decades. In the past, the large amount of informal personal contact, the limited number of people, and the concentration of the shipping industry in New York led to an atmosphere conducive to the amicable resolution of disputes before 2 ̆ 2 dreaded lawyers 2 ̆ 2 could become involved. Presently, the shipping industry is no longer made up of a small number of people or concentrated in one state. This results in a loss of the close personal contact that facilitated arbitration in the past. These changes in the shipping industry led to the immediate consultation of lawyers as a necessity when problems arise, and the continued presence of lawyers through the resolution of those problems. Despite any changes, maritime arbitration remains a popular way to resolve maritime disputes that arise, in part because of the often lower costs involved and the ability to mold the process to the needs of the parties involved. Maritime arbitration is most often the result of an arbitration clause in a contract, in which case, the clause controls. The clause may contain provisions pertaining to the site of arbitration, the procedures to be followed in arbitration, the makeup of the arbitral tribunal, and the remedies available. Part I of this Article discusses the availability of interim measures in maritime arbitrations.

40|$|This book aims to {{meet the}} {{pressing}} need – among international scholars, political scientists, legal practitioners, and students – for a systematic assessment of the changes taking place under the impact of globalization on {{the international community and}} its legal order; it describes how different constitutive processes of globalization transform key aspects of international society, its institutions and legal norms. Fundamental shifts in the rules and structure of the classical international community highlight the ‘public’ dimension of international law, which is developing rules increasingly oriented towards a structuring process for a universal human society (i. e., global community), and the protection of common values and goods (such as world peace and security, fundamental rights of individuals and peoples, collective management of common human beings, etc.) accompanied by objective safeguard mechanisms and procedures. These changes raise {{the question of whether the}} evolution of the classical international legal system has produced a corpus of rules autonomous enough from inter-state law to be called ‘Global Law’. This, in turn, raises the question of the distinctive features of this new body of laws. These questions are not merely theoretical. For several years I have studied the evolution of the international order, starting from its origins and moving through a wide analysis of the relevant practices of states, international organizations, and other new actors, including an analysis of the case law of international courts and tribunals. This analysis addresses important key legal issues from the Westphalian period to the post-war period, and from the establishment of the UN to the present, in order to provide an overview of the new world order. The basic goal is to identify, from the great variety of international practices in political and jurisprudential contexts, a uniform set of legal rules and procedures designed to manage global interests and goods, established for the purpose of institutionalizing governance mechanisms and procedures, defining and allocating powers to the global level, and creating authorities or bodies exercising functions of a public nature. Attention on international institutions (and their activities) undoubtedly predominates in my book and my selection of them as referentially appropriate was with a view to identifying those changes in international law which are indicators to the birth of global law. This is the result of a methodological choice that I believe provides a useful approach to problems that are intrinsically linked to the scope of my work, which is to focus particularly on ‘structural’ changes and key features brought about by the impact of the globalization on ‘inter-state’ international law. The aim of my research is made even more evident by the book’s title which employs the word ‘pillars’ in its most denotative sense, referring to the fact that this investigation is directed at the ‘structural’ aspects of emerging global law, rather than to substantive ones. Interest in the structural profile derives from the fact that most internationalists have made important contributions to changes that have occurred through the effect of globalization in various areas of substantive international law (human rights, world peace, world health, commons protection, etc.). Conversely, the structural profile and features of the growing global community and new world legal order has barely been touched on and no specific, systematic study exists. My investigation is especially based on the decisions of international bodies with a supranational nature (Security Council, General Assembly, WTO panels, International Court of Justice and other international courts, etc.). Certainly, I am well aware that there are other centers of international power apart from international institutions: many important international and transnational normative regimes are not found in international institutions, but in more informal law-making promulgated by international <b>arbitral</b> <b>panels,</b> networks of regulatory entities, or non- state accreditation and standard-setting bodies; just as it is true that various forces of globalism also contribute to mechanisms of global governance. It makes today’s international legal framework more complex because there are many centers of international power and influence, and powerful new forces; that is why my analysis focuses on new integrated procedures and mechanisms of shared governance between States, international organizations and the global NGO community acting jointly with a supranational authority. Already the substantial international community has developed mechanisms of integration with the organized international community and, above all, the United Nations, and other forces of globalism in the areas of human rights, international criminal law and international environmental law. These new forces of international power, however, do not yet have a well established role at a general level and on the decision-making processes which the present book examines (i. e., global constitutive processes and basic constitutional principles). I myself complain in my book about their exclusion and marginalization within international world bodies and hope that more weight will be given to them in those forums where nowadays the power of world decision-making resides. The changes I detail (summarized in the annexed Tables) have been considered with reference to three phases that characterise the evolution of the international order towards a law for a global community: (1) the Westphalian phase (see Table 1 infra); (2) the post-Westphalian phase (see Table 2 infra); and (3) the post-UN Charter phase, characterised by globalization (see Table 3 infra). In considering these three periods, changes in the international legal order may be said to have taken place as a result of the interplay of five variables in the international community: 1. the enhancement of international functions; 2. the expansion of the social base; 3. the legality of norms depending on their substantive content and their role in structuring the principles and practices of a public nature; 4. the development of interaction between legal systems regional, national, and international; and 5. the promotion of collective guarantees. On the basis of these variables, today’s international legal order presents the following distinctive features compared to prior phases of the international order (see Tables 4, 5, 6 infra). 1. A (re) organization of power structures and authority. The classical, unorganized international community is progressively moving towards becoming a more organized entity, vertically structured, due to the increasing institutionalization of law-making, law enforcement, and judicial processes; the proliferation of international courts and tribunals; the increasing authority of international bodies, and the development of democratic forms of participation in the decision-making process for various new actors. A wide range of new law-making processes and enforcement mechanisms results in integrated procedures more rapid as compared to customary procedure and more informal as regards UN Chapter VII enforcement system, working to overturn the veto rule. 2. An expansion of the social base and the development of constitutional principles. The transformation of international law from mere inter-state law to the law of universal human society, in which the range of legal subjects increasingly includes not only states but also individuals and new players. Constitutional norms and legal principles protecting public values and goods have been established at an international level, together with the fundamental rights of individuals and of peoples; these supreme principles, which are ‘public’ in character, complement the ‘private’ norms that protect the interests of individual states and relations between them. 3. A development of integration processes between legal systems. Domestic law is increasingly adapting to international law through regional integration, the harmonization of legislation, and by means of standard conventions. 4. A consolidation of collective guarantees. New mechanisms, inspired by the principle of collective enforcement, have been established for the objective enforcement of the above-mentioned supreme constitutional principles, by setting up new international tribunals and forms of judicial control and introducing new sanctions regimes, suitable to function against states, entities, groups and individuals. It follows that globalization has changed not only the law but also international decision-making processes, enforcement strategies and the interactions between the international legal system and legal systems at other levels (regional and domestic). On the basis of these findings, I have identifie d th e ke y element s o f th e global legal system which I have termed the ‘pillars’ of global law, i. e., verticality of decision-making processes; legality and safeguarding of common values and goods; integration between legal systems and processes; development of forms of collective guarantees. What I am arguing for is also that States have agreed on a set of legal rules and procedures and an operating organization which is based on that set of rules to collectively deal with public needs. Thus, this book aims to explicate the existence of an autonomous legal system: using a systemic approach, it strives to present the foundations of this emerging law for the global community – what I will call ‘Global Law’. The book is organized into four Parts, reflecting the four pillars outlined above, dealing with the ways in which the decision-making processes of the global legal system and fundamental functions of the global community are carried out/ performed (law-making; law-enforcement; judicial functions); the features peculiar to the system, both the fairness/legality and the law-integration; and the construction of an embryonic system of collective guarantees. Accordingly, the global legal system is described by examining: Part I – Verticality and sharing of the decisional processes Part II – Legality principles and common global values Part III – Integration of legal systems in the direction of global law Part IV – Collective guarantees: an embryonic new system. Therefore, the first part deals with constitutive processes of social organization such as hierarchy, authority, allocation of powers, and functions, through an analysis of the mechanisms of joint governance and processes of multilateral authoritative decision- making; it is devoted to the three above-mentioned functions, in which more and more international institutions are taking part, thus fostering the development of a supranational system of governance and the verticalization of international power (Part I, Chapters 1 – 3). There then follow two parts describing the main characteristics of the emerging global law system. One of them describes the increasing legality of a system which overturns the ‘private’ nature of inter-state law by shifting the centre of gravity from the State towards Humanity and to future generations, and safeguarding the basic right of Man as well as universal values, to the detriment of the sovereignty of the States that are restricted through principles of legality. Legality, a cornerstone of the new global law, is compared with the principle of effectivity, a cornerstone of the classical international system that has been eroded by the rise of legality, yet remains ready to re-emerge (Part II, Chapter 4). The other part addresses the growing harmonization between domestic and international legal systems, describing the process of integration between legal systems, achieved through the subordination of national law to norms laid down by international organizations, regional and universal. The emphasis here is on the rules and principles that ensure an effective and uniform application of international law in state legal systems in the move towards the construction of a global law. I describe an integrated structure of global legal order and its organization into concentric circles within which the various legal systems (national, sub-regional, regional, international), ordered hierarchically and subordinated between themselves, are dominated by the system of the UN Charter; all of which, in turn, is subject to the supreme principles of global law (jus cogens). The verticality of the global system poses problems of coordination between various different legal systems and this leads to the necessity to focus on the relationship between them (Part III, Chapter 5). The final part underlines the passage from self-protection to heteronomous processes for the protection of global fundamental values and contains a reconstruction of a new collective guarantee system: procedures and integrated mechanisms of safeguard which seek to adapt to the needs and characteristics of the non-state actors following the broadening of the social base to accommodate the new actors (Part IV, Chapters 6 – 9). In conclusion, I argue that today’s international legal order is developing into a truly global system of law. I certainly do not mean to say that it has already been structured, much less disavow the importance that ‘inter-state’ international law has had and will continue to have. In my vision of a world law system, the sphere of legal relationships established between states comes within the field of what in internal law is ‘private’ law, whilst emerging ‘global law’ represents the ‘public’ dimension of the world legal system, establishing a new juridical organization of the world. The book is complemented by six Tables in the annex that provide an overview of the development of international law in the three stages of development from the Congress of Westphalia in 1648 to the present. Two tables supplement the text and facilitate reading; the other four summarize in systematic form the topics under discussion and the features of a global legal system. This book draws on more than 25 years of analysis of the transformation of the international community and its legal system. It arises from the thesis of the ‘verticalization’ of the international community, which I first outlined in 1977 1 and developed further in a number of later studies. This thesis, moreover, has been largely confirmed by recent developments in international practice and the rise of globalization. International integrated processes of decision making based upon this concept have become concrete and formal...|$|R

The number and complexity of cross border transactions have increased because of ti ie pace of globalisation, and many of these transactions envisage arbitration as the method of dispute settlement. When a foreign arbitral tribunal makes an award against a non-signatory, the court before which enforcement of that award is sought must determine whether the award is a New York Convention award.

Sustainable development, {{as defined}} by the World Commission on Environment and Development, is “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. ” More specifically, {{sustainable}} development is a process of change that seeks to improve the collective quality of life by focusing on economically, socially, and environmentally sound projects that are viable in the long-term. Sustainable development requires structural economic change and the foundation of that change is investment. In developing nations with low levels of domestic savings, investment predictably comes from abroad in the form of foreign direct investment. A large and ever expanding number of international investment agreements are in place to govern these transactions. While these accords seek to foster development while mitigating the risk involved in these types investments, many questions remain unresolved. This highly insightful book reflects the contributions of a variety of world renowned experts each of which is designed to provide the reader with valuable perspective on recent developments in investment law negotiations and jurisprudence from a sustainable development law perspective. It offers answers to pertinent questions concerning advancements in investment law, including the negotiation of numerous regional and bilateral agreements as well as the increasing number of disputes resolved in the World Bank’s International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), from different developed and developing country perspectives. It lays out future directions for new treaty negotiations and dispute settlement proceedings, as well as ongoing investment promotion efforts, against a background of rapidly evolving international relationships between economic, environment and development law. It focuses on key issues in investment laws which have emerged as priorities in the negotiation of bilateral and regional investment agreements, and have been clarified through recent decisions of the ICSID and other <b>arbitral</b> <b>panel</b> awards.

40|$|Public policy favors {{protecting}} {{intellectual property}} in arbitration, and both Congress {{and the courts}} support, and in fact encourage, arbitration of intellectual property disputes. This support stems {{from the history of}} favoritism toward private arbitration agreements and other alternative dispute resolution in lieu of judicial adjudication. Because intellectual property disputes often involve commercial parties transacting business across state lines, arbitration is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Availability of provisional remedies such as injunctions has also proven effective in the area of intellectual property disputes. However, unlike the option and process of private arbitration where there is little to no court involvement, provisional remedies can be awarded either by the <b>arbitral</b> <b>panel</b> or by court order. As a result, complications arise when parties decide to involve the courts when seeking provisional remedies pending arbitration of disputes. Courts are split as to whether parties can seek provisional remedies such as preliminary injunctions in disputes that are subject to arbitration under the FAA. 2 ̆ 2 This paper will demonstrate the consequences of the unavailability of provisional remedies by examining the cases involving Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner 2 ̆ 6 Smith, Inc. (Merrill Lynch), an investment firm, in the field of trade secret disputes with former employees. In short, the cases illustrate how this split in the Circuit Courts can have an unwarranted impact on the enforceability of protective covenants in employment agreements. This paper suggests that the courts should not only be uniform in their interpretation of the extent of their authority to issue preliminary injunctions under the FAA, but they should also adopt a common standard for issuing such injunctions. This paper will introduce the concept of trade secrets in section I(A). Section II will introduce preliminary injunctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and its relationship to trade secret disputes. The Federal Arbitration Act will be discussed in section III.
