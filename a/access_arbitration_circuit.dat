Modeling and simulating wireless communication is critical in exploration and optimization of WSNs as it enables evaluation of system design choices early in the design process.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} important probabilistic {{elements that}} {{should be taken into}} consideration in the analysis of performance of classical multiprocessor systems. These elements represent the following quantities: modified arrival rate for processor requests and a few probabilities, which determine the frequency of certain events when a multiprocessor system is working. There are four peculiar events: service of another job, existence of the queue, a processor request while the given task is waiting into the queue and the return of another task into the queue while the given task is waiting in the queue. The first three events happen more often when a system consists of less number of processors, whereas the fourth event happens more often when more processors work in a system. Including (or not) the probabilities of these events to the analysis of performance of multiprocessor systems exerts its much influence on the precision of computations. All the mentioned quantities were described in detail. Formulas for these quantities were derived.

40|$|International audience—Recent {{advances}} in microelectronics have enabled {{the realization of}} Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). However, the massive growth in wireless devices and the push for interconnecting these devices to form an Internet of Things (IoT) can be challenging for WBANs; hence robust communication is necessary through careful medium <b>access</b> <b>arbitration.</b> In this paper, we propose a new protocol to enable WBAN operation within an IoT.

Accordingly, a BLE informs WBANs through announcements about the frequency channels that are being used in their vicinity. To mitigate interference, the superframe's active period is extended to involve not only a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, but also a Flexible Channel Selection (FCS) and a Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC).

40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} can {{be employed}} {{in a wide range}} of applications such as disaster management, combat field surveillance and homeland security. Sensors in such applications are deployed in mass and are usually constrained in the amount of available onboard energy. This paper presents ARCH, a distributed medium <b>access</b> <b>Arbitration</b> of multi-Radio-CHannel based sensor networks. ARCH is an energy efficient, scalable and collision free MAC layer protocol that combines frequency and time division principles for medium sharing. To achieve scalability sensors are partitioned into cells. One of the sensors in a cell is designated as a cell-head. ARCH employs a distributed algorithm for arbitrating channels among cells to enable simultaneous non-interfering data collection. Intra-cell transmissions are scheduled by the cell-head using the assigned channel. Cell-heads aggregate the gathered data and forward it over inter-cell-head paths to the base-station. The base-station assigns distinct channels to the independent branches of the intercell routing tree. Data transmission and reception on a branch is further scheduled in depth-first ordering. ARCH allows nodes to stay in the sleep mode for the longest duration and avoids collisions and thus it minimizes energy consumption and boosts the robustness of the network operation. The performance of ARCH is validated through simulation. I...|$|R
40|$|In time-domain or pulse-modulation (PM) imaging, the {{incident}} light intensity is not encoded in amounts of charge, voltage, or current {{as it is}} in conventional image sensors. Instead, the image data are represented by the timing of pulses or pulse edges. This method of visual information encoding optimizes the phototransduction individually for each pixel by abstaining from imposing a fixed integration time for the entire array. Exceptionally high dynamic range (DR) and improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are immediate benefits of this approach. In particular, DR is no longer limited by the power-supply rails as in conventional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) complementary metal-oxide semiconductor active pixel sensors, thus providing relative immunity to the supply-voltage scaling of modern CMOS technologies. In addition, PM imaging naturally supports pixel-parallel analog-to-digital conversion, thereby enabling high temporal resolution/frame rates or an asynchronous event-based array readout. The applications of PM imaging in emerging areas, such as sensor network, wireless endoscopy, retinal prosthesis, polarization imaging, and energy harvesting are surveyed to demonstrate the effectiveness of PM imaging in low-power, high-performance machine vision, and biomedical applications of the future.

40|$|The shared-medium multi-hop {{nature of}} {{wireless}} ad hoc networks poses fundamental {{challenges to the}} design of an effective resource allocation algorithm to maximize the aggregated utility of flows, while maintaining basic fairness among multiple flows. When previously proposed scheduling algorithms have been shown to perform well in providing fair shares of bandwidth among single-hop wireless flows, they did not consider multi-hop flows with an endto -end perspective. Moreover, the resource allocation strategies employed in the wireline network can not be applied directly in the context of ad hoc networks due to the unique characteristic of location dependent contention and spatial reuse of the shared wireless channel. In this paper, we propose a price-based resource allocation model to achieve maximized aggregated utility (i. e., social welfare) of flows.
