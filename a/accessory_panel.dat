2500|$|Also new for 1977 was VAM's first {{station wagon}} {{that was not}} an economy base model, the first in 17 years. This model was not a new trim level but a package {{included}} with {{the order of the}} automatic transmission. Like the American GFS, the engine changed from the 258 six to the 282 cu in unit and the 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio. Like the American ECD, it shared the column-mounted gearshift and high-trim-upholstered bench seats (fold down rear unit) and special side <b>panels.</b> <b>Accessories</b> shared with both luxury sedans included power brakes, power steering, heavy duty suspension, bumper guards, full bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, [...] "4.6" [...] emblems (GFS only), tinted windshield, luxury steering wheel, electric analog clock, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light) as well as all the general line novelties of the year. This created a luxury wagon {{for the first time in}} VAM's line up. The downside was that the economy base wagon would no longer be available with the option of an automatic transmission. VAM wagons with this package did not obtain a specific name since it was not a trim level, it was known within VAM and in printed materials as [...] "Camioneta Automática" [...] (automatic wagon). It would be until 1979 that it would officially obtain a designation, now based on the Concord-wagon, making [...] "American DL" [...] its full name.|$|R
