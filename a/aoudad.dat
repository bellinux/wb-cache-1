The effort was successful and soon animals were being sold to zoos and some sent back to their native lands to replenish dwindling herds. As the herds prospered, management was required to limit size. Hunting the exotics for profit became one of the revenue sources for the ranch. Exotics on the Y.O. soon included fallow deer from England, sika deer from Japan, barrasingha deer from India, Pere David deer from China, and <b>aoudad</b> sheep from North Africa. While all of these were hunted, other exotic animals which were not hunted were added. These included fringe-eared Oryx, eland, zebra, and the flightless birds, rhea, ostrich and emu.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{geographical}} distribution and habitat suitability of an introduced ungulate, the <b>aoudad</b> (Ammotragus lervia), {{that is currently}} expanding its range in south-eastern Iberian Peninsula. We assessed the niche of the species using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) on (1) environmental variables (climate and habitat type), and (2) potential <b>aoudad</b> landscape avoidance and human disturbance variables. We compared both niche descriptions to study the impact of human interference on niche selection of the species. ENFA models were calibrated using data on the population expanded from the original release location, in Sierra Espuña mountains, and validated using data from another free-ranging population, originated independently in the Alicante province. The habitat suitability model for the purely environmental niche predicts a potential distribution along a SW–NE axis in the study area, following the Cordillera Sub-Bética mountain range, being constrained by low winter precipitation, high altitude, high terrain slope, {{and the presence of}} forest. In addition to these ecological traits, roads and landscape use restricted the environmental range potentially available for the species. Since the <b>aoudad</b> is a potential competitor of native ungulates and a threat to endemic flora, prospects for its potential dispersion might be of great conservation value. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al XXXth International Union of Game Biologists and Perdix XIII, celebrados en Barcelona (España) del 5 al 9 de septiembre de 2011. Spatio-temporal {{co-occurrence of}} three {{ungulate}} species living in sympatry {{was investigated in}} a Mediterranean environment: one native, the Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus), and two exotics, the European mouflon (Ovis orientalis musimon) and the <b>aoudad</b> (Ammotragus lervia). The aim {{of the study was}} to infer any potential interspecific competition. All possible pairs of combinations (dyads) were considered. In order to compare the probability of species co-occurrence, multiple tests of significance for all 2 by 2 combinations were performed using a Pearson’s chi-square test. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of the reproductive period, habitat, and several group attributes on co-occurrence patterns for each dyad. The probability of co-occurrence varied between dyads, and it was not always explained by random associations according to species abundance. <b>Aoudad</b> groups thus co-occur with mouflon groups at a higher rate than expected by random. Habitat type was the most important variable explaining co-occurrence of red deer with the other two species, mainly mouflon. This variable did not influence, however, co-occurrence of <b>aoudad</b> and mouflon. Among the hypotheses proposed to explain <b>aoudad</b> association behaviour with the other two species, competitive displacement by red deer in the past and improvements in foraging efficiency due to its association with mouflon appeared to be the most feasible explanations. As for mouflon and red deer, direct interactions might be expected at artificial food and water sources as well as resource competition under food shortage conditions in habitats preferred by both species.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of alien species to new environments {{is one of}} the main threats to the conservation of biodiversity. One particularly problematic example is that of wild ungulates which are increasingly being established in regions outside their natural distribution range due to human hunting interests. Unfortunately, we know little of the effects these large herbivores may have on the host ecosystems. This study deals with a first comparative analysis of the habitat requirements of two ungulate species that may be facing competition for resources in the south of Europe: the native Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) and the exotic <b>aoudad</b> (Ammotragus lervia). The <b>aoudad</b> is a North African caprid introduced in 1970 as a game species in south-eastern Spain. It has adapted well, and populations have been freely expanding since then. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis is used to describe the realized niche of both species where their distribution ranges merge. Both species occupy marginal areas of rugged terrain in the region. Marginality is higher for the Iberian ibex, which also presents a higher tolerance of secondary environmental gradients than the <b>aoudad.</b> Highly suitable areas for each species are secondarily suitable for the other. Reclassified and cross-tabulated habitat suitability maps showing the areas of potential spatial coexistence and differences in ecological traits between both species are provided. The results obtained do not allow inferring resource competition between these species. However, current <b>aoudad</b> expansion could result in it invading the favoured habitats of the ibex. Inadequate hunting policy and monitoring, and increasing climatic resemblance of the study region to the native <b>aoudad</b> areas, due to a strong desertification process, are facilitating a high rate of expansion. We strongly recommend to eradicate or, at least, monitor these exotic populations, and promote active conservation practices, if one wants to preserve the unique natural resources present in this European region.

40|$|A micro-histological {{analysis}} of composite faecal samples {{was used to}} determine the food plants consumed by the <b>aoudad</b> Ammotragus lervia (Barbary sheep) in the mountains of Bou Hedma National Park, as well as to study food preferences and seasonal variation of the diet of this ungulate. A total of 19 plant species was identified in the faecal samples: 8 grasses, 6 browse types and 5 forbs. The annual diet of this ungulate is composed of approximately 67 % grasses, 17 % browse and 16 % forbs. Two grass species, Stipa parviflora and Stipa tenacissima, comprised 97 % of grasses consumed and 63 % of the annual diet, and were eaten in the year with considerably greater frequency than any other plant species. The diet of the <b>aoudad</b> at Bou Hedma National Park showed a seasonal variation. For example, grasses were consumed the entire year with a preference in spring (72. 57 %) and summer (78. 31 %), but their occurrence in the diet dropped in winter (38. 7 %). Browse was eaten preferentially in autumn (21. 86 %) and forbs were utilised most during winter (43. 22 %) and least during summer (7. 53 %).

40|$|An {{analysis}} of individuals' behavior when accessing a restricted food source (troughs) {{was carried out}} in a captive population of <b>aoudad</b> (Ammotragus lervia). Access to the troughs followed a strict hierarchical order, as higher-ranking individuals fed before lower-ranking ones. Unweaned male and female calves made use of the troughs from the ages of 2 and 3 months, respectively. Both fed from the troughs more frequently and for longer periods when their mother was present, which allowed them {{to make use of the}} troughs while skipping the hierarchical order. Calves received fewer threats when in proximity to their mothers, particularly in high-ranking families. Mothers defended their calves from other herdmates more frequently when at the feeding area than in other areas of the herd. However, only sated mothers let their calves feed freely from the troughs; unsated mothers showed an aggressive behavior even toward their calves. I conclude that a maternal presence is necessary for <b>aoudad</b> calves to successfully feed from troughs, and that families of higher social rank benefit by getting access to this food source earlier in the day and are disturbed less than low-ranking families.

40|$|Evidence of <b>aoudad</b> Ammotragus lervia {{expansion}} in the southeastern quarter of the Iberian Peninsula is provided based on recent field surveys. <b>Aoudad</b> has become common in a limited region of the southeast of Spain since its introduction as a game species in Sierra Espuña Natural Park in 1970. Its adaptability enabled it to colonise nearby areas in a short period. Apart from this source of expansion, {{the increasing number of}} aoudads in Spanish private game reserves provided other centres of dispersion. In addition, aoudads were introduced on La Palma Island (Canary Islands), becoming a serious threat to endemic flora. Of great conservation concern is the species' potential as a competitor against native ungulates inhabiting the peninsula. Surveys conducted in southern Spain documented rapid colonization of new areas and established viable populations, consisting of adult males and females and the unequivocal presence of nursery groups, in the provinces of Alicante, Almería, Granada and Murcia. Also, aoudads have spread throughout the north and centre of La Palma. There are two main conservational concerns: the necessity of conducting detailed and reliable surveys in all potential regions where the species might expand, and the urgent need of changing current game policies in order to establish reliable controls on big game reserves to prevent animals from escaping.

Phylogenetic analyses support the evidence that caprines share a common ancestor that probably carried the A-haplotype and that a more recent deletion of a gene set gave rise to the duplicated cluster containing the HBBB locus (B-haplotype) found in sheep of the Hb B type and Cypriot mouflon, which evolved independently. Data also suggests that the Ammotragus β-globin gene is older than genes of the examined caprines and indicates it followed an independent evolution after separating from species having the same HBBA locus. Similarly, phylogenetic analyses of β-globin chain sequences suggest a different evolution for globins coded by the HBBA locus with respect to the HBBB. Ammotragus β-globin chain shows all the amino acids responsible for the low oxygen affinity of ruminant Hbs.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} horn size in wild Caprinae are {{of biological}} and socio-economic interest because several species are selectively harvested {{on the basis}} of this heritable character. We analysed temporal trends in horn size in two mountain ungulates from south-eastern Spain, the Iberian wild goat Capra pyrenaica and the <b>aoudad</b> Ammotragus lervia. Trophy harvest is the main way in which these two species are exploited, although >poor-quality> aoudads are also selectively removed. In recent years, both populations have suffered drastic decreases in number due to outbreaks of sarcoptic mange that led to the suspension of hunting for several years. Horn length in harvested male wild goats and aoudads declined during our study period. Over an 18 -year period, the mean age of male goats shot as trophies rose by four years, while the age of trophy-harvested aoudads decreased by around six months over a 9 -year period. Age and environmental conditions during the first few years of life explained 20 % of variance in horn size in Iberian wild goat and 53 % in <b>aoudad.</b> Population density early in life explained much of the reduction in goat horn size over time. Nevertheless, the major fall in population densities after the sarcoptic mange outbreaks did not lead to a recovery in horn size in either species. We suggest that the selective removal of large-horned animals may contribute to a decline in horn size. Other factors that may also explain the observed pattern include changes in interspecific competition, long-lasting maternal effects and reduced carrying capacity due to overgrazing during high density periods. Unfortunately, our data sets did not allow us to account for the possible effects of these factors. © Wildlife Biology, NKV. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
