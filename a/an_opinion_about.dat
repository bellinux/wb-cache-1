However, this was the highest awareness rating in the Democratic field outside of the frontrunners (Clinton, Obama, and Edwards) and non-declared but highly discussed Al Gore. A September 18 poll found that 56% of respondents had not heard enough about Biden to form <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> him.|$|E

Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E
25|$|During the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, the Druze in Mandatory Palestine {{were under}} {{pressure}} from both the Jewish Yishuv leadership and from the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee and {{found it difficult to}} form <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> the conflict between the Jews and the Palestinian Arabs. Noble Druze men from nearby countries visited Druze villages in Palestine and preached neutrality. During {{the early days of the}} conflict, a meeting of all the noblemen from all the Druze villages was conducted in Daliyat al-Karmel, where they all agreed not to take part in the riots instigated by the Arab Higher Committee. This decision was backed by Druze leaders in Jabal al-Druze. In the Druze community there were opposing trends: In mixed Druze and Muslim villages such as Isfiya, Shefa-'Amr and Maghar where there were old sectarial disputes and in Druze villages near Haifa and the Jewish settlement in the western Galilee, the local Druze leaders tended to prefer the Jews in the conflict; at the Druze villages deep in Arab areas, the local leaders were more careful with support of the Jews. Josh Palmon was tasked by the Jewish Agency for Israel to manage the relationship with the Druze. He initially led a preventive approach with the Druze, aimed at making sure the Druze will not join the Arab Higher Committee.|$|E

[...] The show received a broadcast standards request that the anti-gay video the priest shows Lois say [...] "Pat Robertson Industries," [...] so as not {{to make it look like}} Fox had <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> homosexuals. The writers had a problem with Lois being against gay marriage, as they felt they were not portraying her in a way that is consistent with other episodes as she expressed a more liberal viewpoint on many past issues on the show and even expressed a generally more accepting view of gays in the episode Brian Sings and Swings. The DVD version has a deleted scene during the backyard wedding ending where Ricardo (who doesn't speak English) asks Stewie what's going on and Stewie (who speaks Tagalog) tells Ricardo that he'll find out on his wedding night.|$|E
