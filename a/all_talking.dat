5|$|All of Chaplin's films {{up to and}} {{including}} The Circus (1928) were silent, although many were re-issued with soundtracks. City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) were essentially silent films, although they were made with soundtracks consisting of music and sound effects, with talking sequences in the latter film. Chaplin's last five films were <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> pictures. Aside from A Countess From Hong Kong, all of Chaplin's films were photographed in 35mm black-and-white.|$|E
500|$|When [...] "talkies" [...] {{began to}} gain {{momentum}} in the film industry, the Hollywood studios recruited the best talent from Broadway to make musical films. These films included Broadway Melody, which was promoted as the first [...] "all singing, <b>all</b> <b>talking,</b> all dancing" [...] film and had music by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, and Berkley's 42nd Street, his first major success. These films established the backstage musical, a subgenre in which the plot revolves around a stage show and {{the people involved in}} putting on the show. These first musicals set the standard for the genre, placing their musical numbers either {{within the context of a}} stage performance or tacked on and gratuitous, without furthering the story or developing the characters. Donen stated that he disliked them and that his own films were [...] "a reaction against those backstage musicals." [...] Donen credits producer Freed as the driving force behind the transition, adding that Freed [...] "had some sort of instinct to change the musical from a backstage world into something else. He didn't quite know what to change it into, just that it had to change." [...] Kelly stated that Donen was the only person he knew that understood how musicals could progress and better suit the film medium.|$|E
2500|$|You pledged {{during the}} last debate {{that you would not}} raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of {{everything}} is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? ...|$|E

2500|$|Digital Spy {{wondered}} if {{there could be a}} further twist where one of the five named suspects is not the culprit, as the BBC said there would be [...] "at least" [...] five. Soaplife added Joey Branning (David Witts) as a wild card, saying, [...] "there hasn't been a good soap toyboy storyline in we can't remember how long. And when they're done and done good, they're very, very good. It would actually be the one affair we'd understand Kat's motivation for." [...] Jacqueline Jossa, who plays Max's daughter Lauren Branning, said that the cast were so [...] "desperate" [...] to know who Kat's lover was that she tricked them into believing it was Peter Andre, saying, [...] "No one at all knows who Kat's having the affair with, we're <b>all</b> <b>talking</b> about it on set. Some people have started winding other people up saying they've been told but they won't say who it is. I started a rumour around the set {{that it would be a}} celebrity guest appearance. I said it would be Peter Andre and some of the new cast believed it as well!" [...] Tony Discipline, who plays Michael's half-brother Tyler Moon, {{wondered if}} Kat's lover could actually be a woman. However, Digital Spy reported that episodes in September 2012 would make it [...] "pretty much certain" [...] that Kat's lover is one of the named suspects. After the identity of Kat's lover was revealed, Richie said he would have loved it to have been Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) or Tanya.|$|E
