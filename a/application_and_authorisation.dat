40|$|Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an {{emerging}} paradigm {{that changes the}} way networks are managed by separating the control plane from data plane and making networks programmable. The separation brings about flexibility, automation, orchestration and offers savings in both capital and operational expenditure. Despite all the advantages offered by SDN it introduces new threats {{that did not exist}} before or were harder to exploit in traditional networks, making network penetration potentially easier. One of the key threat to SDN is the authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> of network <b>applications</b> that control network behaviour (unlike the traditional network where network devices like routers and switches are autonomous and run proprietary software and protocols to control the network).

40|$|We propose here a {{mechanism}} for history-dependent access control for a distributed object-oriented system, implemented using reflection. In a history-dependent access control system, access is decided based {{not only on the}} current request, but also on the previous history of accesses to some entity or service. We consider timing constraints expressed using temporal logic, and we describe a possible implementation for our mechanism. The expected benefits from the reflective approach are: more stability of the security layer (i. e., with a more limited number of hidden bugs), better software modularity, more reusability, and the possibility to adapt the security module with relatively few changes to other <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> other <b>authorisation</b> policies.

We introduce a novel wireless mesh architecture that supports authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> functionalities, giving {{the possibility of a}} seamless WMN integration into the home’s organization authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> infrastructure. First, we introduce a novel authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> mechanism for wireless mesh nodes. The mechanism is de-signed upon an existing federated access control approach, i. e. the AAI infrastructure that is using just the credentials at the user’s home organization in a federation. Second, we demonstrate how authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> for end users is implemented by using an existing web-based captive portal approach. Finally, we observe {{the difference between the two}} and explain in detail the process flow of authorized access to network resources in wireless mesh networks. The goal of our wireless mesh architecture is to enable easy broadband network access to researchers at remote locations, giving them additional advantage of a secure access to their measurements, irrespective of their location. It also provides an important basis for the real-life deployment of wireless mesh networks for the support of environmental research.
