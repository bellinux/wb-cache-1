25|$|With the 2005 {{cooperation}} agreement with Mercosur, the <b>Andean</b> <b>Community</b> gained four new associate members: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. These four Mercosur members were granted associate membership by the Andean Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in an enlarged {{session with the}} Commission (of the <b>Andean</b> <b>Community)</b> on 7 July 2005. This move reciprocates the actions of Mercosur, which granted associate membership to all the <b>Andean</b> <b>Community</b> nations {{by virtue of the}} Economic Complementarity Agreements (Free Trade Agreements) signed between the CAN and individual Mercosur members.|$|E

Since its foundation in 1991/4, Mercosur's functions have been updated, amended, and changed many times. It is now a full customs union and a trading bloc. Mercosur and the <b>Andean</b> <b>Community</b> of Nations are customs unions that are components of a continuing process of South American integration connected to the Union of South American Nations (USAN).|$|E

25|$|In {{conducting}} Peru’s {{relations with}} Brazil, Toledo's {{goal was to}} reorient Peru from the <b>Andean</b> <b>Community,</b> toward the more economically active Brazil and MERCOSUR. In August 2003, Toledo met with Brazilian ex-president Lula. They committed to increased political and economic cooperation under the Initiative for Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America which invests in large-scale, debt-heavy projects, aimed at developing 10 economic axes or hubs throughout South America. Construction projects, including roads, discussed. President Lula also agreed to allow Peru access to two surveillance systems which Brazil had developed in the Amazon Basin to target legal and illegal activity.|$|E
25|$|The Toledo {{administration}} was unusually active in foreign policy. Its major goals were promoting democracy outside Peru, addressing {{the struggle against}} poverty, encouraging economic development in the borderlands, reducing arms spending in the region, strengthening relations with Asia-Pacific countries, and integrating with the <b>Andean</b> <b>Community</b> of Nations. Peru also became an associate member of MERCOSUR, a free trade zone that would be established gradually. The objective was for signing nations to gradually build up an infrastructure that would ease trade with one another, to cooperate in the improvement of energy efficiency, and to commit to future agreements that would increase cross border investment by eliminating double taxation.|$|E
25|$|The major trade blocs (or {{agreements}}) in {{the region}} are the Pacific Alliance and Mercosur. Minor blocs or trade agreements are the G3 Free Trade Agreement, the Dominican Republic – Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the <b>Andean</b> <b>Community</b> of Nations (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise. Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico are the only four Latin American nations that have an FTA with the United States and Canada, both members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E

2500|$|The {{effects of}} climate change in Peru can be seen in more extreme weather {{conditions}} and El Niño Southern Oscillation causing droughts and floods, and the retreat of Andean glaciers. The combined impacts of global warming and extreme weather are likely to severely impact hydrology, decreasing the water flow available for irrigation downstream in the coastal region and altering crop productivity. The <b>Andean</b> <b>Community</b> (...) estimates that climate change will cause US$30,000 million in losses or 4,5% of the GDP annually starting in 2025.|$|E

40|$|Vicuñas (Vicugna vicugna) are South American {{camelids}} whose valuable fleece led {{to their}} overexploitation and near extinction in the 1960 s. Since then, conservation measures enabled the wild population to rebound, and vicuñas are now viewed as strategic resources {{for the development of}} <b>Andean</b> <b>communities.</b> Perceptions of wild vicuñas are changing owed to a transition from strict conservation to managed harvest of fleece from live-shorn animals. Understanding the values and attitudes of human populations toward wildlife is important in the frameworks for developing conservation and sustainable management plans. Attitudes of children are an overlooked area of focus in this field. We surveyed children (n= 348) from four <b>Andean</b> <b>communities</b> of the Puna region in Argentina regarding their perceptions of wild vicuñas and their relationships with domesticated animals. They recognized the potential of wild vicuñas to promote economic development, although they believed that the wild nature of vicuñas made management difficult and not always desirable...|$|R

The project also includes workshops for the children to motivate their written, narrative, and artistic skills and talents. Writing and drawing materials are also donated.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Mercosur {{signed a}} {{cooperation}} {{agreement with the}} <b>Andean</b> <b>Community</b> of Nations trade bloc (CAN) and they published a joint letter of intent for future negotiations towards integrating all of South America. The prospect of increased political integration within the organization, as per the European Union and advocated by some, is still uncertain. Bolivia, {{also a member of}} CAN and an associate member of Mercosur before the UNASUR process started, plays a crucial part in relations, says Marion Hörmann, since Bolivia is traditionally seen as a mediator between the Andean countries and the rest of South America.|$|E
2500|$|On May 8, 2006 Humala {{met with}} Bolivian President Evo Morales in Copacabana, Bolivia on the Bolivian border with Peru. While meeting with Morales Humala {{stated that he}} stood in [...] "solidarity with the {{historical}} and legitimate demand of the Bolivian Republic" [...] {{of access to the}} Pacific Ocean which Bolivia lost after the War of the Pacific when Chile annexed what is now the Antofagasta Region of Chile. Humala also explicitly stated that he was not opposed to a free trade agreement with the United States but said that any free trade agreement with the United States would have to be negotiated through the <b>Andean</b> <b>Community</b> (CAN) and signed with approval of all members of CAN. During the meeting Humala emphasised the need to maintain CAN as a bloc to negotiate with the United States and asked Morales to work to help maintain the CAN, referring to the CAN's recent troubles with Venezuela removing itself as a member in protest to the signing of trade agreements with the U.S. by Peru and Colombia.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores {{decentralisation}} in {{the context}} of the emergence of indigenous peasant movements in Bolivia. It examines the Bolivian state territorial reconfiguration through decentralisation, with a focus on the impact the process of municipalisation had on indigenous territoriality and social differentiation within <b>Andean</b> <b>communities.</b> It is argued in this thesis that the scope of the Popular Participation Law proves to be more complex in practice than the aims stated by the promoters of the law and by the associated literature. The thesis shows how the municipalisation in fact comes to play a concomitant role in the neoliberal strategy of land property structure modernisation. It also explores how the incorporation of rural <b>Andean</b> indigenous <b>communities</b> into 'national life' as an element of the neoliberal strategies framed on widening the reach of the market come to affect Andean strategies of space management.
