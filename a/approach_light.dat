5|$|In 1971 a Boeing 747, {{operating}} as Pan Am 845 struck <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> structures for the reciprocal runway as it lifted off the runway at San Francisco Airport. Major {{damage to the}} belly and landing gear resulted, which caused the loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four flight control systems. The fluid which remained in the fourth system gave the captain very limited control {{of some of the}} spoilers, ailerons, and one inboard elevator. That was sufficient to circle the plane while fuel was dumped and then to make a hard landing. There were no fatalities, but there were some injuries.|$|E
25|$|On July 30, 1971, Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747 (registration: N747PA, name: Clipper America), struck {{navigational aids}} {{at the end}} of runway 1R on takeoff for Tokyo. The aircraft's landing gear and other systems were damaged. Two {{passengers}} were seriously injured by metal components of the runway <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> pier entering the cabin. The flight proceeded out over the Pacific Ocean to dump fuel to reduce weight for an emergency landing. Emergency services deployed at the airport, and the plane returned and landed on runway 28R. During landing the aircraft veered off the runway. There was no fire. After coming to a stop, the aircraft slowly tilted aft, coming to rest on its tail in a nose-high attitude. The forward evacuation slides were therefore in a nearly vertical position. Evacuation using these slides caused all of the additional injuries, some severe. There were no fatalities among the 218 passengers and crew members aboard. An investigation determined that the cause of the accident was erroneous information from the flight dispatcher to the crew members regarding weight and runway length.|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, 1982, World Airways Flight 30 from Newark to Boston made a {{non-precision}} {{instrument approach}} to runway 15R and touched down [...] past the displaced threshold on an icy runway. When the crew sensed that the DC-10-30-CF couldn't be {{stopped on the}} remaining runway, they steered the DC-10 {{off the side of}} the runway to avoid the <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> pier, and slid into the shallow water of Boston Harbor. The nose section separated as the DC-10 came to rest [...] past the runway end, [...] left of the extended centerline. Two passengers (a father and son) were never found and are presumed to have been swept out to sea.|$|E

2500|$|G-AJDL left Northolt at 7:27, about 25 minutes late. Two {{hours later}} it was on {{approach}} to Nutts Corner. When the aircraft was [...] out from the runway threshold it was [...] above the glideslope. The aircraft then rapidly lost height and hit the pole supporting an <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> {{a short distance from}} the aerodrome. Following the initial impact the aircraft hit further poles; it then hit a mobile standard beam approach van before striking a brick building housing equipment operating the instrument landing system about [...] from the runway. This impact caused the aircraft to break up. There was a slight fire after the accident.|$|E
2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} was {{the crash of}} Flight 1030X on 14 April 1965. BUA (Channel Islands) Douglas C-47B-20-DK (registration: G-ANTB) was operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris Orly to Jersey. Despite the deteriorating weather conditions at Jersey's States Airport, the crew decided to continue its approach to runway 27. This approach was abandoned because runway visual range fell below minima. When the aircraft made a second approach, it struck the outermost pole of the <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> system at a height of , [...] short of the runway threshold. This caused the aircraft to crash into the approach lights and catch fire, which killed 26 of the 27 occupants (three out of four crew members and all 23 passengers).|$|E
2500|$|Ängelholm–Helsingborg Airport was {{primarily}} a military air station, denoted F10 Ängelholm. Because of this its instrument landing system was configured significantly different from most civilian airports. The runway's two radio beacons, LJ and J, were located at unusual distances from normal. LJ was situated [...] from the runway threshold instead of the normal [...] and J was located at [...] instead of the normal [...] Also, the approach lighting system's strobeacon was located [...] from and [...] starboard of the runway's center line, but this light was not indicated on the instrument, approach and landing chart. Therefore, any aircraft which would pass beacon and aimed for the <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> would be aligned to land right of the runway.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 August 2010 a Douglas DC-8-63F YA-VIC of Kam Air {{suffered}} a tailstrike on take-off, destroying an <b>approach</b> <b>light.</b> The aircraft was operating an international cargo flight from Manston to Buenos Aires via the Cape Verde Islands. The incident {{was caused by}} excess fuel, and an underestimation {{of the mass of}} the cargo, making the aircraft [...] overweight. After being informed of the tailstrike, the crew continued the flight to the Cape Verde Islands. Inspection on arrival revealed that a tailstrike had indeed occurred, although the tailstrike indicator was within limits. The incident was investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, which made four safety recommendations. As a direct result, Kam Air was banned from operating within the European Union. The three crew were dismissed, and Kam Air announced that it would withdraw its two DC-8s from service.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the captain}} {{initiated}} the abort procedure at [...] below V1 speed, {{it became apparent}} the plane could not stop {{within the confines of}} the runway. That was the direct result of the partial loss of braking power following the failure of the three tires on the left main gear, and also because the runway was wet. The captain directed the plane to go off the end of the right half of the runway in an effort [...] "to go beside the stanchions holding the runway lights" [...] and thus avoid a collision with the <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> stanchions, which were positioned immediately beyond the end of the runway. About [...] beyond the end of the runway, the left main gear broke through the non-load bearing pavement, which caused it to fail rearward. [...] Portions of the failed gear punctured fuel tanks in the left wing, immediately starting a fuel-fire on the left side.|$|E
6000|$|Reinhart took Commander Carleton's place. [...] "I {{can report}} on the {{economic}} situation. Every factory on Terra is converted to arms production. With Armun {{out of the way}} {{we should be able to}} promote mass insurrection among the Centauran colonies. An inter-system Empire is hard to maintain, even with ships that <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> speed. Local war-lords should pop up all over the place. We want to have weapons available for them and ships starting now to reach them in time. Eventually we hope to provide a unifying principle around which the colonies can all collect. Our interest is more economic than political. They can have any kind of government they want, as long as they act as supply areas for us. As our eight system planets act now." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{required}} minimum visibility for instrument approaches {{is influenced}} by the presence and type of approach lighting system. In the U.S., a CAT I ILS approach without approach lights will have a minimum required visibility of 3/4 mile, or 4000 foot runway visual range. With a 1400-foot or longer <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> system, the minimum potential visibility might be reduced to 1/2 mile (2400 runway visual range), and the presence of touchdown zone and centerline lights with a suitable <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> system might further reduce the visibility to 3/8 mile (1800 feet runway visual range).|$|E
