500|$|The {{expression}} {{has also}} been used to characterize any process that happens with smoothness and precision, as a near-synonym to expressions such as [...] "like clockwork" [...] or [...] "a well-oiled machine." [...] For example, in Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye (1953), detective Philip Marlowe goes through his mail, opens it, <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> into the waste bin, remarking, [...] "Mail slot to desk to wastebasket, Tinker to Evers to Chance." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryan Ryan (Neil Patrick Harris), {{a former}} McKinley High glee club member, arrives as an auditor {{from the school}} board. He speaks to the glee club, asking {{everyone}} to write their biggest dream {{on a piece of}} paper. He then takes Artie's (Kevin McHale) paper <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> into the trash, making a point that their dreams will never come true. Having failed to realize his own dreams, he intends to cut the glee club. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) convinces him that it is not too late to pursue his dreams and sings [...] "Piano Man" [...] with him. They both audition for the role of Jean Valjean in the local production of Les Misérables, singing [...] "Dream On" [...] as a duet. Bryan decides not to cut the glee club, and even presents them with new costumes and sheet music, but changes his mind when cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) announces that Will landed the lead role. Will gives up his role in Les Misérables to Bryan in order to save the glee club.|$|E

500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E
2500|$|Cramer {{is usually}} {{standing}} {{up with the}} fisheye lens Steadicam close to his face, while providing stock picks and investing advice. His voice inflection often changes from calm to shouting then back to a calm tone. Cramer also throws various objects around the set. Whenever one of his books is mentioned by a caller, he grabs the book, flashes it, <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> to the floor as a plug gag. In addition, he has a panel of oversized red buttons, which activate various sound effects. [...] The online version of the show's sound board is available at madmoney.cnbc.com.|$|E

60|$|LADY. Yes; but {{you know}} you have THE letter in your pocket. (He smiles; takes a letter from his pocket; <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> {{on the top of the}} heap. She holds it up and looks at him, saying) About Caesar's wife.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "It quite reconciles one to Christmas. What? Oh, {{that was}} rather nasty. You know I didn't mean it. I {{was so excited}} I didn't know what I was saying. I'm sure nobody ever got on better with sisters-in-law, and that shows my tact; if I do make a slip, now and then, I can always get out of it. They will understand. Do {{you think it was}} very nice of them to flaunt their new motor in my face? But of course {{anything}} your family does is perfect, and always was, though I must say this necklace is sweet of them. I wonder they had the taste." [...] A tap on the door is heard. [...] "Come in, Maggie!" [...] Sotto voce. [...] "Take it off." [...] She snatches his bath-robe <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> behind the door.|$|E
60|$|I do not sneer at {{the purpose}} for which, at that chiming eight-o'clock bell, the {{household}} is called together. The urns are hissing, the plate is shining; {{the father of}} the house, standing up, reads from a gilt book for three or four minutes in a measured cadence. The members of the family are around the table in an attitude of decent reverence; the younger children whisper responses at their mother's knees; the governess worships a little apart; the maids and the large footmen are in a cluster before their chairs, the upper servants performing their devotion {{on the other side of}} the sideboard; the nurse whisks about the unconscious last-born, <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> up and down during the ceremony. I do not sneer at that--at the act at which all these people are assembled--it is at the rest of the day I marvel; at the rest of the day, and what it brings. At the very instant when the voice has ceased speaking and the gilded book is shut, the world begins again, and for the next twenty-three hours and fifty-seven minutes all that household is given up to it. The servile squad rises up and marches away to its basement, whence, should it happen to be a gala-day, those tall gentlemen at present attired in Oxford mixture will issue forth with flour plastered on their heads, yellow coats, pink breeches, sky-blue waistcoats, silver lace, buckles in their shoes, black silk bags on their backs, and I don't know what insane emblems of servility and absurd bedizenments of folly. Their very manner of speaking to what we call their masters and mistresses will be a like monstrous masquerade. You know no more of that race which inhabits the basement floor, than of the men and brethren of Timbuctoo, to whom some among us send missionaries. If you met some of your servants in the streets (I respectfully suppose for a moment that the reader is a person of high fashion and a great establishment), you would not know their faces. You might sleep under the same roof for half a century and know nothing about them. If they were ill, you would not visit them, though you would send them an apothecary and of course order that they lacked for nothing. You are not unkind, you are not worse than your neighbours. Nay, perhaps, if you did go into the kitchen, or to take the tea in the servants'-hall, you would do little good, and only bore the folks assembled there. But so it is. With those fellow-Christians who have been just saying Amen to your prayers, you have scarcely the community of Charity. They come, you don't know whence; they think and talk, you don't know what; they die, and you don't care, or vice versa. They answer the bell for prayers as they answer the bell for coals: for exactly three minutes in the day you all kneel together on one carpet--and, the desires and petitions of the servants and masters over, the rite called family worship is ended.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Saturday Night Shaun" [...] Shaun rips off {{his coat}} <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> away as he is dancing, only to have it tossed back.

50|$|Elaine shares what Jerry {{told her}} with an {{eccentric}} Russian author, Yuri Testikov (George Murdock), who is being courted by Pendant Publishing, her company. This causes a brief argument between Elaine, Mr. Lippman, & Testikov.
