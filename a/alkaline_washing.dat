Thus {{this is not a}} viable option for pulps that are sensitive to changes in viscosity. Enzyme treatment did not completely degrade the glycerides under the mill conditions used. Fibre fractionation studies showed that the fines fractions contained 8 to 13 times more residual lipophilic extractives than the whole pulps.

40|$|Stockpiled {{municipal}} waste incinerator bottom ash is frequently considered for utilization as a construction material. Two 360 kg lysimeter experiments were con-ducted to study percolation washing of contaminants from stockpiled MSW bottom ash. One lysimeter was leached with a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, as a possible pre-treatment for improvement of the bottom ash characteristics prior to utilization, while the other was leached using distilled water. The lysimeter leachate was analysed, {{and at the end}} of the 2 -year leaching period, the bottom ash from each lysimeter was subjected to several laboratory tests to assess the effect of the treatments. The laboratory tests showed that distilled water leachability of both treated ashes was an order of magnitude lower than that of fresh ash, but long-term contaminant leachability under acidic conditions had not changed. Although <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> clearly resulted in greater contaminant removal than did distilled water washing, the chemical properties of the alkaline-leached bottom ash were not significantly different from those of the water-leached ash.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the distribution of various arsenic species in tailings and soils. Other specific goal of the tests were to evaluate the extraction efficiency of arsenic using alkaline or acid washing, to determine optimum operational parameters of <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing,</b> and to evaluate the arsenic precipitation of washing effluents by pH adjustment or ferric chloride addition. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> using sodium hydroxide {{was found to be}} favorable in removing arsenic from tailings or soils having a higher portion of arsenic in the operationally defined crystalline mineral fraction of crystalline oxide and amorphous aluminosilicates. This is due to the ligand displacement reaction of hydroxyl ions with arsenic species and high pH conditions that can prevent readsorption of arsenic because predominant negatively charged crystalline oxides do not attract the negatively charged oxyanions. For tailings, sodium hydroxide had 10 - 20 times higher extraction efficiencies than hydrochloric- or citric acid. The optimum concentration of sodium hydroxide for soil washing was determined to be 200 mM for all samples, while the optimum ratios were 10 : 1 and 5 : 1 for tailings and field/river sedimentary soils, respectively. The washing effluent of river soil was effectively treated by adjusting pH to 5 - 6 with hydrochloric acid, resulting in arsenic concentrations of < 50 Î¼g l- 1. In the case of field soil effluent, an addition of ferric chloride with a minimum mass ratio of 11 (Fe/As) was needed to reduce the arsenic below 50 Î¼g l- 1. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of cellulases from lignin, lignocellulosic hydrolysates and cellulose by <b>alkaline</b> <b>washes</b> at pH 9 and 10 was examined. The {{effect of the}} pH on the structural stability of purified Cel 7 A was analyzed by circular dichroism. Purified Cel 7 A showed conformational changes at pH 9 and 10 that were reversible at pH 4. 8. Temperature influenced the enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw and may be critical for the efficiency of cellulase recycling from wheat straw hydrolysates. Operation at moderate temperatures (37 °C) resulted in a rate of saccharification 19 % higher than that obtained at 50 ° C, improving cellulase recycling by 49 %.

Microsomes depleted of lumenal content were able to translocate and process preprominiPLAP to give protease-protected prominiPLAP, but were unable to convert prominiPLAP to miniPLAP.

Considering the current scenario, the understanding of biopulping mechanisms has gained renewed attention because more resistant and competitive fungal species could be selected with basis on a function-directed screening project. A series of studies aimed to elucidate structural changes in lignin during wood biodegradation by C. subvermispora had indicated that lignin depolymerization occurs during initial stages of wood biotreatment. Aromatic hydroxyls did not increase with the split of aryl-ether linkages, suggesting that the ether-cleavage-products remain as quitione-type structures. On the other hand, cellulose is more resistant to the attack by C subvermispora. MnP-initiated lipid peroxidation reactions have been proposed to explain degradation of non-phenolic lignin substructures by C subvermispora, while the lack of cellobiohydrolases and the occurrence of systems able to suppress Fenton`s reaction in the cultures have explained non-efficient cellulose degradation by this biopulping fungus.

Chick embryo brain microsomes have kinesin bound to their surface, and after detergent solubilization, a matrix with an antibody to the kinesin head domain (SUK- 4) (Ingold et al., 1988) bound the solubilized kinesin and retained an equal amount of a microsome protein of 160 -kD. Similarly, velocity sedimentation of solubilized membranes showed that kinesin and the 160 -kD polypeptide cosedimented at 13 S. After alkaline treatment to remove kinesin from the microsomes, the same 160 -kD polypeptide doublet bound to a kinesin affinity resin and not to other proteins tested. Biochemical characterization localized this protein to the cytoplasmic face of brain microsomes and indicated that it was an integral membrane protein since it was resistant to <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing.</b> mAbs raised to chick 160 -kD protein demonstrated that it was absent in the supernatant and concentrated in the dense microsome fraction.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} work {{describes the}} development, validation {{and application of}} highly sensitive UFLC-MS/MS methods for the bio-analysis of narcotic analgesics. In chapter I, the narcotic analgesics and the LC-MS technique were introduced. The narcotic analgesics are widely used {{for the treatment of}} pain, making them important in the clinical world. Due to their morphine-like effects, these substances are commonly abused which illustrates the forensic context. Analysis of narcotic analgesics and metabolites allowing accurate quantification is thus clearly required for both clinical and forensic investigations. LC-MS is an excellent technique for the analysis of target analytes in complex mixtures such as biological matrices. Recent developments (such as the use of columns with small particles or UPLC or UFLC technology) increase the sensitivity and selectivity of LC-MS even more. The greatest disadvantage of LC-MS, the disturbing effect of co-eluting molecules on ionization of the target analyte was discussed, toghether with strategies to evaluate and overcome these so called matrix effects. In chapter II, several factors (sample preparation, ionization interface, mobile phase and LC column) were optimized in order to obtain highest sensitivity for the detection of fentanyl and its major metabolite norfentanyl. As such, disturbing matrix effects can be minimized while recovery and sensitivity can be maximized. After optimization, the method was fully validated for both urine and whole blood. To the best of our knowledge, the UFLC-MS/MS method presented here is the most sensitive method available for analysis of fentanyl and norfentanyl in urine and blood. Several factors contributed to high sensitivity: (1) appropriate sample preparation: the use of mixed-mode SPE and an extra <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> step in the SPE protocol removed interferences and concentrated the analytes; (2) optimal ionization interface: the use of ESI instead of APCI proved to be more effective for both fentanyl and norfentanyl; (3) optimized chromatography including (a) the use of a mobile phase at high pH instead of the conventional low pH which resulted in a higher signal and (b) the use of columns with small particle size (1. 7 µm versus 2. 5 µm) and small internal diameter (2. 1 mm versus 3. 0 mm) which resulted in smaller and sharper peaks and thus enhanced sensitivity. In chapter III, we extended the method development strategy used in chapter II to other relevant narcotic analgesics. As a result a highly sensitive UFLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the analysis of nine narcotic analgesics and metabolites (buprenorphine, O-desmethyltramadol, fentanyl, norbuprenorphine, norfentanyl, pethidine, piritramide, tilidine and tramadol) in urine and blood. As in chapter II, the <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> step in the SPE protocol, ESI as ionization interface, the mobile phase at high pH and the column with smaller internal diameter and particle size were found to be crucial parameters warranting the high sensitivity of the method. It can be surmised that the optimized parameters (sample preparation, mobile phase, ionization interface and column) should be considered to increase sensitivity of LC-MS methods for other compounds than the opioids studied here. In chapter IV, the applicability of the developed and validated UFLC-MS/MS methods was demonstrated by analysis of thirteen post-mortem forensic cases involving the use of narcotic analgesics. Urine, blood, liver, bile and/or hair were succesfully analyzed and the found results were carefully interpreted. In nine cases, we could conclude that the death of the victim was (partly) caused by the use of narcotic analgesics. It is clear that the presented UFLC-MS/MS methods are useful in forensic research. Moreover, their use can be extended to clinical investigations. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|The {{recording}} of periodic structures on photoresist films {{was carried out}} using the interference pattern formed with a helium-cadmium laser (wavelength λ[*]=[*] 441.6  nm) using the holographic setup assembled by the wave-amplitude division method.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of cellulase recycling in {{the scope of}} bioethanol production from recycled paper sludge (RPS), an inexpensive byproduct with around 39 % of carbohydrates, is analyzed. RPS was easily converted and fermented by enzymes and cells, respectively. Final enzyme partition between solid and liquid phases was investigated, the solid-bound enzymes being efficiently recovered by <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing.</b> RPS hydrolysis and fermentation was conducted over four rounds, recycling the cellulases present in both fractions. A great overall enzyme stability was observed: 71, 64 and 100 % of the initial Cel 7 A, Cel 7 B and -glucosidase activities, respectively, were recovered. Even with only 30 % of fresh enzymes added on the subsequent rounds, solid conversions of 92, 83 and 71 % were achieved for the round 2, 3 and 4, respectively. This strategy enabled an enzyme saving around 53 - 60 %, while can equally contribute to a 40 % reduction in RPS disposal costs.

40|$|Summary Archaeological {{wrought iron}} {{artefacts}} {{are subject to}} damaging corrosion while in the burial environment and when subjected to environmental changes after excavation. The role of water, oxygen, and chloride corrosion accelerators are central to iron corrosion processes. Intrinsic {{factors such as the}} amount and distribution of slag in wrought iron may also play a role in corrosion processes. This study examined a range of factors that impact on understanding conservation desalination treatments to mitigate corrosion by removing chlorides. While examining the effect of slag on corrosion rate and chloride content formed the core of this project, cracking morphologies within corrosion product layers and their influence on corrosion rates measured by oxygen consumption produced outcomes of interest for designing the practicalities of treatment procedures. The slag content of the wrought iron objects examined in this study did not correlate with either their corrosion rate or their chloride content. In line with other authors, clustering of chloride around slag inclusions was identified. This confirmed slag does act as a focus for developing corrosion centres, which will offer challenges for chloride removal and hence provide opportunity for post-treatment corrosion. The alkaline sulphite washing applied to the iron nails produced results that aligned with those reported in other studies and confirmed its relative efficiency for removing chloride. Of major relevance to conservators designing <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> techniques is assigning treatment time and specifying treatment environment. These decisions are aided by evidence provided in this study, which showed that immersing the chloride ii containing corrosion product β-FeOOH in alkaline sulphite entirely transformed it to other iron oxides in only 30 days. During this process it will release its chloride, which will be available for diffusion into the wash solution making a more complete desalination process possible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Previous {{studies have}} shown that microtubule-based {{organelle}} transport requires a membrane receptor but no kinesin-binding membrane proteins have been isolated. Chick embryo brain microsomes have kinesin bound to their surface, and after detergent solubilization, a matrix with an antibody to the kinesin head domain (SUK- 4) (Ingold et al., 1988) bound the solubilized kinesin and retained an equal amount of a microsome protein of 160 -kD. Similarly, velocity sedimentation of solubilized membranes showed that kinesin and the 160 -kD polypeptide cosedimented at 13 S. After alkaline treatment to remove kinesin from the microsomes, the same 160 -kD polypeptide doublet bound to a kinesin affinity resin and not to other proteins tested. Biochemical characterization localized this protein to the cytoplasmic face of brain microsomes and indicated that it was an inte-gral membrane protein since it was resistant to <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing,</b> mAbs raised to chick 160 -kD protein demonstrated that it was absent in the supernatant and concentrated in the dense microsome fraction. The dense microsome fraction also had the greatest amount of microtubule-dependent motility. With immunofluorescence, the antibodies labeled the ER in chick embryo fibroblasts (similar to the pattern of bound kinesin staining in the same cells) (Hollenbeck, P. J. 1989. J. Cell Biol. 108 : 2335 - 2342), astroglia, Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion cells but staining was much less in the Golgi regions of these cells. Because this protein is a major kinesin-binding protein of motile vesicles and would be expected to bind kinesin to the organelle membrane, we have chosen the name, kinectin, for this protein. M ICROTUBULE-dependent organelle transport is involved in a variety of membrane trafficking events (for review see Schroer and Sheetz, 1991 a). At the molecular level both kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein have been implicated as the motors involved in powering organelle transport. In the case of kinesin, a role has been demonstrated in the movement of lysosomes (Hollenbeck...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{diffusion}} of serine proteases into wool fabrics and yarns was studied. The proteases used were free subtilisin and subtilisin-PEG (the same enzyme that was covalently cross linked to polyethylene glycol). It is shown that the adsorption and diffusion is facilitated by the pre-treatment performed, being the <b>alkaline</b> surfactant <b>washing</b> and bleaching the most effective in what concerns enzyme adsorption. Furthermore, {{this study suggests that}} {{the diffusion of}} proteases into wool is dependent {{on the size of the}} protease. The free enzyme penetrates into wool fibre cortex while the modified bigger enzyme is retained only at the surface, in the cuticle layer. Also, proteins without proteolytic activity do not adsorb considerably on wool due to its hydrophobic nature, therefore the diffusion is facilitated by hydrolytic action. These results have important practical implications for the establishment of enzymatic wool finishing processes, since they allow for control of the enzyme hydrolysis, which was the major drawback of this environmental friendly option to the conventional chlorine treatments...|$|R
