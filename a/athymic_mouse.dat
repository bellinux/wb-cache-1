40|$|The {{development}} of radiolabeled folate-chelate conjugates {{could result in}} clinically useful diagnostic imaging agents for several types of cancers that over-express folate receptors. In particular, 111 In-DTPA-folate has shown considerable utility as a diagnostic indicator of folate-receptor-positive, KB cell tumor xenografts in <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> models. After i. v. administration to this mouse model, most of the radiotracer is excreted into the urine. The radiolabel retained by the mouse model is present almost exclusively in the KB cell tumor xenografts and proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys, which are sites of increased folate receptor density. The present research was undertaken to: (1) examine the chemical form of the radiolabel retained in <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> KB cell tumor xenografts and kidney after i. v. administration of 111 In-DTPAfolate; (2) synthesize a Tc- 99 m-based DTPA-folate radiotracer using low doses of the DTPA-folate conjugate; (3) explore {{the possibility of using}} neutral endopeptidase- 24. 11 to cleave a peptide linker connecting the “ 111 In-DTPA” and “folate-receptor-targeting” moieties of the 111 In-DTPA-folate molecule to modify the chemical form of the radiolabel for increased renal clearance. ^ The results of this research indicate: (1) the 111 In-DTPA-folate radiotracer is largely present as the intact radiotracer in KB cell tumor and kidney for up to four hours after i. v administration to <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> models; (2) low levels of the DTPA-folate conjugate can be labeled with the “Tc(CO) 3 +” moiety via the [99 mTc(CO) 3 (H 2 O) 3]+ intermediate to produce the [99 mTc]Tc(CO) 3 DTPA-folate radiotracer, which selectively accumulates in folate receptor positive tumor and kidney tissues; (3) neutral endopeptidase- 24. 11 degrades 111 In-DTPA-Gin-Gin-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-Lys(N- 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;-pteroyl) -OH into two radioactive products in vitro, one of which appears to be 111 InDTPA. ...|$|E

The present study inves-tigated the role of tas 1611, which is a derivative of taspine that has increased activity and solubility, in the regulation of the invasive properties of the SMMC- 7721 liver cell line in vitro and in tumor inhibition in vivo. The proliferation of the SMMC- 7721 cells was examined using the tetrazole blue colorimetric method. Matrigel ® invasion chamber assays and zymogram analyses were performed to assess the inhibi-tory effect of tas 1611 on cell invasion. Finally, a solid tumor <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> model was employed to further investigate the anti-tumor effect of this compound. The results revealed that tas 1611 had a marked inhibitory effect on {{the invasion of the}} SMMC- 7721 cells and that this effect was associated with the activity and expression levels of matrix metal-loproteinase (MMP) - 2 and MMP- 9. Furthermore, tas 1611 was able to inhibit tumor growth effectively in a solid tumor SMMC- 7721 <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> model.

Rabbit polyclonal antisera were also generated against intact virions of both BPV- 1 and CRPV, and neutralizing activity was tested in the xenograft system with BPV- 1 and fetal bovine skin and with CRPV and rabbit ear skin. The three polyclonal antisera contained virus-specific neutralizing antibodies, demonstrating that neutralizing epitopes existed on all three papillomaviruses and that these epitopes were antigenically non-cross-reactive.

40|$|Appropriately stimulated {{lymphocytes}} and macrophages produce {{factors in}} vitro that increase serum corticosterone levels when injected in vivo. In this study, we used euthymic and congenitally <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> on a BALB/c background {{to explore the}} role of T cells in controlling corticosterone levels and the leukocyte response to inflammation. Adult <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> had more intense inflammatory reactions than euthymic mice despite higher basal corticosterone levels. This latter condition {{may be due to}} interleukin- 1 (IL-i) since macrophages from <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> when stimulated in vitro by Iipopolysaccharide produced more IL-i than macrophages from euthymic mice. In response to mitogen stimulation, however, splenocytes from <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> produced a factor (not IL-i), which, upon injection, increased corticosterone levels and suppressed inflammation. Produc-tion of this factor was enhanced by T cells since splenocyte supernatants from euthymic mice were more potent in eliciting both effects. Evidence for in vivo participation of T cells in regulating corticosterone levels was obtained by tumor transplantation. Injection of syngeneic tumor cells or cell-free tumorous ascites rapidly increased corticosterone levels in euthymic but not <b>athymic</b> <b>mice.</b> Anti-inflammation correlated with increased corticosterone levels but was observed also in <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> receiving syngeneic tumor transplants. These studies demonstrate that T cells enhance production of a Iymphokine that increases corticosterone levels and are required for the corticosterone response to tumor transplantation. In addition, the data suggest two pathways of anti-inflammation in tumor-bearing hosts: a corticosterone-lndependent, T cell-independent mechanism and a T cell-dependent mechanism that involves a lymphokine-mediated increase in corticoste-rone blood levels...|$|R

Southern blots were consistent with an episomal state of HPV 59 DNA at approximately 50 copies per cell. Analysis of the cells using a PCR/reverse blot strip assay, which amplifies {{a portion of the}} L 1 open reading frame, was strongly positive. Differentiation of cells in monolayers was induced by growth in F medium containing 2 mM calcium chloride for 10 days.

Transcripts encoding involucrin, a cornified envelope protein, and the E 1 ^E 4 and E 1 ^E 4 ^L 1 viral transcripts were detected after several days of growth in F medium containing 2 mM calcium chloride. The E 1 ^E 4 and L 1 proteins were detected by immunohistochemical analysis, and virus particles were seen in electron micrographs in a subset of differentiated cells. An extract of differentiated cells was prepared by vigorous sonication and was used to infect foreskin fragments. These fragments were implanted into athymic mice. HPV 59 was detected in the foreskin xenografts removed 4 months later by DNA in situ hybridization and PCR/reverse blot assay.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Silica-induced {{pulmonary}} {{inflammation and}} fibrosis in animals {{provides a good}} model for chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Although lymphocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, experimental models using silica-treated <b>athymic</b> nude <b>mice</b> have not been successful in showing the fibrogenic mechanism regulated by T cells. The {{aim of this study}} was to re-evaluate the role of T lymphocytes in the development of silicosis by comparing the response to silica administration of nude athymic mutants with that of euthymic animals. METHODS: Suspensions of silica particles were transnasally administered to nude <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> (Balb/c nu/nu) as well as to their euthymic littermates (Balb/c nu/+). The degree of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis was assessed on days 14, 28, and 56 based upon histological observation, analysis of collagen deposition in the lungs, and analysis of the cellular constituent, protein, and phospholipid content in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. RESULTS: Histologically, <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> developed less severe interstitial pneumonitis than euthymic mice. In euthymic mice the lung hydroxyproline content increased with time after silica administration from 6. 48 (0. 38) micrograms hydroxyproline/mg dry lung weight on day 0 to 8. 87 (0. 41) micrograms/mg on day 56. A gradual increase in lung hydroxyproline content was also observed in <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> but the increase was significantly smaller than in euthymic mice (6. 63 (0. 43) micrograms/mg on day 0, 7. 90 (0. 19) micrograms/mg on day 56). Administration of silica resulted in an increase in the number of macrophages and neutrophils and in the total protein and phospholipid content of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in both mouse strains. No significant difference was detected between <b>athymic</b> and euthymic <b>mice</b> in the numbers of macrophages, but the increase in neutrophils in the BAL fluid of <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> was significantly smaller than in euthymic mice on days 14 and 56. The total protein and phospholipid content of the BAL fluid from <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> was lower than that from euthymic mice. CONCLUSIONS: T lymphocytes appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of silica-induced pneumonitis.

Methods KPL- 1 cell growth was assessed by colorimetric 3 - (4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay; cell cycle progression and mode of cell death were examined by flow cytometry; and levels of expression of p 53, p 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1, cyclin D 1, Bax, and Bcl- 2 proteins were examined by Western blotting analysis. In vivo tumor growth was examined by injecting KPL- 1 cells subcutaneously into the area of the right thoracic mammary fat pad of female athymic mice fed a CDHA diet. Results CDHA inhibited KPL- 1 cells more effectively than did DHA (50 % inhibitory concentration for 72 hours: 97 μmol/l and 270 μmol/l, respectively). With both CDHA and DHA growth inhibition was due to apoptosis, as indicated by the appearance of a sub-G 1 fraction. The apoptosis cascade involved downregulation of Bcl- 2 protein; Bax expression was unchanged. Cell cycle progression was due to G 0 /G 1 arrest, which involved increased expression of p 53 and p 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1, and decreased expression of cyclin D 1. CDHA modulated cell cycle regulatory proteins and apoptosis-related proteins {{in a manner similar to}} that of parent DHA. In the <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> system 1. 0 % dietary CDHA, but not 0. 2 %, significantly suppressed growth of KPL- 1 tumor cells; CDHA tended to decrease regional lymph node metastasis in a dose dependent manner. Conclusion CDHA inhibited growth of KPL- 1 human breast cancer cells in vitro more effectively than did DHA. The mechanisms of action involved modulation of apoptosis cascade and cell cycle progression. Dietary CDHA at 1. 0 % suppressed KPL- 1 cell growth in the <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> system. </p...|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that the isoflavone, genistein, stimulates growth of estrogen-dependent human breast cancer (MCF- 7) cells in vivo (C. Y. Hsieh et al., Cancer Res., 58 : 3833 – 3838, 1998). The isoflavones are a group of phytoestrogens that are present in high concentrations in soy. Whether consumption of genistein from soy protein will have similar effects on estrogen-dependent tumor growth as pure genistein has not been investigated in the <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> tumor implant model. Depending on processing, soy protein isolates vary widely in concentrations of genistein. We hypothesize that soy isolates containing different concentrations of genistein will stimulate the growth of estrogen-dependent cells in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis we conducted experiments in which these soy protein isolates were fed to athymic mice implanted s. c. with estrogen-dependent tumors. Genistein content (aglycone equivalent) of the soy isolate diets were 15, 150, or 300 ppm. Positiv...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} the human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) life cycle was hampered for more than 50 years {{by the lack of}} a conventional cell culture system for propagating HPV. Considerable {{progress has been made in}} the production of several HPV types using either organotypic rafts or human epithelial xenografts in immunocompromised mice. In this study, we demonstrated episomal maintenance of HPV- 11 DNA in N-Tert cells. HPV- 11 episomal DNA containing cell populations grown in raft culture showed induction of the productive viral life cycle. HPV- 11 DNA amplification and viral capsid antigen synthesis were detected in differentiated layers of epithelia. The viruses generated were able to infect keratinocytes in vitro, which indicate that viruses generated were infectious. The demonstration of the productive HPV- 11 life cycle in raft culture from cloned HPV- 11 DNA will facilitate genetic analyses of viral gene functions that was not possible using the human xenograft <b>athymic</b> <b>mouse</b> model...|$|E
40|$|Normal rat oral keratinocytes {{have been}} {{transformed}} with the carcinogen 4 -nitroquinoline iV-oxide (4 NQO) in vitro. The morphology, growth characteristics, ability to grow without anchorage and tumorigenicity in <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> was examin-ed in 12 selected cell lines. Each of the lines could be assign-ed {{to one of two}} general groups. The first group of cell lines although showing some morphological signs of transformation and the ability to be subcultured beyond passage 15 were not anchorage independent or able to form tumours hi <b>athymic</b> <b>mice.</b> The second group of cell lines showed distinct signs of morphological transformation, could be serially subcultured without 3 T 3 feeder cells, were anchorage independent and tumorigenic in <b>athymic</b> <b>mice.</b> Anchorage independence was more common at higher passages and with increased 4 NQO treatment and correlated well with a decreased reliance on 3 T 3 feeder cell support. The anchorage-independent phenotype was closely associated with the ability to form tumours in <b>athymic</b> <b>mice.</b> This same sequence of phenotypic changes has been demonstrated hi rat oral keratinocytes after 4 NQO treatment in vivo indicating that during carcinogenesis, cell populations progress through the same stages whether proliferation occurs in vitro or in vivo. There is some evidence to suggest, however, that the time interval between stages may be altered when carcinogenesis takes place in vitro...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine whether the}} histological pattern of tumour growth of hormone-responsive MCF- 7 human mammary adenocarcinoma varied in different tissues of <b>athymic</b> <b>mice.</b> Tumours in the uterus following intrauterine injection were rapidly proliferating and highly invasive. Tumours injected intracerebrally were also highly invasive. In contrast, s. c. tumours and those which arose in the lung following intrapleural injection, grew as small localized nodules without evidence of aggressive invasion of surrounding tissues. These findings indicate that selective implantation of human tumours in <b>athymic</b> <b>mice</b> can be used to develop different models of tumour growth and aggressiveness...|$|R
