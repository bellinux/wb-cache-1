40|$|An <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>segment,</b> ARS, {{is located}} 293 base pairs {{downstream}} from the histone H 4 gene at the copy-I H 3 -H 4 locus. The sequences needed for autonomous replication were defined by deletion analysis {{to include an}} ARS consensus sequence and an additional 3 '-flanking region. External deletions into the 3 '-flanking yeast sequences resulted {{in a loss of}} replication function. However, disruptions of the required 3 '-flanking domain by either 10 -base-pair linker-scanning substitutions or larger internal deletions did not impair autonomous replication. Thus, replication is dependent upon a flanking chromosome domain, but not an exact DNA sequence. The extent of the yeast sequences required in the 3 '-flanking domain is variable depending on the nature of neighboring plasmid vector sequences. That is, there are certain vector sequences that prohibit replication when they are placed too close to the ARS consensus. These results suggest that the functional 3 '-flanking domain of the H 4 ARS is a specific DNA or chromatin structure or both...|$|E
40|$|Oxytricha nova is a hypotrichous ciliate with {{micronuclei}} and macronuclei. Micronuclei, {{which contain}} large, chromosomal-sized DNA, are genetically inert but undergo meiosis and exchange during cell mating. Macronuclei, which contain only small, gene-sized DNA molecules, provide {{all of the}} nuclear RNA needed to run the cell. After cell mating the macronucleus is derived from a micronucleus, a derivation that includes excision of the genes from chromosomes and elimination of the remaining DNA. The eliminated DNA includes all of the repetitious sequences and approximately 95 % of the unique sequences. We cloned large restriction fragments from the micronucleus that confer replication ability on a replication-deficient plasmid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequences that confer replication ability are called <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> sequences. The frequency and effectiveness of <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> sequences in micronuclear DNA {{are similar to those}} reported for DNAs of other organisms introduced into yeast cells. Of the 12 micronuclear fragments with <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> sequence activity, 9 also showed homology to macronuclear DNA, indicating that they contain a macronuclear gene sequence.

Therefore, in vitro experiments were done to determine if Aleutian disease virus and mink enteritis virus, two <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> mink parvoviruses, induced interferon, were sensitive to the effects of interferon, or inhibited the production of interferon. The results indicated that these parvoviruses neither induced nor were sensitive to the effects of interferon.

In this report, {{we show that}} replication of pARS 65 in HL- 60 cells can be inhibited by co-transfection with anti-c-myc antibody. In an in-vitro replication system using HL- 60 nuclear extract, pARS 65 functioned as a template. This in-vitro replication was also blocked by addition of anti-c-myc antibody. Specific binding activity of the c-myc product to pARS 65 was detected by an immunobinding assay, suggesting that the c-myc protein promotes DNA replication through binding to the initiation site of replication.

We also determined the time within the S phase of the cell cycle that three of the plasmids replicate. Centromeric alpha sequences, which normally replicate late in S phase when in their chromosomal context, were found to replicate earlier when they mediate replication on an extrachromosomal vector.

We added transcriptional elements from the human cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer and the human beta-actin promoter to <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> plasmids based on human sequences {{and found that the}} transcriptional elements inhibited plasmid replication. Furthermore, conditional inhibition of plasmid replication was demonstrated by using a tetracycline-responsive promoter. We found that replication activity of plasmids carrying this promoter was inversely correlated with promoter activity. Replication activity was partially restored on plasmids when a transcriptional termination sequence was placed directly downstream of the promoter element. Transcriptional activity of the promoters and the efficacy of the terminator sequence were confirmed by using steady-state RNA analysis. These experiments suggest that transcription inhibits DNA replication on these plasmids and that the degree of inhibition is dependent on transcription strength.

However, the lack of <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> plasmids has hindered genetic manipulation of myxobacteria for decades. To determine whether indigenous plasmids are present, we screened about 150 myxobacterial strains, and a circular plasmid designated pMF 1 was isolated from Myxococcus fulvus 124 B 02. Sequence analysis showed that this plasmid was 18, 634 bp long and had a G+C content of 68. 7 %. Twenty-three open reading frames were found in the plasmid, and 14 of them were not homologous to any known sequence.

40|$|Epidermal {{keratinocyte}} {{growth and}} differentiation are regulated by specific families of growth factors and receptors. Peptide growth factors of the {{epidermal growth factor}} family stimulate proliferation of clonal density human keratinocytes and suppress markers of terminal differentiation in confluent cultures of human keratinocytes. We present evidence that selected inhibitors of activation of the type I human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or HER- 1), namely, neutralizing monoclonal antibody to HER- 1 /EGFR and the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD 153035, potently inhibit proliferation of human keratinocytes in <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> subconfluent cultures. Coupled to growth arrest is the suppression of HER- 1 tyrosine autophosphorylation in inhibitor-treated human keratinocytes. Proliferation and tyrosine autophosphorylation are initially reversible following removal of the inhibitor and restimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor. Sustained inactivation of HER- 1 in <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> cultures of human keratinocytes induces expression of keratin 1 and keratin 10 genes, early markers of terminal differentiation. Reversal of growth inhibition by epidermal growth factor suppresses keratin 1 and keratin 10 expression.

Plasmid pMGD 20 neo contains the polyoma {{origin of replication}} harboring a mutated enhancer (PyF 101), a modified polyoma early region that encodes the large tumor (T) antigen only, and a gene that confers resistance to G 418 (neo). After transfection, the plasmid replicates in ES cells and is maintained as an extrachromosomal element in 15 % of G 418 -resistant clones.

The subcellular localization of the CDC 46 protein changes with the cell cycle; it is nuclear {{between the end of}} M phase and the G 1 /S transition but is cytoplasmic in other phases of the cell cycle. Here we show that CDC 46 is identical to MCM 5, based on complementation analysis of the mcm 5 - 1 and cdc 46 - 1 alleles, complementation of the minichromosome maintenance defect of mcm 5 - 1 by CDC 46, and the genetic linkage of these two genes. Like mcm 5 - 1, cdc 46 - 1 and cdc 46 - 5 also show a minichromosome maintenance defect thought to be associated with DNA replication initiation at <b>autonomously</b> <b>replicating</b> sequences.
