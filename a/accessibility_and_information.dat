It was still very up to date with assistive services, <b>accessibility,</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> technologies. However, The {{building}} was now over 50 years old and was beginning to show its age. As is common with many of Edmonton's Brutalist buildings of the era, the exposed concrete and other materials in the library were beginning to fail from years of weathering. Aging mechanical system designs have also led to ventilation concerns and wasted energy costs. In addition, there have been safety concerns regarding the front entrance of the library facing Churchill Square. The narrow sidewalk and busy bus stop just outside the entrance on 102 Avenue, has led to many congestion and safety problems.|$|E

The provision of the <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> facility in public transport is not fully meet difable need and therefore difable persons have difficulties in <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> while using public transports. This research will investigate the difable perceptions about accessibility and traveler information for the public transport in Jakarta. Questionnaire method {{will be used for}} this purpose and then analyzed by Importance Performance Analysis. The improvement for the transport infrastructure and information system will be elaborated. The findings of the research could be used as input for the local authority while planning or re-construction public transport infrastructure and information system so that difable persons become more accessible and convenience. The study results show that the average value of the perceived performance for the accessibility is 2. 78 from 5 scales. This means the performance of the accessibility in overall is fairly. For the information facility, the average performance is 3. 11 that meaning the performance in overall is good. The respondents required the provision of waiting room for difable persons as a priority. The information about the departure of the vehicle should been improved as priority to be increased. Furthermore, it is obtained that the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) value for accessibility is 56 %. This indicates the entire respondents satisfied sufficiently with the accessibility facility.

30|$|Among {{these types}} of samples blood is, arguably, under {{the highest level of}} {{scrutiny}} due to the easy <b>accessibility,</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> density and variety. Accurate analysis of information residing in the blood requires efficient and accurate separation of blood cells. If cells have clearly distinguishable physical properties, such as size or density, they are filtered easily by centrifugation or sedimentation, which also allows batch processing. Microfluidics-based sorting and isolation techniques are employed for the cases, where cells are similar in physical properties and batch processing becomes unreliable. Precise and continuous sorting of cells in a microfluidic system requires accurate identification of cells. Generally, this is achieved by tagging cells using special labelling particles or molecules that either fluoresce or change affinity of cells towards electromagnetic fields.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} constructing an evaluation instrument for a Web based learning environment and furthermore to validate its causal structure. The evaluation instrument assumes that there are five principal factors in evaluating a WBLE: the Usability, Pedagogy, Accessibility, Information quality, and Added value. A questionnaire with five point Likert-scale has been developed for such a purpose. A priori model was developed to depict the possible causal effect of Usability, Pedagogy, <b>Accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>Information</b> quality on Added value. The quantitative research method was used to collect data from 650 students at the Syrian virtual University (SVU). The process of data collection was conducted through two stages. The first data set (300) was subjected to an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and the second data set (350) was subjected to a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and correlative analyses between factor score estimates. The descriptive statistics estimated the item means and deviations. The EFA was conducted to determine the items for each specific factor as well as factorial structure of the instrument. Factors were then assessed for their levels of internal reliability. Conducting EFA on the first data set resulted in seven factors for Usability; thirteen factors for Pedagogy; four factors for Accessibility; four factors for Information quality; and four factors for Added value. Confirmatory factor analysis using a structural equation modeling approach and the AMOS software was employed to measure the goodness-of-fit indices and to construct reliability of the instrument. The priori model was confirmed. The findings indicated that the priori model fits with data. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the constructs Usability, Pedagogy, <b>Accessibility,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Information</b> quality affect the Added value. Finally, correlations among factor scores were measured and reported...|$|E

While existing methods rely on different kinds of visual features and model structures, they do not fully exploit relevant semantic information. We present an extensible approach to jointly leverage several sorts of visual features and semantic attributes. Our novel architecture builds on LSTMs for sentence generation, with several attention layers and two multimodal layers. The attention mechanism learns to automatically select the most salient visual features or semantic attributes, and the multimodal layer yields overall representations for the input and outputs of the sentence generation component. Experimental results on the challenging MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, while ground truth based semantic attributes are able to further elevate the output quality to a near-human level...|$|E

40|$|The Internet {{revolution}} {{raises the}} necessity of changing the mode of communication between government and citizens. Government is an information provider to citizens and business. Many governments started an e-Government initiative {{with the aim of}} presenting new opportunities that improve government information availability by using Information Communication Technology (ICT). The intension was to enhance information delivery to citizens and business as access to government information may enable them to make better informed decisions. The United Nations (2003) identify three factors that provide the foundation for e-Government. These factors are human capital, ICT infrastructure and web presence. Web presence is changing the way of distributing government information to citizens. Web presence allows the users to either seek for specific information or conduct an online transaction. Recent studies have explored the purpose of visiting eGovernment websites in developed countries. Result show the majority of visitors to eGovernment websites are seeking information. Access to government information is essential for civilized societies. It is important for the growth and thriving of any culture. Most governments have issued policies (e. g. Information freedom acts) to protect the citizens' right to access government information. However, with the rapid increase the usage of technologies, the availability of government information and services becomes both simpler and faster. In developing countries, many e-Government action plans emphasise developing channels (e. g. e-Government website) that allow users access to necessary government information and services. Yet in practice, there has been no fundamental change in the progress of e-Government websites in Saudi Arabia and Oman as developing countries in relation to information availability, accessibility and usability (Abanumy et al., 2003). This appear to be global problem, as the Audit offices of New South Wales (2001) found that government agencies were struggling and need more guidance and support to translate the strategy aspirations into action. This paper contributes to the issue of eGovernment websites by developing a conceptual eGovernment website framework to enhance information availability, usability, <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> quality. The framework consists of two components. The first component is a content component and the second is a design components. The content component addresses the issued what should be included in eGovernment websites and the design component addresses the usability, <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> quality of eGovernment website. It concludes by presenting recommendations for improving eGovernment websites...|$|E
