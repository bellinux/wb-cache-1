40|$|People {{with disabilities}} often confront {{barriers}} in exercising {{their right to}} work.   Social model scholarship has recognised that attitude is {{a key factor in}} the disablement of people with impairments.   This study reports on 28 semi-structured interviews with professionals with disabilities.   Drawing from their lived experiences and roles in the disability rights movement, the professionals with disabilities interviewed in this study provide unique perspectives on the instances of <b>attitudinal</b> <b>discrimination.</b>   The interviewees discuss the tactics they employ to reduce the negative impact of erroneous stereotypes and the successes of such tactics.   Many of the tactics employed by interviewees reflect strategies discussed in contact theory scholarship.   This study focuses upon contact theory and considers the similarities between this theory and the interventions of interviewees.   Through positing interviewees' tactics in the literature this study is able to analyse possible positive and negative consequences of such interventions.     Keywords: Contact theory, right to work, professionals with disabilitie...|$|E
40|$|Disability, Employment and the European Community" is comparative, contextual and European. It {{examines}} {{the concepts of}} disability, discrimination and positive action, and proposes {{a new model of}} disability, which emphasises the role that physical and <b>attitudinal</b> <b>discrimination</b> play in disadvantaging people with impairments. The hook also investigates the meaning of, and the need for positive action to promote the employment of people with disabilities, and justifies such intervention on principles of social justice. The author examines European Community policy initiatives on disability to date, and argues that the European Community has a valuable contribution to make in legislating to counter discrimination and promote greater equality of opportunity. This analysis is extended to novor the role of anti-discrimination legislation as a fool for addressing the discrimination perpetrated against disabled people in the European labour market. In a number of extensive chapters there is thorough treatment of future possible Community initiatives, covering ifoth the legal detail of competences and measures, and a critical analysis of the practical effect of initiatives taken and proposed, culminating with a call for a disability anti-discrimination directive. broughout the book frequent reference is made to comparative material - from both the United States, with the employment sections of the recently enacted Americans with Disabilities Act being examined detail, and from European countries. The book reveals how European community) policy makers have failed to demonstrate responsiveness to new ideas, and how older models of disability have prevailed and not adjusted to developments in parallel areas. This book will be essential reading for anyone with an interest in EC social policy as well as disability activists and policy makers in this area. Published version of EUI PhD thesis, 199...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} speech stereotypes, {{in a school}} context, in two non-standard dialect speaking communities in the Conception Bay North region of Newfoundland. The sample group of 100 respondents represented three level's of age/education. A modified matched-guise (verbal guise) technique was implemented to assess attitudes to four English dialects, two standard and two non-standard. Respondents were asked to evaluate taped speakers with respect to personality traits {{and in terms of}} the suitability of their speech types to different speech situations. [...] The results revealed clear stereotyped preferences for standard dialect speakers on prestige-related evaluations and for formal speech situations. On solidarity-related evaluations and for informal speech situations, non-standard speakers received fairly positive evaluations. Speakers of an external standard dialect, however, often were preferred again on these scales. Ratings on pejorative scales revealed a general reluctance by the sample to award negative judgments, particularly to speakers of local non-standard dialects. [...] Respondent age proved to be a differentiating factor in <b>attitudinal</b> <b>discriminations.</b> The community backgrounds and sex of respondents were less obvious determining factors in attitudinal differences. [...] The findings are related to the educational situation in Newfoundland...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although a {{definitive}} immunization {{program has been}} advocated for children in our country, the immunization coverage is far from satisfactory. There is paucity of survey studies related to immunization pattern. Objective: This study has been undertaken to explore the social and attitudinal factors with parents resulting into adverse immunization. Material and Methods: The study was school based cross-sectional study conducted in 50 schools of Indore district selected by random sampling from three groups. Information was collected from parents by providing pre-tested questionnaire. Result: Association of parent’s literacy and socioeconomic status with successful immunization could be established. Overall coverage rate with vaccines was poor in school going girls {{as compared to the}} boys; proving thereby that gender discrimination exists putting girls in disadvantageous position. Conclusion: It can be expected that the immunization status of school children will improve if identified risk factors such as parental education, socioeconomic status, awareness status are improved and <b>attitudinal</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> is curbed...|$|R
50|$|The term SSR {{is usually}} {{used to refer}} to {{processes}} in post-conflict and transitional countries, where there is often support by third countries and/or international organisations. However, developed countries also engage in SSR activities. Gender and SSR-related activities include efforts to increase the recruitment, retention and advancement of female security sector personnel, improving responses to SGBV, training on how to prevent and respond to SGBV during overseas deployments, strengthening the gender dimensions of oversight and monitoring, and building collaboration with civil society groups concerned with gender issues. The challenges for integrating gender in such contexts tend to revolve around complacency and the emphasis on external threats such as terrorism. Entry points for gender and SSR are often linked to legal obligations under anti-discrimination and human rights legislation, or the need to boost recruitment for operational reasons. For example, following the introduction of the Canadian Human Rights Act (1977), the Canadian Forces were obliged to prove that any discriminatory policies were an operational necessity. After consistently failing to do so in court, the systemic barriers to women's participation in all areas of activity had been lifted by 2001. Social pressure also forced the Canadian Forces to address <b>attitudinal</b> causes of <b>discrimination</b> and SGBV through the establishment of Defense Diversity Councils. Similarly, regional frameworks such as NATO and the Council of Europe can provide impetus and a degree of social pressure for gender and SSR activities in developing countries.|$|R
