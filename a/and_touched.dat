5|$|After Amy (a playable character) {{complains}} about being bored, a bird wearing a Chaos Emerald necklace crashes into her in Sonic Adventure. She keeps the bird safe from E-100 Alpha, one of Eggman's robots. Amy later meets Sonic, and invites {{him to an}} amusement park (where they become separated). Alpha reappears, imprisoning Amy and the bird on Eggman's airship the Egg Carrier. Another Eggman robot, E-102 Gamma, orders Amy to give the bird to him; she refuses, asking him why he wants it. He does not know, and changes his mind when she tells him he is missing out on love. E-102 Gamma lets them leave <b>and,</b> <b>touched,</b> Amy becomes his friend before she escapes into the ship's interior. On the deck, Eggman confronts her and grabs the bird's Chaos Emerald. Sonic and Gamma appear, and when Sonic tries to destroy Gamma Amy defends him. Sonic agrees to spare Gamma, and Amy leaves with Tails. She later sees {{a photo of the}} bird and its parents (whom Eggman has also stolen) in its necklace. When Amy looks for them in the jungle, she again finds the Egg Carrier. The bird's parents emerge on the deck; Alpha appears, and injures Amy's bird. Amy destroys Alpha, and waves goodbye to the three departing birds.|$|E
40|$|Many {{research}} projects {{have demonstrated the}} benefits of bimanual interaction {{for a variety of}} tasks. When choosing bimanual input, system designers must select the input device that each hand will control. In this paper, we argue for the use of pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> two-handed input, <b>and</b> describe an experiment in which users were faster and committed fewer errors using pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> input in comparison to using either <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> or pen <b>and</b> pen input while performing a representative bimanual task.

40|$|Abstract—Current {{interfaces}} {{for common}} information visualizations such as bar graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots usually {{make use of}} the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and a Pointer) interface paradigm with its frequently discussed problems of multiple levels of indirection via cascading menus, dialog boxes, and control panels. Recent advances in interface capabilities such as the availability of pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> interaction challenge us to re-think this and investigate more direct access to both the visualizations and the data they portray. We conducted a Wizard of Oz study to explore applying pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> interaction to the creation of information visualization interfaces on interactive whiteboards without implementing a plethora of recognizers. Our wizard acted as a robust and flexible pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> recognizer, giving participants maximum freedom in how they interacted with the system. Based on our qualitative analysis of the interactions our participants used, we discuss our insights about pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> interactions in the context of learnability and the interplay between pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> gestures. We conclude with suggestions for designing pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> enabled interactive visualization interfaces.

40|$|Abstract — Abstract: Step <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> {{voltages}} play {{an important}} role when designing high voltage substation. Step <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> potentials near high voltage substation due to severe ground faults present a hazard to anyone in proximity to substation when a fault occurs. A primary issue of concern is hazardous step <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> voltage is that arise during fault situations, hence a reliable and efficient solution to the problem is essential. Although personnel safety is of primary concern, effect of electric current, resistance of the human body and tolerable voltage criteria considerations are also essential in the design system to ensure the protection of personnel and equipment. This study will briefly explain the significance of step <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> voltages...|$|R

40|$|Combined bimanual pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> {{input on}} digital tab-letops is an {{appealing}} interaction paradigm enjoying grow-ing popularity among many HCI researchers. Due to its relative novelty, its properties are still relatively unexplored and many hypotheses emerging from intuition and extrapo-lations from studies about <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> other pointing devices {{remain to be}} verified.

Specifically, we examine the compromise between speed and accuracy for the two input modalities in position-ing and tracing contexts, the influence of palm-resting on pen precision and bimanual coordination for pen mode-switching via postures.
