5|$|Werner Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg), a California-based former salesman, {{training}} manager and {{executive in the}} encyclopedia business, created the Erhard Seminars Training (est) course in 1971. est {{was a form of}} Large Group Awareness Training, and was part of the Human Potential Movement. est was a four-day, 60-hour self-help program given to groups of 250people at a time. The program was very intensive: each day would contain 15–20hours of instruction. During the training, est personnel utilized jargon to convey key concepts, and participants had to agree to certain rules that remained in effect {{for the duration of the}} course. Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes, and were promised a dramatic change in their self-perception. est was controversial. While some critics characterized the training methods as brainwashing, proponents and participants asserted that it had <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> positive impact on people's lives. By 1984 nearly half a million people had completed the est training, including public figures and mental health professionals.|$|E

25|$|Pat Barker's {{historical}} novel Regeneration (1991) also describes {{the meeting and}} relationship between Sassoon and Owen, acknowledging that, from Sassoon's perspective, the meeting had <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> significant effect on Owen. Owen's treatment with his own doctor, Arthur Brock, is also touched upon briefly. Owen's death is described in the third book of Barker's Regeneration trilogy, The Ghost Road (1995). In the 1997 film Regeneration, Stuart Bunce played Owen.|$|E
25|$|Niggle's yearnings after {{truth and}} beauty (God's creations) are echoed in his great painting; after death, Niggle is rewarded with the {{realisation}} (the making-real) of his yearning. Or, if you prefer, Niggle's Tree always existed – he simply echoed {{it in his}} art. From a metanarrative viewpoint, Tolkien's Arda is itself a subcreation designed to honour the true stories of the real world.

25|$|Arirang had {{initiated}} {{the period of}} nationalist film in Korea which continued from 1926 until about 1930, when harsher suppressive measures were undertaken by the authorities. After Arirang, tear-jerker shinpa-style movies that did no more than entertain, without appealing to a deeper national need, were criticized by the Korean press. Indeed, some of Na's own later films were also criticized in this way. Korean director and film historian Yu Hyun-mok states that Na's appearance with a Japanese woman as his romantic interest in the 1931 shinpa film, Geumganghan (The Grief of Geumgan), {{was seen as a}} betrayal by the Korean people, and had <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> negative impact on his career.|$|E
25|$|Scramble: {{also known}} as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and no closer to the hole), and the {{procedure}} is repeated until the hole is finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> negative impact on team score.|$|E

25|$|Antonio Arrúe Zarauz {{was born}} in the Elizmendi quarter of Asteasu, a small town near Tolosa in the Gipuzkoa province, in the region then known as Vascongadas. None of the sources {{consulted}} offers any information on his parents, except that his father, Juan Arrúe, was the first organist in the local San Pedro church; he also served in a number of nearby villages and towns giving lessons. Correct spelling of Antonio's mother’s surname is disputed. It is not clear whether the family was in any way related to a number of known contemporary Basques bearing the same name, esp. the Arrúe Valle brothers and the Franciscan musician, José Arrúe. Antonio and his two sisters, Eleuteria and Dolores, were raised in <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> Catholic ambience.|$|E
25|$|The {{monopoly}} of the VAAP was abolished in 1989. Also during Perestroika, a work group was formed {{with the task}} to adapt the Soviet copyright law to a market economy. These efforts culminated in the passing of <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> revised copyright law on March 31, 1991. This new law was a radical break with the previous Socialist practice. Author's rights were exclusive again, the copyright term was increased to 50 years p.m.a., neighbouring rights were introduced {{for the first time}} in Soviet legislation, and the free uses were reduced considerably and defined much narrower. Compulsory licenses were abolished altogether. The initial copyright owner in a work in all cases was the natural person who created the work; the copyright of legal entities no longer existed. The provisions of the 1991 Fundamentals, which were scheduled to enter in force on January 1, 1992, never became effective in the Soviet Union, as the USSR was dissolved before that date.|$|E
25|$|Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no {{dedicated}} scholarly work; {{the closest}} thing to a monograph are chapters dedicated to his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, Así se hizo MAPFRE (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they paint a picture of a Catholic taking communion almost every day, <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.|$|E

25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access to}} the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
25|$|While Wert {{endured the}} humiliating {{situation}} in Mantua {{through the late}} 1560s, he kept his job: he was to remain at least nominally maestro di cappella in Mantua until 1592. The 1560s were productive years for Wert musically, as he produced his first four books of five-voice madrigals during this time, and his first book for four voices. The dedications are significant: one is to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Duke of Sessa, and in the dedicatory preface Wert thanks him {{for the opportunity to}} lead his choir. (Fernández de Córdoba was Governor of Milan from 1558 to 1560.) During the late 1560s Wert had several offers of employment elsewhere, but turned them down. The most significant came in Augsburg in 1566, where Wert's spectacular ability to improvise counterpoint engendered an offer to join the imperial court in Prague, serving Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The next job offer he refused came from Parma the next year, the home of the Farnese family. However he became increasingly close to the Este court in Ferrara during the 1570s and 1580s, without actually becoming employed there. While the two courts were closely connected by marriage and mutual interchange of musicians, Ferrara was a place with <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> different outlook from Mantua: Ferrara was progressive, while Mantua was supportive of the Counter-Reformation; the progressive tendencies of Ferrara better fitted Wert's musical inclinations. Wert had a good time there; so much so that his employer in Mantua sent a strongly worded letter on 22 December 1584 demanding his immediate return to his post. Wert, however, {{had fallen in love with}} the widowed Tarquinia Molza, the most famous female singer and poet in Italy, who was a lady-in-waiting at the Este court, so he endeavored to spend as much time as possible in Ferrara. This was the same year that Lucrezia, Wert's wife, died in prison in Novellara.|$|E

500|$|As {{literary}} scholar Kari Lokke writes, The Last Man, {{more so than}} Frankenstein, [...] "in its {{refusal to}} place humanity {{at the center of}} the universe, its questioning of our privileged position in relation to nature...constitutes a profound and prophetic challenge to Western humanism." [...] Specifically, Mary Shelley's allusions to what radicals believed was a failed revolution in France and the Godwinian, Wollstonecraftian, and Burkean responses to it, challenge [...] "Enlightenment faith in the inevitability of progress through collective efforts". As in Frankenstein, Shelley [...] "offers <b>a</b> <b>profoundly</b> disenchanted commentary on the age of revolution, which ends in a total rejection of the progressive ideals of her own generation". Not only does she reject these Enlightenment political ideals, but she also rejects the Romantic notion that the poetic or literary imagination can offer an alternative.|$|E
