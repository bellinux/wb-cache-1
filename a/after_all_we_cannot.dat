40|$|Due to {{the fact}} {{that a large number of}} our ethical and {{behavioural}} norms have a conditional form, it is of great importance that deontic logics give an account of deontic commitments of the form “A commits you to do/bring about B”. It is commonly agreed that monadic approaches are only suboptimal for this task since they have several shortcomings, for instance their falling short of giving a satisfactory account of “Strengthening of the antecedent” or their difficulties in dealing with contrary-to-duty paradoxes. While dyadic logics are more promising in these respects, they have been criticized for not being able to model “detachment ” ([8]) : A and the commitment under A to do B implies the actual obligation to do B. “We seem to feel that detachment should be possible <b>after</b> <b>all.</b> But <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> have things both ways, can we? This is the dilemma on commitment and detachment. ” ([15], p. 658) In this paper I answer ˚Aqvist’s question with “Yes, we can ” by proposing a general method to turn dyadic deontic logics in adaptive logics allowing for factual detachment. It is shown that two types of obligations may be detached, proper and instrumental, which in case of violated obligations differ. Furthermore, a concrete realization based on Lou Goble’s conflict tolerant CDPM logics ([5]) is presented. ...|$|R

6000|$|Pope's character, {{apart from}} his poetry, which we intend criticising in our next volume, was not {{specially}} interesting or elevated. He was a spoiled child, a small self-tormentor,--full to bursting with petty spites, mean animosities, and unfounded jealousies. While he sought, with the fury of a pampered slave, to trample on those authors that were beneath him in rank or in popularity, he could on all occasions fawn with the sycophancy of a eunuch upon the noble, the rich, and the powerful. Hazlitt speaks of Moore as a [...] "pug-dog barking from the lap of a lady of quality at inferior passengers." [...] The description is far more applicable to Pope. We have much allowance to make for the influence exerted on his mind by his singularly crooked frame and sickly habit of body, by his position as belonging to a proscribed faith, and by his want of training in a public school; but <b>after</b> <b>all</b> these deductions, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> but deplore the spectacle {{of one of the}} finest, clearest, and sharpest minds that England ever produced, so frequently reminding you of a bright sting set in the body, and steeped in the venom, of a wasp. And yet, withal, he possessed many virtues, which endeared him to a multitude of friends. He was a kind son. He was a faithful and devoted friend. He loved, if not man, yet many men with deep tenderness. A keen politician he was not; but, so far as he went along with his party, he was true to the common cause. In morals, he was greatly superior, in point of external decorum, to most of the wits of the time; but in falsehood, finesse, treachery, and envy, he stood {{at the bottom of the}} list, without that plea of poverty, or wretchedness, or despair, which so many of them might have urged. Uneasy, indeed, he always, and unhappy he often, was; but very much of his uneasiness and unhappiness sprung from his own fault. He attacked others, and could not bear to be attacked in return. He was a bully and a coward. He threw himself into a thorn-hedge, and was amazed that he came out covered with scratches and blood. While he shone in satirising many kinds of vice, he laid himself open to retort by his own want of delicacy. He, as well as Swift, was fond of alluding in his verse to polluted and forbidden things. There, and there alone, his taste deserted him; and there is something disgusting and unnatural in the combination of the elegant and the obscene--the coarse in sentiment and the polished in style. And whatever may be said for many of the amiable traits of the Man, there is very little to be said for the general tendency--so far as healthy morality and Christian principle are concerned--of the writings of the Poet.|$|R

50|$|Human {{capital in}} the form of {{education}} shares many characteristics with physical capital. Both require an investment to create and, once created, both have economic value. Physical capital earns a return because people are willing to pay to use a piece of physical capital in work as it allows them to produce more output. To measure the productive value of physical capital, we can simply measure how much of a return it commands in the market. In the case of human capital calculating returns is more complicated - <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> separate education from the person to see how much it rents for.To get around this problem, the returns to human capital are generally inferred from differences in wages among people with different levels of education. Hall and Jones have calculated from international data that on average that the returns on education are 13.4% per year for first four years of schooling (grades 1-4), 10.1% per year {{for the next four years}} (grades 5-8) and 6.8% for each year beyond eight years. Thus someone with 12 years of schooling can be expected to earn, on average, 1.1344 × 1.1014 × 1.0684 = 3.161 times as much as someone with no schooling at all.|$|E
40|$|Two {{aspects of}} truth {{constitute}} {{the subject of}} investigation in this thesis. These two aspects arise in the dependence of truth on language and fact. A statement is true or false, {{as the case may}} be, jointly in virtue of what it means and of how things are. This double dependence. of truth on meaning and reality establishes prima facie interconnections between these notions, which I am here concerned to analyse. Consideration of these interconnections with respect to individual sentences suggests that truth is dependent on meaning. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> begin to assess a statement as to its veracity unless we first understand it, that is to say, grasp its meaning. This claim is unexceptionable, but only from a vantage point which precludes a general understanding of the concepts involved. It quite leaves out of account the evident consideration that {{it is only in the}} context of a language that a collocation of symbols or sounds is endowed with sense- While it must be that, to determine the truth or falsity of a statement, we have first to know its meaning, it does not follow that the concept of truth is to be analysed in terms of meaning. And indeed, at the level where we consider meaning in terms of the systematic functioning of language, we find that truth underlies meaning. In § 1. 2, 1 consider four arguments which aim to show that an answer to the question "how is a statement endowed with meaning?'' is to be couched in terms of truth. [Continued [...] . ]</p...|$|E
