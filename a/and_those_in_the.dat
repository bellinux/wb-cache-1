5|$|During {{the week}} {{beginning}} 27 November the Ottoman Army launched {{a series of}} infantry attacks employing shock tactics {{in the hope of}} breaking the British lines during the period of destabilisation created by troop reinforcements and withdrawals. Counterattacks were launched by the Ottoman 16th and 19th Divisions in the Judean Hills on Nebi Samweil and on the Zeitun plateau. Attacks were also launched against British lines of communication via a gap between the British forces on the maritime plain <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Judean Hills and also against several British units spread out on the maritime plain.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there were two}} billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not {{interact with each other}} to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} or wood nuthatch (Sitta europaea) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{found throughout}} temperate Asia and in Europe, where its name is the nuthatch. Like other nuthatches, it is a short-tailed bird with a long bill, blue-grey upperparts and a black eye-stripe. It is a vocal bird with a repeated loud dwip call. There are more than 20 subspecies in three main groups; birds in {{the west of the}} range have orange-buff underparts and a white throat, those in Russia have whitish underparts, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Far East have a similar appearance to European birds, but lack the white throat.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} academic results of first year Industrial Management and Engineering students, achieved either in a PLE (Project-led Education) or in a non PLE teaching and learning approach. Data collected focuses on students’ grades, including continuous and summative assessment results of four different courses, from the academic year 2006 / 2007 to 2008 / 2009. The evaluation indicators used are the ratio of students assessed <b>and</b> <b>those</b> enrolled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course, the ratio of students approved <b>and</b> <b>those</b> enrolled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course, the ratio of students approved <b>and</b> <b>those</b> assessed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course, the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation of student grades. Findings suggest that PLE students, in average, have better results than the non PLE students at all courses and for the three academic years analyzed. However, these results need to be understood in a broader perspective which includes other variables such as student background, student engagement of given tasks, etc. which are {{beyond the scope of}} this paper...|$|R

5|$|Immediately after Weylandt's death, Giro {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would not issue his dossard number 108 in future editions of the race. His number was a prominent part of signs held by fans on the roadside at not just the Giro but other events later in the season as well, including the Tour of California where his death was part of the reason the first stage of that race was canceled due to safety concerns. Many other races, mostly those held in Weylandt's native Belgium, also began the practice of not issuing the number. The Belgian federation criticized this gesture, saying it would not bring Weylandt back and would only serve to continually remind fans <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sport of Weylandt's death. They issued the number for the Belgian national road race championships.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{took the}} party into the 2015 United Kingdom general election, which saw a {{majority}} {{win for the}} Conservatives, and Labour's worst-ever election result in Scotland. There was a landslide shift towards the SNP, which took 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, while Labour lost 40 of the 41 Westminster seats it was defending. Notable losses included Murphy's constituency of East Renfrewshire and Brown's former constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, previously Labour's safest seat in Scotland. Other high-profile figures such as Sarwar, Clark, Curran, Ian Davidson, and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander also lost their seats. Following his defeat, Murphy spoke of his intention to stand for a Holyrood seat in 2016. However, the result prompted Labour figures <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trade union movement to question the future of his leadership. Ian Davidson suggested {{that it would be}} difficult for Murphy to remain as Scottish Labour leader without a parliamentary seat and in the wake of such a heavy defeat. Rafferty, and Kevin Lindsay of ASLEF, called for his resignation, while Findlay, and Labour's local government spokesman Alex Rowley, expressed their concerns about the party's future under Murphy's leadership and resigned from his shadow cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Several {{attempts}} at a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Islamic caliphates, their common enemy, {{were made by}} various leaders among the Frankish Crusaders and the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Such an alliance might have seemed an obvious choice: the Mongols were already sympathetic to Christianity, given the presence of many influential Nestorian Christians in the Mongol court. The Franks (Western Europeans <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Crusader States of the Levant) were open {{to the idea of}} support from the East, in part owing to the long-running legend of the mythical Prester John, an Eastern king in a magical kingdom who many believed would one day come to the assistance of the Crusaders in the Holy Land. The Franks and Mongols also shared a common enemy in the Muslims. However, despite many messages, gifts, and emissaries {{over the course of several}} decades, the often-proposed alliance never came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|University {{governance}} {{is conducted}} through the Board of Governors and the Senate, {{both of which}} were given much of their present power in the Unofficial Consolidation of an Act for the Regulation and Support of Dalhousie College in Chapter 24 of the Acts of 1863.

The Board is responsible for conduct, management, and control of the university and of its property, revenues, business, and affairs. Board members, known as Governors of the Board, include the university's chancellor, president, and 25 other members. Members include people from within the university community such as four approved representatives from Dalhousie Student Union, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding community, such as the Mayor of Halifax. The Senate is responsible for the university's academics, including standards for admission and qualifications for degrees, diplomas, and certificates.

5|$|With its heavyset body, conical bulbous snout, {{and large}} mouth filled with {{protruding}} teeth, the {{bigeye sand tiger}} looks much like the better-known sand tiger shark. The large eyes lack nictitating membranes, and behind them are small spiracles. The corner of the mouth extends to behind {{the level of the}} eyes, and the jaws are highly protrusible. There are 34–43 upper and 37–46 lower tooth rows; these include zero to two rows of small teeth at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and two to four more rows at the lower symphysis. In each half of the upper jaw, the teeth in the first and second rows are large, those in the third and sometimes fourth rows are small, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rows after are large again. Each tooth has a narrow, awl-like central cusp flanked by one smaller cusplet on each side; this contrasts with the smalltooth sand tiger, which has two or three lateral cusplets on each side. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
