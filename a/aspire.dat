40|$|Findings {{from the}} 60 Sox Employer Survey founds that over 80 % of {{employers}} indicated that <b>aspiring</b> creatives only accounted for between 0 % and 20 % of all workers. This report represents {{the second of}} two reports that aim to explore views about the employability of <b>aspiring</b> creatives. The first report, released in June 2009, presented findings from a survey of 507 <b>aspiring</b> creatives, defined as recent graduates and/or people with {{less than two years}} industry experience. It presents findings from a project that administered an survey to employers in Australia’s Creative Digital Industries. The survey included questions on employer characteristics, recruitment and training practices, employers’ views of the capabilities of <b>aspiring</b> creatives, and participation in communities of interest/networks, mentoring and internships. The main purpose of the project was to identify capability gaps of <b>aspiring</b> creatives as well as those factors that enhance or inhibit employers’ views of the capabilities of <b>aspiring</b> creatives – both of which impact on the ability of <b>aspiring</b> creatives to find work in their preferred occupations in Australia’s Creative Digital Industries. This report presents findings from the 60 Sox Employer Survey that gathered data from 50 employers in Australia’s Creative Digital Industries about the employability of <b>aspiring</b> creatives i. e. recent graduates and/or people with less than two years industry experience. The survey included questions on employer characteristics, recruitment and training practices, employers’ views of the capabilities of <b>aspiring</b> creatives, and participation in communities of interest/networks, mentoring and internships. The main purpose of the project was to identify capability gaps of <b>aspiring</b> creatives as well as those employer and workforce characteristics that enhance or inhibit the ability of <b>aspiring</b> creatives to find work in Australia’s Creative Digital Industries. The project team set itself three objectives to achieve this purpose: 1. Describe the characteristics and practices of employers. 2. Explore the views of employers and the views of <b>aspiring</b> creatives in relation to the capabilities of <b>aspiring</b> creatives. 3. Identify the factors that influence employers’ views of the capabilities of <b>aspiring</b> creatives. The project team used two measures to identify capability gaps. The first measured the differences between employers’ views of the ‘importance’ of skills and attributes to their workplaces and their views of the ‘capabilities’ of <b>aspiring</b> creatives. The second measured the differences between employers’ views of the capabilities of <b>aspiring</b> creatives and <b>aspiring</b> creatives’ views of their own capabilities, obtained from an earlier survey of 507 <b>aspiring</b> creatives. To identify the factors that influence employers’ views of the capability of <b>aspiring</b> creatives, the project team used criteria to select five (5) skills for analysis - team work skills, communication skills, problem-solving skills, initiative & enterprise skills, and learning skills. They also selected job-specific skills due to ongoing concerns about specialist skills gaps. The project team used descriptive analysis to identify enabling factors that contribute to employers’ views that <b>aspiring</b> creatives have higher capabilities in particular skills areas; and inhibiting factors that contribute to employers’ views that <b>aspiring</b> creatives have lower capabilities in particular skills areas. The project team was then able to identify enabling and inhibiting factors common to most of the skills areas. Notable findings for this project are as follows: Over 80 % of employers indicated that <b>aspiring</b> creatives only accounted for between 0 % and 20 % of all workers. Employers were more attracted to ‘creative talent and/or the necessary job skills’ than qualifications when employing creative graduates and technical graduates. Employers were most likely to indicate that it was ‘difficult’ to recruit <b>aspiring</b> creatives with the ‘right’ skills and attributes. Over the previous 12 months, employers had recruited around half of their new workers from interstate and overseas. Employers were most likely to indicate the capabilities of <b>aspiring</b> creatives for all 15 skills and attributes included in the employer survey were below their expectations when compared to the level of importance they placed on these skills and attributes to their workplaces. When compared to the views of employers, <b>aspiring</b> creatives over-rated their capabilities for 13 of the 15 skills and attributes as well as their software skills; and slightly under-rated their capabilities in the areas of business skills, positive self-esteem and motivation. The two measures of capability gaps identified the largest gaps of <b>aspiring</b> creatives in the areas of problem-solving skills, communication skills, initiative & enterprise skills, team work skills, learning skills, self-management skills, and careers goals/planning skills. Common enabling and inhibiting factors, based on the analysis of six skills areas, are as follows: 	Enabling factors - Employers who employ visual artists and animators, and/or find it ‘easy/very easy’ to recruit the ‘right’ graduates were most likely to indicate higher levels of capability of <b>aspiring</b> creatives. 	Inhibiting factors - Employers from the Architecture, Design and Visual Arts sector and/or have operated for less than five (5) years were most likely to indicate lower levels of capability of <b>aspiring</b> creatives.   Images: 60 sox websit...|$|R
40|$|Developing a {{high-quality}} K- 12 education {{system in the}} United States {{is critical to the}} nation's prosperity and international success. Due to teachers' large impact on the success of a K- 12 system, recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers is at the forefront of this discussion. Unfortunately, current state and federal assessment methods do not account for many of the teacher traits associated with teacher effectiveness [...] such as care and high self-concept. Furthermore, aside from demographic characteristics, we know little about how the population of students entering the teacher occupation has changed. This study draws from career and self-concept theory using longitudinal trend analysis and multinomial regressions to add to the body of knowledge of how the population of <b>aspiring</b> teachers has changed since 1971. In particular, this study examines <b>aspiring</b> elementary, secondary and non-teachers across four categories: demographics, academic success, self-concept, and care. The conclusions from this study suggest that although the current population of <b>aspiring</b> teachers looks similar to their peers in 1971; when <b>aspiring</b> elementary teachers and secondary teachers, and different demographic groups are examined separately, the diversity within the <b>aspiring</b> teacher population becomes more apparent. Further, this study revealed that the population of <b>aspiring</b> elementary teachers is very different from their peers <b>aspiring</b> to teach secondary school. <b>Aspiring</b> secondary teachers' grades, care-levels and self-concept scores are more similar to their peers <b>aspiring</b> not to teach than they are to their peers <b>aspiring</b> to become elementary teachers. Additionally the findings suggest an opportunity for Teacher Education Programs and school districts to create programs to bolster new teachers' self-concept, care and social justice through trainings and collaborations. These findings have implications for teacher education programs, higher education-at-large, as well as state and federal education departments...|$|R

Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given {{in the context of}} his teaching that the direct experience of God was something to which all Christians could <b>aspire.</b>|$|E

5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to <b>aspire</b> to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights {{of one kind or}} another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E
5|$|While it is {{unproven}} that Sejanus {{intended to}} overthrow Tiberius, later prefects of the Guard did <b>aspire</b> to become emperor. Upon {{the suicide of}} Emperor Nero in AD 68, the Guard prefect Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus attempted to have himself declared emperor, on the pretence {{that he was the}} illegitimate son of Caligula. The attempt failed and Sabinus was killed by his soldiers. In the early 3rd century, Plautianus was executed after a failed conspiracy against Septimius Severus. According to sources, the downfall of Plautianus was largely due to suspicion of Severus' son Caracalla, who was later murdered and replaced by his Praetorian prefect Marcus Opellius Macrinus.|$|E
5|$|Æthelred usually {{acted with}} the {{permission}} of or in association with King Alfred, but occasionally he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces, for he is also accorded styles which <b>aspire</b> to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E
