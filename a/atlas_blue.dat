While on hiatus, Jenkins pursued his solo career to release two albums, Bungalow (2004) and The City Gates (2005) on Parole Records. Icecream Hands briefly reunited for The Good China, issued in 2007 on the independent label Dust Devil Music. Jenkins {{returned to his}} solo work and released <b>Blue</b> <b>Atlas</b> on Dust Devil Music in 2008. Robertson (as [...] "Doug Root") joined Melbourne-based alternative rock group Root! in 2008, he had guested on their debut album, Root! (2007).

40|$|We {{present the}} results from an {{analysis}} of surface photometry of B, R, and Halpha images {{of a total of}} 114 nearby galaxies drawn from the Palomar/Las Campanas Imaging <b>Atlas</b> of <b>Blue</b> Compact Dwarf galaxies. Surface brightness and color profiles for the complete sample have been obtained. We determine the exponential and Sersic profiles that best fit the surface brightness distribution of the underlying stellar population detected in these galaxies. We also compute the (B-R) color and total absolute magnitude of the underlying stellar population and compared them to the integrated properties of the galaxies in the sample. Our analysis shows that the (B-R) color of the underlying population is systematically redder than the integrated color, except in those galaxies where the integrated colors are strongly contaminated by line and nebular-continuum emission. We also find that galaxies with relatively red underlying stellar populations (typically (B-R) >~ 1 mag) show structural properties compatible with those of dwarf elliptical galaxies (i. e. a smooth light distribution, fainter extrapolated central surface brightness and larger scale lengths than BCD galaxies with blue underlying stellar populations). At least ~ 15 % of the galaxies in the sample are compatible with being dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies experiencing a burst of star formation. For the remaining BCD galaxies in the sample we do not find any correlation between the recent star formation activity and their structural differences with respect to other types of dwarf galaxies.

50|$|The pea-gravel {{driveway}} {{is lined}} with maturing pin oaks and red maples. The formally landscaped terrace is surrounded by Japanese yew, Chinese juniper, and dwarf hemlock. The trees of The Breakers' grounds act as screens that increase the sense of distance between The Breakers and its Newport neighbors. Among the more unusual imported trees are two examples of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Atlas</b> Cedar, a native of North Africa. Clipped hedges of Japanese yew and Pfitzer juniper line the tree-shaded foot paths that meander about the grounds. Informal plantings of arbor vitae, taxus, Chinese juniper, and dwarf hemlock provide attractive foregrounds for the walls that enclose the formally landscaped terrace. The grounds also contain several varieties of other rare trees, particularly copper and weeping beeches. These were hand-selected by Ernest W. Bowditch, a landscape architect and civil engineer based in the Boston area. Bowditch’s original pattern for the south parterre garden was determined from old photographs and laid out in pink and white alyssum and blue ageratum. The wide borders paralleling the wrought iron fence are planted with rhododendron, mountain laurel, dogwoods, and many other flowering shrubs that effectively screen the grounds from street traffic and give visitors a feeling of seclusion.|$|R
