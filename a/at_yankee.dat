Sheppard {{would go on}} to serve PA duties <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium for another 56 years. On September 28 of that year, Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds pitched a no-hitter against the Red Sox. A year later, Red Sox outfielder Jimmy Piersall and Yankees second baseman Billy Martin exchanged insults before a game in Boston, and ended up fighting in the tunnel under the stands. The fight was eventually broken up by Yankees coaches Bill Dickey and Oscar Melillo, and Boston starting pitcher Ellis Kinder. Piersall changed out of his bloody shirt and promptly fought with teammate Maury McDermott. The Red Sox won 5–2 with Piersall sitting the game out.|$|E

5|$|As {{the complex}} was being built, and their current home <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium was being renovated, {{they would be}} without a home for three years. Their final full season <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium was 1972. After playing their first two games there in 1973, the Giants played {{the rest of their}} home games in 1973, as well as all of their home games in 1974, at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. This was done out of a desire to have their own home field, as opposed to having to share Shea Stadium with the Jets. However, between access problems, {{neighborhood}} issues, the fact that the Yale Bowl was not ideally suited for pro football (the stadium did not have lights, nor does it have lights today), the age of the stadium (it was built in 1914) and the lack of modern amenities, the Giants reconsidered their decision and ultimately agreed to share Shea Stadium with the Jets for the 1975 season. The Giants left Yale Bowl after losing all seven home games played at Yale in the 1974 season and compiling a home record of 1–11 over that two-year stretch.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, 1939, Ruth {{spoke on}} Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium {{as members of}} the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, who was forced into {{premature}} retirement by ALS disease, which would kill him two years later. The next week, Ruth went to Cooperstown, New York, for the formal opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Three years earlier, {{he was one of the}} first five players elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers. During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball when he contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but he was sent a rejection letter.|$|E

5|$|Rivera rebounded in 2008 {{and began}} the year with 16consecutive {{scoreless}} innings pitched and 28consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06ERA and 23saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher {{as a tribute to}} him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on September21, in the final game <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason {{for the first time in}} his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed calcification of the acromioclavicular joint in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason.|$|E

5|$|The 1963 season {{unfolded}} for the Mets {{much like}} the previous year's, though they lost only eight games to begin the season, rather than nine, but they still finished 51–111, in last place. One highlight, though it did not count in the standings, was the Mayor's Trophy Game on June 20 <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium. Stengel played to win; the Yankees under Houk possibly less so, and the Mets beat the Yankees, 6–2.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{lost the}} World Series in , while the Red Sox loss came in 1986. Both times, the teams lost after being up 2–0 in their {{respective}} World Series, and both losses happened in New York (The Red Sox lost the 1986 World Series at Shea Stadium). For the Yankees, the loss in 1981 {{marked the beginning of}} the team's demise and downfall in the 1980s and early 1990s. Despite the lack of championships, the rivalry between the teams did have some memorable highlights. Yankee left-hander Dave Righetti threw a no-hitter against the Red Sox <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium. One of the game's greatest hitters, Wade Boggs, struck out to end the game. This was the first no-hitter thrown by a left-hander <b>at</b> <b>Yankee</b> Stadium and the first no-hitter by a Yankee since Don Larsen's perfect game against Subway Series rival Brooklyn Dodgers in Game five of the 1956 World Series and the first regular no-hitter by a Yankee since 1951.|$|E
