40|$|AbstractIn this report, a {{split ring}} {{resonator}} (SRR), {{the most important}} building block of metamaterial, is fabricated and integrated with a microfluidic chamber for biosensing. The SRR is produced on a microwave printed circuit board while the microfluidic chamber is fabricated by casting of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). SRR was immobilized with <b>Anti-</b> <b>Immunoglobulin</b> G (IgG) for IgG detection by a standard covalent immobilization using Cystamine. The PDMS chamber was aligned and clamped on the circuit board and the electromagnetic response of the SRR sensor was continuously monitored when IgG analytes was flowed through the chamber. The reaction of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Anti-IgG results in a shift of resonance frequency. It {{was found that the}} response of the resonance frequency is sensitive to the IgG concentrations. Therefore, the SRR microfluidic scheme can be effectively used as an advanced bio-sensing device...|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} that thyroid monolayers derived from the glands of {{patients}} with autoimmune thyroid disease have immunoglobulin (Ig) bound to their surface. This {{appears to have been}} deposited in vivo rather than during preparation of the monolayers, a view supported by our finding of such deposits on the apical margin of follicular cells in sections cut from these glands and stained with conjugated <b>anti-</b> <b>immunoglobulin.</b> It is likely that these deposits represent specific binding of so-called "microsomal" autoantibodies {{to the surface of the}} thyroid cells in vivo since staining of partially disrupted follicles ("half-melons") with Hashimoto serum containing microsomal autoantibodies in the indirect immunofluorescence (IFL) test, localized the antigen on the apical surface of the cells lining the follicular cavity.

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} distribution of anti-immunoglobulin IgG molecules on the surface of bone marrow-derived lymphocytes upon the interaction of these cells with macrophages. Lymphocytes which were diffusely coated with antibodies to surface immunoglogulin were ingested by macrophages. Lymphocytes which had the same number of <b>anti-</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> IgG molecules redistributed to one pole of the surface bound to the macrophages' Fc receptors but were not ingested. These results confirm our previous hypothesis that ingestion of an immunologically coated particle requires the sequential, circumferential binding of specific receptors on the plasma membrane of a phagocytic cell to immunologic ligands distributed over the entire particle surface. Macrophages which had bound capped lymphocytes by the macrophages' Fc receptors removed the immune complex caps from the lymphocyte surface without destroying the lymphocytes. These lymphocytes remained attached to the macrophage surface. The finding that macrophages can phagocytize immune complexes from the surface of a cell without destroying the cell to which these complexes are attached may be important in understanding the effects of antigens and antibodies on cells participating in a humoral immune response, in identifying the mechanisms by which chronic viral infections are established, and in defining the roles of blocking antibodies in tumor immunity...|$|R

40|$|This paper examines, in mouse spleen lymphocytes, {{the effect}} of <b>anti-</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> (anti-Ig) on the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration, [Ca 2 +]i, {{measured}} with the fluorescent indicator quin 2, {{and the relationship of}} [Ca 2 +]i to the capping of surface Ig. Anti-Ig causes a rapid rise of [Ca 2 +], which precedes capping. Assuming that only those 40 - 50 % of the cells which can bind anti-Ig (the B cells) undergo a [Ca 2 +]i response, [Ca 2 +]i in those cells approaches 500 nM. It declines to resting levels over many minutes, roughly paralleling the formation of caps. Part of the [Ca 2 +]i signal is due to stimulated influx across the plasma membrane, since in Ca 2 +-free medium, anti-Ig gives a smaller and shorter [Ca 2 +]i rise. The amplitude of this reduced transient now varies inversely with quin 2 content, as if some 0. 25 mmol Ca per liter of cells was released into the cytoplasm from internal stores. These stores are probably sequestered in organelles since A 23187 in Ca 2 +-free medium also causes a transient [Ca 2 +]i rise after which anti-Ig has no effect. These organelles seem not to be mitochondria because uncouplers have hardly any effect on [Ca 2 +]i. Though anti-Ig normally raises [Ca 2 +]i before causing capping, {{there seems to be no}} causal link between the two events. Cells in Ca 2 +-free medium whose stores have been emptied by A 23187, still cap with anti-Ig even though there is no [Ca 2 +]i rise. Cells loaded with quin 2 in the absence of external Ca 2 + still cap anti-Ig normally even though their [Ca 2 +]i remains steady at below 30 nM, four times lower than normal resting [Ca 2 +]i...|$|R

40|$|Background. Despite the {{introduction}} of anti-D prophylaxis into clinical practice, RhD alloimmunization still presents a problem to date. The actual incidence of RhD alloimmunization in pregnant women remains unknown in most countries. <b>Anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> is administered to RhD negative women at a fixed dose and in much greater amounts than is actually necessary. On the other hand, {{it is not possible}} to diagnose cases where greater doses are needed. To optimize the prevention of RhD alloimmunization in RhD negative women, it is important to diagnose conditions that lead to fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH), precisely determine the volume and subsequently administer the appropriate dose of <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin.</b> The possibility to accurately detect FMH and precisely determine its volume would enable more effective and less costly prevention of RhD alloimmunization. <b>Anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> could be administered only in indicated cases and only in doses essentially necessary for prevention of RhD alloimmunization. Methods and results. The Cochrane and UpToDate databases of systematic reviews, as well as national guidelines, were reviewed. Conclusions. Due to the medical significance and indispensable economic costs associated with prevention of RhD alloimmunization, it would be appropriate to establish exact methodical guidelines. The text itself should be limited to a list of potentially sensitising events during which <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> should be administered to RhD negative women if anti-D antibodies are not already present. Following each potentially sensitising event, the minimal dose of <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> necessary for prevention of RhD alloimmunization should be determined.

40|$|Progression {{through the}} cell cycle is a tightly {{controlled}} process that integrates signals generated at the plasma membrane with the proteins {{that form the}} cell cycle machinery. The current study chronicles the induction of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk), and cdk inhibitors in low density primary mouse B lymphocytes after <b>anti-</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> plus interleukin 4 (IgM + IL- 4) stimulation. In this system, > 85 % of cells remain in the G 0 /G 1 phase of cell cycle for an initial 24 -h period, followed by entry of up to 50 % of the cells into S phase, commencing around 30 h and peaking at 48 h. Extensive time course analyses of these anti-IgM + IL- 4 -stimulated B cells revealed that the G 1 -associated D-type cyclins D 2 and D 3 were induced by 3 h after stimulation, and that cyclins E, A, and B were subsequently induced sequentially, beginning at mid-G 1, G 1 /S transition, and S phase, respectively. The G 1 -associated cyclin D 1 was not expressed at any stage of the anti-Ig + IL- 4 -induced B cell cycle. cdk 2, cdk 4, and cdk 6 were induced during G 1, whereas cell division cycle- 2 (cdc 2) was induced concomitantly with S phase. Irrespective of their expression, the kinases cdk 2 and cdc 2 were only active from S phase onwards, suggesting that productive cyclin/kinase complex formation did not occur until that time. Cell cycle inhibitors p 21 and p 19 were induced by anti-Ig + IL- 4, peaking in expression at mid-G 1 and S phase, respectively. Stimulation of low density B cells with anti-Ig + IL- 4 caused rapid down regulation of the p 27 inhibitor, however this protein was reexpressed at 54 - 96 h after stimulation. In contrast, B cells stimulated with anti-CD 40, a stimulus which induces long-term B cell proliferation, permanently down regulated p 27. These {{findings are consistent with}} the concept that p 27 reexpression contributes to the G 1 arrest that follows antigen receptor crosslinking. Low density B cells cultured in the viability-enhancing cytokine IL- 4 alone also showed induction of D 2 and D 3 cyclin expression. However, the D 2 expression was transient, and the D 3 expression was substantially lower than that observed in B cells induced to proliferate by anti-Ig + IL- 4. This partial induction of D 2 and D 3 expression may explain IL- 4 's ability to promote B cell entry into G 1 but not S phase of cell cycle, and furthermore, its ability to truncate G 1 progression when B cells are subsequently stimulated with anti-Ig...|$|R

The babies {{were divided into}} two groups according to number of doses of <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> received by the mother (one or two), and then further divided by their Rh status (negative or positive). Findings were also compared with a control group of babies of O-Rh positive mothers. â€¨RESULTSâ€”The study group consisted of 101 babies and the control group of 37 babies. No statistically significant differences were found for any of the haematological variables between the babies of mothers who received one or two doses of <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin,</b> or between the Rh negative babies (n = 35), and the controls. Although 20 % of the Rh positive babies born to mothers receiving two doses of <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> had a positive result in the direct Coombs' test compared with only 2. 4 % of the babies of mothers treated with only one dose, no signs of haemolysis were documented in the babies with a positive Coombs test. â€¨CONCLUSIONâ€”The prevention of Rh isoimmunisation with <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> (one or two doses) during pregnancy does not jeopardise the newborn.

In a proportion of cases the mothers received <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> prophylaxis according to the flow cytometer estimate of FMH volume. RESULTS [...] Forty three cases of FMH were studied prospectively. The correlation between Kleihauer and flow cytometry results was poor. In 38 (88 %) cases the size of FMH quantitated by flow cytometry was lower than that estimated using the Kleihauer technique. In 13 (30 %) cases no Rh D immunoglobulin positive cells were detected by flow cytometry. Centralised review of the original Kleihauer films using a calibrated microscope resulted in improved, but still suboptimal correlation with flow cytometry results.

The incidence of pre-eclampsia was lower in mothers given antenatal <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin,</b> but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS [...] Antenatal prophylaxis with <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> is effective, and the effect of giving it in the first pregnancy persists into at least the second pregnancy. It seems to be safe for the fetus in the index and subsequent pregnancies...|$|E

40|$|The risk ofmaternal alloimmunization due to RhD {{incompatibility}} {{has decreased}} {{with use of}} antenatal and postnatal <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> prophylaxis. The discovery of cell-free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma during pregnancy and the feasibility of fetal RhD testing using this source of DNA {{make it possible to}} determine fetal RhD type and to restrict the use of antenatal <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> to only those RhD-negative women carrying an RhD-positive fetus. Variable and low amount of fetal DNA present in maternal plasma and the genetic variation of RHD alleles in the fetus or mother complicate such noninvasive testing. This study was done to evaluate the efficacy of noninvasive fetal RHD testing in week 27 of pregnancy to restrict use of antenatal and postnatal <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> use to RhD-negative women carrying an RhD-positive fetus. Duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was carried out for RHD exon 5 and RHD exon 7 in triplicate on cellfreeDNA isolated frommaternal plasma. Cord blood serologywas used as the reference standard as it is the best test available for determination of neonatal RhD status. The sensitivity for detection of fetal RHD was 99. 94 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 99. 89 %- 99. 97 %), and specificity was 97. 74 % (95 % CI, 97. 43 %- 98. 02 %). Cord blood serology showed 9 falsenegative fetal RHD test results (0. 03 %; 95 % CI, 0. 02 %- 0. 07 %) and 225 false-positive fetal RHD test results (0. 87 %; 95 % CI, 0. 76 %- 1. 00 %). The overall negative predictive value was 99. 91 %(95 % CI, 99. 82 %- 99. 95 %), and the positive predictive value was 98. 60 % (95 % CI, 98. 40 %- 98. 77 %). The results demonstrate that fetal RHD assay performed at week 27 of pregnancy as part of an antenatal screening program is reliable and effective and can be used to restrict the use of both antenatal and postnatal <b>anti-D</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> in RhD-negative pregnant wome...|$|E
40|$|Two {{proteins}} {{which are}} capable of dispersing cell clusters of Staphylococcus aureus have been purified from a S. aureus FDA 209 P culture supernatant. Both of them {{were found to have}} bacteriolytic activity. From the elution profile of column chromatography and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis, one of them was identified as a 51 -kDa endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GL). The other was a 62 -kDa protein on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the peptidoglycan fragments following treatment with the 62 -kDa protein indicated that this protein is an N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase (AM). In vitro studies of cluster dispersion activities using S. aureus mutant strains Lyt 66 or S. aureus Wood 46 grown as clusters demonstrated that these two enzymes act synergistically to disperse clusters into single cells. Antiserum against the 51 -kDa GL cross-reacted with the 62 -kDa AM, and S. aureus FDA 209 P grown in the presence of <b>anti-</b> 51 -kDa-GL <b>immunoglobulin</b> G induced giant clusters. Clusters induced by anti- 51 -kDa GL and by Cibacron blue F 3 G-A were dispersed by coincubation with the 51 -kDa GL and the 62 -kDa AM. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the 51 -kDa GL and the 62 -kDa AM were missing in culture supernatants of S. aureus Lyt 66, Wood 46, and RUSAL 2 (Tn 551 autolysin-defective mutant), which grow in clusters. These results strongly suggest that the 51 -kDa GL and 62 -kDa AM are involved in cell separation of daughter cells after cell division...|$|R
40|$|Athrombospondin-related {{anonymous}} protein (TRAP) of {{the human}} malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum shares highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs with the circumsporozoite protein of all plasmodia sequenced so far, {{as well as with}} unrelated proteins like thrombospondin and properdin. Although it was first described as an asexual blood stages protein, there has been some controversy about its expression in these stages. Pursuant to our interest in the conserved sequences within the malaria antigens, we synthesized an 18 -residue peptide (18 -mer) representing a conserved motif of TRAP and raised polyclonal antibodies against it. In an immunoblot assay in which we probed proteins from the asexual blood stages of the parasite, we found that this antibody recognized predominantly a 78 -kDa protein in the whole parasite lysate. Furthermore, in another immunoblot, the recombinant TRAP constructs containing the conserved-motif sequence were distinctly recognized by the antipeptide antibodies, whereas a construct lacking the motif sequence was not, suggesting that the antibodies specifically cross-reacted with a protein which might be a TRAP-like protein present in the asexual blood stages of the parasite. Also, in an immunofluorescence assay, this antibody brightly stained the acetone-fixed trophozoites of the parasite. Most significantly, <b>anti-</b> 18 -mer <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, as well as antipeptide antibody against a smaller (nonamer) construct representing the most conserved motif within the 18 -mer, inhibited the merozoite invasion of erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. These results provide evidence of the expression of TRAP or a TRAP-like protein in the asexual blood stages of the parasite and of a possible role of the conserved motifs in the parasite-host cell interaction during the process of invasion...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} is primarily acquired in early childhood. Its transmission routes are debated. The aims {{of this study}} were to determine the seroprevalence of <b>anti-</b> H. pylori <b>immunoglobulin</b> G (IgG) in Yemeni children under 10 years of age, the potential risk factors for contracting H. pylori infection and co-infection of H. pylori with intestinal parasites. METHODS : Enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay was used to determine the H. pylori prevalence rate among 572 healthy volunteers aged less than 10 years. Formalin ether concentration methods were used to test the prevalence of intestinal parasites (intestinal roundworms and tapeworms). In addition, we interviewed participants regarding potential risk factors for contracting H. pylori infection. RESULTS : The seroprevalence of H. pylori antibodies was 9 &#x 0025;. The prevalence according to age varied from 0 &#x 0025; in children under 2 years to 12. 5 &#x 0025; in age group 9 - 10 years. There was a correlation between the amounts of positive antibodies and increasing age. The prevalence rate of H. pylori antibodies was also significantly associated with the practice of drinking water from reused plastic jerry cans, with poor mouth hygiene and with co-infection by intestinal parasites. CONCLUSION : The prevalence of H. pylori antibodies in Yemen among children under 10 years of age is higher than that reported from other regions for the same age groups. Yemen shares some but not all potential risk factors for H. pylori infection with countries in which similar socioeconomic conditions are found. A possible way of eliminating H. pylori from the population would be via public health measures, i. e. preventing the reuse of plastic jerry cans, and improving sanitation and the standard of living...|$|R
