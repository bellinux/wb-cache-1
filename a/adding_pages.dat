40|$|Our aim is {{to produce}} a focused crawler that, given one or a number of sample pages, will crawl to all similar pages on the web as {{efficiently}} as possible. A key problem in achieving this goal is assigning credit to documents along a crawl path, so that the system can learn which documents lead toward goal documents and can thus efficiently search in a best first manner. To address this problem, we construct an artificial economy of autonomous agents. Each agent buys and sells web pages and is compensated when it buys a goal page, when another agent buys the current set of uncrawled web pages, or when future agents buy a goal page. The economy serves to push money up from goal pages, compensating agents that buy useful pages. Inappropriate agents go broke and new agents are created, and the system evolves agents whose bids accurately estimate the utility of <b>adding</b> <b>pages</b> to the search. The system is found to outperform a Bayesian focused crawler in our experiments...|$|E
40|$|Please {{follow these}} {{guidelines}} carefully {{in order to}} ensure that your book is published on schedule. Final manuscript •	 Use	double	line	spacing	and	 12 -point	font	size throughout. •	 Leave	a	margin	of	at	least	an	inch	(2. 5 	cm). •	 Number	pages	consecutively	through	the manuscript. •	 Do	not	justify	text	(i. e. 	leave	right	margin	ragged). •	 Do	not	embed	diagrams	or	scanned	images	within the text. Supply	each	artwork	as	a	separate	file. •	 Keep	a	back-up	copy	of	the	final	electronic	version. •	 Files	may	be	supplied	as	Word	documents	on	disk, via email,	 or	by	online	file	transfer. •	 Label	disks	clearly. Prelims The prelims	(pages	that	come	before	the	main	text) should include	any	or	all	of	the	following,	 in	this order:	 (1) 	 title	page;	 (2) 	 dedication;	 (3) 	 contents	list; (4) 	 list	of	contributors;	 (5) 	 foreword;	 (6) 	 preface;	 (7) acknowledgements;	 (8) 	 list	of	abbreviations. It is	important	to	include	all	the	necessary	pages	at	this stage because	<b>adding</b>	<b>pages</b>	later	on	may	be	expensive or even	impossible	to	do. Chapters •	 Each	chapter	should	start	on	a	new	page. •	 Only	capitalize	the	initial	letter	of	the	chapter	title, and the	initial	letter	of	the	chapter	subtitle. •	 Avoid	using	notes,	 but	if	they	are	necessary,	 please use endnotes	rather	than	footnotes. •	 Start	endnote	numbers	afresh	for	each	chapter. This can be	accomplished	by	using	the	‘section-break’ feature in	Word	and	formatting	the	notes	to	start numbering at	each	new	section. •	 Indent	each	new	paragraph	using	the	tab	key. •	 Avoid	cross-references	(e. g. 	‘see	p. 	 23 ’) 	 as	far	as possible –	 you	will	be	responsible	for	updating	them at proof	stage. Headings and sub-headings •	 Headings	must	be	clearly	differentiated	by	size	to show the	level	of	the	heading	or	sub-heading. •	 There	is	never	a	full	stop	after	a	heading. •	 Do	not	number	headings	and	sub-headings. •	 Only	capitalize	the	initial	letter	of	the	heading...|$|E
