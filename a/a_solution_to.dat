5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set.

5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values {{he has grown}} up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial {{and he could not}} make a living as a lawyer.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} namely, {{parallel}} moving method is proposed <b>to</b> find <b>an</b> optimal <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the fuzzy assignment problem considered in Lin and Wen [13]. We derive two theorems; one is related <b>to</b> <b>an</b> optimal <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the fuzzy assignment problem and another is related <b>to</b> find <b>an</b> improved <b>solution</b> {{from the current}} <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the fuzzy assignment problem. The parallel moving method provides <b>an</b> optimal <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the fuzzy assignment problem in less number of iterations than the labeling algorithm [13]. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the procedure of the proposed method...|$|R
5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> {{the problem}} {{known as the}} Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected {{to each other and}} the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
5|$|In December 1523, {{the council}} set a {{deadline}} of Pentecost in 1524 for <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> {{the elimination of}} the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Zurich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.|$|E

Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year.

5|$|Llywelyn {{responded by}} {{intervening}} {{with his own}} forces but outright conflict was prevented by the diplomatic efforts of Henry III. De Clare continued building work and in 1270 Llywelyn responded by attacking and burning the site, probably destroying the temporary defences and stores. De Clare began work again the following year, raising tensions and prompting Henry to send two bishops, Roger de Meyland and Godfrey Giffard, {{to take control of}} the site and arbitrate <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the dispute.|$|E
5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. <b>A</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E

The Israeli media declared that <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, {{said that this}} assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do nothing of the kind.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered.

5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies.
