30|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> {{dihydrate}} deposition disease (CPDD) {{is a rare}} arthropathy {{that includes}} a <b>calcium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> crystal deposition in the articular space [1]. CPDD has been termed as “pseudogout” because CPDD patients show gout-like symptoms and <b>calcium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> crystal deposition in the synovial fluid without sodium urate [2]. The etiology of CPDD is unknown. Recently, it has been proposed to result from a metabolic disorder related to phosphate metabolism [3]. The predominant site of occurrence of CPDD is the knee and wrist. Involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) has been rarely reported [4]. The involvement of CPDD in the TMJ shows various clinical symptoms, such as pre-auricular pain, swelling, and trismus due to the crystal mass [1]. The presence of the <b>calcium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> crystal deposit forms a tumor mass in the TMJ and leads to a limitation of condylar movement [5]. The common treatment of CPDD in the TMJ is surgical excision of the mass for the recovery of joint function. The recurrence of this tumor has been rarely reported [6].|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether acute attacks of uric <b>acid</b> and <b>calcium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> microcrystalline arthritis show a seasonal variation and, if so, to verify whether {{the distribution of}} single episodes shows a rhythmic circannual pattern. METHOD: All suspected cases of microcrystalline acute arthritis observed at the General Hospital of Ferrara during an 8 yr period (January 1990 -December 1997) were considered. Diagnosis was {{made on the basis}} of history, physical examination and analysis of synovial fluid by means of polarized light microscopy. Month and day of each event were categorized both into four 3 -month periods (by seasons) and 12 monthly intervals. Two different statistical methods have been utilized: chi(2) test for goodness of fit and partial Fourier series. RESULTS: During the period considered, 210 episodes of acute gout were observed [196 in males (93. 3 %) and 14 in females (6. 7 %) ] in 179 different subjects, and 179 episodes of acute pseudogout [58 in males (32. 4 %) and 121 in females (67. 6 %) ] in 165 different subjects. Gout attacks showed a higher frequency peak in spring [76 cases (36. 2 %), P< 0. 001]. Analysis of distribution of events by gender confirmed the clear spring pattern in males (36. 2 %), whereas the paucity of cases in females did not allow any valid statistical analysis. Pseudogout attacks showed a higher frequency peak in autumn [52 cases (29. 1 %) ], without reaching a statistically significant level either for the total sample or for subgroups divided by gender. Analysis of the seasonal distribution of gout or pseudogout events was significantly different (chi(2) 15. 7, P= 0. 001). Chronobiological evaluation by means of Fourier analysis showed a circannual pattern for gout attacks, both for the total sample (P= 0. 006) and the male subgroup (P= 0. 003), characterized by a peak in April and a trough in October. Again, as for pseudogout events, no seasonal variation was found, either for the total sample or subgroups by gender. CONCLUSIONS: The present study gives further confirmation that acute gout attacks exhibit a circannual distribution in their occurrence, being more frequent in April, whereas pseudogout attacks do not. Moreover, the seasonal distribution of gout and pseudogout acute events is significantly different...|$|R
