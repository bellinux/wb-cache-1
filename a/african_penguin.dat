25|$|<b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> {{casualties}} were significant following {{the sinking of}} the MV Apollo Sea and subsequent oil slick in 1994. 10,000 penguins were collected and cleaned, of which less than half survived.|$|E
25|$|The total {{population}} fell to 200,000 in 2000. In 2010, {{the number was}} estimated to be only at 55,000. If this decline is not halted, the <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> is expected to be extinct within 15 years.|$|E
25|$|The <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> is monogamous. It breeds in colonies, and pairs {{return to}} the same site each year. The <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> has an {{extended}} breeding season, with nesting usually peaking from March to May in South Africa, and November and December in Namibia. A clutch of two eggs are laid either in burrows dug in guano, or scrapes in the sand under boulders or bushes. Incubation is undertaken equally by both parents for about 40 days. At least one parent guards the chicks until about 30 days, whereafter the chick joins a crèche with other chicks, and both parents head out to sea to forage each day.|$|E
40|$|<b>African</b> <b>penguins</b> Spheniscus demersus closely {{resemble}} Magellanic S. magellanicus and Humboldt S. humboldti penguins and have similar breeding and feeding ecologies. Adults feed on pelagic schooling fish in continental shelf waters, but <b>African</b> <b>penguins</b> {{have been reported}} to have shallower dive angles and remain submerged longer for dives to a given depth than their congeners. The few data for <b>African</b> <b>penguins</b> were gathered using relatively large time-depth recorders. We measured diving behaviour of 36 <b>African</b> <b>penguins</b> provisioning small chicks at three colonies near Cape Town, South Africa. Maximum and mean dive depths were 69 m and 14 m respectively. Diving took place mainly during the day. Although dive depths differed between colonies, {{there were no significant differences}} in dive duration or maximum, median or mean depth. Total dive duration, descent time, bottom time, ascent time and dive angle all were strongly correlated with the maximum depth attained. The diving behaviour of <b>African</b> <b>penguins</b> is similar to that of its congeners. Diving performance probably was compromised by the data-logger used in the previous study. Comparative data from Humboldt penguins also indicate potential biases in an earlier study of this species. Care is needed when comparing the diving performance of penguins measured using different loggers...|$|R

25|$|The <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> {{was one of}} {{the many}} bird species {{originally}} described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where he grouped it with the wandering albatross {{on the basis of its}} bill and nostril morphology and gave it the name Diomedea demersa.|$|E
25|$|Roughly 4 million {{penguins}} {{existed at}} the beginning of the 19th century. Of the 1.5-million population of African penguins estimated in 1910, only some 10% remained at the end of the 20th century. <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> populations, which breed in Namibia and South Africa, have declined by 95 percent since pre-industrial times.|$|E
40|$|<b>African</b> <b>{{penguins}}</b> (Spheniscus demersus) carry {{a pattern}} of black spots on their chests that does not change from season to season during their adult life. Further, {{as far as we}} can tell, no two penguins have exactly the same pattern. We have developed a real-time system that can confidently locate <b>African</b> <b>penguins</b> whose chests are visible within video sequences or still images. An extraction of the chest spot pattern allows the generation of a unique biometrical identifier for each penguin. Using these identifiers an authentication of filmed or photographed <b>African</b> <b>penguins</b> against a population database can be performed.

25|$|The <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> is a banded penguin, {{placed in}} the genus Spheniscus. The other banded {{penguins}} are the African penguin's closest relatives, and are all found mainly in the Southern Hemisphere: the Humboldt penguin and Magellanic penguins found in southern South America, and the Galápagos penguin found in the Pacific Ocean near the equator. All are similar in shape, colour and behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Many {{organisations such as}} SANCCOB, Dyer Island Conservation Trust, SAMREC and Raggy Charters {{with the}} Penguin Research Fund in Port Elizabeth are working to halt {{the decline of the}} <b>African</b> <b>penguin.</b> Measures include {{monitoring}} population trends, hand-rearing and releasing abandoned chicks, establishing artificial nests and proclaiming marine reserves in which fishing is prohibited. Some colonies (e.g. on Dyer Island) are suspected to be under heavy pressure from predation by Cape fur seals and may benefit from the culling of individual problem animals which has been found effective (although requiring a large amount of management effort) in trials.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{collapse}} of a commercial pilchard fishery in 1960, <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> diet has shifted towards anchovies to some extent, although available pilchard biomass is still a notable determinant of penguin population development and breeding success. While a diet of anchovy appears to be generally sufficient, it is not ideal due to lower concentrations of fat and protein. Penguin diet changes throughout the year; as in many seabirds, it is believed that the interaction of diet choice and breeding success helps the penguins maintain their population size. Although parent penguins are protective of their hatchlings, they will not incur nutritional deficits themselves if prey is scarce and hunting requires greater time or energy commitment. This may lead to higher rates of brood loss under poor food conditions.|$|E

25|$|<b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> females remain fertile for 10 years. African {{penguins}} {{spend most}} of their lives at sea until it comes time for them to lay their eggs. Due to the high predation by larger mammals on the mainland, the penguins will go offshore to an island for protection from mammals and natural challenges. African penguins usually breed during the African winter when temperatures are lower. Ideally, eggs are incubated in a burrow dug into the guano layer, which provides a suitable temperature regulation, but the widespread human removal of guano deposits has rendered this type of nest unfeasible at most colonies. To compensate, penguins dig holes in the sand, breed in the open, or make use of nest boxes if such are provided. The penguins spend three weeks on land to provide for their offspring, after which chicks may be left alone during the day while the parents forage. The eggs are three to four times bigger than hen’s eggs. Parents usually feed hatchlings during dusk or dawn.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> is {{a member}} of the class Aves, and the order Sphenisciformes. It belongs to the penguin family Spheniscidae. It is {{classified}} as Spheniscus demersus.

2500|$|The <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> (Spheniscus demersus), {{also known}} as the jackass penguin and black-footed penguin is a species of penguin, {{confined}} to southern African waters. [...] It is also widely known as the [...] "jackass" [...] penguin for its donkey-like bray, although several related species of South American penguins produce the same sound. Like all extant penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Adults weigh on average [...] and are [...] tall. It has distinctive pink patches of skin above the eyes and a black facial mask; the body upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked with a black band. The pink gland above their eyes helps them to cope with changing temperatures. When the temperature gets hotter, the body of the <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> sends more blood to these glands to be cooled by the air surrounding it. This then causes the gland to turn a darker shade of pink.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, when {{foraging}} {{conditions were}} favorable, more male than female <b>African</b> <b>penguin</b> chicks were {{produced in the}} colony on Bird Island. [...] Male chicks also had higher growth rates and fledging mass, and therefore may have higher post-fledging survival than females. This coupled with higher adult female mortality in this species {{may result in a}} male biased adult sex ratio, indicating that conservation strategies focused on benefiting female African Penguins may be necessary.|$|E
