This may include dispersing their cremation ashes in a Tirtha region in a forest, mountain, river or sea to honor the wishes of the dead. The journey to a Tirtha, assert some Hindu texts, helps one overcome the sorrow of the loss.|$|E

25|$|As Rebbe, Schneerson {{would receive}} {{visitors}} for private meetings, known as yechidus, on Sunday and Thursday evenings. Those meetings would begin at 8pm and often continue until {{five or six}} in the morning and were open to everyone. Schneerson, who spoke several languages including English, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, Russian, German and Italian, would converse with people on all issues and offer his advice on both spiritual and mundane matters. Politicians and leaders from across the globe came to meet him, but Schneerson showed no preference to one person over another. His secretary once even declined to admit John F. Kennedy because Schneerson was already meeting 'ordinary' people who had requested appointments months previously. Those meetings were discontinued in 1982 when it became impossible to facilitate the large number of people. Meetings were then held only for those who had <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasion,</b> such as a bride and groom for their wedding or a boy and his family on the occasion of a bar mitzvah.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Wolowelsky {{wrote that}} {{although}} the Talmud appears to have an iron-clad rule that a Kohen should always be called to the Torah first and early practice gave precedence to Torah scholars, the Magen Avraham proposed the then-novel idea that individuals observing special occasions, such as a wedding or Bar Mitzvah, should have precedence. The Magen Avraham's view eventually prevailed, and subsequent commentators, including Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, developed his ideas {{to the point of}} creating various exceptions under which a Yisrael observing <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasion</b> could sometimes be called first even if a Kohen is present and refuses to waive the first aliyah. Observing {{that it is important to}} be able to tell whether a new approach can be considered a legitimate effort to develop the tradition or an illegitimate attempt to manipulate it, he suggested that changes in traditional concepts of respect involved in the idea of sometimes calling a woman to the Torah based on the Magen Avraham's ideas, may not necessarily be any more radical or threatening to the tradition, from a hashkfic (outlook or worldview) point of view, than the changes involved in developments leading to sometimes not calling a Kohen first.|$|E
25|$|Kyaiktiyo Pagoda or Golden Rock {{has become}} a popular pilgrimage and also tourist attraction. At {{the peak of the}} pilgrimage season, during November to March, an {{atmosphere}} of devotion is witnessed at Kyaikhtiyo pagoda. As the golden rock gleams in different shades from dawn to dusk (the sight at dawn and at sunset are unique), pilgrims' chants reverberate in the precincts of the shrine. Lighting of candles, meditation and offerings to the Buddha continues throughout the night. Men cross over a bridge across an abyss to affix golden leaves (square in shape) {{on the face of the}} Golden Rock, in deep veneration. However, women are not allowed to touch the rock so cannot cross the bridge. Pilgrims visit the pagoda, from all regions of Myanmar; a few foreign tourists also visit the pagoda. Even disabled persons who are staunch devotees of Buddha visit the pagoda, walking up the track on crutches. Old people, who can not climb, are carried on stretchers by porters to the Pagoda to offer prayers to Buddha. The Full Moon day of Tabaung in March, is <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasion</b> for pilgrims who visit the shrine. On this day, the platform of the pagoda is lighted with ninety thousand candles as reverential offering to the Lord Buddha. The devotees visiting the pagoda also offer fruits, food and incense to the Buddha.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} {{shows an}} aproned matriarch presenting a roasted turkey {{to a family}} of several generations, in Rockwell's idealistic presentation of family values. The patriarch looks on with fondness and approval {{from the head of}} the table, which is the central element of the painting. Its creased tablecloth shows that this is <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasion</b> for [...] "sharing what we have with those we love", according to Lennie Bennett. The table has a bowl of fruit, celery, pickles, and what appears to be cranberry sauce. There is a covered silver serving dish that would traditionally hold potatoes, according to Richard Halpern, but Bennett describes this as a covered casserole dish. The servings are less prominent than the presentation of white linen, white plates and water-filled glasses. The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.|$|E
500|$|Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) competes on the {{television}} game show Jeopardy!, which has temporarily moved taping to Boston for <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasion,</b> and amasses $22,000 {{by the end of}} the Double Jeopardy! round, more than twice the score of the second place contestant, theoretically ensuring a win. For the Final Jeopardy! clue of [...] "Archibald Leach, Bernard Schwartz and Lucille LeSueur" [...] in the category of [...] "Movies", Cliff responds incorrectly with [...] "Who are 3 people who've never been in my kitchen?" [...] Having wagered his entire score, Cliff loses all of his winnings. Cliff objects and argues, demanding that his answer be accepted. The show's host, Alex Trebek, later arrives at Cheers, tells Cliff that his response should have been accepted earlier, and announces his resignation as the host of Jeopardy!. However, Cliff convinces Trebek to remain as host by telling him how much the show and Trebek mean to him. After Cliff shares the news with others, Norm Peterson (George Wendt) praises Trebek for doing this just to make Cliff feel better. However, Trebek says that he did not realize that Cliff was at the bar and that meeting him had been a coincidence. Trebek says that Cliff scares him and that the story about quitting the show was a fabrication to placate him.|$|E
500|$|The {{international}} media reported that expectations {{for a successful}} summit were deliberately set low, because NATO leaders wanted to avoid a flare-up over the Iraq War. Therefore, they agreed to meet the modest goals the Alliance had already set for itself in trying to stabilize Afghanistan, and endorsed a tepid version of the Bush administration’s initiative to promote modernization and democracy in the Arab world. The newspaper further commented that the summit had [...] "a sort of [...] "Waiting for Godot" [...] quality about it — European leaders biding time, neither creating a crisis nor mending fences, {{in the hope that}} the American election in November will somehow spare them from the choice between having to deal with Bush and letting Iraq, and NATO, slide into further disarray." [...] Other analysis were even more critical: [...] "There have been NATO summits at which neither <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasion</b> was acknowledged nor decisions of particular relevance made. One example is the NATO summit in Istanbul in 2004, where the concluded measures hardly required a meeting of the heads of state and government, and the media presence was not justified by the agreed-upon resolutions." [...] US and other government officials however emphasized that the summit was significant in terms of the alliance's unprecedented outreach beyond its traditional North Atlantic focus and its aggressive emphasis on force planning to tackle new challenges worldwide.|$|E
