25|$|The {{people of}} Gilgit thought {{themselves}} to be ethnically different from the Kashmiris and resented being under Kashmir state rule. Gilgit {{was also one of}} the most backward areas of the Kashmir state. Major William Brown, the Maharaja's commander of the Gilgit Scouts, believed that the British handover of Gilgit to Kashmir was <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>mistake.</b> Brown recounts that when he met the scouts they indirectly made it clear how they despised and hated Kashmir and everything connected with it, how happy and content they had been under the British rule, and how they considered they had been betrayed by the British in the unconditional handing over of their country to Kashmir. Taking advantage of the situation the populace of Gilgit-Baltistan started revolting, the people of Ghizer were first to raise the flag of revolution, and gradually the masses of entire region stood up against the rule of Maharaja, again British played an important role in war of independence of Gilgit-Baltistan.|$|E

Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume, and explains that as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again, with Mr. Krabs admitting that he made <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>mistake</b> in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook, and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs reveals that he has installed a pay toilet that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.|$|E

Pension policy in Canada needs a fresh look. Canada’s defined-benefit pensions are in trouble: many are underfunded and exposed to the financial stresses of their sponsors. But some proposed fixes could make matters worse. NDP leader Jack Layton has talked in recent months about pension protection as a condition for keeping the Liberals in power.

In the 3rd minute, captain Bobby Boswell made <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> mental <b>mistake,</b> ignoring his goalie's pleas to allow a missed shot to bounce over the end line and under no pressure, Boswell played it out for a corner. Montreal converted on the set piece as Laurent Ciman ran onto the cross and volleyed to give the visitors the early lead. United was frustrated by the Impact defense, and ifnally surrendered a second goal {{late in the first}} half after a failed clearance gave the Impact a chance to run at the D.C. defense. Ignacio Piatti chipped the ball behind the back line and Matteo Mancosu ran on to the pass and slotted it in for a 2-0 lead. The lead grew to 3-0 when a Mancosu header beat Hamid. United began showing some life late, but two Birnbaum headers were cleared off the line. The result was put beyond any doubt when Mancosu and Piatti combined on a breakaway, with Piatti getting the goal. D.C. did manage to make the scoreline more respectable in the closing moments, as Neagle headed in a Nyarko cross for a goal in the 90th minute and Kemp scored unassisted in stoppage time with a screamer inside the post from 25 yards. Though the team showed the same late-game fire they had for the last 3 months, they had dug too deep a hole, and a 4-2 loss began the long off-season.|$|R
2500|$|Some law {{enforcement}} experts have also stated that, while they appreciate the site's mission, {{they do not}} agree with some of the operators' and volunteers' practices. In a December 2004 article in the New York Sun, Bradley Russ, the training director for the federal Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce (which has trained about 200 {{law enforcement}} agents nationwide) said that the tactics of Perverted-Justice sometimes run counter to the task force's standards. For instance, Russ said, by accepting child pornography from their [...] "busts" [...] to bolster a potential legal case, the volunteers are themselves in possession of unlawful images. He said federal authorities have begun considering whether to seize Perverted-Justice contributors' computers. [...] "It's a noble effort gone too far," [...] Russ told the newspaper.

2500|$|In February 1986, Chrétien whose {{relations}} with Turner were very poor, resigned {{his seat and}} left public life for a time. On February 27, 1986, Chrétien accompanied by his special executive assistant Jean Carle went to Turner's office to hand in his resignation. Turner forced Chrétien to wait a considerable period of time, during which Carle broke down in tears while Chrétien was visibly angry when Turner finally received them, making for a tense and barely civil meeting. Chrétien's resignation was largely motivated by his desire to better organise against Turner in the leadership review due {{in the fall of}} 1986. [...] Now working in the private sector again, Chrétien sat on the boards of several corporations, including the Power Corporation of Canada subsidiary Consolidated Bathurst, the Toronto-Dominion Bank, and the Brick Warehouse Corporation. Though Chrétien professed to be retired from politics, he told reporters within days of his retirement that: [...] "I will always be a politician. I love politics". Crucially, Chrétien did not disband the campaign organization that he founded in 1984 which suggested that his retirement was always intended to be temporary. In November 1986 when the Liberals held a leadership review, Chrétien attempted to organise against Turner, which led to a bruising battle between factions loyal to the two men. To topple Turner, Chrétien used Turner's penchant for heavy drinking to spread rumors that Turner was an alcoholic who was simply too drunk most of the time to effectively lead the Liberals to power. Chrétien formally claimed to be neutral {{on the question of the}} leadership review of Turner's management of the Liberal Party, but behind the scenes Chrétien lobbied as many Grit MPs and senators as possible for their support in bringing down Turner. Two Liberal leading power-brokers Marc Lalonde and Senator Keith Davey aka [...] "the Rainmaker" [...] both backed Turner in 1984, and in the aftermath of the 1984 election, Lalonde and Davey decided they had made <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>mistake</b> with Turner, which they were determined to rectify in 1986 by installing Chrétien as the leader best able to return the Liberals to power. The intense emotions stirred up by the 1986 leadership review were well-illustrated when Chrétien arrived to vote in the review, which led a [...] "chaotic melee" [...] on the convention floor at the Ottawa Convention Centre as pro-Turner and pro-Chrétien Liberals fought one another with their fists, and led to the police being called to end the violence. Turner won the leadership review by the mass signing up of immigrants as [...] "instant Liberals" [...] who provided a loyal bloc of delegates. It is quite likely that without the support of the [...] "instant Liberals", Turner would have lost the leadership review as many within the Liberal Party were deeply angry at him for losing the 1984 election. Many Liberals believed if only Chrétien had won the 1984 convention instead of Turner, that they would not have lost the 1984 election, or at least not as badly.|$|E
2500|$|In Mein Leben, it {{was argued}} that [...] "the deadly {{effect of the}} terms of the Treaty of Versailles" [...] {{justified}} rearmament in the 1930s, and used the [...] "sacrifice" [...] of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 to prove Germany was not pursuing aggressive policies. In Mein Leben, it was stated the Treaty of Versailles was [...] "completely unrealistic" [...] had it had [...] "shackled" [...] the German people by enforced [...] "...subjugation, including confiscation of national territory, occupation and military control, disregard for a people's sovereignty and corresponding humiliation...", and as such it was the Versailles treaty and the Versailles treaty alone that was responsible for the Third Reich. It was claimed that Raeder as [...] "apolitical" [...] officer who had just been doing his duty to the Fatherland borne no legal or moral guilt for anything that had happened under the Third Reich, and that the real responsibility for Nazi crimes rested with the governments of the United Kingdom, France and the United States who had imposed the Treaty of Versailles on Germany. It was claimed that the Allies had [...] "good reason" [...] to forbid using resistance against Versailles as a defense at Nuremberg because Nazi Germany was a [...] "direct consequence of the situation created by the victorious enemy powers in 1918". Along the same lines, it was charged that the Nuremberg trial of 1945–46 was meant by the Allies to cover up the [...] "decisive part" [...] played by the Versailles treaty in causing Nazi Germany and the war crimes committed by the Allies [...] "...by damning the whole German nation as an international outlaw" [...] and it was [...] "...the German people as a whole who were to be indicted as the sole criminals, guilty of waging a malevolent war of aggression". As such, the Nuremberg trials were presented as having nothing to do with justice, but instead were a political show trial. The Commando Order, the cash payments from the Konto 5 slush fund and Raeder's calls for war with the United States were not mentioned in Mein Leben. Instead it was claimed Raeder was opposed to war with the United States and had always worked to protect neutral shipping during the war with the committee having Raeder say: [...] "We had to consider neutrals to avoid any possible unfortunate incidents" [...] at sea. The invasion of Norway was presented as a measure to protect Norway's neutrality from Britain, and Raeder claimed to have been a [...] "political prisoner" [...] at Spandau. Finally, Raeder was presented as a victim of Hitler with the committee having Raeder say [...] "It was the tragedy of my life that our future took a completely different path". Dönitz also headed the call for the [...] "united front". Besides for the Z Plan, which Dönitz called <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>mistake,</b> Dönitz's memoirs presented Raeder in a favorable light, leading the British historian Peter Padfield to remark [...] "It is an open question which of the two Grand Admirals produced the more deliberately dishonest volume".|$|E

60|$|Not long ago, {{the world}} saw, with thoughtless joy {{which might have}} been very {{thoughtful}} joy, a real miracle not heretofore considered possible or conceivable in the world,--a Reforming Pope. A simple pious creature, a good country-priest, invested unexpectedly with the tiara, takes up the New Testament, declares that this henceforth shall be his rule of governing. No more finesse, chicanery, hypocrisy, or false or foul dealing of any kind: God's truth shall be spoken, God's justice shall be done, on the throne called of St. Peter: an honest Pope, Papa, or Father of Christendom, shall preside there. And such a throne of St. Peter; and such a Christendom, for an honest Papa to preside in! The European populations everywhere hailed the omen; with shouting and rejoicing leading articles and tar-barrels; thinking people listened with astonishment,--not with sorrow if they were faithful or wise; with awe rather as at the heralding of death, and with a joy as of victory beyond death! Something pious, grand and as if awful in that joy, revealing once more the Presence of a Divine Justice in this world. For, to such men it was very clear how this poor devoted Pope would prosper, with his New Testament in his band.
