5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWE Women's Championship between Candice Michelle and Beth Phoenix. Phoenix was in control early in the match. When Phoenix had Candice on her shoulders, Candice {{reversed}} the attack and pinned Phoenix with <b>a</b> <b>crucifix.</b> As a result, Michelle won the match, and retained the WWE Women's Championship.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main road, there are five avenues, each planted in its own species and named accordingly: oak, poplar, birch, lime, and sycamore. The tree-lined avenues give Barrhill a charming appearance. Wason had trees planted in an unusual pattern around the market square. Residents only noticed in 1975 when viewing an aerial photo that those trees form {{what appears to be}} the three circles of Trinity, with the two inner avenues {{possibly}} symbolising <b>a</b> <b>crucifix.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example <b>a</b> <b>crucifix,</b> rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E

5|$|Kostova did {{extensive}} research about Eastern Europe and Vlad Țepeș. She found a vampire-killing kit at the Mercer Museum, {{which included a}} pistol, silver bullets, <b>a</b> <b>crucifix,</b> a wooden stake, and powdered garlic. As she was writing, she posted maps of Eastern Europe in her office and constructed a chart to help her {{keep track of the}} book's timelines. Her husband, whom she had met in Bulgaria, assisted her with related geographical descriptions and diction. It took her ten years to finish the novel.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the leaders}} were of socialist or anarchist leanings, few of their {{supporters}} were revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the peasants who assembled into the Fasci were eager for social justice and convinced that a new world {{was about to be}} born. <b>A</b> <b>crucifix</b> hung beside the red flag in {{many of the}}ir meeting-places, and portraits of the King beside those of the revolutionaries Garibaldi, Mazzini and Marx. Cheers for the King were often heard in their marches that almost resembled quasi-religious processions. Many of the Fasci were part of the Italian Workers' Party (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani, the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party) that had been founded at a conference in Genoa on August 14, 1892.|$|E
5|$|Beth Phoenix {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for the Women's Title after winning a Diva battle royal at SummerSlam. At the Unforgiven pay-per-view, however, Candice successfully retained her title in their match by countering one of Phoenix's moves with <b>a</b> <b>crucifix</b> pin. Their feud continued when Phoenix pinned Candice during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24. At No Mercy on October 7, Candice dropped the title to Phoenix, ending her reign as Women's Champion. On October 22, Candice legitimately cracked her clavicle during her rematch for the Women's Title against Phoenix in a {{two out of three}} falls match; Phoenix ran into the ropes, causing Candice to fall face-first off of the turnbuckle onto her face, neck, and shoulders necessitating a rushed finish and putting her out of action for 14 weeks.|$|E

5|$|Father John Buerlein (Jeremy Sisto) is the mild-mannered Catholic {{priest of}} a small parish in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the {{profession}} and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears <b>a</b> <b>crucifix</b> and is an Aries, which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a rosary instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (Brian Baumgartner), who advises him not to become too personally involved.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson's boasting and exaggerated claims {{concerning}} his war experiences, {{together with his}} depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the USA and Britain. Roger Fry of the Bloomsbury Group was a particularly virulent critic. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind observed in his catalogue introduction to an exhibition of Nevinson's recent work: 'It is something, {{at the age of}} thirty one, to be among the most discussed, most successful, most promising, most admired and most hated British artists.' In September 1920, Nevinson designed a poster for a production, by Viola Tree, of The Unknown by Somerset Maughan which showed bombs exploding around <b>a</b> <b>crucifix.</b> The image was deemed to be offensive and was banned from display on the London Underground. Nevinson distributed the poster outside the theatre and gained a great deal of press coverage in the process.|$|E
5|$|On August 4, 2006, WWE {{announced}} that Hardy had re-signed with the company. In the following weeks, vignettes aired hyping his {{return on the}} August 21 episode of Raw. On {{the day of his}} return, Hardy received a push and defeated then-WWE Champion Edge by disqualification when Lita pulled Edge out of the ring. After failing to capture the Intercontinental Championship from Johnny Nitro over the next few weeks, including at Unforgiven, Hardy finally defeated Nitro to win his second Intercontinental Championship on the October 2 episode of Raw. On the November 6 episode of Raw, Hardy lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Nitro, after Nitro hit him with the Intercontinental Championship title belt. One week later, Hardy regained it on the November 13 episode of Raw, with <b>a</b> <b>crucifix</b> pin. This marked Hardy's third reign as Intercontinental Champion.|$|E

5|$|On {{the left}} side of the altar are also two retablos. The larger altar, which is a twin of the altar {{opposite}} it, houses an image of a unidentified saint on the topmost level, presumably Michael the Archangel, and the crucified Christ (originally Madonna and Child) in the center, Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left, and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches. The original images on the lowest level have been replaced. The smaller retablo, also of the same style, houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus, and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level, respectively. In the sacristy is another retablo, with <b>a</b> <b>crucifix</b> in its central niche. On the doorframes of the sacristy are two bas-reliefs depicting Saint Ignatius and the first Jesuits before Mary and the child Jesus and of St. Ignatius holding a book (in stucco).|$|E
5|$|The main {{narrative}} for Over the Edge {{continued the}} events that unfolded at , WWF's previous pay-per-view event, held on April 25, 1999. There, The Undertaker abducted Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of chairman Vince McMahon. The Undertaker's price for Stephanie's return was control over the wrestling organization. His plans were thwarted, however, by the WWF Champion, Steve Austin, who rescued Stephanie and denied The Undertaker his ransom. This plot development set up a feud between the two wrestlers, which would be settled in a standard singles match for the Championship at Over the Edge, in which both Vince and his son Shane, who had aligned himself with The Undertaker, would serve as the guest referee. Originally Shane had named himself the sole referee of the match, but WWF commissioner Shawn Michaels made Vince the co-referee in order {{to level the playing}} field. WWF further built up the rivalry between The Undertaker and Austin by having them attack each other on WWF programming, before their showdown. On May 3, 1999, The Undertaker threw Austin off the stage, and two weeks later, the WWF Champion handcuffed his title's challenger to <b>a</b> <b>crucifix,</b> which was raised above the ring.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was a Straight Edge Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could be cleaned up. While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him on the floor to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform <b>a</b> <b>crucifix</b> cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E

5|$|On the August 1 {{episode of}} Raw, Vince McMahon officially {{announced}} Hardy's return to WWE, adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam. Hardy made his in-ring return, defeating Snitsky on the August 8 Raw. Seconds after the victory, Hardy {{was attacked by}} Edge, and as he was being carried backstage, Matt counterattacked Edge in the locker room. On August 21 at SummerSlam, their match came to a premature end when Edge dropped Hardy onto {{the top of a}} ring post, causing him to bleed heavily. The referee ended the match on the grounds that Hardy could not continue, and Edge was declared the winner. After SummerSlam, the two continued fighting on Raw, including a Street Fight that resulted in Hardy performing a Side Effect on Edge off the entrance stage and into electrical equipment below. At Unforgiven, Edge faced Hardy in a steel cage match. Hardy caught an interfering Lita with the Twist of Fate and won the match with a leg-drop {{off the top of the}} cage. Hardy and Edge faced each other at WWE Homecoming in a Loser Leaves Raw ladder match. Edge's briefcase holding his Money in the Bank Contract for his WWE Championship opportunity was suspended above the ring. The winner of the match received the contract and the loser was forced to leave Raw. After a contentious match, Edge tied Hardy's arms in the ropes, and Lita trapped Hardy in <b>a</b> <b>crucifix</b> hold, leaving Hardy only able to watch Edge win. When the match ended, Edge and Lita gloated over the victory, but Hardy took it in stride and left the arena.|$|E
