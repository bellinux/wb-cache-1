5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E

50|$|Photobacterium are {{primarily}} marine organisms (hence {{the use of}} sodium for growth). They may be free-living or found as colonies associated with certain species of fish. These organisms do not contain any pigmentation and therefore will appear white or colorless. When {{there is a high}} density of cells forming a colony, they will exhibit fluorescence. However, the fluorescence is based on the accumulation of autoinducers which is proportional to cell density and therefore free-living photobacterium will not fluoresce. Their association with fish may be: symbiotic growth within fish for the formation of light organs, as a neutral entity on the surface or within the intestines of fish, as decomposers of dead fish, or as an <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

50|$|Amyloodinium ocellatum, {{also known}} as marine velvet, is a species of {{microbial}} parasitic dinoflagellates of the Amyloodinium genus. Currently, A. ocellatum {{has been the only}} species discovered in the Amyloodinium genus and has been found in various aquatic regions around the world in both tropical and temperate habitats. A. ocellatum is a temperature dependent microbe which can live in both salt and freshwater. A. ocellatum is also an obligate parasitic microbe, depending on marine animals to survive and complete their life cycles. The life cycle of A. ocellatum follows a parasitic growth model, maturing from a trophont to a tomont, before growing into a dinospore. First analyzed in the 1930s, A. ocellatum has since been identified as a major <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> among marine life.|$|E
50|$|Other {{times there}} is not a single cause for a disease, but instead a chain of {{causation}} from an initial trigger to the development of the clinical disease. An etiological <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> may require an independent co-factor, and be subject to a promoter (increases expression) to cause disease. An example of all the above, which was recognized late, is that peptic ulcer disease may be induced by stress, requires the presence of acid secretion in the stomach, and has primary etiology in Helicobacter pylori infection. Many chronic diseases of unknown cause may be studied in this framework to explain multiple epidemiological associations or risk factors which may or may not be causally related, and to seek the actual etiology.|$|E

It may be found on oilier areas of the body including the neck and trunk. Besides M. sympodialis, several species of Malassezia have been identified on individuals with the disorder including, M. globosa, M. slooffiae and several others. Some believe that M. globosa is responsible for the disease as it has been found in higher numbers, but this has not yet been confirmed. Confirmation of the <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> involves microscopic examination of skin scrapings from the infected individuals for the presence of thick-walled yeast cells intermixed with broad hyphae. Ointments containing fungicidal ingredients such as selenium {{can be applied to the}} affected area. Oral medications are also used in some cases.|$|E

50|$|Banana Freckle is {{a disease}} caused by the fungus Guignardia musae (telomorph) or Phyllosticta musarum (anamorph). Generally, the causal <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> is {{referred}} to as Guignardia-Phyllosticta sp. There are several different strains of the fungus that exist to infect different banana varieties around the globe. Symptoms include yellowing of the tissue and formation of small dark brown spots on the leaves and fruit. Within the spots, conidia or pycnidia can be found. Banana Freckle is easily propagated and spread from plant to plant by rain splash and movement of infected tissue or fruit. Management of the disease consists of cutting out infected leaves, the paper bag method, fungicide application, and proper sanitation techniques. This devastating disease is extremely relevant for the major banana exporting countries of the world. In the absence of chemical control, there is about a 78% yield loss. Banana Freckle disease needs to be carefully monitored in order to prevent further spread of the disease.|$|E

40|$|Background & Aim: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is an {{endemic disease}} {{in some parts}} of Iran. Leishmania infantum is the <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> in studied areas. The aim {{of the present study was}} the {{characterization}} of visceral leishmaniasis in reservoir host (dogs) and determination of agent by molecular method in Boyer-Ahmad district, Iran Methods: In this study 15 infected dogs with symptoms of canine visceral leishmaniasis were selected from 5 VL endemic villages of Boyer-Ahmad district in 2010. All cases were tested by DAT for evaluation of anti leishmanial antibodies. After necropsy, parasitological study was conducted by use of impression smear of liver and spleen. Nested PCR was use to detect the parasite DNA in the liver and spleen tissues. Results: From fifteen cases, fourteen dogs had antibody titer above of 1 : 320 while one of the cases was seronegative. Leishmania amastigotes was seen in 13 smears of liver and spleen (13 cases). The <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> in 14 dogs determined as Leishmania infantum by nested PCR.
