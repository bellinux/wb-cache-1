5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
5|$|In June 1399, Louis, Duke of Orléans, {{gained control}} of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The policy of {{rapprochement}} with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, {{and for this reason}} he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England. With a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Men {{from all over the country}} soon rallied around the duke. Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> and declined to interfere. The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to Conwy, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the popular}} story, Godiva took pity {{on the people of}} Coventry, who were {{suffering}} grievously under her husband's oppressive taxation. She appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to remit the tolls. At last, weary of her entreaties, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and ride through the streets of the town. Godiva took him <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> and, after issuing a proclamation that all persons should keep within doors and shut their windows, she rode through the town, clothed only in her long hair. In the end, Godiva's husband keeps his word and abolishes the onerous taxes. However, known facts do not corroborate the legend.|$|E

500|$|Ready to Die {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. In his review for Rolling Stone, Cheo H. Cocker stated [...] "Ready to Die {{is the strongest}} solo rap debut since Ice Cube's Amerikkka's Most Wanted. From the breathtakingly visual moments of his birth to his Cobainesque end in [...] "Suicidal Thoughts," [...] B.I.G. proves a captivating listen. It's difficult {{to get him out}} of your head once you sample what he has to offer". Robert Christgau from The Village Voice commented [...] "His sex raps are erotic, his jokes are funny, and his music makes the thug life sound scary rather than luxuriously laid back. When he considers suicide, I not only take him <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> I actively hope he finds another way". The New York Times wrote [...] "Though drug dealing carries tremendous heroic value with some young urban dwellers, he sacrifices the figure's romantic potential. His raps acknowledge both the excitement of drug dealing and the stress caused by the threat from other dealers, robbers, the police and parents, sometimes one's own. In presenting the downside of that life, Ready to Die offers perhaps the most balanced and honest portrait of the dealer's life of any in hip-hop".|$|E
500|$|The {{gigantic}} {{proportions of}} A. fragillimus have been debated by paleontologists. Carpenter {{has argued that}} {{there is every reason}} to take Cope <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> noting that the paleontologist's reputation was at stake. The discovery took place during the Bone Wars, and Cope's rival Marsh, who was [...] "ever ready to humiliate" [...] Cope, never called the claims into question. Marsh was known to have employed spies to monitor Cope's discoveries, and may have even had confirmation of the enormous size of the Amphicoelias fragillimus bones. Paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and C.C. Mook in 1921, as well as John S. McIntosh in 1998, also accepted Cope's data without question in published reviews. Other paleontologists have been more critical. In an analysis of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the publication and interpretation of A. fragillimus, Woodruff and Foster (2015) concluded that its size has been over-estimated and that modern palaeontologists were accepting Cope's interpretation without due scepticism. They note that no comparably gigantic sauropod fossils have been discovered in the Morrison Formation or elsewhere, that 19th century palaeontologists - including Cope himself - paid no attention to the size of A. fragillimus (even when it may have substantiated Cope's Rule of size increase in animal lineages over time), and that typographical errors in his measurements - such as reporting vertebral measurements in meters rather than millimeters - undermine their reliability. They concluded that the super-gigantic A. fragillimus is a 'highly unlikely' creature based on unquestioning interpretation of Cope's report.|$|E

2500|$|A journalist, who {{had come}} to report another event that had been {{cancelled}} had wandered into the room, and wrote a brief report. This report was picked up by Die Suidwester, the National Party newspaper, and made front-page news, leading to a week of Anglican-bashing by that newspaper. Following that the Commissioner-General for Ovamboland, Jannie de Wet, said in a radio broadcast on Radio Ovambo that the contract labour system was not a form of slavery, because the workers could go home whenever they liked. A group in Walvis Bay, after hearing the broadcast, wrote to other contract workers all over the south of Namibia, suggesting that they should take [...] "the boer Jannie de Wet" [...] <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> and all go home. The result was a highly successful contract workers strike, which signified a new mood of boldness following the decision of the World Court.|$|E
2500|$|There is an {{unsettled}} {{debate about}} whether Kelly was {{the model for the}} title character in Ernest Lawrence Thayer's 1888 poem [...] "Casey at the Bat." [...] Thayer, as a baseball reporter for the San Francisco Examiner, had seen Kelly play after the 1887 season, when he was on a playing tour to San Francisco. [...] A [...] "best guess" [...] is to take Thayer <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> that he chose the name [...] "Casey" [...] after a non-player of Irish ancestry he once knew. [...] However, open to debate is who, if anyone, he modeled Casey's baseball situations after. Arguably the best big league candidate is Kelly, the most colorful, top player of the day of Irish ancestry. [...] Thayer, in a 1905 letter, singles out Kelly as showing [...] "impudence" [...] in claiming to have written the poem. If he still felt offended, Thayer may have steered later comments away from connecting Kelly to it. Cap Anson 2, the definitive biography of Kelly, states that it did not find Kelly claiming to have been the poem's author.|$|E

2500|$|Kleist, his units {{reinforced}} by Waffen-SS General Sepp Dietrich's [...] 1st SS Division (the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler), attacked on 17 November, and captured Rostov on the 21st. But the Soviets had {{had time to}} prepare, and launched a counter-offensive on the 25th. On the 28th Rundstedt authorised Kleist to withdraw from Rostov and establish a front on the Mius, 70km to the west. When Hitler heard of this the next day, he ordered that Rostov should be held, although it had in fact already been evacuated. Rundstedt replied by insisting on his decision, and adding: [...] "Should confidence in my leadership no longer exist, I beg to request someone be substituted who enjoys the necessary confidence of the Supreme Command." [...] Hitler took Rundstedt <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> and on 1 December he dismissed him, replacing him with Reichenau. The new commander saw at once that Rundstedt was right, and succeeded in persuading Hitler, via Halder, to authorise the withdrawal. This was the first significant defeat the German Army suffered in World War II, and Rundstedt was the first senior commander to be dismissed.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the music}} {{historian}} Daniel Heartz, there has been considerable controversy concerning Gluck's native language. Gluck's protégé in Vienna, the Italian-born Antonio Salieri, says in his memoirs (translated into German by Ignaz von Mosel), that [...] "Gluck, whose native tongue was Czech, expressed himself in German only with effort, and still more so in French and Italian...." [...] Gluck's first biographer, Anton Schmid, accepted that Gluck spoke Czech, but thought Salieri incorrect, proposing instead that Gluck learned Czech in Prague. Heartz writes: [...] "More devious manoeuvres have been attempted by Gluck's German biographers of this [...] century, while the French ones have, without exception, taken Salieri <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word.</b> Arend objected that not a single letter written in Czech can be found, to which Jacques-Gabriel Prod’homme countered that no letters written by Liszt in Hungarian were known either, but does this make him a German?" [...] Hans Joachim Moser wanted a lyric work in Czech as proof. In fact, the music theorist Larent Garcin, writing in 1770 (published 1772) before Gluck arrived in Paris, included Gluck in a list of several composers of Czech opéras-comiques (although such a work by Gluck {{has yet to be}} documented).|$|E
2500|$|By late 1940, the Home Guard had amassed 847,000 rifles, 47,000 {{shotguns}} and 49,000 {{machine guns}} of various kinds. With more than 1,682,000 volunteers, {{this meant that}} 739,000 men were unarmed. There was little improvement in June 1941 when Churchill wrote to the War Office saying that [...] "every man must have a weapon of some sort, be it only a mace or a pike". The civil servants took Churchill <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> and ordered 250,000 pikes from the Ministry of Aircraft Production, each consisting of a long steel tube with an obsolete bayonet welded to the end. When {{the first of these}} reached the Home Guard, there was uproar and it is thought that none were actually issued. Captain Godfrey Nicholson MP, spoke for the Home Guard when he said in the House of Commons that the provision of pikes, [...] "if not meant as a joke, was an insult". Lord Croft, the Under-Secretary of State for War, could have blamed the fiasco on Churchill but defended the decision, saying that the pike was [...] "a most effective and silent weapon"; his name was attached to the affair thereafter. The armaments shortage was solved when the first mass-produced Sten submachine guns entered service early in 1942.|$|E
