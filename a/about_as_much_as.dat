25|$|Economic {{success was}} short-lived. Following a lumbering {{recovery}} during 1933 to 1945, from 1946 to 1953 Argentina gained benefits from Perón's five-year plan. The GDP expanded by over a fourth during that brief boom, <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> it had {{during the previous}} decade. Using roughly half the US$1.7billion in reserves inherited from wartime surpluses for nationalizations, economic development agencies devoted {{most of the other}} half to finance both public and private investments; the roughly 70% jump in domestic fixed investment was accounted for mostly by industrial growth in the private sector. All this much-needed activity exposed an intrinsic weakness in the plan: it subsidized growth which, in the short term, led to a wave of imports of the capital goods that local industry could not supply. Whereas the end of World War II had allowed Argentine exports to rise from US$700million to US$1.6billion, Perón's changes led to skyrocketing imports (from US$300million to US$1.6billion), and erased the surplus by 1948.|$|E

25|$|Just like data {{on water}} availability, {{publicly}} available data on water use in Greater Damascus are contradictory and outdated. In 2001 water use {{has been estimated}} at between 1,350 and 1,700 million cubic metres per year. This includes water use for irrigation that was estimated at between 920 and more than 1,200 million cubic metres per year, accounting for 68% and 76% of total water use in the basin. Domestic water use was estimated at between 300 and 390 million cubic metres per year. The lower bound of this estimate is probably more realistic and is equivalent {{to an average of}} about 220 liter/capita/day before distribution losses for a population connected to the network of about 3.75 million. Taking into account non-revenue water of about 50%, this corresponds to about 110 liter/capita/day which is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> domestic water use in Germany. However, during summer water availability and thus water use drop significantly. For example, in the summer of 2001 the city received 317,000 cubic meter per day, corresponding to about 85 liter/capita/day before losses and 43 liter/capita/day after losses.|$|E
500|$|In particular, the console's {{status as}} an add-on and poor timing after the {{announcement}} of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. [...] Allgame notes that [...] "very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales." [...] GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. [...] According to reviewer Blake Snow, [...] "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if {{you were one of the}} unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a small dog." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Reparaz noted that [...] "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons." [...] Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that [...] "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." [...] Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that [...] "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience." ...|$|E

It just wasn't that funny." [...] Although he said the twist of making Longshaft the traitor was good, he said the episode ends abruptly, the resolution with Kröd and Aneka's relationship was unsatisfying and that practically all the jokes were unfunny, {{with the exception of}} Grimshank's dying words to Kröd: [...] "I die unconvinced." [...] Fowler was particularly critical of the scene in which Kröd and his fellow warriors became dogs.|$|E

2500|$|Until {{the passage}} of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990, {{television}} captioning was performed by a set-top box manufactured by Sanyo Electric and marketed by the National Captioning Institute (NCI). (At that time a set-top decoder cost <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a TV set itself, approximately $200.) Through discussions with the manufacturer it was established that the appropriate circuitry integrated into the television set would be less expensive than the stand-alone box, and Ronald May, then a Sanyo employee, provided the expert witness testimony on behalf of Sanyo and Gallaudet University in support of {{the passage of}} the bill. On January 23, 1991, the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990 was passed by Congress. [...] This Act gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) power to enact rules on the implementation of Closed Captioning. This Act required all analog television receivers with screens of at least 13inches or greater, either sold or manufactured, {{to have the ability to}} display closed captioning by July 1, 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is aged {{for about}} 25 months {{exclusively}} in American oak barrels. Silver Oak’s Alexander Valley wines are aged in both new and once-used American oak barrels and spend an additional 14 months in bottle before release. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon spends about 20 months in bottle after barrel. In {{answer to the}} question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I like tough steak." [...] The company formed a partnership with Missouri-based barrel producer A Cooperage in 2000 to have a steady supply of American oak barrels made to Silver Oak’s specifications.

They {{made the decision to}} produce only Cabernet Sauvignon and to attempt to produce the finest in the world, to age the wine exclusively in American oak barrels. Meyer said of the reason for deciding to concentrate on one wine, [...] "it was kind of a reaction to my days at Christian Brothers, where we made so many wines it was hard to do them all right, {{and it was kind of}} in keeping with what I thought — that Cabernets were what Napa and Sonoma did best, so why not devote our attention to that. This is a pretty common concept in France." [...] According to noted wine critic Robert Parker, Meyer always believed in harvesting ripe, physiologically mature fruit. In answer to the question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees.

Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of Stellar Wind, a 2001–2007 NSA warrantless surveillance program, but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time. Fiorina [...] "acknowledged she complied with Hayden's request, redirecting trucks of HP computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the Washington Beltway, where they were escorted by NSA security" [...] to the agency's Fort Meade headquarters.
