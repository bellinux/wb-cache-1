5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms in that they <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began in 1617 or 1618 {{during the reign of}} Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets carved in the form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> the layout of a Persian paradise garden, and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre.|$|E

5|$|Paper Mario {{combines}} traditional role-playing game (RPG) elements with {{concepts and}} features from the Mario series.

Many of the game's puzzles and boundaries <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> the abilities of Mario's partners, who each have a specialised skill required for progression in the game. The player accumulates partners as they advance into different locations; only one partner can accompany Mario in the overworld, although the player can interchange them at any time.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E

The items, spells and equipment available to the player <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> those in the original game, and although a large number have been omitted along with optional characters and some side quests, the original story was reproduced in very minute detail. The game was received with mixed reception, cited as an impressive achievement {{but at the same}} time criticized for its difficulty and choice of a target console.|$|E

He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to dispel preconceived notions about ninja popularized by other manga and to bring an original take to the presentation of ninja in manga. The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games. The hand seals <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> the characters of the Chinese zodiac, which is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and Kishimoto used them specifically to draw upon that tradition.|$|E

5|$|Within the Heathen {{community}} of the United States, gender roles <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> perceived ideals and norms found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources. Among male American Heathens there is a trend toward hypermasculinized behaviour, while a gendered division of labor—in which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children—is also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. Due to its focus on traditional attitudes to sex and gender—values perceived as socially conservative in Western nations—it {{has been argued that}} American Heathenry's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as Wicca.|$|E
