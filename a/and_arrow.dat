5|$|During the Woodland period, many American Indians in Iowa shifted {{away from}} hunting and {{gathering}} and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important. Ceramics, the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow,</b> burial mounds, and evidence {{of political and social}} hierarchy became common at Woodland sites in Iowa.|$|E
5|$|People {{have used}} {{resources}} on {{and around the}} Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites.|$|E

The image still shows the woman with a large bow, but further details by the reviewers state that the boy used a toy bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> to make the shot.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow.</b> The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} {{in what is now}} Pennsylvania since at least 10,000 BC. The first {{settlers}} were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artefacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000BC and 1500AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows <b>and</b> <b>arrow,</b> and ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Little {{remains of}} the eastern walls, but in the {{north-east}} corner several towers still remain largely intact, including Polymond tower, a powerful drum tower largely reconstructed during the Victorian period. Further west is the Bargate; this was originally a simple archway but was expanded with drum towers <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> slits in the early 14th century, and then expanded again in the early 15th century with battlements and parapets, before being heavily restored in the 19th century. The Bargate remains an elaborate building, taking military symbolism and combining it with rich civic heraldry and decoration above the gateway.|$|E

5000|$|Some in {{the diamond}} {{industry}} disagree on which diamonds should receive the [...] "Hearts and Arrows" [...] label. Because {{there used to}} be no industry standard, one person or company may say a diamond is a Hearts <b>and</b> <b>Arrows</b> diamond while another may say it is not. In the industry, the term [...] "super ideal" [...] is a common term that is coined and used to describe diamonds displaying perfect optical symmetry. Most diamonds with an overall cut graded by GIA as [...] "Excellent" [...] (with Excellent symmetry as well) or American Gem Society as [...] "0" [...] (or [...] "Ideal") will have some sort of hearts <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> pattern when seen through a viewer, although the pattern may not be perfect. Many within the diamond industry believe the Hearts <b>and</b> <b>Arrows</b> pattern should be graded, and only those with the top grade should be called Hearts <b>and</b> <b>Arrows.</b> Those people believe that the mere presence of a Hearts <b>and</b> <b>Arrows</b> pattern is not sufficient to be considered a Hearts <b>and</b> <b>Arrows</b> diamond; the pattern must be perfect to fit within certain guidelines.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that after the}} collapse of the Hopewell, Indiana had a low population until the rise of the Fort Ancient and Mississippian culture around 900 AD. The Ohio River Valley was densely populated by the Mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 AD. Their settlements, like those of the Hopewell, were known for their ceremonial earthwork mounds. Some of these remain visible at locations near the Ohio River. The Mississippian mounds were constructed on a grander scale than the mounds built by the Hopewell. The agrarian Mississippian culture was the first to grow maize in the region. The people also developed the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> and copper working during this time period.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 and 1896 {{the ruins}} at Abydos, Tukh, Hierakonpolis and Gebelein were excavated. In 1892 Jacques de Morgan, Director of Antiquities in Egypt, proved that pottery found at Abydos and Nakadah pre-dated the dynastic period, {{stimulating}} interest by many European Archaeologists. As each excavation was completed, local Egyptian residents {{would continue to}} search the sites for remains. In 1895 E. A. Wallis Budge, {{on behalf of the}} British Museum, procured inscribed coffins and funerary furniture from the 12th Dynasty tombs at Al-Barshah by working with the Egyptian Service of Antiquities. Budge started purchasing predynastic finds from the locals including bowls, spear <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> heads, carved flint and bone figures and partial human remains (described as chiefly bones without skin or flesh remaining).|$|E
5|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, {{was seen}} as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the {{southern}} stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> depiction with that of a dog.|$|E

Writings in Tamil-Brahmi script {{have been found in}} many locations in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and also in Egypt and Thailand. mostly recording grants made by the kings and chieftains. References are also made to other aspects of the Sangam society. Coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of the coins carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty on their reverse, such as the bow <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> of the Cheras; some of them contain portraits and written legends helping numismatists assign them to a certain period.|$|E

Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573–621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621. In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626. Shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his favor and Li Shimin ascended the throne. He is conventionally known by his temple name Taizong.|$|E
