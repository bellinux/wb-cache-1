5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E
25|$|He {{lived in}} Châtres {{on the road}} to Orléans as a hermit for {{fourteen}} years, near a church dedicated to Saint Germain. His reputation attracted students to him, which distracted him from his hermitage. His devotion to Saint Peter the Apostle prompted <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a journey to Rome, accompanied by some of the disciples. While in Rome, Pope Gregory II admonished him to use his talents to evangelize Bavaria. Corbinian, who may already have been a bishop or who was so consecrated by Gregory, was sent to minister to Grimoald, the Frankish Duke of Bavaria. Corbinian probably arrived in Bavaria in 724.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat in}} the third test {{marked the end of}} Michael Vaughan's time as captain. Vaughan had been captain of the Test team before Moores had taken over, and his {{resignation}} left Moores with <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> about who succeeded him. Although it was Collingwood who had previously succeeded Vaughan as captain as the ODI Team, Kevin Pietersen was asked to step in as Captain for the final match of the series. Pietersen had been in good form with the bat and was seen by many as the obvious choice. England {{went on to win the}} final Test by 6 wickets, with Pietersen making a hundred on his first game as captain.|$|E

25|$|The last {{phase is}} the post-deployment phase. After 18-months of {{training}} and deployment, the platoon is granted 30-days of military leave. Once a Force Recon operator has finished deployment, they have <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> What makes Force Recon unique from Division Recon, and the other SOFs, is the career style that is being placed in the Force Recon company structure. They can choose {{to stay with the}} Force Recon Company and continue their assignment with the MEU, recycling its loop cycle; or they can get release from the FORECON company and go back to their original assignment, whether it being administration, motor transport, or infantry. However, on average, approximately 50% of the platoon will leave, their time in Force having expired.|$|E
25|$|The {{neutrality}} of the United States {{was tested}} during the Napoleonic Wars. After the Chesapeake–Leopard affair, President Thomas Jefferson {{was faced with}} <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> regarding the situation at hand. In the end, he chose an economic option: the Embargo Act of 1807. Jefferson essentially closed all the ports overnight, putting a damper on the seaport town of Salem. The embargo of 1807 was the starting point {{on the path to}} the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Both Great Britain and France imposed trade restrictions in order to weaken each other's economies. This also had the effect of disrupting American trade and testing the United States' neutrality. As time went on, harassment of American ships by the British Navy increased. This included impressment and seizures of American men and goods.|$|E
25|$|Mismanagement and {{corruption}} resulted in major economic problems. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the economy was deteriorating because of a combination of overspending on a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the regime, overspending to purchase privately owned sugar mills and electricity plants, and <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a major investment in state sugar production that proved economically unsuccessful. In 1956, Trujillo's agents in New York murdered Jesús María de Galíndez, a Basque exile who had worked for Trujillo but who later denounced the Trujillo regime and caused public opinion in the United States to turn against Trujillo. In August 1960, the Organization of American States (OAS) imposed diplomatic sanctions against the Dominican Republic as a result of Trujillo's complicity in an attempt to assassinate President Rómulo Betancourt of Venezuela.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{missing out}} on playing in UEFA Euro 2004, Evra endured a tumultuous summer in which the player was linked with moves with Manchester United in England, and Juventus and Internazionale in Italy. Despite offers, Evra {{remained}} at Monaco. On 24 September 2004, he signed a one-year contract extension with the club until 2008. In the season, Evra was a regular appearing in a career-high 52 matches scoring one goal and assisting on seven as Monaco reached the semi-finals in both the Coupe de la Ligue and Coupe de France. Evra scored his only goal of the season on 8 January 2005 in the team's round of 64 Coupe de France match against amateur club AC Seyssinet-Pariset. He netted the opener in a 7–0 win. In the Champions League, Monaco reached the first knockout round, where they suffered defeat to PSV 3–0 on aggregate. Evra appeared in nine of the ten matches the team contested in the competition. In April 2005, Evra confirmed {{he was interested in}} departing the club, stating, [...] "I will have <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{for the rest of my}} career... If attracted clubs show concrete interest, I will think about it seriously." [...] Despite several clubs declaring interest in Evra, Deschamps declared he would not be sold. At the start of the 2005–06 season, Monaco struggled falling to 15th place after only a month of play. On 21 December 2005, Evra made his final appearance with the club in a 1–0 win over Lille in the Coupe de la Ligue.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, {{the yard}} was {{expanded}} to include two hump facilities. In the 1920s and 1950s, the NYC again enlarged and improved the yard. In the mid-1960s, NYC made <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Selkirk near Albany the main yard and began a process of [...] "downgrading" [...] DeWitt Yard. Traffic continued to dwindle into the 1980s and in January 1991, Conrail closed the hump classification operation. The yard remained open, however, the eastbound yard was relegated to storage of freight cars and maintenance-of-way equipment and the formerly active classification yard was limited to storage of freight cars.|$|E
60|$|She {{had often}} before seen the dusty cars roll into a wayside depot {{to wait until}} the luxurious limited passed, and the grimy faces at the windows, pale and pinched, cunning, or {{coarsely}} brutal, after the fashion of their kind, had roused no more than a passing pity. It was, however, different that night, for Grant's words had roused her to thought, and she wondered with a vague apprehension whether the tramp of weary feet she had listened to would once more break in upon her sheltered life. Larry had foreseen changes, and he was usually right. Then she brushed these fancies into the background, for she had still <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> Captain Cheyne would shortly arrive, and she knew what he came to ask. He was also a personable man, and, so far as the Schuylers knew, without reproach, while Hetty had seen a good deal of him during the past twelve months. She admitted a liking for him, but now that {{the time had come to}} decide, she was not certain that she would care to spend her life with him. As a companion, he left nothing to be desired, but, as had happened already with another man with whom Miss Torrance had been pleased, that position did not appear to content him; and she had misgivings about contracting a more permanent bond. It was almost a relief when Miss Schuyler came in.|$|E
