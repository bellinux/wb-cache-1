5|$|Inspired by the Halo {{video game}} series, Troy Hurtubise, {{known for his}} anti-bear suits, {{developed}} a real counterpart to the MJOLNIR powered assault armor, named the Trojan. The suit is functional and its capabilities were inspired by those present in the video games versions of the armor. The armor's features include a system that purifies <b>air,</b> <b>powered</b> by solar panels located in the helmet, equipment for weapon transportation, a recording system, emergency illumination, and a transponder that can be activated if the wearer is in serious jeopardy. The armor offers protection against attacks with knives, blunt objects, and small explosions and is bulletproof. Hurtubise expressed that {{he is able to}} improve this design for use in the military for a price of 2,000 dollars per piece. Non-functional replicas of the MJOLNIR powered assault armor have also been created by hobbyists; a Spike TV pre-Halo 3 special profiled some of these dedicated fans.|$|E

500|$|After a tank is cleaned, {{provided}} {{that it is}} going to be prepared for entry, it will be purged. Purging is accomplished by pumping inert gas into the tank until hydrocarbons have been sufficiently expelled. Next the tank is gas freed which is usually accomplished by blowing fresh air into the space with portable <b>air</b> <b>powered</b> or water powered air blowers. [...] "Gas freeing" [...] brings the oxygen content of the tank up to 20.8% O2. The inert gas buffer between fuel and oxygen atmospheres ensures they are never capable of ignition. Specially trained personnel monitor the tank's atmosphere, often using hand-held gas indicators which measure the percentage of hydrocarbons present. After a tank is gas-free, it may be further hand-cleaned in a manual process known as mucking. Mucking requires protocols for entry into confined spaces, protective clothing, designated safety observers, and possibly the use of airline respirators.|$|E

For $650.00. a 390-horsepower 428 cubic inch engine was installed {{in place of the}} 400. The 428 CI engine was disassembled and blueprinted to produce more than the advertised factory 390 horsepower and easily spinning to 5700 RPM. Car and Driver road tested the 428 CI powered car with the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission and 3.55 gears.

Car and Driver wrote that the 428 CI powered car was [...] "a fine, exciting car for either touring or tooting around in traffic. Not overly fussy. Not difficult to drive–-up to a point. Too much throttle at the wrong time will spin the car, or send it rocketing off the road and into the farmer's field.

[...] On the other hand, according to Car Life, the Ram <b>Air</b> <b>powered</b> car [...] "likes to run between 3000 and 6000 RPM. Below 3000, the GTO ran flat and a bit rough. Part-throttle driving at 2000 RPM around town was difficult and unpleasant. Freeway cruising at 4000 RPM is anything but pleasant and promises short life for hard working engine components. Also, driving the GTO on wet roads with this deep geared axle was thrilling. Rear tire breakaway could be provoked by a slight jab at the accelerator, sending the car into a minor skid that usually used up more than one lane of space." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether traditional <b>air</b> <b>power</b> theory complements counterinsurgency <b>air</b> <b>power</b> {{theory in}} kinetic counterinsurgency operations. The reason being {{that there is}} some discrepancy in the theories of how <b>air</b> <b>power</b> can be used in counterinsurgency. Winning a revolutionary war requires a graduated spectrum of violence; whereas, traditionally <b>air</b> <b>power</b> is characterized as only using the kinetic, hard power, end of that spectrum. The purpose is to test Robert Pape’s <b>air</b> <b>power</b> theory of military coercion by denial, motivated by the theory’s agreement with current research of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in counterinsurgency. This thesis is a comparative case study examining two, similar and successful counterinsurgency operations, Operation Anaconda and Operation Medusa. Findings show that denial is quite prominent when direct support of ground forces occurs; whereas operational and strategic interdiction indicate low or no occurrence. This study strengthens the theory’s applicatory power in a counterinsurgency context, and suggests it can complement current research on counterinsurgency <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in kinetic usage.   Uppsatsen skriven VT 2017 under Termin 4 Officersprogrammet 15 - 18 med inriktning mot flyg.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe thesis argues that <b>air</b> <b>power</b> now dominates modern warfare. The overwhelming {{victory of the}} Gulf War stands {{as a symbol of}} the maturity of <b>air</b> <b>power.</b> In effect, technology has caught up with nearly a century of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> theory, the early prophets of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> were basically correct. The air war in the Gulf was revolutionary in the sense that very few bombs were required to achieve an enormous amount of very focused, precise destruction. The existence of precision guided munitions allows single aircraft to accomplish what, in the past, would have taken literally thousands of aircraft to accomplish or could not have been accomplished at all. The argument is based on a comparison of the employment of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in previous conflicts. A comparison is then made with the employment of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in the Gulf War.

40|$|The <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> {{theories}} of today are often written from a superior air force perspective where the overall {{focus is on}} the offensive nature of <b>Air</b> <b>Power.</b> Very little is spoken about <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> and its defensive role as well as the inferior states opportunities against superior opponents. A state that successfully has used <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> through history is Israel. During both the Six Day War in 1967 and Yom Kippur in 1973, Israel faced superior opponents consisting of a coalition of Arab states, including Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. Despite Israel being the initially inferior state during both wars, they managed to gain initiative against the superior Arab states. This study will set the <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> {{theories of}} Philip S Meilinger to a test through a validation process against two cases, the Six Day War in 1967 and Yom Kippur in 1973. The aim is to analyse the Israeli air force during these two wars. The main goal is to try to explain how inferior states can succeed against superior opponents through <b>Air</b> <b>Power.</b> The result of the study demonstrates that an inferior state has the opportunity to achieve success through <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> against superior opponents. The analyses of Meilingers theories indicates that high readiness, early employment of forces, use of <b>Air</b> <b>Powers</b> psychological effect and timing constitutes successful factors in gaining initiative. An additional important factor for achieving success through these variables is highly relevant intelligence. ...|$|R

Few innovations have provided the consistent and often decisive impact that <b>air</b> <b>power</b> has delivered in conflict.
