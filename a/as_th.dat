5|$|The {{majority}} of Deshasthas speak Marathi, {{one of the}} major languages of the mainly northern Indo-Aryan language group. The major dialects of Marathi are called Standard Marathi and Warhadi Marathi. Standard Marathi is the official language of the State of Maharashtra. The language of Pune's Deshastha Brahmins has been considered to be the standard Marathi language and the pronunciation of the Deshastha Rigvedi is given prominence. There are a few other sub-dialects like Ahirani, Dangi, Samavedi, Khandeshi and Puneri Marathi. There are no inherently nasalised vowels in standard Marathi <b>as</b> <b>th</b> whereas the Chitpavani dialect of Marathi, spoken in Pune does have nasalised vowels.|$|E

2500|$|These {{discrepancies}} in transliterations {{of the same}} word {{can be traced to}} {{discrepancies in}} the transliterations of individual Hebrew letters, reflecting not only different traditions of transliteration into different languages that use Latin alphabets, but also the fact that different pronunciation styles exist for the same letters in Israel (e.g. mainstream secular Ashkenazi pronunciations used in the media versus Mizrahi, Arab, or Orthodox Ashkenazi colloquial pronunciations). For example, Hanukkah and Chayyim are transliterated with different initial letter combinations, although in Hebrew both begin with the letter the use of [...] "ch" [...] reflects German / Yiddish influence and pronunciation, whereas the [...] "h" [...] or [...] "ḥ" [...] may indicate a softer pronunciation of [...] as in ancient Hebrew, Judeo-Arabic or Mizrahi Hebrew. Similarly, the Hebrew letter [...] is transliterated <b>as</b> <b>th</b> in the word Beith, s in the word talis, and t in the word Bet, even though it is the same letter in all three words in Hebrew. The Hebrew letter [...] is transliterated as c in Isaac, k in Yitzchak, and q in Qehila. Finally, the Hebrew letter [...] is transliterated variously as s (in Isaac), tz (in Yitzchak), and ts (in Tsfat), again reflecting different traditions of spelling or pronunciation. These inconsistencies {{make it more difficult for}} the non-Hebrew-speaking reader to recognize related word forms, or even to properly pronounce the Hebrew words thus transliterated.|$|E

60|$|There {{are three}} {{particularly}} well-marked systems of ridges {{in the palm}} of the hand marked in Plate 3, Fig. 6, ~1~, <b>as</b> <b>Th,</b> AB, and BC. The system Th is that which runs over the ball of the thumb and adjacent parts of the palm. It is bounded by the line a which starts {{from the middle of the}} palm close to the wrist, and sweeps thence round the ball of the thumb to the edge of the palm on the side of the thumb, which it reaches about half an inch, more or less, below the base of the fore-finger. The system AB is bounded towards the thumb by the above line a, and towards the little finger by the line b; the latter starts from about the middle of the little-finger side of the palm, and emerges on the opposite side just below the fore-finger. Consequently, every ridge that wholly crosses the palm is found in AB. The system BC is bounded thumbwards by the line b, until that line arrives at a point immediately below the axis of the fore-finger; there the boundary of BC leaves the line b, and skirts the base of the fore-finger until it reaches the interval which separates the fore and middle fingers. The upper boundary of BC is the line c, which leaves the little-finger side of the palm at a small distance below the base of the little finger, and terminates between the fore and middle fingers. Other systems are found between c and the middle, ring, and little fingers; they are somewhat more variable than those just described, as will be seen by comparing the five different palms shown in Fig. 6.|$|E
