25|$|Relative humidity: The {{relative}} humidity of air {{is defined as}} the partial pressure of water vapour divided by the saturated vapour pressure at the same temperature and total pressure (Siau, 1984). If the temperature is kept constant, lower relative humidities result in higher drying rates due to the increased moisture gradient in wood, resulting from the reduction of the moisture content in the surface layers when the {{relative humidity}} of air is reduced. The relative humidity is usually expressed on a percentage basis. For drying, the other essential parameter related to relative humidity is the <b>absolute</b> <b>humidity,</b> which is the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air (kg of water per kg of dry air).However, its influenced by the amount of water in the heated air.|$|E

However, while diffusive transport rates in bulk NaCl solution are rapid and well characterized, such data are not directly applicable to storage conditions where crack walls are coated with thin adsorbed water films. To reliably predict healing times in geological storage applications, data on mass transport rates in adsorbed films are needed. We determined the surface diffusivity in such films for conditions with <b>absolute</b> <b>humidities</b> (AH) ranging from 1 to 18 g/m 3 (relative humidities (RH) of 4 %- 78 %) by measuring the surface impedance of single NaCl crystals. We use the impedance results to calculate the effective surface diffusivity S = DδC using the Nernst-Einstein equation. The S values obtained lie in the range 1 × 10 - 27 m 3 s - 1 at very dry conditions to 1 × 10 - 19 m 3 s - 1 for the deliquescence point at 296 K, which is in reasonable agreement with existing values for grain boundary diffusion under wet conditions. Estimates for the diffusivity D made assuming a film thickness δ of 50 - 90 nm and no major effects of thickness on the solubility C lie in the range of 1 × 10 - 14 to 8 × 10 - 12 m 2 s - 1 for the highest humidities studied (14 - 18 g/m 3 AH, 60 %- 78 % RH). For geological storage systems in rock salt, we predict S values between 1 × 10 - 22 - 8 × 10 - 18 m 3 s - 1.

Ten subjects performed intermittent exercise on a treadmill while wearing the protective masks in a climatic chamber controlled at an air temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 70 %. Two types of mask—mask A, with exhaust valves and mask B, with exhaust holes—were used in the study. The results of this study indicated: (1) The subjects had a tendency toward lower maximum heart rate when wearing mask A than when wearing mask B. (2) Temperatures and <b>absolute</b> <b>humidities</b> (the outer surface of mask, the microclimate inside the mask, the chest wall skin and microclimate) of mask A were significantly lower than those of mask B. (3) The ear canal temperature increased significantly in mask B as compared to that in mask A. (4) The ear canal temperature showed significant augmentation along with increased temperature and humidity inside the mask microclimate. The mask microclimate temperature also affected significantly the chest microclimate temperature. (5) Mask A was rated significantly lower for perception of humidity, heat, breath resistance, tightness, unfitness, odor, fatigue, and offered less overall discomfort than mask B. (6) Subjective preference for mask A was higher. (7) The ratings of subjective overall discomfort showed significant augmentation along with increased wetness and fatigue. We discuss how the ventilation properties of masks A and B induce significantly different temperature and humidity in the microclimates of the masks and the heat loss of the body, which have profound influences on heart rate, thermal stress, and subjective perception of discomfort.

Length of mite population growth season - abbreviated to mite season - can be shortened by effective ventilation. Therefore, minimal required ventilation rates, to keep the relative humidity in the mite niche below the hygienic moisture limit for mite population growth, in European countries, were collected. No significant correlation was demonstrated between length of heating season and mite numbers in any of the home textiles.

On floors, none of the climatic variables showed a significant correlation with mite numbers. Minimal required ventilation rates were found in Denmark and the Netherlands, only.

Such exposures were carried out at different ages: 1 - 3 months, 6 - 8 months, and 12 - 13 months. The following reactions were studied: Rectal temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, evaporative loss, skin temperature (Zebu-Hereford only), and behaviour. For air temperatures above 95 °F the rise in rectal temperature was greater and equilibrium was reached more slowly in Illawarra Shorthorns than in the Zebu-Hereford. Increase in humidity at temperatures over 80 ° F produced more stress in the animals than increase of dry-bulb temperature. Pulse rates changed little during heat exposure, {{but there was a}} fall in rate with age under all circumstances. As the calves increased in age the panting rate decreased for a given hot environment (markedly so for the Zebu-Hereford crossbred). Evaporative loss increased as dry-bulb temperature was raised. The Zebu-Hereford showed a high transcutaneous water loss soon after birth with a continued increase up to 12 months. Skin evaporation was relatively small in the Illawarra Shorthorn at 1 - 3 months but increased at 6 - 8 months, although it did not attain the high rate of the crossbred. In the Zebu-Hereford cross, sweat glands became active at a skin temperature of approximately 96 °F. With the onset of sweating a fall in skin temperature was observed. A comparison of the reactions of the Illawarra Shorthorn and the Zebu-Hereford crossbred with four Jersey calves aged 1 - 3 months, exposed to similar conditions by Riek and Lee, shows that the Zebu-Hereford has a better heat tolerance than either of the other breeds. Evidence is presented to indicate that this superiority of the Zebu crossbred is associated with at least two factors, (a) a better sweating mechanism and (b) decreased heat production.
