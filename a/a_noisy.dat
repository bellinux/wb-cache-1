5|$|After a lacuna in the {{manuscript}} of the poem, Hymiskviða abruptly picks up again with Thor and Hymir in a boat, out at sea. Hymir catches a few whales at once, and Thor baits his line {{with the head of}} the ox. Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in {{the manuscript}}.|$|E

5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> print shop, a disgraced {{police detective}} named Hofmeister (Karl Meixner) escapes from {{pursuing}} criminals' attacks. Hofmeister telephones his former superior Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) and explains frantically {{that he has}} discovered a huge criminal conspiracy. Before he can disclose {{the identity of the}} responsible criminal, the lights go out, shots are fired, and Hofmeister becomes mad. Hofmeister vanishes only to be found later singing every time he feels watched, and he is institutionalized at Professor Baum's asylum.|$|E

50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that reducing traffic noise pollution is low-cost or cost-effective.

5|$|Like other nuthatches, this is <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members of a pair, given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E
5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>noisy</b> species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|Control {{systems have}} a need for {{smoothing}} filters in their feedback loops with criteria to maximise the speed of movement of a mechanical system to the prescribed mark {{and at the same}} time minimise overshoot and noise induced motions. A key problem here is the extraction of Gaussian signals from <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> background. An early paper on this was published during WWII by Norbert Wiener with the specific application to anti-aircraft fire control analogue computers. Rudy Kalman (Kalman filter) later reformulated this in terms of state-space smoothing and prediction where it is known as the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. Kalman started an interest in state-space solutions, but according to Darlington this approach can also be found in the work of Heaviside and earlier.|$|E
5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E

The Compressed SENSE factor and the denoising level (weak, medium, strong) influence the quality of image. The denoising level establishes an equilibrium between the undersampling of data and their necessary consistency in order to reconstruct a reliable image. A weak denoising level leads to <b>a</b> <b>noisier</b> image impression than a medium or strong denoising level [5].|$|R
50|$|The {{voices and}} vocalisations {{of the sexes}} differ, the male having a hoarse, subdued duck-like quack which seldom sounds unless it is aroused. The male Egyptian goose attracts its mate with <b>an</b> elaborate, <b>noisy</b> {{courtship}} display that includes honking, neck stretching and feather displays. The female has <b>a</b> far <b>noisier</b> raucous quack that frequently sounds in aggression and almost incessantly at the slightest disturbance when tending her young.|$|R
5|$|The plan seemed ill-conceived and {{suggests}} that Narborough was obsessed {{by the possibility of}} treasure. It is also possible that Phips was being used in a complex way, with the sly intention that HMS Rose would act as <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> decoy for his more important treasure hunt. Unlike the Falcon and Bonetta, Phips was not sent directly to search near Hispaniola where Narborough (correctly) believed a great treasure lay buried. Phips' instructions were not kept secret but were signed by the entire crew, thereby broadcasting their designs through the harbor and shipyards. On July 13, 1683, the articles of agreement (see image) were signed by Phips and seven other crew members, in the presence of Narborough and Haddock.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} is <b>a</b> <b>noisy</b> bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E
