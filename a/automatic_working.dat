40|$|Following {{cognitive}} {{models of}} anxiety, biases occur if threat processing is automatic versus strategic. Therefore, {{most of these}} models predict attentional bias, but not explicit memory bias. We suggest dividing memory into the highly <b>automatic</b> <b>working</b> memory (WM) component versus long-term memory when investigating bias in anxiety. WM for threat has rarely been investigated although its main function is stimulus monitoring, particularly important in anxiety. We investigated WM for spiders in spider fearfuls (SFs) versus non-anxious controls (NACs). In Experiment 1 (23 SFs/ 24 NACs), we replicated an earlier WM study, reducing strategic processing options. This led to stronger group differences and, thus, clearer WM threat biases. There were no group differences in Experiment 2 (18 SFs/ 19 NACs), using snakes instead of spiders to test whether WM biases are material-specific. This article supports cognitive models of anxiety in that biases {{are more likely to}} occur when reducing strategic processing. However, it contradicts the assumption that explicit memory biases are not characteristic of anxiety...|$|E
40|$|The dual task {{paradigm}} (DTP), where {{performance of}} a walking task co-occurs with a cognitive task to assess performance decrement, has been controversially mooted as a more suitable task to test safety from falls in outdoor and urban environments than simple walking in a hospital corridor.

In this study we validated the x-io x-IMU wearable inertial sensors, used them to record healthy walking, and then used dynamic time warping to assess the elements of the gait cycle. In the timed 25 foot walk (T 25 FW) the alternate letter alphabet task lengthened the stride time significantly compared to ordinary walking, while counting backward did not.

In addition, the adaptive modulation switching threshold is the trade off between spectral efficiency and Bit Error Rate (BER).

40|$|Two main {{pollutants}} are {{of significant}} importance: ozone and particulate matter. <b>Automatic</b> <b>working</b> instruments {{can help to}} monitor the concentrations in air. But such monitoring stations are expensive and therefore limited in number. Passive samplers are simple, inexpensive and could {{be placed in a}} large number over a wide area, they are part of european regulations (CEN/T 264) already. In combination with geostatistic methods like kriging they can show the pattern of the pollution and allow to find the optimal places to situate the monitoring stations after these studies. Mass spectrometry allow the analysis of collected dust samples and even the analysis of single particles. In a similar manner the distribution of chemical elements in particles could be also depicted by geostatistics e. g. in a city area. Multivariate statistics, like biplots, allow the interpretation which sources contribute mainly to the particles.

40|$|The {{present state}} of {{technology}} {{is the use of}} haptic, inductive and laser sensors as well as the use of voltaic arc sensors. The sensors mentioned first have the disadvantage, that they are sensoring with a local displacement from the actual welding spot and that they use a geometrically interfering measuring pick-up. The voltaic arc sensors known require for the welding pulsed power sources although it is not required for the welding process itself. Furthermore a number of disadvantages are known for LB-sensors due to lateral swing of the pendulum. On the one hand there is increased wear-down of the torch axises, on the other hand notches appear on fillet weld edge at raised output and welding speed. The aim was to develop a voltaic arc sensor system where the disadvantages of the LG-sensors with lateral swing of the pendulum are avoided. A further aim was to establish air gaps during welding and to fill them appropriately for welding proper thicknesses of fillet welds. With a LB-sensor system that lets rotate the wire tip with minor diameter (1, 5 mm), the a. m. disadvantages can be avoided and multitude information regarding the welding process can be generated. The result is a voltaic arc sensor system with rotation wire electrode that has been tested intensive in welding laboratory and was implemented and tested in a welding robot for shipbuilding at HDW. The welds performed on active components over a period of 12 weeks proof the fully functioning of the system regarding sensoring as well as the compensation of the air gaps, i. e. for the first time fillet welds without excess can be welded. This sensor system can be applied for all semi- or fully <b>automatic</b> <b>working</b> MAG-welding machines (solid wire, welding position PB) including weld robots requiring an exact torch guidance. Further examinations are necessary for MAG-welding with flux-cored electrode wire, particularly in welding positions PF, PC and PD. (orig.)
