40|$|Functional {{response}} {{describes the}} rate at which a predator consumes prey. Handling time, duration that a predator spends on a captured prey for the consumption, is one of the parameters of many functional response models. Although models typically assume that handling time is static, most empirical studies that directly quantified the relationship between handling time and prey density show that handling time decreases with prey density. In this study, I compare a community model that employs density-dependent handling time and a model with static handling time for their responses to enrichment. The density-dependent handling time is derived by assuming that predators <b>adjust</b> <b>handling</b> time to maximize their fitness. I show that the model with adaptive handling time is more robust to enrichment than the model with static handling time at realistic parameter values. Although community response to enrichment is used as an illustrative example, density-dependent handling time is a common empirical observation and would have general implications to ecological dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The {{companies}} of the photovoltaic industry have experienced considerable growth in recent years. And further growth is forecasted {{for the coming}} years. By now, nearly two million single photovoltaic (PV) installations generate electricity from sunlight around the world. Thereby, the wafer-based PV products have a market share of about 80 - 85 %. The interim shortage of silicon and the increasing cost pressure in the market give rise to ever thinner and larger wafers. Thus, the "PV Roadmap for Crystalline Silicon" of the German cell producers expects an average wafer thickness of 100 µm until 2020 and {{the next generation of}} wafer thickness in 2015. This trend brings about new challenges for the PV industry: due to the manual and automated handling in the manufacturing the silicon-based wafers are exposed to mechanical stress. If the wafers, however, become ever thinner they lose their mechanical stability and might form cracks when exposed to huge forces during the handling. These cracks, however, cause a higher breakage rate and are {{one of the main reasons}} for breakdowns of the finished modules. The damage-free handling of the very fragile silicon wafers will gain in importance due to the expected increase in the throughput. Therefore, the handling systems and components must not only handle the sensitive substrates as gently as possible but also with high speed and precision in the µm range. For this purpose, new <b>adjusted</b> <b>handling</b> components are required. This thesis aims at making a contribution to the optimal selection of handling components for the photovoltaic industry. The primary target is the development of an objective and vendor-independent evaluation procedure for grippers especially used in the cell and module manufacturing. The procedure to be developed should be suitable for cell, equipment and machine manufacturers as well as for component suppliers. Furthermore, the procedure should be applicable to identical and variable gripping principles. The result of the method should be the optimal decision guidance for the user and should enable an adequate and neutral classification of the tested gripper...|$|R

The direction of change in emissions, effluent quality and operational cost resulting from variation of control handles individually is determined using one factor-at-a-time sensitivity analysis, and corresponding trade-offs are identified. The contribution of each control handle to variance in model outputs, taking into account the effects of interactions, is then explored using a variance-based sensitivity analysis method, i. e., Sobol's method, and significant second order interactions are discovered. This knowledge will assist future control strategy development and aid an efficient design and optimisation process, as it provides {{a better understanding of the}} effects of control handles on key performance indicators and identifies those for which dynamic control has the greatest potential benefits. Sources with the greatest variance in emissions, and therefore the greatest need to monitor, are also identified. It is found that variance in total emissions is predominantly due to changes in direct N 2 O emissions and selection of suitable values for wastage flow rate and aeration intensity in the final activated sludge reactor is of key importance.

The framework is used to derive a novel approach to interaction design, particularly in situations where rich or unusual sensing and display modalities are present. A number of key tools for describing and implementing systems which are consistent with this perspective are presented. The role of system dynamics as a mediating element between sensed state and decision making is described. The work sets out a paradigm for interaction which brings probabilistic models – and thus many of the techniques of modern machine learning – into the interface in a clean and principled manner.
