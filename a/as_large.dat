5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates {{is in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as that of a reptile of the same body size.|$|E

5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, and the body is raised, so that the animal appears <b>as</b> <b>large</b> and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
5|$|Asteroids in the {{asteroid}} belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as their partners. The asteroid belt also contains main-belt comets, {{which may have been}} the source of Earth's water.|$|E

5|$|Data {{is stored}} in a 160Gb (20GB) flash memory module {{consisting}} of over 700 memory chips, each with a 256Mbit capacity. This memory capacity is not actually that large considering the amount of data to be acquired; for example, a single image from the HiRISE camera can be <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as 28Gb.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} {{to those of}} Tachyoryctes audax, the nasal bones are larger and have angles at the sides. T.annectens, which is nearly <b>as</b> <b>large,</b> has smaller teeth and nasals; in T.rex, the basioccipital is broader, and the back part of the mandible (lower jaw) is better developed and has the capsule of the incisor placed further to the front.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia's {{population}} has been increasing rapidly since the 1815 eruption, reaching 222 million in 2006, of which 130 million were living on Java. A new volcanic eruption <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as 1815 probably would cause catastrophic devastation with many more fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Juno was {{originally}} considered a planet, along with 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, and 4 Vesta. In 1811, Schröter estimated Juno to be <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as 2290km in diameter. All four were reclassified as asteroids as additional asteroids were discovered. Juno's small size and irregular shape preclude {{it from being}} designated a dwarf planet.|$|E
5|$|Lemmings {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} levels, grouped into four {{difficulty}} categories. Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other. Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such <b>as</b> <b>large</b> drops, booby traps and pools of lava.|$|E

5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, {{the human brain}} is almost twice <b>as</b> <b>large</b> {{as that of a}} bottlenose dolphin, and three times <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as that of a chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E

Premiums are allowed to vary by enrollee age, but those for the oldest enrollees (age 45–64 average expenses $5,542) can only be three times <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as those for adults (18–24 $1,836).|$|E

5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy and}} the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the Milky Way has never {{collided}} with a galaxy <b>as</b> <b>large</b> as Andromeda before, evidence of past collisions of the Milky Way with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing.|$|E
