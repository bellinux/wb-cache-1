40|$|Aim This {{pilot study}} {{reports on the}} uptake of I- 123 -interleukin 2 (IL- 2) in metastatic renal cell {{carcinoma}} (MRCC) patients {{and its relationship to}} prognostic factors of response or failure of MRCC to cytokines treatment. Methods. Nine consecutive patients with MRCC underwent an I- 123 -IL- 2 scan (6 male and 3 female; mean age 64 years; range 51 - 78). Uptake in metastases was related to <b>a</b> <b>summed</b> score of 4 independent factors, predictive of rapid progression under cytokine treatment as defined by Negrier et al. Results. Four patients presented with metastases at one site, 4 at 2 sites and one patient at 3 different sites. Summed scores were: 5 patients had <b>a</b> <b>summed</b> score of 1; 3 <b>a</b> <b>summed</b> score of 2 and I patient <b>a</b> <b>summed</b> score of 3. Uptake of I- 123 -IL- 2 by tumor tissue was found in only 2 patients. Uptake occurred in I patient with <b>a</b> <b>summed</b> score of 3 and in 1 with <b>a</b> <b>summed</b> score of 2. Conclusion In this small series of patients with MRCC, I- 123 -IL- 2 uptake was found in tumors of 2 patients who less likely will benefit from cytokine treatment. Additional studies are needed to assess the relationship between the pretreatment uptake of I- 123 -IL 2 in MRCC and the response to IL- 2 therapy...|$|R

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested <b>a</b> <b>sum</b> of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved <b>a</b> <b>sum</b> of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
