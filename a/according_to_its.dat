Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E

5|$|The {{material}} {{formed in}} the Acheson furnace varies in purity, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> distance from the graphite resistor heat source. Colorless, pale yellow and green crystals have the highest purity and are found closest to the resistor.

Nitrogen and aluminium are common impurities, and they affect the electrical conductivity of SiC.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E
5|$|Development of System Shock 2 {{began in}} 1997 when Looking Glass Studios {{approached}} Irrational Games {{with an idea}} to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans of System Shock and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella Heart of Darkness. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> pitch document, was Junction Point. The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop {{the concept of a}} dungeon crawler, like , in a science fiction setting, the basis for System Shock. However, the press mistook System Shock to be closer to a Doom clone which was cited for poor financial success of System Shock. With Junction Point, the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from Doom.|$|E
5|$|During single-player segments, {{the player}} could select two AI companions after {{selecting}} missions, which {{added to the}} player's total score {{at the end of}} these missions. During missions, the companions could be issued with Team Commands, which could either order them to attack or increase healing abilities while lowering their defensive capabilities. Each attempt at a mission used up the Cadet's stamina meter, which allowed a maximum of three missions at a time. The game used a job system similar to other entries in the Final Fantasy series, where different equipment and weapons alter a character's abilities in battle. Specific skills accompanied each job. Players could create multiple equipment sets, with each item and weapon ranked <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> rarity in-game. Materials gathered during missions could be used to upgrade the player's equipment and abilities.|$|E
