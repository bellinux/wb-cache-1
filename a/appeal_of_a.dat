His works from this period include the First Choral Symphony to words by Keats (a Second Choral Symphony to words by George Meredith exists only in fragments).

5|$|The UK {{had been}} a home for music video pioneers. When the music video cable channel MTV started {{broadcasting}} in 1982, the importance of videos abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience. MTV filled its programs with many hard rock and heavy metal videos, but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels. Moreover, music videos exalted the visual <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> band, an area where some British metal groups were deficient. So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following. Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable {{to follow up on}} their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, the Fifth Circuit heard United States v.

25|$|Many urban legends are framed as {{complete}} stories with plot and characters. The compelling <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, horror, fear or humor. Often {{they serve as}} cautionary tales. Some urban legends are morality tales that depict someone, usually a child, acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble, hurt, or dead.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{provision}} for review or <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grant of a warrant application, only of a denial.

25|$|The union won a few skirmishes in {{the strike}} in August 1936. New York Governor Lehman ordered {{a special session}} of the appellate {{division}} of the New York Supreme Court to hear an emergency <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state court ruling granting an injunction against the union under the State Anti-Injunction Law of 1935. The appeal was ultimately unsuccessful. After a fresh outbreak of violence in Syracuse on August 11, in which two strikers were shot and injured by local police, Governor Lehman threatened to replace policemen with National Guard troops unless local law enforcement authorities proved capable of more restraint.|$|E
25|$|During the 1870s Abe Buford {{suffered}} {{a series of}} financial reversals that forced him into bankruptcy with the resulting loss of Bosque Bonita Farm to his creditors. In addition, he {{suffered a}} devastating personal loss when his only son, William A. Buford, died at age twenty-three in 1872. He lost his wife Amanda Harris Buford in 1879 and on March 26 of that same year, his brother, Colonel Thomas Buford of Henry County, Kentucky, shot and killed Judge John Milton Elliott in Frankfort, Kentucky. Tom Buford surrendered to police and was jailed pending trial. Abe Buford came to his brother's aid and {{spent a great deal}} of money on legal fees for his defense. On <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guilty verdict, Thomas Buford would eventually be found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to the Anchorage, Kentucky psychiatric hospital.|$|E

25|$|A Christian {{music festival}} (also {{known as a}} Jesus music festival or simply a Jesus festival) is a music festival held by the Christian community, in support of {{performers}} of Christian music. The festivals are characterized by more than just music; many feature motivational speakers and evangelists, and include seminars on Christian spiritual and missions topics, service, and evangelism. They are often viewed as evangelical tools, and small festivals can draw 10 times the crowd of traditional revival meetings. While the central theme of a Christian festival is Jesus Christ, the core <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Christian music festival remains the artists and their music. Critics {{point out that the}} dichotomy of business and religious interests can be problematic for Christian festivals. In similar ways as the Christian music industry in general, festivals can be drawn away from their central theme and gravitate toward commercialization and mainstream acts in an attempt to draw crowds.|$|E
25|$|Nationals {{pitchers}} grabbed much of {{the attention}} as the season came to an end. On October 1, rookie starting pitcher A. J. Cole dropped his <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> five-game suspension handed down by the league for intentionally throwing at a batter the previous month, with the suspension expected to carry over into the 2017 season. The same day, starter Tanner Roark posted his career-best 16th win of the regular season, defeating Wei-Yin Chen and the Marlins 2–1. On October 2, {{the last day of}} the regular season, staff ace Max Scherzer earned his 20th win, although he gave up five runs in a seesaw 10–7 victory over the Marlins; he also notched four runs batted in during the game, going 2-for-2, for the first time in his career. Closer Mark Melancon finished his year with 47 saves, the second-highest season total of his career. Catching prospect Spencer Kieboom, meanwhile, made his major league debut on October 2, drawing a walk from Marlins reliever Brian Ellington as a pinch-hitter and then coming around to score later in the inning.|$|E

[...] When {{he described the}} style of the album, Gill said, [...] "It doesn't really help matters that as they get more mature, the band appear to be indulging their interest in Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb rather more openly, despite lacking either songwriter's way with a winning melody." [...] In his 2003 book The Rough Guide to Rock, Peter Buckley described the album as [...] "a little gushing and overall disappointing".|$|E
500|$|To {{what extent}} bookwheels were {{appreciated}} for their convenience versus their aesthetic qualities remains {{a matter of}} speculation according to modern American engineer Henry Petroski. Ramelli himself described the bookwheel as a [...] "beautiful and ingenious machine, very useful and convenient for anybody who takes pleasure in study, especially {{for those who are}} indisposed and tormented by gout." [...] Ramelli's reference to gout, a condition that impairs mobility, demonstrates the <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> device that allows access to several books while seated. However, Petroski notes that Ramelli's illustration lacks space for writing and other scholarly work, and that the [...] "fanciful wheel" [...] may not have been appropriate for any activity beyond reading.|$|E

In Gitlow v.

Holmes and Brandeis dissented in several more cases in this decade, however, advancing the argument that the Free Speech Clause protected a far greater range of political speech than the Court had previously acknowledged. In Whitney v. California (1927), in which Communist Party USA organizer Charlotte Anita Whitney had been arrested for [...] "criminal syndicalism", Brandeis wrote a dissent in which he argued for broader protections for political speech: ...|$|E
