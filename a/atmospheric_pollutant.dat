40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{estimate}} correlation between <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{and the number}} of children admissions by respiratory disease in the year 2001. METHODS: this is an ecological study of time series. The data on the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> were obtained at CETESB and the data on hospital admissions were obtained at the Medical Archive Service of the Taubaté University Hospital, in Taubaté. In order to study the correlation of pollutants concentration values between themselves and with the admissions, the Pearson correlation technique was utilised. The relative risks for admission by respiratory disease were estimated comparing the quartiles of the pollutant agents with values of the first quartile. The adopted statistical significance was alpha = 5 %. RESULTS: one hundred and fifty eight children were admitted with respiratory disease in the year 2001 (30 % of annual admissions). The pollutants were correlated between themselves. There was a positive correlation between the number of admissions and the concentrations of sulphur dioxide and particulate material. There was an increase of 25 % in the admission risk when comparing the fourth and the first quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: there was positive correlation between admission by respiratory disease and the concentration of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants...</b>|$|R

30|$|Rainwater is an {{important}} source of fresh water on earth. It is the purest form of naturally occurring water. It is considered, therefore, to be produced by a kind of natural distillation. However, it contains dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, fine particulate materials or aerosols, etc., from the atmosphere (Asthana and Asthana 2003).Industrial processes, fossil fuel combustion, mining, waste incineration, motor vehicles and other human activities emit large amounts of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants.</b> One of the most important groups of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> is heavy metals.

40|$|AbstractThrough many interactions, the {{composition}} and {{chemistry of the atmosphere}} are inherently connected to the climate system since <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> initiate chemical reactions affecting the climatically important compounds such as greenhouse gases. Therefore, when considering climate–chemistry interactions in the atmosphere, it is not only important to study the emissions of the climate compounds, but also to consider the chemical processes and the distribution of the compounds in the atmospheric regions by assessing their atmospheric sources and fates and determining their lifetimes. A considerable amount of kinetic studies has been carried out in this field. Consequently, progressive improvements in the database for reactions involving <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> and the quantification of their atmospheric lifetimes are made. This is fundamental to understanding the relationship between the budget and the trends of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> and thus, their impact on the climate. This issue is an essential step helping to develop effective control strategies and to establish appropriate legislations in order to prevent the emission of pollutants and to protect the atmosphere. In this respect, this paper focus on the impact of the gas phase chemistry on the climate and briefly presents the future changes in the Mediterranean climate. The major kinetic methods used in this field in laboratory studies are then reviewed and emphases on their limitations are indicated...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} a detailed {{overview of the}} current status of transboundary air pollution in the UK. It reviews the current state of air pollution issues, evaluates the extensive measurements of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their effects, and {{provides a}} synthesis of current understanding. The review focuses on the main causes of acid deposition, eutrophication, ground level ozone and heavy metal pollution in the UK, namely sulphur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH 3), aerosols (particulate matter), heavy metals, nitric acid (HNO 3) and ozone (O 3). A summary of the current European status is included to provide a wider perspective for the assessment. Emissions of primary pollutants contributing to transboundary air pollution have changed substantially during the last 30 years, mainly in response to international control measures such as the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), and the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) which set ceilings for the emissions of key <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> including sulphur dioxide (SO 2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and ammonia (NH 3) for European Community Member States, which the UK had to achieve by 2010.
