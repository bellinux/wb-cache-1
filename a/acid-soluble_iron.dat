This region has been suggested to contribute enough bioavailable iron to regulate interannual and interglacial variability in biological productivity downstream in the high-nitrate low-chlorophyll upwelling zone of the eastern equatorial Pacific. We investigated the advection and first-order biogeochemical impact of an imposed, data-based iron maximum in the western Pacific EUC using an ecosystem model forced by a global dynamical model. We imposed two source profiles of iron constrained by total <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>iron</b> measurements. Though the data for total <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>iron</b> included both dissolved and acid-soluble particulate iron species, we treated all of the total <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>iron</b> {{as if it was}} dissolved and bioavailable. A deeper (270 m) source was centered in the density horizon of the observed iron maximum and a shallower (180 m) source was located in the core of our model's EUC, where a dissolved iron maximum has been frequently postulated. These source runs were compared with a control run that contained no specific source of iron associated with the EUC. In the source runs elevated iron concentrations were simulated in the EUC across its entire zonal span, evident as a subsurface plume of dissolved iron slightly below the core of the EUC. In the control run there was no iron maximum associated with the EUC. Upwelling of iron-replete water in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific increased integrated primary productivity in the Wyrtki box (180 °W: 90 °W, 5 °S: 5 °N, 0 : 200 m) by 41 % and 66 % for the deeper and shallower iron perturbation, respectively. The source runs increased the realism of the zonal extent of HNLC conditions and the meridional distributions of biological productivity, relative to the control run. However, in the source simulations surface chlorophyll concentrations were too high by a factor of two and maximum surface nitrate concentrations were too low, relative to climatologies. The relative abundance of diatoms roughly doubled upon the input of additional iron, exceeding field observations. Though biogeochemical data are limited and we did not adjust parameters to optimize the model fits to observations, these results suggest that acid-soluble particulate iron supplied to the EUC in the western equatorial Pacific is unlikely to be entirely bioavailable...|$|E
30|$|The fruiting {{bodies and}} the sawdust media were dried at 105  °C and {{ground to a}} powder. The {{replicates}} of dried fruiting bodies were combined because the fruiting body amounts from one bottle were too small for measuring their accurate radioactivities. Nonradioactive 39 K, 56 Fe, and 133 Cs contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry according to the factory instruction manual (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). As internal standards, 45 Sc and 140 Ce were used. Before the measurement, mushroom and sawdust medium samples (about 0.5  g) were digested with 14  mL concentrated nitric acid (Ultrapur- 100, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) and 1  mL hydrogen peroxide (Ultrapur, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) at 220  °C for 4  h. For measuring nitric <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>iron</b> content in sPB, sPB (about 2  g) was diluted with 5  % nitric acid to 100  mL total, filtered, and centrifuged (10, 000 ×g, 5  min.).|$|E
40|$|Iron {{supplied}} by glacial weathering results in pronounced hotspots of biological production {{in an otherwise}} iron-limited Southern Ocean Ecosystem. However, glacial iron inputs {{are thought to be}} dominated by icebergs. Here we show that surface runoff from three island groups of the maritime Antarctic exports more filterable (< 0. 45 [*]μm) iron (6 – 81 [*]kg[*]km− 2 [*]a− 1) than icebergs (0. 0 – 1. 2 [*]kg[*]km− 2 [*]a− 1). Glacier-fed streams also export more <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>iron</b> (27. 0 – 18, 500 [*]kg[*]km− 2 [*]a− 1) associated with suspended sediment than icebergs (0 – 241 [*]kg[*]km− 2 [*]a− 1). Significant fluxes of filterable and sediment-derived iron (1 – 10 [*]Gg[*]a− 1 and 100 – 1, 000 [*]Gg[*]a− 1, respectively) are therefore likely to be delivered by runoff from the Antarctic continent. Although estuarine removal processes will greatly reduce their availability to coastal ecosystems, our results clearly indicate that riverine iron fluxes need to be accounted for as the volume of Antarctic melt increases in response to 21 st century climate change...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Oral {{bioaccessibility}} - {{the fraction}} of soil contaminant that dissolves in the human gastrointestinal tract - can be evaluated using various chemical extraction tests, {{some of which are}} designed to mimic biochemical conditions. As for any other partial extraction tests, bioaccessibility can be expected to be influenced not only by the soil parameters, but also by the characteristics of the contamination, such as the metal speciation, the contamination aging, etc. Here, we try to relate bioaccessibility measurements to factors that can only be obtained when the sampled soils are surveyed and mapped at a regional scale. The factors we consider are the type of industrial activity responsible for soil contamination in industrialized areas, the land-use, and the regional level of contaminant concentrations. The question which we address is whether a fixed bioaccessibility value can be proposed for risk-based approach of contaminated land or a variable bioaccessibility value must be considered in order to take into account regional differences. To substantiate our conclusions about the influence of these factors on bioaccessibility measurements, chemical sequential extraction tests were also performed on the same soil samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the course of the POLLUSOL 2 survey, 237 topsoil samples have been collected in urban parks, vegetable gardens and forests within several industrial areas of Wallonia (South Belgium). The in-vitro oral bioaccessibility test used in this study is Unified BARGE Method (UBM). We looked at the ‘stomach’ compartment of the test for the 237 samples, and at the ‘stomach and intestine’ compartment for a subset of 178 samples. Analysis of the extracts for eight trace metal elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) was carried out by ICP-AES. Total metal contents were measured by aqua regia extraction and ICP-AES. The sequential extraction was performed on a subset of 103 samples out of the 237 using the modified three-step BCR extraction procedure, whose purpose is to evaluate the speciation of trace metals. In this method, the operationally-defined fractions are the exchangeable and weak-acid soluble fraction (step 1), the reductible fraction (step 2), and oxidisable fraction (step 3). The BCR sequential extraction procedure was carried out for the eight trace metal elements. Statistical data analysis and regression curve fitting were carried out using robust statistics (StatDA package of the R software). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We found very good correlation between the 'stomach' and the 'stomach and intestine' phases for As, Cd and Zn (r > 0. 9). For Co, Cr, Ni and Pb, we found also a good correlation, although somewhat weaker (0. 6 - 0. 9). Because of this correlation, only 'stomach' values will be discussed in what follows. For As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb, relative bioaccessibility was found to be constant across the entire range of total metal content. Zinc was the only metal that exhibited a relative bioaccessibility which varied according to the total metal content and the type of industrial activity. For the eight trace metals, the bioaccessible fraction was influenced to a variable degree by one or several soil parameters (pH, organic matter, Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe). A very good linear relationship was found between the sum of the two first steps of the BCR sequential extraction and the bioaccessible fraction (gastric) of UBM the test (e. g. R 2 > 97 % for Zn). The bioaccessible fraction amounted to between 61 % (for Co) and 137 % (for Cu) of the exchangeable, <b>acid-soluble</b> and <b>iron</b> and manganese oxyhydroxide-bound fraction of the Walloon industrial soils obtained by the BCR extraction method. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that, for the eight trace metals studied in the industrial and urban zones of Wallonia, the bioaccessible fractions can be satisfactorily predicted basing on the total metal contents. This prediction can be improved by taking into account soil properties in the regression model. For Zn, a variable relative bioaccessibility should be considered, {{depending on the type of}} industrial activity and the level of total metal content. Our data also show that the sum of the two first steps of BCR sequential extraction closely predicts the ‘stomach’ phase measured by the BARGE method...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} by Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans of untreated pyrite (FeS 2) {{as well as}} HCl-pretreated pyrite (from {{which most}} of the <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>iron</b> species were removed) was studied manometrically. Oxygen uptake was linear during bacterial oxidation of untreated pyrite, whereas with HCl-pretreated pyrite both a decrease in oxygen uptake at 2 hr and nonlinear oxygen consumption were observed. Ferric sulfate added to HCl-pretreated pyrite restored approximately two-thirds of the decrease in total bacterial oxygen uptake and caused oxygen uptake to revert to nearly linear kinetics. Ferric sulfate also oxidized pyrite in the absence of bacteria and O 2; recovery of ferric and ferrous ions was in excellent agreement with the reaction Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 + FeS 2 = 3 FeSO 4 + 2 S, but the elemental sulfur produced was negligible. Neither H 2 S nor S 2 O 32 − was a product of the reaction. It is probable that two mechanisms of bacterial pyrite oxidation operate concurrently: the direct contact mechanism which requires physical contact between bacteria and pyrite particles for biological pyrite oxidation, and the indirect contact mechanism according to which the bacteria oxidize ferrous ions to the ferric state, thereby regenerating the ferric ions required for chemical oxidation of pyrite...|$|E
40|$|The {{water levels}} of the thermal springs and the ground water levels were {{measured}} and the contour of the water table was obtained. The contour was disturbed at two regions in which many springs issue. The thermal and ground waters were sampled all over the springs district, and the water temperatures were measured when they were sampled. The chloride, bicarbonate, sulfate, calcium and magnesium content was also determined. In addition, the analytical methods for the determination of arsenic, phosphorus and <b>acid-soluble</b> <b>iron</b> were improved. Also the concentration of these elements was determined. Based {{on the results of}} the observations and chemical analysis, the relations between the water temperatures and content of chemical constituent and the chloride content were checked respectively. Positive correlations were found in the relations between water temperature～Cl(-), HCO(3) (-) ～Cl(-), SO(4) (2 -) ～Cl(-), Ca(2 +) ～Cl(-), and As～Cl(-). Furthermore, the regional differences were detectable in the ratios of water temperature to chloride content and of bicarbonate to chloride content, nevertheless the correlation as a whole were valid. The diversity and regional differences of the chemical composition of the waters were explained as due to the differences in the mixing proportion of the magmatic thermal water and the varying kinds of ground water at the deep site in the ground and at the site near the ground surfaces...|$|E
