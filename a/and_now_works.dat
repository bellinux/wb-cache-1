500|$|Javier Bardem {{was cast}} as the film's {{principal}} villain, Raoul Silva, a cyberterrorist who is seeking revenge against those he holds responsible for betraying him. Bardem described Silva as [...] "more than a villain", while Craig stated that Bond has a [...] "very important relationship" [...] to Silva. In casting the role, director Sam Mendes admitted that he lobbied hard for Bardem to accept the part. Mendes saw {{the potential for the}} character to be recognised {{as one of the most}} memorable characters in the series and wanted to create [...] "something [...] may consider to have been absent from the Bond movies for a long time". He felt that Bardem was one of the few actors up to the task of becoming [...] "colourless" [...] and existing within the world of the film as something more than a function of the plot. In preparing for the role, Bardem had the script translated into his native Spanish to better understand his character, which Mendes cited as being a sign of the actor's commitment to the film. Bardem dyed his hair blond for the role after brainstorming ideas with Mendes to come up with a distinct visual look for the character, which led some commentators to observe a similarity between the character and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Bérénice Marlohe was cast as Séverine, a character who had been saved from the Macau sex trade by Silva <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>works</b> as his representative. Marlohe described her character as being [...] "glamorous and enigmatic", and that she drew inspiration from GoldenEye villain Xenia Onatopp (played by Famke Janssen) in playing Séverine.|$|E
