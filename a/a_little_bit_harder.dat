[...] "Everything You Know Is Wrong" [...] is a stylistic {{pastiche}} of They Might Be Giants. Yankovic {{explained that he}} [...] "tried to write a song sort of in their style, but perhaps {{even a little bit}} more twisted". For fans of They Might Be Giants, he put [...] "little references in here and there, little allusions to other songs of theirs". Yankovic later admitted that it [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> I think to decipher exactly where the inspiration is coming from." [...] The song title is taken from the 1974 Firesign Theatre album of the same name.|$|E

In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the points deduction, Arsenal were placed second in the league, eight points behind leaders Liverpool and one in front of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. O'Leary {{expressed}} his disappointment at the docked points: [...] "The champagne will be out at Liverpool tonight because this makes our task very much harder." [...] His teammate Limpar was more optimistic: [...] "It seems very harsh. It makes it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> to catch Liverpool, but it is not impossible." [...] Indeed, Arsenal went on to lose just one game all season and won the First Division title, seven points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. They became England's first representatives in the European Cup since the ban imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster was lifted. Manchester United finished sixth, but did not end the season empty-handed, winning the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup in the first season English clubs were allowed back into UEFA competitions.|$|E
500|$|The season {{confirms}} that the blue alien seen in the first season, and a recurring plot point this season, {{was a member of}} the Kree race, who play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy. Whedon explained that [...] "We obviously showed this body a year ago at around this time. When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we had to talk to features about what their plans were and where they were going." [...] When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to Guardians of the Galaxy, Whedon said [...] "It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In Guardians, we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too." [...] This storyline also introduces the Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their own film.|$|E
500|$|Another story arc saw Charlie {{reveal that}} her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) {{is in fact}} her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline {{challenging}} and felt {{they had to get}} it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but was pleased with the end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?" [...] Breeds said it was a [...] "big exploration" [...] and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said, [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey." [...] Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, [...] "Perhaps this storyline was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>harder,</b> you've seen the start of this storyline and there is a lot more to come and it wasn't easy." ...|$|E

500|$|Espinoza {{positioned}} {{the colt}} {{in third place}} early in the race as Dortmund took the lead, followed closely by Firing Line. The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race, and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside. The favorite took the lead entering the final furlong and won by a length from Firing Line and Dortmund in 2:03.02, with Frosted finishing strongly in fourth. Espinoza, who won {{the race for the}} third time, said, [...] "I feel like the luckiest Mexican on earth. He has been a special horse since the first time I rode him. He has a lot of talent and is an unbelievable horse. Turning for home I started riding <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>harder.</b> At the eighth pole I just couldn't put that other horse away, but he got it done." [...] Espinoza's performance attracted some scrutiny as he appeared to have struck the winner 32 times with his whip during the race. In post-race analysis, one of the stewards at Churchill Downs said, [...] "we watched [...] many, many times prior to making it official, and that wasn't anything that got our attention." [...] Baffert said, [...] "He was hitting him on the saddle towel. He doesn't hit that hard." [...] Gary Stevens, rider of second-place Firing Line, commented that he had used his whip heavily as well, stating that the race was [...] "as tough a race as I've been in in 20 years the last eighth of a mile." [...] The Blood-Horse writer Steve Haskin, while condemning whip overuse in general, offered analysis that Espinoza [...] "did a lot of waving with the whip" [...] and may not have actually hit the horse as many times as it seemed. Reflecting on the race, Baffert said that the colt did not bring his [...] "super A-game" [...] to the Derby and that {{it was the first time}} American Pharoah had really been tested by other aggressive horses.|$|E

[...] Recording this solo was the most challenging aspect of the session; a take that surfaced on a bootleg in the 1980s reveals Harrison fumbling over his strings, losing his timing and missing notes. But {{by the time the}} session ended at 10 p.m. that night, he had sculpted one of his most memorable solos – an upward run played twice and capped with a circular flourish - in illustration of an observation made by engineer Geoff Emerick: [...] "George would {{spend a lot of time}} working out solos. Everything was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> for him, nothing quite came easily." ...|$|E

500|$|Cobain has said, [...] "The entire song {{is made up}} of {{contradictory}} ideas [...] It's {{just making}} fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought."
