40|$|Coal mine {{ventilation}} systems are often subject to high leakage rates. As a result, changes in airflow resistance will strongly affect the efficiency with which air is {{delivered to the}} working place. One major source of airflow resistance is the line brattice used to direct air from the last open crosscut to the working face.

The results showed that the drying rate of clothes in the chamber installed with and without <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fan</b> unit were 2. 26 and 1. 1 kg/h, respectively. In case of the chamber installed with a <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fan</b> unit, the additional power of 0. 011 kWh was consumed and the drying rate was higher than that of clothes drying without <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fan</b> unit. Without <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fan</b> unit installation, no energy was required but there was a portion of hot air leaks away through the punctured holes at the wall of the drying chamber, hence the drying rate was dropped below.

In addition, administrative controls, such as regulating the length of time a diesel-powered vehicle operates underground, may also effectively reduce DPM concentrations. Finally, DPM concentrations can be reduced by increasing the overall ventilation airflow in the mine. Increased ventilation airflow can be achieved by installing large-volume fans and using stoppings or <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fans</b> to direct this ventilation air to the working face of the mine.

Once the decision-making team has selected the appropriate set of ventilation hardware, the duct line is installed across a main drivage and ends up to the most productive working areas.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. South Africa is {{currently}} facing a major electricity crisis {{due to the}} continuous growth in electricity demand. Eskom, the largest electricity supplier in South Africa, have enabled numerous methods to support energy reduction in both the residential and industrial sectors. Programs developed by Eskom to help the different major electricity consuming industries {{with the development of}} energy efficient and load shift strategies, have already been put into practice. These programs solely focus on the potential savings in megawatts each production sector might consist of. The key features of the Eskom electricity reduction initiative are driven by the energy efficiency concept and the peak demand load shift capability. Both the load shift and energy efficient initiatives are mostly active in the mining industry, because of the high electricity consumption levels of a standard mining operation. One of the most inefficient systems currently active within a mining operation is the ventilation control system. This dissertation describes the energy efficient and load shift research on the current underground ventilation system by means of certain design methodologies that might improve the inefficient operational features on both the standard underground auxiliary fans and the main surface fans. The operational features of a standard 2 -pole 45 kW issued <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fan</b> were tested, by using a fan-testing column to compare the performance criteria to that of an improved <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fan</b> design. An energy saving potential on a single 45 kW unit of 11 kW was evident during the testing analysis. This amounted to an estimated annual energy saving potential of R 370, 000. 00 with a total saving of 561 kW on all the installed 45 kW units at Kopanang goldmine, by means of an investment in the replacement of the current installed units with that of the improved units. A secondary study was to gather information on the main surface fan operational features at Kopanang and Mponeng goldmines. The gathered information showed an estimated possibility for load shift and efficiency initiatives, which will result in fan operating life expansion and electricity savings capabilities. Annual electricity savings of up to R I, 500, 000. 00 were calculated on efficiency and load shift strategies and gave an indication on how costly inefficient operations are. The calculated I 0 % increase in main fan efficiency resulted in an annual saving of nearly R 1, 100, 000. 00 with a reduction of 1, 05 MW at Mponeng goldmine and an annual saving of nearly R 721, 000. 00 with a reduction of 675 kW at Kopanang goldmine. The load shift potential at Mponeng and Kopanang goldmines were nearly 3, 5 MW and 2, 25 MW respectively. Capital investments from either Eskom or alternative investors will definitely play a crucial part in the realization of energy efficiency and load shift measures. It may include, improved fan installations, variable speed drives for the main fans and real time management systems. If the mine should decide to invest in these efficient strategies, the proposed Eskom DSM program might result in a net energy savings potential for any mining operation. Master...|$|E

Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane main mine fan that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the propeller fans more than doubled the air quantity while operating at 50 hp less than the original main mine fan system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas. This is because propeller fans are more efficient at lower pressures and can produce large air quantities at lower horsepower requirements than axial vane fans.

40|$|The European Commission {{in joint}} {{collaboration}} with Heavy Duty Vehicle manufactures, the Graz University of Technology and other consulting and research bodies {{has been preparing}} a new legislative framework for monitoring and reporting CO 2 emissions from Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDVs) in Europe. In contrast to passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, for which monitoring is performed through chassis dyno measurements, and considering the diversity and particular characteristics of the HDV market, {{it was decided that}} the core of the proposed methodology should be based on a combination of component testing and vehicle simulation. Emphasis is put on accurately simulating the performance of different vehicle components and achieving realistic fuel consumption results. A proof of concept was launched aiming to test and prove that these targets are achievable. A series of experiments were conducted on 2 different trucks, a Daimler 40 ton Euro VI, long haul delivery truck with semi-trailer and a DAF 18 ton Euro V rigid truck. Measurements were performed at the Joint Research Centre’s HDV chassis dyno labs and on the road. A vehicle simulator (Vehicle Energy Consumption Calculation Tool - VECTO) has been developed to be used for official monitoring purposes and the results of the measurements were used for its validation. As inputs the simulation based methodology considers test track measurement of driving resistances (eg air drag), determination of drivetrain losses (e. g. gearbox), determination of power demand of engine <b>auxiliaries</b> (eg. cooling <b>fan)</b> and other consumers (e. g. steering pump), measurement of the engine fuel consumption map as extension to the engine's type approval tests (as described in EURO VI legislation). CO 2 emissions of the vehicle are then calculated using the aforementioned input data for predefined representative driving cycles and mission profiles. For the two Heavy Duty vehicles tested and simulated on the same test route, fuel consumption was calculated always within a ± 3 % range from the real world measurement, and in several cases even closer than that (in the order of ± 1. 5 %). Given the variability of the actual measurement (σ = 2 %), it is concluded that a future certification scheme can be based on vehicle simulation tools. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
