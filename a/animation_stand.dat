The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an <b>animation</b> <b>stand.</b> The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a matte to block out where the spaceship image was.|$|E
500|$|For {{the scene}} in which Valeria and Subotai had to fend off ghosts to save Conan's life, the [...] "boiling clouds" [...] were created by George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic, while VCE was given the task of {{creating}} the ghosts. [...] Their first attemptfilming strips of film emulsion suspended in a vat of a viscous solutionelicited complaints from the producers, who thought the resulting spirits looked too much like those in a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, so VCE turned to animation to complete the task. [...] First, they drew muscular warriors in ghostly forms onto cels and printed the images onto film with an Oxberry <b>animation</b> <b>stand</b> and contact printer. [...] The Oxberry was fitted with a used lens that introduced lens flares to the prints; VCE's intention with using the old lens {{was to make the}} resultant images of the ghosts seem as if they were of real-life objects filmed with a camera. [...] The final composite was produced by passing the reels of film for the effects and the live-action sequences through a two-headed optical printer and capturing the results with a camera.|$|E
5000|$|Film opticals {{were created}} using Oxberry aerial image cameras, with [...] "many {{animation}} techniques {{used in the}} process."

50|$|However, later Gameloft remakes of {{the games}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Reception for the 2010 remake, Earthworm Jim HD, less positive. IGN and GameSpot both felt that the surreal art style and <b>animation</b> <b>stood</b> the test of time, but felt that some gameplay aspects and controls felt dated in comparison to modern platformers. Similarly, the iPhone version of the game was criticized for its sloppy controls, mostly due to being touchscreen only.|$|R
50|$|<b>Animation</b> <b>stands</b> can be homemade, from {{metal or}} wood, {{such as that}} owned by Los Angeles {{animator}} Mike Jittlov, and still accomplish impressive animation production; or they can be elaborate (and expensive) professionally made precision systems that allow for the computerised movements of both the art and the camera, as has been traditionally used by professional animation studios and special effects facilities such as the Walt Disney studio (famous for their Multiplane camera) and George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) facilities.|$|R

50|$|Photoanimation is a {{technique}} {{as old as the}} motion picture industry, in which still photos, artwork, to other objects are filmed with the use of an <b>animation</b> <b>stand.</b> On the Oxberry Master Series Stand, the compound (platform) of the <b>animation</b> <b>stand</b> moves East-West and North-South or varying degrees of these parameters and tilts at angles up to 45 degrees in any direction with combinations that cover the compass rose. In the meantime the camera, mounted to a steel track, moves up and down relative to the subject being filmed. The E-W/N-S movement combinations and scans are done with a motorized compound that rotates and tilts. Backlighting can also be applied beneath the compound platform to create special visual effects.|$|E

50|$|Disney {{purposely}} planned his new Burbank studio {{around the}} animation process. The large <b>Animation</b> Building <b>stood</b> {{in the center}} of the campus, while adjacent outlying buildings were constructed for the ink-and-paint departments, the camera and editing departments, and the other various functions of the studio. Underground tunnels linked some of the buildings, and the lot also included a movie theatre, a sound stage, and a commissary. The 1941 Disney feature The Reluctant Dragon, which combined live action with animated sequences and starred Robert Benchley, served as a tour of the then-new studio. It was later frequently seen and toured on the various Disney television programs.|$|R

Until 1938, it served as the home of Fleischer Studios (who produced the Popeye, Betty Boop, and Color Classics shorts for Paramount Pictures) as well as the Van Beuren Studios (who produced animated shorts for RKO Radio Pictures) until 1937. It would later be the home for Famous Studios (who replaced Fleischer Studios and continued the production of Popeye shorts for Paramount) from 1943 to the 1960s. Its current position in the animation world is as an alternative to Los Angeles (where most U.S. animation is produced), and the city now houses several schools and school programs concerning <b>animation,</b> and <b>stands</b> as a source of work for animators working for any medium, from advertising to film.|$|R

Documents containing all frame assembly information must also be maintained. This paper presents several production of cartoon animation, overall quality. computer methods for assisting in the both to reduce expense and to improve the Merging is the process of combining levels of artwork into a final composite frame using digital computer graphics. The term "level " refers to a single painted drawing (cel) or background. A method for the simulation of any hypothetical animation camera set-up is introduced. A technique is presented for reducing the total number of merges by retaining merged groups consisting of individual levels which do not change over successive frames. Lastly, a sequence-editing system which controls precise definition of an animated sequence, is described. Also discussed is the actual method for merging any two adjacent levels and several computational and storage optimizations to speed the process...|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, {{the show}} had a massive revamp, with the rocket and flower clocks {{and the three}} windows put in storage in favour of a newer style Play School. The main clock was now simply called the Play School Clock, which was {{controlled}} {{by one of the}} presenters standing {{at the top of the}} clock and turning a winding device, which caused the clue to the story to slide down a slippery dip. That was soon replaced by the Hickory Dickory Clock which featured clockwork resembling the [...] "Hickory Dickory" [...] nursery rhyme. That was soon replaced by the Train Clock which resembles a train station with a clock above it. The windows were also heavily changed. They were now built into a massive rotating prop which was built underneath the clock (shown one week) and 'controlled' by one of the presenters pulling a lever back and forwards. The windows (now including a diamond window) would spin around and would slowly be eliminated as the window they would look through until they got to the fourth window and the camera would slowly zoom in and fade out into the fill. The order in which they appear is Square~Diamond~Round~Arched~Square. That was soon replaced by windows with <b>animation</b> where Jemima <b>stands</b> next to the round window, Little Ted stands next to the square window, Big Ted stands next to the diamond window and Humpty stands next to the arched window and the window chosen goes through to pre-recorded footage.|$|R
40|$|Animation {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} moving image that 2 ̆ 028 is not {{recorded}} from a real-time movement but the 2 ̆ 028 movement created artificially. My concern here is the 2 ̆ 028 visualisation of the space inaccessible for either pho 2 ̆ 028 tographic film image or our sensory apparatus. I see it 2 ̆ 028 as the crucial attribute of animated image that is equally 2 ̆ 028 important for understanding of the animation medium 2 ̆ 028 as the movement making. What the philosopher Paul 2 ̆ 028 Crowther labelled as "proxy space in animated film" 2 ̆ 028 (quoted by Donald Crafton 2013 : 147) could in my own 2 ̆ 028 interpretation be distinguished as {{the creation of the}} diegetic space that only exists in the viewers' imagination, and only in the moment while they are watching the film. Mise-en-scène in animation is always a symbol for a space, no matter how convincing an illusion of three dimensions is created in some particular film. Actually, many animators who are active in our time exploit the fact that digital animation made a possible perception of space totally inaccessible to the photographic film technique. For instance the penetrating camera (fly-through) dissolves the restrictions associated with the pictorial space so that we can reach what we cannot see beyond the picture's surface. However, in this short presentation I aim to examine that aspect of animation in the realm of traditionally made animated films in order to verify the view on the "proxy space" being always {{an essential part of the}} animated image regardless technical or production conditions. In order to explore varied approaches toward the creation of "proxy space" I will look at some canonical films produced during the golden age of Zagreb School of Animation. Those films made by Vladimir Kristl, Dušan Vukotić, Borivoj Dovniković, Vatroslav Mimica and Nedeljko Dragić, provide lot of evidences that prove that <b>animation</b> space <b>stands</b> for an inherent liberation from the limitations of the laws of physics and entering into the world of the fantastic, symbolical and metaphorical. Employing various minimalistic methods the Zagreb animators created a complex multi-dimensional representation of space. By using several film examples I am going to emphasise five different methods in this paper...|$|R
