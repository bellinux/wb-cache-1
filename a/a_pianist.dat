5|$|Chopin's qualities as <b>a</b> <b>pianist</b> and {{composer}} were recognized {{by many of}} his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.|$|E

Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as <b>a</b> <b>pianist</b> and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism between himself and the conductor Michael Costa.|$|E

5|$|In Berlin Busoni was at {{the heart}} of the musical world of the Weimar Republic. His works, {{including}} his operas, were regularly programmed. He continued to perform whilst his health allowed it; problems of hyperinflation in Germany meant that he needed to undertake tours to England. His last appearance as <b>a</b> <b>pianist</b> was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. Amongst his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel and Robert Blum, and he also during these last years had contact with Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, Hermann Scherchen and others.|$|E
5|$|In his 50-year career, Waldron {{recorded}} {{more than}} 100 albums {{under his own}} name and more than 70 for other band leaders. He also wrote for modern ballet, and composed the scores of several feature films. As <b>a</b> <b>pianist,</b> Waldron's roots lay chiefly in the hard bop and post-bop genres of the New York club scene of the 1950s, but with time he gravitated more towards free jazz. He {{is known for his}} dissonant chord voicings and distinctive later playing style, which featured repetition of notes and motifs.|$|E

5|$|After the Revolution, Prokofiev left Russia {{with the}} {{official}} blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky, and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. During that time he married a Spanish singer, Carolina Codina, {{with whom he had}} two sons. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as <b>a</b> <b>pianist,</b> and increasingly turned to Soviet Russia for commissions of new music; in 1936 he finally returned to his homeland with his family. He enjoyed some success there – notably with Lieutenant Kijé, Peter and the Wolf, Romeo and Juliet, and perhaps above all with Alexander Nevsky.|$|E

Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album Cowboy Favorites, released on the Cameo label.|$|E

Upon release after two years, Costa again worked around the New York area, including for bands led by Kai Winding, Johnny Smith, and Don Elliott.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Imogen Holst showed {{precocious}} {{talent in}} composing and performance. After attending Eothen School and St Paul's Girls' School, {{she entered the}} Royal College of Music, where she developed her skills as a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable for health reasons to follow her initial ambitions to be <b>a</b> <b>pianist</b> or a dancer, Imogen {{spent most of the}} 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
