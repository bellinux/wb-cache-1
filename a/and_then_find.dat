5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>find</b> instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} deal with {{problems}} with thousands of variables, it is necessary to use a different approach. One is to first sample one ordering, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>find</b> the optimal BN structure with respect to that ordering. This implies working on the search space of the possible orderings, which is convenient as it is smaller than the space of network structures. Multiple orderings are then sampled and evaluated.

25|$|As {{described}} above, one {{can identify}} significantly regulated genes first <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>find</b> patterns {{by comparing the}} list of significant genes to sets of genes known to share certain associations. One can also work the problem in reverse order. Here is a very simple example. Suppose there are 40 genes associated with a known process, for example, a predisposition to diabetes. Looking at two groups of expression profiles, one for mice fed a high carbohydrate diet and one for mice fed a low carbohydrate diet, one observes that all 40 diabetes genes are expressed {{at a higher level}} in the high carbohydrate group than the low carbohydrate group. Regardless of whether any of these genes would have made it to a list of significantly altered genes, observing all 40 up, and none down appears unlikely {{to be the result of}} pure chance: flipping 40 heads in a row is predicted to occur about one time in a trillion attempts using a fair coin.|$|E
500|$|Adam Elliot {{conceived}} {{the idea behind}} Harvie Krumpet over a ten-year period, and wrote fourteen drafts of the script over three months.

500|$|Beliefs about {{slow lorises}} {{and their use}} in {{traditional}} practices are deep-rooted and go back at least 300years, if not earlier based on oral traditions. [...] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. [...] More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil. The following passage from an early textbook about primates is indicative of the superstitions associated with slow lorises: Many strange powers are attributed to this animal by the natives of the countries it inhabits; there is hardly an event in life to man, woman or child, or even domestic animals, that may not be influenced for better or worse by the Slow Loris, alive or dead, or by any separate part of it, and apparently one cannot usually tell at the time, that one is under supernatural power. Thus a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>find</b> that an enemy had buried a particular part of a Loris under his threshold, which had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own disadvantage. ... life is not a happy one, for it is continually seeing ghosts; that is why it hides its face in its hands.|$|E

Hobson rejected the proposal, insisting the task was so vast it would require them all {{to be engaged in}} inquiries around the country. He directed Spain to proceed immediately to Wellington to investigate the New Zealand Company purchases that were defined in an agreement Hobson had made with the company in September 1841. In that agreement the Crown indicated its acceptance of certain earlier land purchases—110,000 acres at Port Nicholson, Porirua and Manawatu, 50,000 acres at Wanganui and 50,000 acres (later lifted to 60,000 acres) at New Plymouth—with the guarantee conditional on the company proving it had fairly extinguished the Maori title. Spain's task, then, was to first establish who had actually held the title to the lands before they were sold to the company, a difficult task in itself, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>find</b> whether the sales were legitimate. Under instructions from Colonial Secretary Lord Stanley to Governor Robert FitzRoy, any land deemed to be in excess of a valid claim should be retained by the Crown.
