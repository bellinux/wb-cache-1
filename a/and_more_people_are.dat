25|$|Artificial levees block spring {{flood water}} {{that would bring}} fresh water and {{sediment}} to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for {{the oil and gas}} industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. And as the communities disappear, more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> leaving the region. Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry.|$|E
