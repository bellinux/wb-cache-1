50|$|After World War II, Hill {{helped develop}} the similar NRC {{tailless}} glider in Canada. Returning to England, he developed the <b>aero-isoclinic</b> <b>wing</b> and helped Short Brothers develop the Short SB.1 and SB.4 tailless swept-wing test aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Short SB.4 Sherpa was a British {{experimental}} aircraft {{designed and}} built during the 1950s to test the flight characteristics of the <b>aero-isoclinic</b> <b>wing.</b> It was based upon (and used some components of) the Short SB.1, an earlier glider design.|$|E
50|$|The Short SB.1 was a British {{tailless}} glider {{designed by}} David Keith-Lucas and Professor Geoffrey T.R. Hill. Built by Shorts {{as a private}} research venture to test {{the concept of the}} <b>aero-isoclinic</b> <b>wing,</b> it was the first aircraft to incorporate this feature.|$|E
50|$|This radical wing {{configuration}} {{was designed}} to maintain a constant angle of incidence regardless of flexing, by placing the torsion box well back in the wing so that the air loads, acting {{in the region of}} the quarter-chord line, have a considerable moment arm about it. The torsional instability and tip stalling characteristics of conventional swept wings were recognised at the time, together with their tendency to aileron-reversal and flutter at high speed. It was to prevent these effects that the <b>aero-isoclinic</b> <b>wing</b> was designed.|$|E

The SB.1 was towed behind to a 10,000 ft altitude with the flight completed successfully.|$|E
5000|$|After {{extensive}} testing with wind-tunnel and flutter models, {{the design}} team proposed that a manned glider be built.

40|$|Summary. [...] The work {{dealt with}} in this report is of an {{exploratory}} nature primarily intended to provide some understanding of the flutter characteristics of a Hill <b>aero-isoclinic</b> <b>wing.</b> Essentially, this is a swept-back wing elastically designed so that the lifting loads do not affect the aerodynamic incidence. The aero-isoclinic property {{is dependent on the}} change of incidence due to torsion of the wing being neutralised by that produced by wing bending. The simple aero-isoclinic system used in the tests consisted of a rigid aerodynamic lifting surface having the two essential freedoms, rotation about a swept-back axis, and rotation about a perpendicular axis at the root. Flutter critical speeds and frequencies were measured over a range of the ratio of the bending and torsion frequencies; the results show that the aero-isoclinic condition is not sufficient to prevent flutter, and further that the critical speed for flutter may be low. As usual, forward mass-loading of the wing raises the critical speed. A subsidiary part of the report deals with a method of flutter-speed calculation in which the aerodynamic terms are restricted to static derivatives only. No damping terms whatever are present in the equations of motion. The solution yields a boundary between constant amplitude and growing oscillations, which is regarded as the flutter critical condition. The method gives critical flutter speeds that agree surprisingly well with the experiments. 1. Introduction. [...] The idea of an <b>aero-isoclinic</b> <b>wing</b> was put forward by G. T. R.
