These keys are often used to control the player character's movement in computer games, most commonly first person games but also in many driving and third person games. W/S control forward and backward, while A/D control strafing left and right. Typically, modifier keys are not used to strafe (as performed using the Alt + arrow keys in older games such as Doom and Duke Nukem 3D).|$|R

5000|$|Typing {{a period}} or numerals {{requires}} pressing Shift, whereas some rarer characters (ù, the semicolon) do not.

50|$|Perhaps the {{earliest}} game to use ESDF was Crossfire (1981), which used the keys for firing in multiple directions. It is the default configuration for several games such as Tribes 2.

Moreover, these keys are compatible with both QWERTY and <b>AZERTY</b> <b>keyboard</b> layouts, which is a major plus if the game is also released in France or Belgium.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the use of}} eta and tārava {{is equal}} to the usage of such symbols in other Polynesian languages, it is {{promoted}} by lAcadémie Tahitienne and adopted by the territorial government. There are at least a dozen other ways of applying accents. Some methods are historical and no longer used. This can make usage unclear. See list. At this moment lAcadémie Tahitienne seems to have not made a final decision yet whether the eta should appear as a small normal curly comma (’) or a small inverted curly comma (‘). Compare okina. The straight apostrophe (Unicode U+0027) being the default apostrophe displayed when striking the apostrophe key on a usual French <b>AZERTY</b> <b>keyboard,</b> it has become natural for writers to use the straight apostrophe for glottal stops.|$|E
50|$|A {{computer}} keyboard {{is a series}} of electronic switches used to input data into a computer. Each button typically represents one character, but some symbols may only be accessible via a combination of buttons. The layout of the keyboard is like that of a traditional typewriter, although there are some additional keys provided for performing further functions. There are a number of different keyboard layouts available, QwERTY being the standard English-language keyboard layout. The standard English keyboard map is referred to as QWERTY, as the first six keys on the top row of letters are Q, W, E, R, T and Y. Other keyboards layouts include AZERTY and Dvorak. The <b>AZERTY</b> <b>keyboard</b> is a variation of the standard QWERTY keyboard adapted for French-language input. The AZERTY layout modifies the QWERTY layout to add functionality for inputting accented characters. The Dvorak keyboard is designed so that the middle row of keys includes the most common letters, with the goal of allowing greater efficiency and comfort while typing. The keyboard usually contains letters, numbers, punctuation, function and control keys, arrow keys, a keypad, and may include a wristpad.|$|E
