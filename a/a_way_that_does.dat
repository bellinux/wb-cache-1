For orally administered drugs, this usually involves incorporating the drug into a tablet or a capsule.

25|$|Insider {{trading is}} the trading of a corporation's stock or other {{securities}} (e.g. bonds or stock options) by individuals with potential access to non-public {{information about the}} company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal, if this trading is done in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> {{not take advantage of}} non-public information. However, the term is frequently used to refer to a practice in which an insider or a related party trades based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the non-public information was misappropriated from the company. Illegal insider trading is believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.|$|E

500|$|Western philosophers, {{since the}} time of Descartes and Locke, have {{struggled}} to comprehend the nature of consciousness and identify its essential properties.

500|$|The horns are {{normally}} black, {{but may be}} black and white striped; white horns are undesirable. Ideally, horns are smooth and balanced, strongly attached to the skull, and grow in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not impede the animal's sight or grazing abilities. Rams have larger horns than ewes. The horns in two-horned sheep, and the lower horns in four-horned animals, grow in a spiral shape. The rostral set of horns usually extend upwards and outwards, while the caudal set of horns curls downwards {{along the side of}} the head and neck. On polycerate animals it is preferred that there is a fleshy gap between the two pairs of horns. Partial or deformed horns that are not firmly attached to the skull, often referred to as [...] "scurs", are not unusual but are considered undesirable.|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2005, in {{response}} to bombings in London, the New York City Transit Police introduced a new policy of randomly searching passengers' bags as they approached turnstiles. The NYPD claimed that no form of racial profiling would be conducted when these searches actually took place. The NYPD {{has come under fire}} from some groups that claim purely random searches without any form of threat assessment would be ineffectual. Donna Lieberman, Executive Director of the NYCLU, stated, [...] "This NYPD bag search policy is unprecedented, unlawful and ineffective. It is essential that police be aggressive in maintaining security in public transportation. But our very real concerns about terrorism do not justify the NYPD subjecting millions of innocent people to suspicionless searches in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not identify any person seeking to engage in terrorist activity and is unlikely to have any meaningful deterrent effect on terrorist activity." [...] The searches were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in MacWade v. Kelly.|$|E
500|$|The {{station has}} a {{full-length}} mezzanine above the platforms and tracks. All of the mezzanine is still completely open, {{with the exception}} of a tiny closed fenced-off section at the station's eastern end that is accessed from a single closed staircase on the Manhattan-bound platform. [...] However, it is set up in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not allow a free transfer between directions, as the fare control is located in the middle of the mezzanine. The token booth and turnstile banks for either direction are at the center. HEET turnstiles are at either ends near the station's entrances and exits, both of which have two street stairs. The entrance at the west (railroad south) end leads to the northwest corner and southwest corners of Queens Boulevard and 75th Avenue, while the one on the east (railroad north) end leads to southeast corner of Queens Boulevard and 75th Road. Chain-link fences separate the sections of the mezzanine within fare control and the section out of fare control. The section of the mezzanine within fare control used to span across the entire space, but a fare-free underpass under Queens Boulevard now divides the northbound and southbound parts of the mezzanine, and there is no way to make a free transfer between the two platforms anymore.|$|E

500|$|While {{much of the}} {{symbolism}} of the ceiling dates from the early church, the ceiling also has elements that express the specifically Renaissance thinking that sought to reconcile Christian theology with the philosophy of Renaissance Humanism. During the 15th century in Italy, and in Florence in particular, there was a strong interest in Classical literature and the philosophies of Plato, Socrates and other Classical writers. Michelangelo, as a young man, had spent time at the Humanist academy established by the Medici family in Florence. He was familiar with early Humanist-inspired sculptural works such as Donatello's bronze David and had himself responded by carving the enormous nude marble David, which was placed in the piazza near the Palazzo Vecchio, the home of Florence's council. The Humanist vision of humanity was one in which people responded to other people, to social responsibility, and to God in a direct way, not through intermediaries, such as the Church. This conflicted with the Church's emphasis. While the Church emphasized humanity as essentially sinful and flawed, Humanism emphasized humanity as potentially noble and beautiful. These two views were not necessarily irreconcilable to the Church, but only through a recognition that the unique way to achieve this [...] "elevation of spirit, mind and body" [...] was through the Church as the agent of God. To be outside the Church was to be beyond Salvation. In the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo [...] presented both Catholic and Humanist elements in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not appear visually conflicting. The inclusion of [...] "non-biblical" [...] figures such as the Sibyls or Ignudi is consistent with the rationalising of Humanist and Christian thought of the Renaissance. This rationalisation was to become a target of the Counter Reformation.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros often {{incorporates}} Spanish {{into her}} English writing, substituting Spanish words for English ones where {{she feels that}} Spanish better conveys the meaning or improves {{the rhythm of the}} passage. However, where possible she constructs sentences so that non-Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context. In Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories Cisneros writes: [...] "La Gritona. Such a funny name for such a lovely arroyo. But that's what they called the creek that ran behind the house." [...] Even if the English-speaking reader does not initially know that arroyo means creek, Cisneros soon translates it in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not interrupt the flow of the text. She enjoys manipulating the two languages, creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases. In the same book Cisneros writes: [...] "And at the next full moon, I gave light, Tía Chucha holding up our handsome, strong-lunged boy." [...] Previous sentences inform the reader that a baby is being born, but only a Spanish speaker will notice that [...] "I gave light" [...] is a literal translation of the Spanish [...] "dí a luz" [...] which means [...] "I gave birth." [...] Cisneros joins other Hispanic-American US writers such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, Gustavo Pérez Firmat, and Junot Díaz, who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English. Cisneros noted on this process: [...] "All of a sudden something happens to the English, something really new is happening, a new spice is added to the English language." [...] Spanish always has a role in Cisneros's work, even when she writes in English. As she discovered, after writing The House on Mango Street primarily in English, [...] "the syntax, the sensibility, the diminutives, the way of looking at inanimate objects" [...] were all characteristic of Spanish. For Cisneros, Spanish brings to her work not only colorful expressions, but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude.|$|E
