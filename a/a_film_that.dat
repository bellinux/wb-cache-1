5|$|After Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg {{chose to}} {{compensate}} with <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> toned down {{the violence and}} gore. During the five years between Temple of Doom and Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's. Filming locations included Utah, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Dor, {{which was}} {{produced}} by Elahe Hiptoola, had cinematography by Sudeep Chatterjee and editing by Sanjib Datta. For <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> had Hindi as the predominant language with a sporadic use of Urdu, Salim-Sulaiman composed the background score.|$|E
5|$|Babb, {{who gained}} notoriety for his various {{marketing}} gimmicks, occasionally had Leeds make appearances and give lectures at showings of the film. Babb often booked the movie as a midnight presentation {{twice a week}} in the same town; David F. Friedman, who would later use the film in his own double-billings, attributed the distribution plan to <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> was so low in quality that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{director}} Michael Cimino, Antonio Margheriti did {{not want}} to make <b>a</b> political <b>film</b> <b>that</b> was for or against the Vietnam War. He just wanted to make <b>a</b> Vietnam War <b>film</b> <b>that</b> was fun.|$|R

5|$|Development of The Blair Witch Project {{began in}} 1993. While film {{students}} at the University of Central Florida, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez came across {{the idea for the}} film after realizing that they found documentaries on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> combined the styles of both. After graduation, Myrick and Sánchez, along with Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie, and Michael Monello started the production company Haxan Films, derived from Benjamin Christensen's 1922 Swedish-Danish silent documentary horror film Häxan, whose English-language title is Witchcraft Through the Ages.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Friday the 13th was the fifteenth-highest {{grossing}} R-rated film of 2009. Because of {{the significant}} decrease in box office revenues in its second weekend, the film had the sixth-largest second-weekend drop. It is the seventh-largest drop for <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> opened as the top-earning film in the United States. With its $65 million revenue at the North American box office, Friday the 13th is the highest-grossing film among the recent slasher remakes, which comprise When a Stranger Calls (2006), Black Christmas (2006), Halloween (2007), Prom Night (2008), and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009). The film is ranked seventh-highest earning of all horror remakes, and is the seventh-highest earning slasher film in unadjusted dollars.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Jackman later confessed being {{unhappy with}} the final result of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The actor wanted {{primarily}} <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> would deepen the Wolverine character, but “somehow the first Wolverine movie ended up looking like the fourth X-Men — just with different characters.” He tried to avert the same results while doing the next solo film for the character, 2013's The Wolverine.|$|E
5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes them think about the kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love, and the kind of miraculousness of just being alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E
5|$|Not feeling {{qualified}} {{to write the}} script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson. Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for sex offenders. He {{has said that he}} wanted to make <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> would not only entertain people, but also make people get angry and talk about the issues it raised.|$|E

5|$|Pacino's career {{slumped in}} the early 1980s; his {{appearances}} in the controversial Cruising, <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> provoked protests from New York's gay community, and the comedy-drama Author! Author!, were critically panned. However, 1983's Scarface, directed by Brian De Palma, {{proved to be a}} career highlight and a defining role. Upon its initial release, the film was critically panned due to violent content, but later received critical acclaim. The film did well at the box office, grossing over US$45 million domestically. Pacino earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana.|$|E
5|$|Rajkumar Sethupathi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} remake Jeethu Joseph Drishyam (2013), which starred Mohanlal, Meena and Asha Sarath in the lead roles. Following Kamal Haasan suggestion, Sethupathi chose Daggubati Venkatesh to play the lead role in the Telugu version. Haasan previously met Venkatesh in Goa and advised him to act in <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> challenges him as an actor. Venkatesh, along with his brother Daggubati Suresh Babu, then watched Drishyam.|$|E
5|$|Set {{designers}} modeled the set for Our World after {{a corner}} news stand. For each episode, artifacts {{of the period}} being profiled, including magazines and political posters, decorated the set and a movie marquee listed the title of <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> was in theatres of the time. In the foreground was placed an Our World newspaper the headlines of which were the program's title {{and the name of}} that program's producer.|$|E

5|$|She next {{played a}} {{supporting}} role in the comedy-drama Adaptation. (2002), <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> {{tells the story of}} screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a film. She later appeared in the unauthorized biography Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), part of an ensemble cast that included Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore, George Clooney, and Julia Roberts. The movie grossed US$33 million worldwide. That same year, she had a small role in the comedy 40 Days and 40 Nights.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} developed in 1990. After creating films {{which focused on}} the lives of gangsters, director John Woo wanted to make <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> glorified the police instead. Woo admired Clint Eastwood's and Steve McQueen's characters from their films Dirty Harry and Bullitt respectively, and wanted to make his own Hong Kong-style Dirty Harry police detective film. While creating this character, Woo was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to Woo having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop.|$|E
5|$|Val Guest, who had {{directed}} The Quatermass Xperiment, returned for Quatermass 2. Guest once again sought to create <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> felt {{as real as}} possible, using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film's climactic scenes. Guest planned each day’s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots {{he wanted to make}} that day.|$|E

5|$|Visual {{effects for}} Deadpool were {{produced}} by Digital Domain (DD), Atomic Fiction, Blur Studio, Weta Digital, Rodeo FX, and Luma Pictures. Reynolds credited Miller and his visual effects experience with producing <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> looked liked others with much bigger budgets. Motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle agreed with this, noting that Miller held off on {{working on the}} CGI for Colossus until after the film was edited to avoid spending money on shots {{that would not be}} used. Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Rothbart to design and complete the film's 1500 effects shots. These were up from a planned 700 shots, with 800 of them completed in the last four weeks of production.|$|E
5|$|Among big-budget auteurs, Michael Mann {{has worked}} {{frequently}} in a neo-noir mode, with {{such films as}} Thief (1981) and Heat (1995) and the TV series Miami Vice (1984–89) and Crime Story (1986–88). Mann's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir, in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up-to-date visual style and rock- or hip hop–based musical soundtrack. Like Chinatown, its more complex predecessor, Curtis Hanson's Oscar-winning L.A. Confidential (1997), based on the James Ellroy novel, demonstrates an opposite tendency—the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatales is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, {{the year in which}} it is set. Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo-noir Seven (1995) with <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: Fight Club (1999) is a sui generis mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 14 September, 26 Lancasters from the attack forces and the Film Unit {{aircraft}} were ready; 20 of the bombers were armed with Tallboys and the remainder with JW mines. The Mosquito took off bound for Kaafjord at 2:10am, but the planned departure of the bombers at 8:00am was cancelled when it returned to Yagodnik at 6:45 and reported that conditions over the target area were unsuitable. For {{the remainder of the}} day the Soviets provided hospitality including a formal lunch, a football tournament and <b>a</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> night. Some of the Allied airmen were disturbed to see political prisoners being beaten by overseers while undertaking forced labour. Work on repairing the damaged Lancasters also continued on 14 September, and an additional Tallboy-armed aircraft was ready by the next morning.|$|E
