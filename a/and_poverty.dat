40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} theoretical relationship between income <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> multidimensional <b>poverty,</b> <b>and</b> to explore the empirical linkages and discrepancies between {{these two types of}} poverty using the Alkire-Foster (AF) multidimensional poverty measurement method with 2011 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data. Regarding the relationship between income <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> multidimensional <b>poverty,</b> poverty can be summarised as not the mere lack of income but the deprivation of human basic capability, covering both monetary <b>and</b> non-monetary <b>poverty.</b> The statistical analysis on income <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> multidimensional <b>poverty</b> measurement shows that the coincidence of income <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> multidimensional <b>poverty</b> is 31 %. In other words, 69 % of multidimensionally poor households are not considered poor in terms of income poverty. The econometric results indicate that an increase in income can significantly reduce the incidence of multidimensional poverty in each dimension, but the impact is limite.

5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social <b>and</b> <b>poverty</b> characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E

Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an {{economic}} downturn beginning in the mid-20thcentury. The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse, <b>and</b> <b>poverty</b> associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E

Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E

His interest in football developed at a young age, which persuaded his parents, despite financial difficulties, to buy him a pair of football boots as a Christmas present when he asked for them aged seven. Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.|$|E

The Northumbrian Priests' Law which is usually attributed to Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York, might have been authored instead by Cynesige, or possibly Cynesige's predecessor Ælfric Puttoc.
