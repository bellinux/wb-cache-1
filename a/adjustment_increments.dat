5000|$|Many modern reticles are {{designed}} for (stadiametric) rangefinding purposes. Perhaps {{the most popular and}} well-known ranging reticle is the [...] "Mil-dot" [...] reticle, which consists of duplex crosshairs with small dots at milliradian (Mil or 1/1000 of a radian) intervals in the field of view. This reticle has gained significant acceptance in NATO and other military and law enforcement organizations. Training and practice will enable a user to measure the range to objects of known size, the size of objects at known distances, and compensate for both bullet drop and wind drift at known ranges with reasonable accuracy. To promote methodological uniformity, (mental) calculations and communication between spotters and snipers in sniper teams, the elevation or vertical adjustment and windage controls of Mil-dot reticle equipped telescopic sights are usually adjustable in (decimal) 0.1 milliradian increments. There are, however, (military) Mil-dot equipped telescopic sights that use coarser or finer reticle <b>adjustment</b> <b>increments.</b>|$|E
40|$|The water {{relations}} and anatomical and morphological changes of Lotus creticus sub. creticus seedlings to two irrigation treatments (water stress and control) and temperature (unheated and night-heated greenhouse) {{was investigated in}} nursery conditions. Shoot and root growth, leaf stomatal density, leaf trichome density, xylem vessels in roots and stems and water relations were studied because of their relation with drought resistance. Water stress led to substantial losses in dry weight, leaf area, root dry weight and length. The limited osmotic adjustment reached by the plants may not maintain leaf turgor and growth. In general deficit irrigation produced Lotus plants with greater leaf trichome densities and number of xylem vessels of stems and roots. Night-time heating had little influence on these aspects, temperature reduced leaf water potential of water stressed plants but {{had no effect on}} well-watered plants. Deficit irrigation under nursery conditions induced a suite of morphological and physiological adaptations (reduction in leaf area, development of osmotic <b>adjustment,</b> <b>increments</b> of leaf hairs and number of xylem vessels of stem and roots) that might allow a considerable capacity to adapt to adverse conditions after transplanting.

40|$|A pattern {{recognition}} and classification software {{was developed to}} detect dust devils automatically in surface images from Mars. The amount of images taken by spacecraft orbiting Mars is increasing continuously and the expenditure of time is too high to search every image for spatially and temporally highly variable features like dust devils. The {{pattern recognition}} method was therefore used to conduct a completely new kind of search for dust devils. Images from the three different Mars missions Viking, Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express can be processed {{and for the first}} time automatically scanned for the desired objects.

40|$|The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) {{mission has}} been {{collecting}} global L-band (1. 4 GHz) brightness temperature observations every 1 - 3 days since 31 March 2015. These observations {{are sensitive to}} soil moisture and soil temperature in the near-surface layer. They {{are used in the}} Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS- 5) land data assimilation system to generate the Level 4 Soil Moisture (L 4 _SM) product, which provides 3 -hourly, 9 -km resolution, global estimates of surface (0 - 5 cm) and root zone (0 - 100 cm) soil moisture along with related land surface states and fluxes with a latency of ~ 3 days. This presentation investigates the soil moisture analysis underlying the L 4 _SM product. The soil moisture analysis converts the differences between model-predicted brightness temperatures and SMAP observations into <b>adjustments</b> (or <b>increments)</b> to the modeled soil moisture state based on error correlations between the modeled and observed variables. The analysis (i) uses an ensemble approach, (ii) is spatially distributed, (iii) performs downscaling from the resolution of the observations to the of the model, and (iv) respects the relative uncertainties of the modeled and observed brightness temperatures, thereby resulting in soil moisture estimates that meet the root-mean-square error target of 0. 04 m 3 /m 3 (after removal of the long-term mean differences). The early results presented here focus on an in-depth investigation of the observation-minus-forecast residuals, which reveals modest biases in the assimilation system. Furthermore, the investigation demonstrates where the assimilation system overestimates or underestimates the actual errors in the system. Finally, the increments that are applied to the model states are investigated. status: publishe...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Society of American Foresters and can be found at: [URL] strategies such as thinning may minimize productivity losses from a variety of forest disturbances, including forest insects. This study analyzed the 10 -year postthinning response of stands and individual trees in thinned white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) plantations in northern Minnesota, USA, with light to moderate defoliation from eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens). Using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, model results suggested overprediction of stand basal area growth and tree diameter increment in these stands. Growth modifiers indicated that trees growing in unthinned stands and with greater defoliation levels (i. e., 20 ‐ 32 %) would need the largest <b>adjustment</b> for diameter <b>increment.</b> Modifiers for height were similarly specified to compensate for the underprediction of height increment in these stands. Thinned stands continued to maintain target live crown ratios in excess of 0. 40, suggesting long-term productivity. Results highlight the need for simulation models that represent appropriate responses to stands and trees affected by forest insects and diseases. Ultimately, accurate representations of growth and development in these models that account for influences of biotic disturbance agents are essential under future global change scenarios, particularly as silvicultural strategies are implemented to reduce the impacts of forest health threats and other stressors...|$|R

Se incluyeron los eventos correspondientes a 120 partos de 54 hembras que se aparearon con 22 machos durante un período de tres años. Los animales presentaron promedios de 94, 277 y 407 g, para nacimiento (231 crías), destete (204) y saca (170), respectivamente. Las distribuciones del peso {{corporal}} son del tipo "normaloide", con ligera asimetría positiva. Los coeficientes de correlación entre pesos corporales disminuyen con el transcurso del tiempo. Los promedios de peso se diferencian en cada etapa de vida del animal, según el sexo y el tamaño de camada; para compensar los efectos, los datos se ajustaron en forma multiplicativa y se corrigieron linealmente por edad. Para la selección de reproductores se ensayaron tres criterios: grupo de mejor comportamiento, padres que no difieren significativamente del mejor reproductor y padres con hijo, homogéneamente más pesados. La estimación de heredabilidad para el incremento post-destete por el método de Hermanos Medios Paternos, arrojó un valor de 0. 298 y mediante el ajuste multiplicativo, se incrementó en un 72 % con la combinación de los tres factores. Con base en los datos ajustados se definió como criterio de selección de crías, las características peso a 90 días e incremento post destete, exigiendo en forma simultánea el requisito de estar por encima de la media general más 0. 5 veces la desviación estándar.

It was shown that the standard dust devil is filtered and correctly classified. The two main features, the bright spot representing the dust column and the shadow, must be filterable from the background. Crater rims and hills are the most false-positive objects. Three regions, Amazonis Planitia, Syria Planum and Chryse Planitia have been searched for dust devils by applying the software to all HRSC images available for these areas. Together with images where it was known before that dust devils are included, a total of 205 dust devils were analysed. A detailed statistics was prepared listing their diameters and heights, {{and for the first time}} the forward speeds of dust devils. The time of day, the season and the locations are noted as well. The mean diameter is 230 m, the height is 660 m on average. They occur from late morning to late afternoon following the daily insolation. Most dust devils have been observed in spring and summer of the respective hemisphere, but formation in autumn and especially in winter was also seen. Dust devils move with the ambient wind, even at high speeds, which were formerly thought to be the reason that dust devil occurrence is suppressed. The computed speeds can be used as an indirect measurement of the near-surface wind speeds. Dust devils evolve wherever the atmospheric conditions are suitable and are not limited to certain regions or altitudes. A preference for dust devil activity can be seen in the 50 to 60 degree latitude range due to the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation. The high frequency of dust devils in the Amazonis Planitia region that was observed before can not be verified so far. The southern part of Chryse Planitia seems to be a region favourably for dust devil formation. The lifetimes of dust devils are a few minutes but increase with larger sizes and were measured up to 30 min. All derived characteristics were used to compute the dust lifting rates by a typical HRSC dust devil, which resulted in most reliable values between 9. 39 E- 04 to 2. 35 E- 01 kg/m 2 /a. This suggests a significant contribution of dust devils to the dust cycle on Mars. A comparison between dust devils analysed by the rover Spirit and those detected by HRSC revealed that most results complement each other suggesting that future dust devil studies should be performed with both methods, from the surface with a lander and with orbiter images...|$|R
