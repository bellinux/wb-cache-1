40|$|The {{electricity}} {{industry is}} currently experiencing a significant paradigm shift in managing electrical resources. With {{the onset of}} aging infrastructure and growing power demands, and the influx of intermittent renewable energy generation, grid system operators are looking towards energy storage as a solution for mitigating industry challenges. An emerging storage solution is underwater {{compressed air energy storage}} (UWCAES), where air compressors and turbo-expanders are used to convert electricity to and from compressed air stored in submerged accumulators. This work presents three papers that collectively focus on the design and optimization of an UWCAES system. In the first paper, the field performance of a distensible <b>air</b> <b>accumulator</b> is studied for application in UWCAES systems. It is followed by a paper that analyzed the energetic and exergetic performance of a theoretical UWCAES system. The final paper presents a multi-objective UWCAES optimization model utilizing a genetic algorithm to determine optimum system configurations...|$|E

40|$|The method {{involves}} {{guiding the}} air in a closed circuit from the absorber chamber to the heat accumulator and back again. A solar collector (4) is fixed {{to the outer wall}} of a building (1) and is operated with air as the heat conveyor. The air is conveyed via an accumulator duct (13) for transferring heat from the <b>air</b> to heat <b>accumulator</b> material. The enclosed absorber chamber has two connections for the inflow and outflow of the <b>air.</b> The heat <b>accumulator</b> is formed by the roof (5) of the building. The accumulator is insulated {{on the side of the}} building external wall. ADVANTAGE - The solar energy is better utilised as a result of the accumulator element. Losses are minimised by the closed circuit system, and the system is very easily regulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a sensor capable of detecting temperature changes {{as a function of}} viscosity changes, was completed. This type of sensor, consisting of an orifice bridge circuit, resulted in a device with a threshold above internally generated noise of 0. 8 C (1. 5 F). Data were obtained using a noise free Freon source provided by an air pressurized bladder. Tests conducted to operate the sensor from a typical Freon centrifugal pump system employing an <b>air</b> bubble <b>accumulator</b> for noise attentuation disclosed the sensor could be used only to sense temperature changes greater than 3. 3 C (6 F) because of the excessively noisy output. This is attributed to the high frequency-pressure fluctuations in the Freon supply to the sensor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, we {{analyzed}} {{the origin of}} pressure fluctuation of ceramic filter during recoiling washing process and found that reducing such pressure fluctuation necessitates {{the use of an}} accumulator. From functions, types, volume to define the types of accumulators, and by employing the TT- 12 type of ceramic filter machine as an example, according to known conditions and through calculation and analysis, we determined the <b>air</b> pressure and <b>accumulator</b> volume and chose the NXQA- 16 / 10 -L-A accumulator. With the use of this type of accumulator, we demonstrated that the pressure fluctuation was reduced to be within 0. 02 MPa when the air pressure was 0. 1 MPa, which satisfied the requirements for recoiling washing...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis research is to analyze the pneumatic suspension systems to improve their vibration isolation performance. The work presented in this thesis addresses modeling, analysis {{and control of the}} pneumatic suspension system. First, the static and dynamic characteristics of a generic pneumatic suspension system are studied, followed by the development of a nonlinear model of the pneumatic suspension system for multiple operating conditions. An <b>air</b> spring- <b>accumulator</b> system has various dynamic nonlinearities which are explored extensively through numerous simulations as well as exhaustive experimental work. One of the main objectives of this work was to better understand the physics behind the operation of air spring-accumulator system, obtain reliable math model, and develop effective control design for such systems. In terms of of the controller design, a control-oriented analytical model is obtained by the system identification techniques. Then, a model reference H-infinity controller design is presented based on the system-id where control input is the modulation of orifice opening using an electronically-controlled proportional solenoid valve. The experimental results show that the closed-loop system with designed controller significantly improved the vibration isolation performance over a wide frequency range. It is shown that the inherent vibration isolation characteristics of air spring-accumulator system can be exploited through careful modeling and advanced control design. The pneumatic system offers a much economical and easy way to maintain low weight isolation system for various applications such as over the road trucks, automobiles, gurneys. etc. Finally, potential enhancements to the system are proposed for future work...|$|R
40|$|Cumulative {{effect of}} {{transmitted}} vibrations to the tractor driver not only leads to driver health problems, but also reduces the driver working efficiency. Tractor suspension system {{is one of}} the methods which is employed to lower the level of transmitted vibrations to the driver. In this study the design and performance assessment of a semi-active suspension model of tractor cabin was considered. Tractor full vibration model was developed first, and subsequently a semi-active ON-OFF damper model was designed. The examination of the model indicated that doubling the piston area and the volume of hydraulic <b>accumulator</b> <b>air</b> chamber, led to 39 % increase and 31 % reduction of the resonance frequency of transmitted vibrations to the driver, respectively. On the other hand doubling the piston area and the primary air pressure of the accumulator, affected the RMS of transmitted vibration to the driver by 77 cm s- 2 reduction and 66 cm s- 2 increase, respectively. Moreover, the numerical comparison of the model outputs with and without activation of semi-active cabin suspension, while the model was stimulated with the same input function, led to 43 % improvement in RMS acceleration of the transmitted vibrations to the tractor seat. Therefore, the designed semi-active suspension model of cabin was able to attenuate the level of transmitted vibrations to the tractor driver...|$|R
40|$|A {{vortex ring}} is a torus-shaped vortex {{consisting}} of a region of fluid spinning around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop. It is an important phenomenon in animal kingdom and engineering applications. Birds and flying insects use buoyant vortex ring to glide higher altitudes; squid and jellyfish produce vortex rings during propulsion; vortex rings also participate in the blood flow through the human hearts. With {{the help of the}} vortex ring, animals can move fast and produce large thrust. In engineering, the Underwater Compressed Air Energy Storage (UWCAES) system uses surplus electricity to compress <b>air</b> into flexible <b>accumulators</b> (balloons) to store energy underwater. Balloons of stored compressed air may rupture when over-pressurized or pierced by a sharp object. This may generate a large-scale buoyant vortex ring, leading to water surface disruptions and undesirable waves. As a result, it is a necessity to study the hydrodynamics of a buoyant vortex ring. This work presents three papers to {{have a better understanding of}} the fluid dynamics of a buoyant vortex ring. The first two papers focus on the flow behavior of a buoyant vortex ring and the third paper studies the vortex rings’ influence on the ambient fluid (flow behind a buoyant vortex ring). The first paper characterized the formation conditions of a buoyant vortex ring and its transition behavior from a laminar to a turbulent vortex ring. It is followed by a paper investigating the flow characteristics of a buoyant vortex ring experimentally, including rising velocity, ring radius, relative core size, circulation and the energy development of a buoyant vortex ring. The final paper analyzed the wake of a vortex ring by simplifying that the core of a vortex ring is solid. This part of the work was conducted in a closed loop wind tunnel...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{drivability}} and increase safety {{a major part}} of Scania’svehicles is fitted with a retarder. The retarder is a complementary brake system that assists the vehicles mechanical brakes. When running a retarder some oil leakage can occur. The main source to the leakage is oil sump ventilation but there is also some contribution from the solenoid valve block that controls the retarder. Test results from the test rig shows that with rather simple methods the oil leakage in form of oil mist can be captured. The efficiency of for instance concept 1 with half the volume and a chicane interior was as high as 99 to 100 %. For the concept 2 with the expanded metal filter the efficiency was in the order of 96 to 100 %. From testing it has also become clear {{that there is a problem}} to feed the oil back into the oil sump. Initial tests shows that the retarder is rather sensitive regarding the placing of the feedback channel. It is considered that the best option is to only use the feedback channel that enters the internal drain of the retarder. Measurements show that the airflow in the tube from the accumulator could reach velocities up to 67 m/s. It is considered that the best solution is to have two separate chambers, one for the accumulator and one for the oil sump ventilation, the safety valve and the proportion valve. The reason for this is that the combination of oil in a chamber together with high airflow from the accumulator is disastrous and the retarder leaks far worse compared to original. The conclusion is therefore that it is important to separate <b>air</b> from the <b>accumulator</b> from places where oil can occur. Tests also revealed that the size of an external volume is not of any great importance when it comes to colleting oil. There was no significant difference in between of using a volume of 0. 64 l or 0. 19 l. However regarding overfilling it is favorable to have a larger volume since this increases the retarder’s capability to withstand oil leakage when it is overfilled...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis provides a methodology of designing, modeling and controlling a fully pneumatic semi-active vibration isolator system. The prototype vibration isolator system {{has the ability to}} adjust the damping and natural frequency characteristics of the system. It consists of an air spring, a variable orifice valve, and an accumulator. In this conguration, the spring characteristics are provided by the <b>air</b> spring and <b>accumulator,</b> while the variable orifice valve provides the damping characteristics. The valve is computer regulated according to the innovative control laws that were developed for the pneumatic system. The vibration isolator system is designed to work in the vibration environment that is typically observed in the case of Class 7 and 8 vehicles as dened by the U. S Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. In order to design a vibration isolator system for the intended application, a benchmarking study was conducted to gain additional insight on OEM vibration isolator systems features and limitations. Based on the insights obtained from this study, the design requirements for the system were dened. This paper presents a methodology of producing a plant model that is based on supplier 2 ̆ 7 s engineering specications and experimental characterization. The plant model includes a complete characterization of nonlinear pressure to volume and eective area to ride height relationships. A detailed design process of selecting and implementing components to optimize system performance is also provided. The plant model was then used to design three semiactive controllers that use position and pressure feedback signals that exploit the nonlinear characterizations to measure direct force generation. The semi-active controllers that were designed for this novel pneumatic vibration isolator system include: a LQI (Linear Quadratic Impulse) optimal controller, Modied Skyhook controller, and a Relative Displacement controller. This vibration isolator system was designed, fabricated, and tested using a prototype electronic height control system. A comprehensive design process for the specialized height control system is also presented. The performance of the system was evaluated using a custom testing apparatus that was built specically for this vibration isolator research. The testing apparatus was designed to accommodate dierent isolator systems and excite them with simulated road disturbances to obtain head-to-head system comparisons. This research presents a comparison between the system performances of an OEM Peterbilt cab suspension unit and the innovative fully pneumatic semi-active vibration isolator prototype using the three dierent control laws. It was found that the properly tuned controllers were able to provide desired dynamic characteristics over the range of common ride frequencies...|$|R
