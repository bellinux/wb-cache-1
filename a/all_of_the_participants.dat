Hemme stated that she couldn't wait to get her hands on Victoria, but during the segment, Victoria interrupted the interview by smashing a glass jar on the back of Hemme's head.|$|E

500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E

In 1995, U2 and Eno wrote the song [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] as a response to [...] "the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of Sarajevo". One such act was a beauty pageant organized by Bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their [...] "lipstick and heels". During the pageant, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said, [...] "Don't let them kill us". [...] The winner of the pageant, 17-year-old Inela Nogić, later said the pageant [...] "was a crazy thing to do during a war. But we tried to live a normal life. It was some kind of a defence mechanism we all had." [...] Years later, Bono said, [...] "It was pure Dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song." [...] Of the song's meaning, he said, [...] "Everywhere people had heard their call for help—but help never came. That was the feeling. I had tried to tackle subjects like this head-on, but I'd learnt a lesson. You have to try and make the same points, in a different, less direct, more surrealist way."

[...] The Bábí combatants represented almost every social class, including clergymen, merchants, craftsmen, {{and representatives of the}} landed nobility; the youngest was a twelve year old boy.
