5|$|In {{the next}} match, Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter faced Deuce 'n Domino for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Deuce 'n Domino {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match and mocked the champs because of their feud over the United States Championship, which MVP held. Deuce N' Domino took advantage of Hardy and MVP's fight {{with each other and}} isolated Hardy. Hardy tossed MVP out of the ring and delivered <b>a</b> <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate to Deuce and pinned Deuce. In result, MVP and Matt Hardy retained the WWE Tag Team Title.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up {{the outside of the}} cage, but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering <b>a</b> <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of the}} cage before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E

5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps <b>a</b> <b>twist</b> <b>of</b> irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E
5|$|Hardy {{returned}} from injury on the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, making an announcement that his brother, Matt, would face TNA World Heavyweight Champion Ethan Carter III in a Full Metal Mayhem match, in which Matt was unsuccessful. After a brief hiatus, Hardy returned on the August 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, {{where he and}} Matt made an agreement that if Matt would lose his second match against Carter for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, then Jeff would become his personal assistant. Matt was unsuccessful, and Jeff was forced to be Carter's assistant. On the September 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, after refusing to hit Spud, then hitting Carter with <b>a</b> <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate, Hardy quit as Carter's personal assistant, therefore also (storyline) quitting TNA. On the September 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, TNA President Dixie Carter announced that Hardy would be the special guest referee in the three-way dance TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Carter, his brother Matt, and Drew Galloway at Bound for Glory. At the event, Hardy turned on Carter by hitting him with a steel chair with Matt hitting the Twist of Fate, thus giving Matt his first TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy made an appearance on January 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling on its live Pop TV debut backstage and ringside to support his brother Matt in the semi-finals and finals of the TNA World Title Series, which Matt had later lost.|$|E
5|$|In the Smackdown main event, Triple H {{defended the}} WWE Championship in a Championship Scramble against Jeff Hardy, The Brian Kendrick, Shelton Benjamin, and Montel Vontavious Porter. The match began with Jeff Hardy and Shelton Benjamin, with both men wrestling inconclusively {{until the first}} five-minute {{interval}} had passed, and Brian Kendrick entered the match. Soon after his entrance, Hardy performed a reverse powerbomb on Benjamin, covering him & scoring a pinfall to become the interim WWE Champion. Later, Kendrick performed The Kendrick on Hardy and covered him for a pinfall, becoming the temporary WWE Champion. Shortly after, the second five-minute interval expired and MVP entered the match. All four men in the match continued to fight, with no pinfalls being scored until the third five-minute interval expired, at which point Triple H entered the match. Soon after his entrance, he performed a spinebuster, followed by a Pedigree on Kendrick, pinning him to become the interim champion. Hardy returned to the ring and performed <b>a</b> <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate on MVP, pinning him to become the temporary champion. After disrupting Hardy's attempt to perform a maneuver off the top turnbuckle, Triple H performed Pedigree on Kendrick to become interim champion again. Shortly after, however, Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb on Kendrick and again became temporary champion after a cover. At the end, Triple H performed a Pedigree on MVP and Hardy performing a Swanton Bomb on Benjamin; however, Triple H covered MVP faster and scored the pinfall with one second remaining on the clock. The time limit expired and Triple H retained the WWE Championship.|$|E

5|$|On the July 24 Impact Wrestling, Hardy {{told the}} {{audience}} that we {{had not seen the}} last of Willow and then brought out Matt Hardy, his brother, to reform The Hardys. The Wolves joined them in the ring and challenged them to a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship at , which the Hardys agreed to. At Destination X, the Hardys lost against the Wolves, but shook hands after the match. On October 22, 2014, The Hardys entered a number one contenders tournament for the TNA World Tag Team Championships defeating The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and DJ Z) {{in the first round of}} the tournament. On October 29, episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys defeated Team Dixie (EC3 and Tyrus) in the semifinals to advance to the finals of the tournament where they defeated Samoa Joe and Low Ki to become number one contenders for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the January 7 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy along with his brother Matt were at ringside for The Wolves vs. James Storm and Abyss; during the match, The Great Sanada and Manik attempted to interfere in the match, but then ended up receiving a Side Effect from Matt Hardy, and <b>a</b> <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate from Jeff Hardy. Despite that, it distracted Eddie Edwards, who then received a Last Call super kick from Storm. At the Lockdown episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy suffered a minor concussion which was set as a storyline injury when he fell on the door of the cage; James Storm hit Hardy off the door onto the steel steps below with a cowbell. The falling off the cage spot was covered in mainstream media such as USA Today and TMZ. Hardy returned after TNA United Kingdom tour. In March, The Hardys participated in a tournament for the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship. On March 16, 2015, The Hardys won an Ultimate X match for the belts for the first time as a team and individually. On May 8, 2015, the Hardys were forced to vacate the TNA World Tag Team Championship due to Jeff suffering a broken leg in a legitimate dirt bike accident.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match of}} the evening was the fourth-annual Money in the Bank ladder match, in which there were no {{disqualifications}} or countouts, {{and the only way}} to win the match was to climb a ladder in the ring and retrieve a contract briefcase hanging above. The match featured Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy, and Carlito from the Raw brand; CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand; and Montel Vontavious Porter (M.V.P.) from the SmackDown brand. Jeff Hardy was supposed to be in the match, but he violated the wellness program and was taken out of the match. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault onto other competitors outside the ring while holding a ladder against his chest. Later, while Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a ladder, Benjamin climbed another ladder placed adjacent to the first one and performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the ladder. Later, Carlito and Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a ladder in the ring, sending him crashing through another ladder set-up between the barricade and the ring apron. When MVP was close to retrieving the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy (returning to action after suffering a legitimate injury), entered the ring from the crowd, climbed the ladder, and delivered <b>a</b> <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate to MVP off that ladder. As soon as Morrison started to climb a ladder, see-sawing with another ladder, Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring-ropes groin-first. Jericho even performed a Codebreaker on Punk using a ladder. In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a ladder, but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the ladder's steps and retrieved the briefcase to win the match. This was an interpromotional match.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the reconnection of two untwisted, linked quantised vortex rings in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We {{show that the}} reconnection is capable of transferring helicity, from the links present in the initial configuration, to <b>a</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> the resulting vortex ring, and hence a rotation of the phase plane along the vortex ring. As velocities in a quantum fluid are the gradient <b>of</b> the phase, <b>a</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> the phase along the vortices leads to an axial flow along the vortices. Hence {{one would expect that}} the dynamics of quantum turbulence are strongly influence by the helicity of the initial conditions or the system forcing.

40|$|Quantum double construction, {{originally}} due to Drinfeld and {{has been}} since generalized even to the operator algebra framework, is naturally associated with a certain (quasitriangular) R-matrix R.
