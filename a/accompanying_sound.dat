25|$|The premiere {{was set for}} October 6, 1927, at Warner Bros.' {{flagship}} {{theater in}} New York City; it was chosen to coincide with Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday around which much of the movie's plot revolves. The buildup to the premiere was tense. Besides Warner Bros.' precarious financial position, the physical presentation of the film itself was remarkably complex: Each of Jolson's musical numbers was mounted on a separate reel with a separate <b>accompanying</b> <b>sound</b> disc. Even though the film was only eighty-nine minutes long...there were fifteen reels and fifteen discs to manage, and the projectionist {{had to be able}} to thread the film and cue up the Vitaphone records very quickly. The least stumble, hesitation, or human error would result in public and financial humiliation for the company. None of the four Warner brothers were able to attend: Sam Warner—among them, the strongest advocate for Vitaphone—had died the previous day of pneumonia, and the surviving brothers had returned to California for his funeral.|$|E
25|$|His {{family was}} long {{associated}} with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in Dublin, and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his The Standard Elocutionist (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. The Standard Elocutionist appeared in 168 British editions and sold {{over a quarter of}} a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its <b>accompanying</b> <b>sound.</b> Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic, and even Sanskrit, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.|$|E

500|$|Tank is a two-player maze game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a tank, attempt to shoot each other. The maze {{is a set of}} blocks set at right angles to each other with an empty square central area all viewed from above; the shape of the maze is not symmetric, and is the same between games. One of the tank sprites is white and the other is black, while the central area is filled with black X marks representing land mines. The tanks can fire shells, which destroy the other tank if they hit; tanks are also destroyed if they hit a land mine. The destruction of a tank grants the opposing player a point and causes a brief explosion and <b>accompanying</b> <b>sound,</b> during which time the other tank cannot shoot, before restoring the tank at the same position. Destroyed land mines do not return. Points are displayed above the play area, and flash during the final twenty seconds of the round. The game continues until the time runs out, after which the player with the higher point value wins the match. Each game typically costs a quarter and lasts for 60 seconds, but an internal toggle adjusts it to two quarters and 120 seconds. [...] The time can be further adjusted by operators.|$|E
2500|$|Slow motion during {{weightlessness}} was inaccurately portrayed; {{the director}} had discovered this when riding the Vomit Comet, {{but he kept}} the slow motion to meet audiences' expectations. The film's premise of the sun dying out is also inaccurate, since the Sun is estimated to die out in five billion years' time, after becoming a red giant and not by a gradual decline in brightness, and not from a Q-ball. Another purposeful inaccuracy was the [...] "whooshing" [...] of the ship, despite there actually being no sound in the vacuum of space; Cox later mentioned in the BBC's Stargazing Live programme in January 2011 that this was simply because without <b>accompanying</b> <b>sound,</b> the CGI shots seemed [...] "cheap".|$|E
