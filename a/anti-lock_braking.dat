5|$|MacPherson struts {{are used}} in the front suspension, and an unusual three-link De Dion tube/Watt's linkage is used in the rear. Front discs with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> (ABS) and {{electronic}} brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>Braking</b> System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake</b> {{controller}} is {{also known}} as the CAB (Controller <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>Brake).</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{much more}} {{successful}} system was {{to fit the}} tractor with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes.</b> Fitted originally to airplanes in the 1950s, <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> have significantly {{reduced the number of}} heavy vehicle accidents.|$|R
50|$|BMW {{introduced}} <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> {{on production}} motorcycles {{starting in the}} late 1980s. The generation of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles {{pave the way for}} the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E

50|$|An actuary may {{refer to}} risk homeostasis, where (for example) {{people who have}} <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> have no better safety record than those without <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes,</b> because the former unconsciously {{compensate}} for the safer vehicle via less-safe driving habits. Previous to the innovation of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes,</b> certain maneuvers involved minor skids, evoking fear and avoidance: Now the anti-lock system moves the boundary for such feedback, and behavior patterns expand into the no-longer punitive area. It has also been suggested that ecological crises are an instance of risk homeostasis in which a particular behavior continues until proven dangerous or dramatic consequences actually occur.|$|R

25|$|As a first example, {{consider}} an <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system, directed by a microcontroller chip. The microcontroller {{has to make}} decisions based on brake temperature, speed, and other variables in the system.|$|E
25|$|All models come {{standard}} with side torso airbags, {{side curtain}} airbags, <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> and electronic brakeforce distribution. For the 2010 model the previously optional Vehicle Stability Control and traction control systems became standard.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> systems use {{different}} schemes {{depending on the}} type of brakes in use. They can be differentiated by the number of channels: that is, how many valves that are individually controlled—and the number of speed sensors.|$|E
50|$|Brakes were {{enlarged}} and <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> (ABS) {{was added}} as standard equipment.|$|R

25|$|In 2008, Harley {{added the}} <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> {{system as a}} factory {{installed}} option on all VRSC models. Harley also increased the displacement of the stock engine from , which had only previously been available from Screamin' Eagle, and added a slipper clutch as standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|Prior to launch, various {{observers}} {{said the}} Ninja H2-H2R {{could be expected}} to have electronic rider aids including <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system (ABS), traction control (KTRC), engine braking control (KEBC), Kawasaki quick shifter (KQS), electronic steering damper (ESD), and launch control (KLCM) which are now confirmed.|$|E
25|$|The A1 model {{features}} uprated AxleTech 5000 Series axles, an <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system with traction control and a Dana central tire inflation system. Armor mode increases tire pressures {{to compensate for}} the added weight of the B-kit armor. The operator can manually increase or decrease differential locking based on conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{interest}} of safety, rear-wheel <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> (ABS) became standard in 1987.|$|R
50|$|BMW's {{electronic}} limited-slip differential {{used on the}} F10 5-series is {{an example}} of such a system. Another example began on the first year (1992) production of the re-styled, and new 4.6L V-8 overhead cam Ford Crown Victoria model with its optional <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes.</b> This option was available on the 1992 Crown Victoria, onward; on those cars equipped with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{automotive}} industry quickly realized {{the complexity of}} wiring each module to every other module. Such a wiring design would not only be complex, {{it would have to}} be altered depending on which modules were included in the specific vehicle. For example, a car without the <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brake</b> module would have to be wired differently than one that included <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 1991 {{model was}} {{completely}} restyled—It replaced the 1977-based rectilinear design with rounded, more aerodynamic sheetmetal. While {{the body and}} interior were all new, excluding the <b>Anti-Lock</b> <b>Braking</b> System, the chassis and powertrain were carried over from the 1990 model. Several major components (including the floor pan) are entirely interchangeable between 1977 and 1996.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{model year}} had little {{news for the}} Premier except for a new <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system (ABS) that was also {{available}} on the Canadian-built Dodge Monaco twin. The new safety feature came standard on the ES Limited and was optional on other models. The Limited model received a new front grille and rear tail lamp assemblies.|$|E
25|$|Since initial {{widespread}} use in production cars, <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> {{systems have been}} improved considerably. Recent versions not only prevent wheel lock under braking, but also electronically control the front-to-rear brake bias. This function, depending on its specific capabilities and implementation, is known as electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), traction control system, emergency brake assist, or electronic stability control (ESC).|$|E
50|$|November 8, 1996 saw the {{introduction}} of dual airbags for front seat passengers and <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> as standard.|$|R
50|$|Standard safety {{features}} include <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> with electronic brake distribution and brake assist, traction control and six airbags.|$|R
50|$|Airbags {{were first}} offered on the Golf in 1992, and from 1996 <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{standard}} across the range.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that {{the wearing of}} helmets may make cyclists feel safer and thus take more risks. This hypothetical effect is known as risk compensation or risk homeostasis. Some authors have suggested that risk compensation occurs with other road safety interventions such as seat belts and <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> systems, but these views are disputed by other road safety experts.|$|E
25|$|Many newer {{vehicles}} feature traction control, which partially mitigates {{the poor}} traction characteristics {{of an open}} differential by using the <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system to limit or stop the slippage of the low traction wheel, increasing the torque {{that can be applied}} to the opposite wheel. While not as effective as a traction-aided differential, it is better than a simple mechanical open differential with no traction assistance.|$|E
25|$|By 1977 the {{batteries}} were coming along, and Ballard and Prater were shuttling {{back and forth}} between Arizona and Vancouver. Ballard had always wanted to return to Canada, so Schwartz sold his interest in the battery technology to Ballard for $1, while Ballard sold his interest in Schwartz's latest venture, a mechanical <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system for the same $1. In 1979 Ballard moved to Vancouver and became president and CEO of Ultra Energy.|$|E
