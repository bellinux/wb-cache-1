40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulation test of an <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> that helps the driver to perform vehicle following maneuvers. When activated, the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> drives the vehicle to the desired inter-vehicle distance. Based on Lyapunov theory and invariant sets, the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> is able to guarantee that the state trajectories remain bounded under bounded disturbance inputs, such as leading vehicle accelerations. The <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> is designed {{in such a way}} that variable time headway strategy is naturally handled. The control law is computed using Linear and Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (LMI-BMI) methods. Some design parameters can be adjusted to handle the tradeoff between safety constraints and comfort specifications...|$|R
40|$|Driver {{drowsiness}} is {{a common}} cause of fatal traffic accidents. In this study, a driver <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> with a dual control scheme is developed; it attempts to perform simultaneously the safety control of the vehicle and identification of the driver 2 ̆ 7 s state. The <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> implements partial control {{in the event of}} lane departure and gives the driver the chance to voluntarily take the action needed. If the driver fails to implement the steering action needed within a limited time, the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> judges that “the driver 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the given situation is incorrect” and executes the remaining control. We used a driving simulator equipped with the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> to investigate the effectiveness of identifying driver drowsiness and preventing lane departure accidents. Twenty students participated in three trials on a straight expressway, and they were required to implement only lateral control. We hypothesized that a participant cannot implement the action needed to maintain safety when he/she falls asleep, and that in such a case, the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> will implement the safety control repeatedly. The <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> assisted the participants only when almost really needed, such as when their eyelids were closed. The results validated the hypothesis, showing that the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> implemented the safety control repeatedly when a participant fell asleep. In addition, the algorithms used by the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> to determine whether the driver can continue driving were evaluated through a leave-one-out cross-validation, and they were proven to be effective for identifying driver drowsiness...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel concept towards future tower {{air traffic control}} operations in order to tackle the known “head-down vs. head-up problem”. A possible solution to the mentioned problem could be an augmented-vision based <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> projecting air traffic data into the real outside view of the tower controller. However, there are also technical limitations and unsolved ergonomic issues regarding untailored information presentation, over-cluttering, ambiguous display symbology, latency, non-collimated view etc. This paper will present the conceptual framework for an envisioned <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> for air traffic control towers that fuses adaptive information management with augmented vision. The concept constitutes the fundament of the future prototype development. Based on a multidimensional adaptive automation model which is described in this paper, the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> monitors both the operational environment and the ATCO behaviour. The <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> then adapts its information content and mode of interaction accordingly following the premise to display the right (amount of) information at the right time. The paper will also illustrate the first conceptual designs that were presented to several active ATCOs and their feedback to it. The proposed system architecture for a wearable head-up display for the tower environment and the potential benefits and challenges of the envisioned <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> will be described as well. The paper concludes with on-going activities and necessary steps for future work...|$|R
