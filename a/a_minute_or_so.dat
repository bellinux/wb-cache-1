5|$|Monday to Saturday {{services}} are half-hourly {{in each direction}} until 20:00, with an hourly service provided after 20:00 and on Sundays. The first weekday service departs at 05:20 from Tweedbank with the last service leaving Edinburgh at 23:54. Departure times from Edinburgh are usually at 24 and 54 minutes past the hour, while from Tweedbank trains depart at 28 and 58 minutes past the hour; individual timings may vary by <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> The trains starting close to on the hour do not call at Stow except in the peaks and evenings; the Sunday service stops at Stow. Most services operate between Edinburgh and Tweedbank {{except for a few}} morning peak services that continue to Glenrothes with Thornton via the Fife Circle Line and a few evening peak services that originate at Glenrothes with Thornton.|$|E
25|$|After <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> a dark {{plume of}} smoke was {{observed}} {{rising from the}} wreckage. The fire was traced to a ruptured oil tank above the right engine. The leaking oil fell onto the hot engine and ignited. The fire was not fed by jet fuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{first time}} the U.S. Coast Guard found one {{containing}} drugs, authorities dubbed it Bigfoot because they had heard rumors that such things existed, but none had actually been seen. In late 2006 a Bigfoot was seized 145km southwest of Costa Rica carrying several metric tonnes of cocaine. In 2006, US officials say they detected three; in 2008, they were spotting an average of ten per month, but {{only one out of}} ten was intercepted. Few were seized, as their crews scuttle them upon interception and they sink within <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> By 2009, the U.S.A. detected as many as 60 narco submarine related events, and it was calculated that they were moving as much as 330 metric tonnes of cocaine per year.|$|E

One still sees. The sense of vision is a question of length of vibration, and not of multitude of impacts; but there's a kind of shock to the retina, a nasty giddy confusion just at the time, if the eyes are open. Keep 'em shut." ...|$|R

25|$|The sundew genus (Drosera) {{consists}} of over 100 species of active flypapers whose mucilage glands are borne {{at the end}} of long tentacles, which frequently grow fast enough in response to prey (thigmotropism) to aid the trapping process. The tentacles of D. burmanii can bend 180° in <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Sundews are extremely cosmopolitan and are found on all the continents except the Antarctic mainland. They are most diverse in Australia, the home to the large subgroup of pygmy sundews such as D. pygmaea and to a number of tuberous sundews such as D. peltata, which form tubers that aestivate during the dry summer months. These species are so dependent on insect sources of nitrogen that they generally lack the enzyme nitrate reductase, which most plants require to assimilate soil-borne nitrate into organic forms.|$|E
25|$|Reductions {{employing}} {{an excess}} of alkali metals in ammonia or amines are extremely rapid and should be quenched after <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of reaction time—longer reaction times promote side reactions. When lithium or sodium in ammonia is used, the persistence of a deep blue color in the solution (due to solvated electrons) {{is a sign that}} the reaction is complete. Reductions employing alkali metal arene radical anion complexes similarly require a large excess of the reducing agent, very low temperatures and short reaction times. Reductive desulfonylations and reductive eliminations employing alkali or alkaline earth metals in ammonia present a high fire hazard and should be conducted in a properly functioning chemical fume hood away from flammable solvents. Ammonia is a corrosive gas with a pungent odor. Alkali metals react violently with water or even moist air to generate hydrogen, which can then be ignited by the heat of the reaction.|$|E
25|$|Chelsea {{equalised}} twelve {{minutes before}} the end, after a flowing move, from which Osgood scored with a diving header from a Charlie Cooke cross. Jackie Charlton should have been marking Osgood but had 'lost' him whilst chasing Hutchinson to exact retribution for a deadleg administered in the Chelsea penalty area <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> earlier. In scoring, Osgood became the last player to date to have scored in every round of the FA Cup. With the game ending 1–1, the final once again went into extra time. One minute before the first period of extra time was to end, Chelsea's Hutchinson sent in a long throw-in that missed almost every player in the penalty area but came off Charlton's head towards the far post, before being put into the unguarded net by Webb to give Chelsea the lead {{for the first time}} in the two games. They kept the lead until the end, securing their first FA Cup win.|$|E

500|$|At 09:09, the {{anti-aircraft}} guns of Hornet and her escorting warships opened fire as the 20 untouched Japanese torpedo planes and remaining 16 dive bombers commenced their {{attacks on the}} carrier. At 09:12, a dive bomber placed its , semi-armor-piercing bomb dead center on Hornets flight deck, across from the island, which penetrated three decks before exploding, killing 60 men. Moments later, a [...] "land" [...] bomb struck the flight deck, detonating on impact to create an [...] hole and kill 30 men. <b>A</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> later, a third bomb hit Hornet near where the first bomb hit, penetrating three decks before exploding, causing severe damage but no loss of life. At 09:14, a dive bomber was set on fire by Hornets {{anti-aircraft guns}}; the pilot deliberately crashed into Hornets stack, killing seven men and spreading burning aviation fuel over the signal deck.|$|E

2500|$|This time, Wagner {{could not}} be stifled as he outhit Cobb, [...]333 to [...]231, and stole six bases, {{establishing}} the new Series record. The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: [...] "We had him out at second. We put up a squawk, but Silk O'Loughlin, the umpire, overruled it. We kept the squawk going for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O'Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, 'Of course I was out. They had me by a foot. You just booted the play, so come on, let's play ball.'" ...|$|E

At pre-determined intervals of <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>a</b> figure of Elvis Presley would appear from the centre of the stage and rise up above the pianos and sing a section from the song [...] "Glory Hallelujah", before dropping back down out of sight.|$|R
60|$|The {{art of the}} essayist is so simple, so entirely {{free from}} canons of criticism, and withal so delightful, that one must needs wonder why all men are not essayists. Perhaps people {{do not know how}} easy it is. Or perhaps beginners are misled. Rightly taught it may be learnt in <b>a</b> brief ten <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> what art there is in it. And all the rest is as easy as {{wandering}} among woodlands on a bright morning in the spring.|$|R
2500|$|The Stugotz Pregame Show — {{beginning}} the TV simulcast, Stugotz gets <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to vent {{about something that}} {{might or might not}} be brought up during the main show. During football season on Fridays, Stugotz uses the pregame show to make his weekend picks. On Tuesdays, [...] "The Stugotz Pregame Show" [...] is replaced by [...] "Greg Cote's Show and Tell," [...] where the Shipping Container gathers in the main studio with Stugotz as Greg Cote brings in and describes a random item from his garage. Previously, when the show's final hour aired on ESPN2, a segment titled ESPN Dos Minutos would air, where Stugotz and Mike Ryan would review the show, but Dos Minutos ended when ESPNU re-gained the final hour of the show. Because of a difference in commercial lengths between the TV simulcast and radio show, the TV simulcast typically airs flashback moments or highlights from the local hour at the return from commercials.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prohibition}} of stunning {{and the treatment}} of the slaughtered animal expressed in shechita law limits the extent to which Jewish slaughterhouses can industrialize their procedures. The most industrialized attempt at a kosher slaughterhouse, Agriprocessors of Postville, Iowa, became the center of controversy in 2004, after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released a gruesome undercover video of cattle struggling to their feet with their tracheas and esophagi ripped out after shechita. Some of the cattle actually got up and stood for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> after being dumped from the rotating pen. Dr. Temple Grandin, told Mason City, Iowa's Globe Gazette, [...] "I thought it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, and I had never ever seen that kind of procedure done before. … I've seen kosher slaughter really done right, so the problem here is not kosher slaughter. The problem here is a plant that is doing everything wrong they can do wrong." [...] While Agriprocessors has been criticized by both secular and Jewish organizations for both its human and animal rights violations, the Jewish Orthodox Union (OU) made note {{to point out that the}} kashrut of a product is not contingent upon [...] "the conditions in which it is produced. [...] The OU's condonation of Agriprocessors as a possibly inhumane, yet appropriately glatt kosher company has led to discussion as to whether or not industrialized agriculture has undermined the place of halakha (Jewish law) in shechita as well as whether or not halakha has any place at all in Jewish ritual slaughter.|$|E

5000|$|Of the song, Unterberger concludes, [...] " [...] Like many of {{the tracks}} on that album, it drew on country blues for musical inspiration... The lyrics, however, are not the sort that would be heard on actual rural Delta blues records... More of a {{drawback}} to the song, however, is its lack of melodic development, just keeping on the same basic monotonous stock blues tune for <b>a</b> good six <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> For album filler such as this, some other creative touches were needed to make it stand out more." ...|$|R

500|$|From 1975 until 2016, on the {{day before}} the Organic Chemistry exam—which is often {{on the first day of}} finals—at {{precisely}} the stroke of midnight, the Columbia University Marching Band occupied Butler Library to distract diligent students from studying.

The band then plays at other locations around Morningside Heights, including the residential quadrangle of Barnard College, where students of the all-women's school, in mock-consternation, rain trash – including notes and course packets – and water balloons upon them from their dormitories above. The band tends to close their Orgo Night performances before Furnald Hall, known among students as the more studious and reportedly [...] "anti-social" [...] residence hall, where the underclassmen in the band serenade the graduating seniors with an entertaining, though vulgar, mock-hymn to Columbia, composed of quips that poke fun at the stereotypes about the Columbia student body.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that Fido systems were generally clustered – of the 15 systems running {{by the start of}} June 1984, 5 of them were in St. Louis. [...] A user on Jennings's system in San Francisco that addressed emails to different systems in St. Louis would cause calls to be made to each of those BBSes in turn. [...] Local calls were normally free or charged at a low rate. [...] Additionally, the initial call setup, generally the first minute of the call, was normally billed at a higher rate than continuing an existing connection. Therefore, it would make sense to deliver all the messages from all the users in San Francisco to all of the users in St. Louis in a single call. Packets were generally small enough to be delivered within <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> two, <b>so</b> delivering all the messages in a single call could greatly reduce costs by avoiding multiple first-minute charges. Once delivered, the packet would be broken out into separate packets for local systems, and delivered using multiple local free calls.|$|R

We have been making some port fires this afternoon, and I have a dozen men halfway down the hill and, directly the outposts are safely across, they are to light the port fires, which will enable us to take aim.

60|$|Then there {{began an}} {{altogether}} different phase of hunting conversation. As {{long as the}} ladies were there {{it was all very}} well to talk of hunting as an amusement; good sport, <b>a</b> thirty <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> the delight of having a friend in a ditch, or the glory of a stiff-built rail were fitting subjects for a lighter hour. But now the business of the night was to begin. The difficulties, the enmities, the precautions, the resolutions, the resources of the Brake hunt were to be discussed. And from thence the conversation of these devotees strayed away to the perils at large to which hunting in these modern days is subjected;--not the perils of broken necks and crushed ribs, which can be reduced to an average, and so an end made of that small matter; but the perils from outsiders, the perils from new-fangled prejudices, the perils from more modern sports, the perils from over-cultivation, the perils from extended population, the perils from increasing railroads, the perils from literary ignorances, the perils from intruding cads, the perils from indifferent magnates,--the Duke of Omnium, for instance;--and that peril of perils, the peril of decrease of funds and increase of expenditure! The jaunty gentleman who puts on his dainty breeches, and his pair of boots, and on his single horse rides out on a pleasant morning to some neighbouring meet, thinking himself a sportsman, has but a faint idea of the troubles which a few staunch workmen endure in order that he may not be made to think that his boots, and his breeches, and his horse, have been in vain.|$|R
