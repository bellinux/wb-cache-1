5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to <b>alternative</b> <b>employment</b> possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed to make contact with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{initially}} did {{not significantly}} alter {{the operation of the}} manor or the village economy. William reassigned large tracts of land amongst the Norman elite, creating vast estates in some areas, particularly along the Welsh border and in Sussex. The biggest change in the years after the invasion was the rapid {{reduction in the number of}} slaves being held in England. In the 10th century slaves had been very numerous, although their number had begun to diminish as a result of economic and religious pressure. Nonetheless, the new Norman aristocracy proved harsh landlords. The wealthier, formerly more independent Anglo-Saxon peasants found themselves rapidly sinking down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree workers, or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor and seek <b>alternative</b> <b>employment.</b> Those Anglo-Saxon nobles who had survived the invasion itself were rapidly assimilated into the Norman elite or economically crushed.|$|E

5|$|While a few former bal maidens found <b>alternative</b> <b>employment</b> {{at local}} factories, and large numbers emigrated, the {{unemployment}} situation in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in other}} areas soon began to be felt. The method of {{government}} after the conquest {{can be described as}} a feudal system, in that the new nobles held their lands on behalf of the king; in return for promising to provide military support and taking an oath of allegiance, called homage, they were granted lands termed a fief or an honour. Major nobles in turn granted lands to smaller landowners in return for homage and further military support, and eventually the peasantry held land in return for local labour services, creating a web of loyalties and resources enforced in part by new honorial courts. This system had been used in Normandy and concentrated more power in the king and the upper elite than the former Anglo-Saxon system of government. The practice of slavery declined in the years after the conquest, as the Normans considered the practice backward and contrary to the teachings of the church. The more prosperous peasants, however, lost influence and power as the Normans made holding land more dependent on providing labour services to the local lord. They sank down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree villeins or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor or seek <b>alternative</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to London, Wheeler {{moved into a}} top-floor flat near Gordon Square {{with his wife and}} child. He returned to working for the Royal Commission, examining and cataloguing the historic structures of Essex. In doing so, he produced his first publication, an academic paper on Colchester's Roman Balkerne Gate which was published in the Transactions of the Essex Archaeological Society in 1920. He soon followed this with two papers in the Journal of Roman Studies; the first offered a wider analysis of Roman Colchester, while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city's Temple of Claudius which was destroyed by Boudica's revolt. In doing so, he developed a reputation as a Roman archaeologist in Britain. He then submitted his research on Romano-Rhenish pots to the University of London, on the basis of which he was awarded his Doctorate of Letters; thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as Dr Wheeler. He was unsatisfied with his job in the Commission, unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army, and so began to seek out <b>alternative</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E

5|$|Total {{production}} of slate in Wales declined from 54,000tons in 1958 to 22,000tons in 1970. The Diffwys quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1955 after almost {{two centuries of}} operation. The nearby Votty and Bowydd quarries closed in 1963. In 1969, the Dinorwig Quarry was closed, and over 300 quarrymen lost their jobs. The following year the Dorothea Quarry in the Nantlle Valley and the Braichgoch Slate Mine near Corris announced their closure. The Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1971, but was later reopened by another company. By 1972, {{the number of men}} employed in the North Wales slate industry was down to under 1,000. There was little <b>alternative</b> <b>employment</b> in the slate-producing areas, and the closures resulted in high unemployment and a drop in population as younger people moved away to find work. In 1979, after a long struggle, the government recognized silicosis as an industrial disease meriting compensation. There was an increase in demand for slate in the 1980s, and although this came too late for many quarries there was still some production in the Blaenau Ffestiniog area at the Oakeley, Llechwedd and Cwt-y-Bugail quarries, though the bulk of roofing slate production was at the Penrhyn Quarry. Further mechanization was introduced, with a computerized laser beam being used to aid the sawing of the slate blocks.|$|E

25|$|By 1984 {{the richest}} seams of coal had been {{increasingly}} worked {{out and the}} remaining coal was more and more expensive to reach. The solution was mechanisation and greater efficiency per worker, making many miners redundant. The industry was restructured between 1958 and 1967 {{in cooperation with the}} unions. The reduction in the labour force was offset by government and industry initiatives to provide <b>alternative</b> <b>employment.</b> Stabilisation occurred between 1968 and 1977, when closures were minimised {{with the support of the}} unions even though the broader economy slowed. The accelerated contraction imposed by Thatcher after 1978 was strenuously opposed by the unions. In the post-war consensus, policy allowed for closures only where agreed to by the workers, who in turn received guaranteed economic security. Consensus did not apply when closures were enforced and redundant miners had severely limited employment alternatives.|$|E

We found support for configural and metric invariance in all five dimensions of the EOI with these populations, and support for scalar invariance three of the five EOI dimensions. The construct validity of the EOI appears to be relatively robust in Latin American populations, although cultural and macroeconomic factors may impose some response bias in these groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea of a}} rural {{village is}} a new {{settlement}} concept that has been piloted by the Steve Tshwete Municipality in Mpumalanga Province.

The purpose of this research is to assess if rural villages can be a sustainable approach for the provision of farm workers housing related needs. Doornkop Rural Village was used as a case study. The location of the rural villages far from urban centres where economic opportunities exist, creates problems such as high transport costs and decreases chances of getting <b>alternative</b> <b>employments.</b> Rural villages are costly to service as they are located far from the municipal bulk infrastructure. This may lead to creation of dormitory settlements. On the contrary, location rural villages 15 km closer to urban areas may encourage urban sprawl and sterilisation of agricultural potential of adjacent farms. The rate of revenue collection at rural villages is very low as most of the households are indigent. Therefore, rural villages are not a sustainable approach for the provision of farm workers housing related need...|$|R
25|$|Nearly {{three years}} passed without major {{incident}} for Christie after Evans's trial. Having lost his employment at the Post Office Savings Bank {{due to his}} criminal convictions being disclosed at Evans's trial, Christie found <b>alternative</b> <b>employment</b> as a clerk with the British Road Services at their Shepherd's Bush depot. At the same time, new tenants arrived to fill the vacant first- and second-floor rooms at 10Rillington Place. The tenants were predominantly black immigrants from the West Indies; this horrified the Christies, who regarded their neighbours as inferior and disliked living with them.

Christie successfully negotiated with the Poor Man's Lawyer Centre to continue to have exclusive use of the back garden, ostensibly to have space between him and his neighbours.|$|E
25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is <b>alternative</b> <b>employment</b> rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find <b>alternative</b> <b>employment</b> much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

25|$|In 1851, 38% {{of the men}} and 27% of {{the women}} were {{employed}} in cotton; the only <b>alternative</b> <b>employment</b> was agriculture, building, or labouring on the railway. Consequently, the town was vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of cotton or the export trade. The American Civil War caused the cotton famine of 1861–64. The mill owners met together and put in place a relief programme through which they supplied food, clogs and coal to their employees. Howard increased the workforce on his estate, and public works (such as improving the domestic water supply) were undertaken. They provided unsecured loans to the workers until the cotton returned. The relationship between the owners and men was one of paternal benevolence. They lived in the same community and worshipped in the same churches. The mill owners were the local aldermen, the church elders and led the sports teams. In the Luddite and Chartist times and the period following Peterloo, Glossop was virtually unaffected, despite its proximity to Hyde, a radical hotbed. In the '4s 2d or swing strike' it was incomers from Ashton who stopped the Glossop mills. The rivalry in Glossop was not based on class, but on religious groups.|$|E
25|$|On {{the face}} of it, the distinctions between amateurs and {{professionals}} in first-class cricket were their availability and their means of remuneration. The professional cricketer received a wage from his county club or, if he went on a tour, a contracted fee paid by the tour organiser. In both cases, there was the possibility of bonuses being earned. The amateur in theory received expenses only, again paid either by his county club or a tour organiser. Professionals were full-time players during the cricket season and would mostly seek <b>alternative</b> <b>employment</b> in the winter months. The amateur was not always a full-time player during the season and many played by choice as they typically had other means of income or support. Some amateurs, those in education being a common example, were part-time players of necessity as they could only commit to cricket during the school or university holidays (say, late July to mid-September). Those in other forms of employment relied for availability on occasional holidays or, in some cases, being given time off by their employers. There were employers who hired well-known cricketers for commercial prestige reasons and so were keen to see them take part in big matches.|$|E
