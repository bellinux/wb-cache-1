5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted <b>and</b> <b>swallowed</b> Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and pulled out his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, <b>and</b> <b>swallowed</b> whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized <b>and</b> <b>swallowed</b> whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E

This study was, conducted to evaluate the masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> functions {{in a group of}} oral submucous fibrosis patients. Patients and Methods: Masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> performance, maximum bite force, oral stereognosis, and surface electromyographic activity of the buccinator muscle were measured in 11 patients with early oral submucous fibrosis and controls matched for age and gender. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that {{there was no significant difference}} in maximum bite force between controls and patients with oral submucous fibrosis. However, the masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> performance, integrated surface electromyographic activity during maximum blowing in right buccinator, and oral stereognostic score in the oral submucous fibrosis group were significantly lower than in the control group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that patients with early oral submucous fibrosis may exhibit impaired masticatory <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> functions along with reduced oral stereognosis and buccinator muscle activity...|$|R

5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue <b>and</b> <b>swallowed</b> again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws <b>and</b> <b>swallowed</b> whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E

The primary tumor was an extended papillary thyroid carcinoma (pT 4 N 0 M 0). For vocal restoration, an indwelling Provox(®) 1 voice prosthesis was inserted secondarily. The patient received speech <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> therapy, including digital maneuvers {{at the level of}} the proximal (cervical) part of the jejunal graft to improve speech <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> function.

40|$|SummaryThe {{pathways}} for air {{and food}} cross in the pharynx. In breathing, air may flow through either the nose or the mouth; it always {{flows through the}} pharynx. During swallowing, the pharynx changes from an airway to a food channel. The pharynx is isolated from the nasal cavity and lower airway by velopharyngeal and laryngeal closure during the pharyngeal swallow. During mastication, the food bolus accumulates in the pharynx prior to swallow initiation. The structures in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx serve multiple functions in breathing, speaking, mastication <b>and</b> <b>swallowing.</b> Thus, the fine temporal coordination of feeding among breathing, mastication <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> is essential to provide proper food nutrition and to prevent pulmonary aspiration. This review paper will review the temporo-spatial coordination of the movements of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures during mastication <b>and</b> <b>swallowing,</b> <b>and</b> temporal coordination between breathing, mastication, <b>and</b> <b>swallowing...</b>|$|R

25|$|Newer studies {{sometimes}} use mercury vapor analysis {{instead of}} the standard exposure test. Because this test was designed for factories and large enclosures, Consumer Reports has reported {{that this is not}} an accurate method of analysis for the mouth. It is less reliable, less consistent, and tends to greatly exaggerate the amount of mercury inhaled. Moreover, it is argued this test additionally exaggerates the amount of mercury inhaled by assuming that all the mercury vapor released is inhaled. This assumption was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and not found to be valid. Their research review found that most of the mercury vapor released from amalgam fillings is mixed with saliva <b>and</b> <b>swallowed,</b> some part is exhaled, and the remaining fraction is inhaled. Of these amounts, {{it is important to note}} that the lungs absorb about 80% of inhaled mercury whereas only about 0.01% of swallowed mercury vapour is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the speech <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> characteristics following segmental mandibulectomy and coronoidectomy to release trismus. Materials and Methods: A detailed speech <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> function assessment {{was carried out}} using various formal and informal tests following the surgeries. Result: After the initial assessment, the patient had severe impairment with the movement of articulators, and distortion was observed for labio dentals, lingual sounds, and vowels. Speech intelligibility, diadokokinetic rate, maximum phonation duration were reduced, and also patient had severe voice problem <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> problems. Following the assessment post-coronoidectomy, patient had articulatory errors such as distortion, omission, and substitution for majority of sounds secondary to reduced articulatory movements. <b>Swallowing</b> <b>and</b> voice characteristics have improved slightly, and the voice parameters were near normal. Conclusion: Segmental mandibulectomy can have several effects on an individual′s daily living as it affects speech, which becomes a major hindrance for communication. Also, due to the swallowing difficulties, there may be health issues. Hence, the affected individuals should be evaluated by a speech language pathologist to define {{the exact nature of}} changes in communication (including speech <b>and</b> voice), <b>and</b> <b>swallowing</b> that also helps to plan a comprehensive management strategy that includes speech therapy and surgical recommendation, which will have good prognosis in speech <b>and</b> <b>swallow</b> characteristics to give a good quality of life...|$|R

25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is a diurnal foraging carnivore which, unlike other carangids, does not normally seek out individual prey items. The highly protractile mouth {{possessed by the}} species is used to form a tube to suck prey out of both reef- and algae-dominated habitats, as well as filtering organisms out of sandy substrates. In the latter case, both sand and any prey items are taken into the mouth and filtered through the gill rakers; sand is expelled, while small organisms are trapped <b>and</b> <b>swallowed.</b> The species takes a variety of prey including crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and amphipods, as well as molluscs and small fish. Golden trevally found inhabiting a mangrove swamp {{were found to have}} fed exclusively on fish (Mugil curema), suggesting the species also actively hunts down fleeing prey. A laboratory study using only four individuals being fed found that one fish will take the 'lead' position in this situation while another will attack the other fish in the school, apparently in competition for food.|$|E
25|$|Living {{habits are}} varied; the family {{includes}} both bottom-foraging and midwater species. Callichthyids inhabit {{a wide range}} of habitats, from small, swift, oxygen-rich creeks to big rivers and flooded areas. Their habitats may even include swampy and muddy habitats where oxygen may be virtually absent. Callichthyids survive in these conditions by breathing air; air is collected at the water surface <b>and</b> <b>swallowed.</b> The intestines are used to absorb oxygen, and the air is expelled from the anus. The anterior digestive intestine packages digesta into a string of slightly compressed boluses, creating an air channel in the digestive intestine, thus allowing air to pass unimpeded. The posterior intestine is modified for respiration into a thin-walled and highly vascularized structure by reduction of the thickness of the epithelium, submucosa, and muscle layers; though highly modified to absorb air, it is inefficient for digestive purposes. Air moving through the digestive tract facilitates the movement of digesta to the rectum. Unlike other catfish such as loricariids or trichomycterids that may breathe air only under hypoxic conditions, callichthyids breathe air under all water conditions. Some callichthyids are able to absorb air through their hind guts to move short distances on land. Air stored in their digestive tracts also accounts for 75% of the necessary air for neutral buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|N. americanus and A. duodenale eggs can {{be found}} in warm, moist soil where they will {{eventually}} hatch into first stage larvae, or L1. L1, the feeding non-infective rhabditoform stage, will feed on soil microbes and eventually molt into second stage larvae, L2. L2, which is also in the rhabditoform stage, will feed for approximately 7 days and then molt into the third stage larvae, or L3. L3 is the filariform stage of the parasite, that is, the non-feeding infective form of the larvae. The L3 larvae are extremely motile and will seek higher ground to increase their chances of penetrating the skin of a human host. The L3 larvae can survive up to 2 weeks without finding a host. While N. americanus larvae only infect through penetration of skin, A. duodenale can infect both through penetration as well as orally. After the L3 larvae have successfully entered the host, the larvae then travel through the subcutaneous venules and lymphatic vessels of the human host. Eventually, the L3 larvae enter the lungs through the pulmonary capillaries and break out into the alveoli. They will then travel up the trachea to be coughed <b>and</b> <b>swallowed</b> by the host. After being swallowed, the L3 larvae are then found in the small intestine where they molt into the L4, or adult worm stage. The entire process from skin penetration to adult development takes about 5–9 weeks. The female adult worms will release eggs (N. americanus about 9,000–10,000 eggs/day and A. duodenale 25,000–30,000 eggs/day) which are passed in the feces of the human host. These eggs will hatch in the environment within several days and the cycle will start anew.|$|E
