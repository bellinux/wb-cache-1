The optimum threshold is derived based on the full analysis of the ranging error, which {{is equivalent to the}} probability of correct detection of first <b>arriving</b> <b>signal</b> in time-based ranging techniques. It is shown that the probability of correct detection is a function of first <b>arriving</b> <b>signal,</b> which has variations with two independent distributions. On the one hand, the first <b>arriving</b> <b>signal</b> varies in different positions with the same range due to multipath interference and on the other, it is a function of distance due to free space path-loss. These two distributions are considered in the derivation of the ranging error, based on which the optimum threshold is obtained. A practical method to derive this threshold is introduced based on the standard channel model. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations, ray-tracing simulations and ranging measurements confirm the analysis and the superior performance of the proposed threshold scheme.
