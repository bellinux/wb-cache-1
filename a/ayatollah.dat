5|$|Among others, Iran's {{supreme leader}} <b>Ayatollah</b> Ali Khamenei blamed a Zionist {{conspiracy}} for the row over the cartoons. Palestinian Christian diplomat Afif Safieh, then the Palestine Liberation Organization's envoy to Washington, alleged the Likud party concocted {{the distribution of}} Muhammad caricatures worldwide {{in a bid to}} create a clash between the West and the Muslim world.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2002 {{deterioration}} of his health, al-Jamri's {{position as a}} political and religious leader of Bahrain's Shia opposition {{was taken over by}} his lifelong friend, <b>Ayatollah</b> Isa Qassim. Qassim was less revolutionary than al-Jamri, having opposed the 1992 and 1994 petitions, but his views were kept private, in part as a sign of respect for al-Jamri. Al-Jamri's role as leader of the opposition remained empty, as the opposition became fragmented.|$|E
5|$|After the Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982, Israel occupied {{a strip of}} south Lebanon, which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a militia supported by Israel. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation. Its leaders were followers of <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, <b>Ayatollah</b> Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of FN electoral success, the {{immigration}} debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini, the 1989 affaire du foulard {{was the first major}} test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following the event, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In {{the first round of the}} 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system (if the election had used proportional representation, it would have won 64 seats). In the 1995 presidential election, Le Pen rose slightly to 15% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{returned}} to the U.S. {{at the end of}} 1974 to become Washington correspondent and news anchor for ABC's new morning program AM America, a predecessor to Good Morning America. ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today. AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first Canadian or American reporter to interview the <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.|$|E
