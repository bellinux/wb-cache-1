5|$|Clark {{never married}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> no account of any romantic relationships, {{although}} his family held {{that he had}} once been in love with Teresa de Leyba, sister of Don Fernando de Leyba, the lieutenant governor of Spanish Louisiana. Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts in the archives of the Wisconsin Historical Society attest to their belief in Clark's lifelong disappointment over the failed romance.|$|E
5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim {{did his best to}} avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era Greed was set in, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.|$|E
5|$|Arnold was the {{preferred}} choice in goal {{at the start}} of the 1983–84 season, before Southall was recalled on 1 October against Notts County. Everton had a poor start to the league campaign, but excelled in cup competitions, reaching the final of both the League Cup and the FA Cup. Southall's first appearance at Wembley was in the League Cup final against Liverpool, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> a clean sheet in a goalless draw. The replay was held at Maine Road, and Liverpool won the tie 1–0 with a Graeme Souness goal. He was rarely called into action in the 1984 FA Cup Final, and kept a clean sheet as Everton claimed the trophy with a 2–0 victory over Watford.|$|E

5|$|From the {{unexpected}} realism {{of his first}} major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> company {{with a variety of}} high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, {{in the last year of}} both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged {{by his parents}} {{when he was a}} child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams. Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a 'pracharak' in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh. Although Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career, he acknowledged his wife when he filed his nomination for a parliamentary seat in the 2014 general elections. Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben and often visits her on his birthday to seek her blessings.|$|E
5|$|Southall {{was bought}} by Everton manager Howard Kendall for £150,000 {{in the summer of}} 1981. To win a first team place he had to compete with Jim McDonagh (a Gordon Lee signing who would soon leave the club), Jim Arnold (also a new signing), and Martin Hodge (who was injured {{throughout}} his time at Everton). He made his debut in a 2–1 win over Ipswich Town in October, after Arnold picked up an injury. He returned to the first team in December, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> a clean sheet against Aston Villa and remained an ever-present {{throughout the rest of the}} 1981–82 season.|$|E

5|$|In his lifetime, J. R. R. Tolkien {{never ceased}} to {{experiment}} on his constructed languages, {{and they were}} subjected to many revisions. Therefore, Quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between the different stages of its development. During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c. 1910 to c. 1920, the language was called Elfin in English and Eldarissa in Qenya proper. While its development was a continuous process, Quenya underwent {{a number of major}} revisions in its grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The vocabulary, however, was not subject to sudden or extreme change. Tolkien sometimes changed the meaning of a word, but he almost never discarded it once invented, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elvish etymology was in constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new etymons for his Quenya vocabulary. But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings (finished c. 1949–1950, published in 1954–1955), the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya (c. 1950–1973).|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP. Pennzoil and Chevron have remained separate companies.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{takeover}} by Wahhabi rebels {{of most of}} Hejaz in 1803, the appointment to the governorship of Jeddah {{was said to be}} little esteemed, and considered tantamount to exile.

25|$|Uccello {{was asked}} to paint a number of scenes of distempered animals for {{the house of the}} Medici.
