5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions. To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{politics}} {{have been particularly}} strong in municipal government since the 1960s. Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party, which feared a splintering of the liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of May 2016, Democrats hold the mayorship and nine out of the ten council seats. Nationally, Ann Arbor is located in Michigan's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{a number of}} {{organizations}} were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion.

It emerged from Catholics for the Elimination of All Restrictive Abortion & Contraceptive Laws, a New York lobby group that had been formed in 1970.|$|E
25|$|In {{reproductive}} rights, feminists {{sought the}} right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s. Feminists hoped to use the first birth control pill to free women to decide the terms under which they will bear children. They felt that reproductive self-control was essential for full economic independence from men. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> was also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue.|$|E
25|$|For many people, {{abortion}} {{is essentially a}} moral issue, concerning the commencement of human personhood, {{the rights of the}} fetus, and a woman's rights over her own body. The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with anti-abortion campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand anti-abortion laws, while abortion rights campaigners seeking the repeal or easing of such laws while expanding <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion.</b> Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. Availability of safe abortion also varies across the world.|$|E

25|$|Other {{prominent}} feminists, including Frida Laski, Dora Russell, Joan Malleson and Janet Chance {{began to}} champion this cause - the cause broke dramatically {{into the mainstream}} in July 1932 when the British Medical Association council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion. On 17 February 1936, Janet Chance, Alice Jenkins and Joan Malleson established the Abortion Law Reform Association as the first advocacy organisation for abortion liberalization. The association promoted <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> in the United Kingdom and campaigned {{for the elimination of}} legal obstacles. In its first year ALRA recruited 35 members, and by 1939 had almost 400 members.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was {{the first}} {{government}} to legalize abortion and make it available on request, often for no cost. The Soviet government hoped to provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> in a safe environment performed by a trained doctor instead of babki. While this campaign was extremely effective in the urban areas (as much as 75% of abortions in Moscow were performed in hospitals by 1925), it had much less on rural regions where there was neither access to doctors, transportation, or both and where women relied on traditional medicine. In the countryside in particular, women continued to see babki, midwives, hairdressers, nurses, and others for the procedure after abortion was legalized in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The National Organization for Women ("NOW") as {{plaintiff}} {{filed the}} suit {{as a civil}} class-action in 1986 in federal district court on behalf of women seeking abortions and on behalf of various abortion clinics and providers. Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and injunctions under the RICO, Hobbs, and the Travel Acts, alleging that the defendants against whom the suit was filed are racketeering organizations engaging in a conspiracy to prevent {{access to health care}} facilities providing abortion services. The suit's named defendants were Joseph Scheidler and other pro-life/anti-abortion protesters and organizations who were members of the Pro-Life Action League (PLAL), and specifically the Oklahoma Pro-Life Action Network (PLAN). The underlying issues in the case concerning <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> and the coercive and violent tactics used by some to prevent such access formed a central rallying point for both sides of the national abortion debate.|$|E

500|$|Women's {{reproductive}} {{and sexual}} health {{has a distinct}} difference compared to men's health. Even in developed countries pregnancy and childbirth are associated with substantial risks to women with maternal mortality accounting {{for more than a}} quarter of a million deaths per year, with large gaps between the developing and developed countries. Comorbidity from other non reproductive disease such as cardiovascular disease [...] contribute to both the mortality and morbidity of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Sexually transmitted infections [...] have serious consequences for women and infants, with mother-to-child transmission leading to outcomes such as stillbirths and neonatal deaths, and pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility. In addition infertility from many other causes, birth control, unplanned pregnancy, unconsensual sexual activity and the struggle for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> create other burdens for women.|$|E
500|$|Wałęsa is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic. He is a staunch {{opponent}} of abortion; in 1993 during his presidency {{he signed a}} law restricting abortions in Poland. This law reversed the virtually free <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> that existed since 1956 and limited its use to {{cases in which the}} woman's life is in danger, pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest, or the fetus is irreparably damaged. Doctors who violate the rules now face up to two years in prison. [...] This abortion law {{is one of the most}} restrictive in Europe, deeply divided the country, and saw the former Solidarity coalition split between liberals and conservatives. The Polish Catholic Church supported Wałęsa, but public opinion polls indicated most Poles favored retaining a liberal abortion law; 1.3 million Poles signed a petition demanding a plebiscite rather than governmental imposition of the law. In 1994 a group of women legislators tried to ease the criteria for abortion; Wałęsa vetoed their amendment.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{national}} [...] politicians recognized that {{a focus on}} reducing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> was not a winning political strategy. Some anti-abortion activists grew more aggressive and violent {{in the face of}} political abandonment, culminating with the murder of Dr. David Gunn in 1993 and the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1994. With direct action discredited, anti-abortion organizations, including the National Right to Life Committee, came to the forefront of the movement. These focused on legal tactics, including lobbying against late-term abortions and access to mifepristone and demanding legislation based on the purported ABC link. More recently, anti-abortion organizations have turned to lobbying to increase obstacles to abortion, such as mandated counseling, waiting periods, and parental notification, and some feel that anti-abortion advocates treat ABC as simply another tactic in their campaign against abortion. There have been ongoing and incremental legal challenges to abortion in the United States by anti-abortion groups. In 2005, a Canadian anti-abortion organization put up billboards in Alberta with large pink ribbons and the statement: [...] "Stop the Cover-Up," [...] in reference to the ABC hypothesis. The Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation was concerned by the misrepresentation of the state of scientific knowledge on the subject.|$|E
