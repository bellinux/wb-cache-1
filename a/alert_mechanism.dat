50|$|The {{scoreboard}} in the <b>Alert</b> <b>Mechanism</b> Report {{is currently}} {{made up of}} eleven indicators that monitor external imbalances and competitiveness, as well as internal imbalances.

50|$|Similar to the Notice {{is another}} request for {{cooperation}} or <b>alert</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{known as a}} 'diffusion'. This is less formal than a notice but {{is also used to}} request the arrest or location of an individual or additional information in relation to a police investigation. A diffusion is circulated directly by a member states or international entity to the countries of their choice, or to the entire Interpol membership and is simultaneously recorded in Interpol’s databases.|$|E
50|$|Low-level I/O allowed {{control of}} devices, {{interfacing}} for determining device status, and for {{reading and writing}} data as either single bytes, or as blocks. I/O could be completed to a register, or to memory, or via a direct memory access (DMA) channel. The distinction between these I/O types was that regular I/O would 'hang' the CPU until the I/O operation completed, but DMA I/O allowed the CPU to proceed with instruction execution concurrently with the data transfer. The interrupt system was purely based on IO, meaning that all interrupts were generated externally. Interrupts were introduced to neophytes as being the <b>alert</b> <b>mechanism</b> by which a program could be informed that a previously initiated DMA I/O operation was completed.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} of each yearly round of the MIP is the <b>Alert</b> <b>Mechanism</b> Report {{prepared}} by the European Commission. Based on a scoreboard of indicators, which are not interpreted mechanically, the Commission identifies the countries and issues which require In-Depth Reviews for further economic analysis. The Commission also takes into account relevant data {{beyond the scope of}} the scoreboard, when selecting countries for in-depth reviews. Based on these in-depth reviews, the Commission determines if imbalances exist; what the nature of the imbalances is; and judges whether they are persistent, aggravating or unwinding. Depending on the severity of the imbalances the Commission proposes a policy recommendation under either the 'preventive arm' or the 'corrective arm' of the MIP.|$|E
50|$|The Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure was {{triggered}} {{the first time}} with the publication of the <b>Alert</b> <b>Mechanism</b> Report in February 2012. Based on the analysis in the report, the European Commission carried out in-depth reviews for twelve EU member states. The countries included were: Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Hungary, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The analysis confirmed that these EU member states faced macroeconomic imbalances of different nature. But none were considered excessive, therefore no Excessive Imbalance Procedure was launched. The 'preventive arm' of the MIP was however activated, with the recommended policy responses to the imbalances being integrated in the set of Country-Specific Recommendations addressed to member states under the European Semester. These recommendations were endorsed by the European Council in June and subsequently adopted by the Council of Ministers in July 2012.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 November 2012 {{the second}} <b>Alert</b> <b>Mechanism</b> Report was published. Based on the report, the Commission decided {{to review the}} {{progress}} {{in all of the}} twelve member states initially reviewed in 2012. They were therefore all selected again for an In-Depth Review. In addition, the Commission also started in-depth reviews for Malta and the Netherlands. On 10 April 2013, the Commission published the in-depth reviews and concluded that excessive imbalances exist in Spain and Slovenia. At its meeting on 14 May 2013, the Council of the European Union however stated that the European Commission should first review the national reform programmes of these countries, and on this basis it would then be assessed whether additional policy measures were necessary. The Slovenian Prime Minister stated on 23 May:"We have the feeling the Commission believes submitting us to this Imbalance procedure will be a help to our country. This is not the case, in my estimate, and I believe it would be much better that Slovenia can on its own without any supervision resolve its problems." [...] On 29 May 2013, after the national reform programmes of Spain and Slovenia had been reviewed, the Commission found those programmes to be sufficient; and thus refrained from launching an Excessive Imbalance Procedure towards Spain and Slovenia.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the third}} <b>Alert</b> <b>Mechanism</b> Report {{published}} in November 2013, the Commission {{announced a new}} round of in-depth reviews for the countries already under scrutiny, but widened these reviews to Germany, Croatia, and Luxembourg, as well as to Ireland immediately after exit from its assistance programme. [...] In March 2014, the Commission concluded that it found no imbalances in Denmark, Malta and Luxembourg, while the remaining countries were experiencing imbalances. Imbalances in Spain were not considered excessive any more. Imbalances in Italy, Croatia, and Slovenia were however experienced as excessive, with decisions to be taken in June 2014 on subsequent steps under the MIP - meaning those three countries are in risk of facing the opening up of EIP's. The joint decision by the Commission and Council whether or not to open up EIP's, will be taken in conjunction with the publication of the Country-Specific Recommendations {{in the context of the}} European Semester. On 2 June 2014 the Commission announced for the three countries identified with excessive imbalance: [...] "we have found that their national reform programmes appropriately address the main challenges we identified in March. That's why we are not proposing to launch the Excessive Imbalances Procedure for these three Member States. We will however monitor very closely the implementation of today’s detailed [...] "Country Specific Recommendations", so as to provide the same support for the reform process in these countries, as we have over the past year for Spain and Slovenia, where progress has been very encouraging".|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{deal with}} micro-mobility in TWINBOARD network, which is a two nodes mobile network {{architecture}} based on an all IP infrastructure. The two nodes are the Base Station (BS) and the Access Gateway (AG). To manage micro-mobility, we propose a new approach providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to coexist and inter-operate with exist-ing technologies. Specifically, we propose an intra-domain multicast-based handover approach combined with an <b>Alert</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Alert approach is a distributed mecha-nism that provides routers with information regarding the congestion state of other routers without any modifications on existing routing protocol. Our solution achieves an efficient intra-domain handover and avoids flooding in the network. The simulations used to evaluate our scheme and compare it to other multicast scheme- DVMRP (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol) show that our solution presents a good performance and outperforms DVMRP scheme. Our main contribution consists on an efficient new approach to manage IP micro-mobility using intra-domain multicast with <b>alert</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E

40|$|Many {{distributed}} systems rely on neighbor selection mechanisms to create overlay structures that have good network performance.

This paper investigates the properties of triangle inequality violation (TIV) in Internet delays, the impacts of TIV on representative neighbor selection mechanisms, specifically Vivaldi and Meridian, and avenues to reduce these impacts. We propose a TIV <b>alert</b> <b>mechanism</b> that can inform neighbor selection mechanisms to avoid the pitfalls caused by TIVs and improve their effectiveness...|$|E
