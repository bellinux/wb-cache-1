40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. In {{the distant}} past, {{adhesive}} materials {{were considered to}} be a kind of mere glue. But today adhesive materials are used extensively in the field of manufacturing because of the good properties they exhibit. <b>Adhesive</b> bonded aluminum <b>laminates</b> are well known materials that belong to the family of metal <b>laminates.</b> <b>Adhesive</b> bonded aluminum <b>laminates</b> are made by joining several thin sheets of aluminum. These sheets are bonded by an adhesive material in between. The <b>adhesive</b> bonded aluminum <b>laminates</b> when compared to the monolithic aluminum plates, exhibit very good mechanical and chemical properties. They also exhibit some useful properties such as weight reduction, capability of withstanding high loads, thermal resistance, etc. Because of this, they are widely used in aerospace, marine and automobile fields, particularly in manufacturing of doublers plates. Optimizing the design of structural joint will definitely improve the load carrying capability of the structural joint. Identifying the significant factors that affect the structural joint is one way to avoid failure at the joints. The main purpose of this study is to predict the stress concentration around the hole in single and double lap joints of <b>adhesive</b> bonded aluminum <b>laminate.</b> A three dimensional finite element model is developed in ABAQUS to know the effect of stress concentration and is validated by comparing the results of the finite element model with the results obtained from theoretical closed form solution. The present study shows the relationship between the stress concentration around the hole and the Young‟s modulus of the adhesive material, Radius of the fastener holes, Distance between the fastener holes, position of the adhesive layer and number of the adhesive layers. The results obtained from this parametric study are analyzed in a design of experiments software to determine the significance of each parameter...|$|R
40|$|A {{conventional}} and three distinct CFRP-based shear reinforcing systems {{were used to}} assess the most effective one on the shear strengthening of reinforced concrete beams. Nowadays, one of these CFRP-based shear reinforcing systems is currently applied, wrapping the beam with strips of CFRP sheets. The two others CFRP-based shear reinforcing systems are based on bonding, with epoxy <b>adhesive,</b> <b>laminate</b> strips of CFRP into slits cut on the concrete cover of the lateral surfaces of the concrete beams. These two CFRP-based reinforcing systems only differ on the direction of the laminates. To evaluate the influence of the beam height, two series of tests with beams of distinct height were carried. These last reinforcing systems were more effective than the one based on strips of CFRP sheet, {{not only in terms of}} increasing the load bearing capacity, but also enhancing the beam ductility. They are also much more simple and faster to apply. In the present work the tests carried out are described and the main results are presented and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Epoxy resins {{have been}} broadly {{used in the}} {{industry}} for <b>adhesives,</b> <b>laminates,</b> coatings, composites, encapsulation of electronic devices, printed circuit boards, etc. Despite their excellent adhesion to different materials, heat and chemical resistance and good mechanical properties, they also exhibit few drawbacks like brittleness, high thermal expansion coefficient (CTE), poor resistance to crack initiation and growth. Therefore, the thesis {{is focused on the}} preparation of epoxy-silica hybrid materials exhibiting improved thermomechanical properties compared to the neat epoxides, without impairing their beneficial features. The main synthetic route of epoxy-silica hybrids' preparation has been the sol-gel process of alkoxysilanes, allowing either in-situ formation of high purity and homogeneity silica particles or creation of various siloxane structures in a form of liquid (sol) silica-based precursors. The sol-gel method, on one hand, helps to omit too high viscosity of nanofiller suspension and energy-intensive nanofiller dispergation problems, but on the other hand, is often associated with necessity to use solvents and to remove formed volatiles. Therefore, {{in the first part of}} the thesis, a simple solvent-free sol-gel procedure, enabling to minimize the side-effect of solvent evaporation and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the {{suitability}} in the application of classical laminate theory analysis tools for filament wound pressure vessels with <b>adhesive</b> <b>laminated</b> joints in particular: pressure vessel wall performance, joint stiffness and failure prediction. Two 18 -inch diameter 12 -ply filament wound pressure vessels were fabricated. One vessel was fabricated with a 24 -ply pyramid <b>laminated</b> <b>adhesive</b> double strap butt joint. The second vessel was fabricated with the same number of plies in an inverted pyramid joint. Results from hydrostatic tests are presented. Experimental results were used as input to the computer programs GENLAM and Laminate, and the output compared to test. By using the axial stress resultant, the classical laminate theory results show a correlation within 1 % to the experimental results in predicting the pressure vessel wall pressure performance. The prediction of joint stiffness for the two adhesive joints in the axial direction is within 1 % of the experimental results. The calculated hoop direction joint stress resultant is 25 % less than the measured resultant for both joint configurations. A correction factor is derived and used in the joint analysis. The correction factor is derived from the hoop stress resultant from the tank wall performance investigation. The vessel with the pyramid joint is determined to have failed in the joint area at a hydrostatic pressure 33 % value below predicted failure. The vessel with the inverted pyramid joint failed in the wall acreage at a hydrostatic pressure within 10 % of the actual failure pressure...|$|R
