5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula</b> known today as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use the camel, {{approximately}} 4,000–5,000years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula</b> prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Within the Indian Ocean {{north of}} the equator, {{tropical}} cyclones are tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the officially designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis. The Arabian Sea, which borders the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion {{of the body of}} water, offshore of western India. About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making landfall, or moving ashore, and around one in three storms move toward the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool sea surface temperatures (the result of strong winds from the monsoon), as well as dry air from the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Indian Ocean, loggerheads feed {{along the}} coastlines of Africa, the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> {{and in the}} Arabian Sea. Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago to South Africa's St Lucia estuary. The largest Indian Ocean nesting site is Oman, on the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> which hosts around 15,000 nests, giving it the second largest nesting {{population}} of loggerheads in the world. Western Australia is another notable nesting area, with 1,000–2,000 nests per year.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius soon {{experienced}} a new event, the Muslim conquests. Emerging from the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> the Muslims quickly conquered the Sasanian Empire. In 634 the Muslims marched into Roman Syria, defeating Heraclius's brother Theodore. Within {{a short period}} of time, the Arabs conquered Mesopotamia, Armenia and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu {{traditionally}} {{served as}} a commercial and financial centre. Before the importation of mass-produced cloth from Europe and America, the city's textiles were forwarded far and wide throughout {{the interior of the}} continent, {{as well as to the}} <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula</b> and as far as the Persian coast.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> is a {{peninsula}} {{between the}} Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf. There are 57known tropical cyclones that affected the peninsula, primarily Yemen and Oman. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of Socotra. Most {{of the tropical}} cyclones originated in the Arabian Sea, {{the portion of the}} Indian Ocean north of the equator and west of India. The remainder formed in the Bay of Bengal off India's east coast. Collectively, the 57storms have caused at least US$5.7billion in damage and 1,662deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was Cyclone Gonu, which caused US$4billion in damage and 50fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> is chiefly due to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The small, pale {{northern}} subspecies of {{crag martin}} {{found in the}} mountains of North Africa and the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula</b> is now usually split as the pale crag martin, Ptyonoprogne obsoleta. The remaining birds are now identified as Eurasian crag martin.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not found}} in {{rainforest}} areas, such as {{along the coast of}} West Africa and in Central Africa (i.e., central DR Congo); it is also absent from the Mediterranean coastal region of North Africa. On the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula,</b> it is found as far north as Ta'if. It has been reported {{to be found in the}} Dhofar region of southern Oman.|$|E
5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|Arabian horses also {{spread to}} the rest of the world via the Ottoman Empire, which rose in 1299. Though it never fully {{dominated}} the heart of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> this Turkish empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade, diplomacy and war. The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses, and Ottoman nobles, such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure, desert-bred Arabian horses.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It is not certain, however, {{if it was the}} religion of the majority outside the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic by the time the Ayyubids took power there.|$|E
5|$|Hana {{currently}} {{owns and}} operates or sub-licenses over 200 restaurants on the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula,</b> Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. To accommodate the tenets of the majority Islamic population's faith in its markets, all of the locations operated and overseen by Hana feature halal meats and do not feature pork based products. Additionally, hamburgers are called beefburgers, avoiding the term ham and its association with pork.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the cheetah ranged across vast {{stretches}} of Asia: from the Mediterranean and the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{in the west}} to the Indian subcontinent in the east, and as far north as the Caspian and Aral Seas. However, the cheetah has disappeared from the majority of its historic range, save for Iran and possibly a few areas in Afghanistan, the Indian subcontinent, and Turkmenistan.|$|E
5|$|Many centuries later, both {{world wars}} saw {{fighting}} in the desert. In the First World War, the Ottoman Turks were engaged with the British regular army in a campaign that spanned the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula.</b> The Turks were defeated by the British, who had the backing of irregular Arab forces that were seeking to revolt against the Turks in the Hejaz, made famous in T. E. Lawrence's book Seven Pillars of Wisdom.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November 2011, Charlie Hebdo was firebombed {{right before}} its 3 November issue was due; {{the issue was}} called Charia Hebdo and satirically {{featured}} Muhammad as guest-editor. The editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, known as Charb, and two co-workers at Charlie Hebdo subsequently received police protection. Charb was placed on a hit list by Al-Qaeda in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> along with Kurt Westergaard, Lars Vilks, Carsten Juste and Flemming Rose after editing an edition of Charlie Hebdo that satirised Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 2015, two French Muslim extremists {{attacked}} the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo and killed thirteen people, {{in an attack}} claimed by Al-Qaeda in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> and on 9 January, a third terrorist, who claimed {{he was part of}} ISIL, killed four hostages during an attack at a Jewish grocery store at Porte de Vincennes. On 11 January an estimated 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|Palmyrene trade {{reached its}} apex {{during the second}} century, aided by two factors; {{the first was a}} trade route built by Palmyrenes, and {{protected}} by garrisons at major locations, including a garrison in Dura-Europos manned in 117 AD. The second was the Roman conquest of the Nabataean capital Petra in 106, shifting control over southern trade routes of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> from the Nabataeans to Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|Resin is {{gathered}} by tapping trees including silver-fir and Aleppo pine; the best resin {{is from the}} terebinth. On Mount Ida in Crete the people gather pitch from Corsican pine and Aleppo pine. Gums such as frankincense, myrrh and balsam of Mecca are gathered either by cutting the plant or naturally. Frankincense and myrrh are gathered into the closely guarded temple of the Sabaeans. Cassia and cinnamon also come from the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{last of the}} Roman-Persian Wars {{ended in}} 627, when Heraclius {{concluded}} a successful campaign against the Persians in Mesopotamia. At the same time, Mohammad united the Arabs {{under the banner of}} Islam. After his death in 632, Abu Bakr succeeded him as the first Rashidun Caliph. Suppressing several internal revolts, Abu Bakr sought to expand the empire beyond the confines of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed off the Karnataka-Goa coastline in the Arabian Sea on May 27 and developed into a depression the next day. The system developed further into a cyclonic storm on May 29 as it moved to the north. The storm reached its peak with 95km/h (60mph) soon after this as it turned to the west, but soon degenerated into a deep depression over the northern Arabian Sea on May 31. The depression continued to move west, weakening to a remnant low shortly as it made landfall on the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> on June 2. The remnant low dissipated over southern Saudi Arabia the next day.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression {{turned to a}} northwest motion before resuming a track to the west-northwest. On May7 it intensified into a deep depression, and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized as the center became exposed from the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due {{to the influence of}} dry air from the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> as well as from wind shear. As a result, the IMD downgraded it to depression status early on May8. However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation, and it again reached deep depression status, about 830km (515mi) southeast of Oman.|$|E
5|$|Biblical and extrabiblical {{evidence}} suggests that of the Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were most prominent in their contacts with the world outside of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Like other nomadic groups, they lived primarily in unfortified encampments. Pastoralists and traders in livestock, such as male lambs, rams and goats, they also {{played a key role}} in the prosperity of Gaza's incense trade, controlling traffic in the desert regions between Egypt and Palestine. As a result of their trading activities, there were clans from among the Qedarites that became wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Hector E. Pagan {{graduated}} from the U.S. Army War College in 2003. Pagan took command of the 5th SF Group (Airborne) in Baghdad, Iraq, Operation Iraqi Freedom. He led the 5th SF Group (Airborne) in combat as {{the commander of the}} Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> for two combat tours in 2003 and 2004. Later Pagan became the first Hispanic of Puerto Rican descent to become Deputy Commanding General of the U.S.Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} check the Arab advance and to recover lost territory, Emperor Heraclius had sent a massive {{expedition}} to the Levant in May 636. As the Byzantine army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> where, after being reinforced, they defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army. The battle {{is considered to be}} one of Khalid ibn al-Walid's greatest military victories. It cemented his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{there had}} been rapid {{political}} development in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and by 630, he had successfully united most of the Arabia under a single political authority. When Muhammad died in June 632, Abu Bakr was elected Caliph and his political successor. Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, when several Arab tribes openly revolted against Abu Bakr, who declared war against the rebels. In {{what became known as}} the Ridda wars of 632–633, Abu Bakr managed to unite Arabia under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina.|$|E
5|$|Nilofar {{originated}} {{from a low}} pressure area between India and the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> It developed into a depression on October25 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions. The system intensified into a cyclonic storm on October26. Quickly organizing due to the conditions, Nilofar developed a well-defined eye and structure, attaining its peak intensity on October28. At the time, Nilofar was expected to make landfall in western India, prompting evacuations and preparations. However, high wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and Nilofar degraded into a remnant low pressure area on October31 off the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the vital}} {{instruments}} which facilitated long distance trade was portage and the domestication of beasts of burden. Organized caravans, visible by the 2nd millennium BCE, could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way. The domestication of camels allowed Arabian nomads {{to control the}} long distance trade in spices and silk from the Far East to the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Caravans were useful in long-distance trade largely for carrying luxury goods, the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators. With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies, newer trade routes– dispensing innovations of civilizations– began to rise.|$|E
5|$|Sailing from Cape Town on 6 September, Samuel Huntington sailed {{around the}} African continent, calling at Durban on 10 September, and {{arriving}} at Aden, on the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula,</b> in mid September. Departing there on 24 September, the Huntington sailed up the Red Sea, calling at Massaua on the Eritrean coast on 26 September and Suez on 1 October. Departing Suez on 12 October, she retraced her track around Africa, calling at Port Sudan on 18 October, Durban on 2 November, Cape Town on 7 November. Leaving the same day, {{she crossed the}} South Atlantic and headed for Paramaribo, Suriname.|$|E
5|$|Sharia (or Islamic law), {{the primary}} source of law in modern Saudi Arabia, was {{developed}} gradually by Muslim judges and scholars between the seventh and tenth centuries. From the time of the Abbasid caliphate in the 8th century, the developing Sharia was accepted as the basis of law in the towns of the Muslim world, including the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula,</b> and upheld by local rulers, eclipsing urf (or pre-Islamic local customary law). In the rural areas, urf continued to be predominant for some time, and, for instance, was the main source of law among the bedouin of Nejd in central Arabia until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Oman cyclone (also {{known as}} Cyclone 02A) was a {{tenacious}} and deadly system that caused historic flooding {{in the southern}} <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> It originated from a disturbance in the Gulf of Aden, the first such tropical cyclogenesis on record. After moving eastward, the system interacted with the monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on June11. Later that day, it turned toward Oman and struck the country's southeast coast. It weakened over land, dissipating on June12, although it continued to produce rainfall – heavy at times – {{over the next few}} days.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas of}} Mesopotamia and the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{experiences}} rapid growth and sharing of musical instruments {{once they were}} united by Islamic culture in the seventh century. Frame drums and cylindrical drums of various depths were immensely important in all genres of music. Conical oboes {{were involved in the}} music that accompanied wedding and circumcision ceremonies. Persian miniatures provide information on the development of kettle drums in Mesopotamia that spread as far as Java. Various lutes, zithers, dulcimers, and harps spread as far as Madagascar to the south and modern-day Sulawesi to the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} map {{itself of}} Europa Barbarorum covers a wider geographical area {{than that of}} Rome: Total War, expanding into {{areas such as the}} <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> India, Central Asia, and Scandinavia. Relief, province boundaries, snow boundaries, vegetation types, coastlines and areas prone to natural disaster in 272 BC have all been researched and implemented into the campaign map. The Nile–Red Sea canal linking the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea has been added to the map, as have the great trade routes of the ancient world, such as the Amber and Silk Roads, which can be captured and exploited by the player or by the artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has {{not occurred}} in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. Wild dromedaries inhabited arid regions, particularly the Sahara Desert. The original range of the camel’s wild ancestors was probably southern Asia and the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula.</b> Its range included hot, arid regions of northern Africa, Ethiopia, the Near East and western and central Asia. The dromedary typically thrives in areas with a long dry season and a short wet season. They are sensitive to cold and humidity, though some breeds can thrive in humid conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has {{not occurred}} naturally {{in the wild}} for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} {{is native to}} Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, but it is extinct in Djibouti. Largely {{confined}} to the Horn of Africa today, the species historically ranged from Awash (Ethiopia) southward through southern and eastern Ethiopia, and most parts of Somalia (except {{the north and the}} northeast) and Kenya (except the southwest). It also occurred in southeastern Sudan and northeastern and eastern parts of Uganda and Tanzania. The only evidence for its existence in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula</b> is a single set of horns obtained in 1967 from an individual shot in South Yemen and another in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
