It was {{originally intended to}} widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978, and a second inquiry in 1984, chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings, was also abandoned. The traffic flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a day by 1981, but by 1986 the <b>actual</b> <b>flow</b> was only 30,000 a day.|$|E

Indices and variables {{to be taken into}} consideration are classified into two sub-categories as data on <b>actual</b> <b>flows</b> and data on restrictions. Data on <b>actual</b> <b>flows</b> include foreign trade, foreign direct investment, stocks, portfolio investment, and income payments to foreign nationals. Hidden import barriers, mean tariff rate, taxes on international trade and capital account restrictions are the variables which will be assessed while evaluating the economic restrictions. The paper is finally going to compare and discuss alternative globalization measures. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
40|$|The yield {{monitors}} use {{a constant}} delay time {{to match the}} grain flow with location. Therefore, mixing and smoothing effects on the grain flow are neglected. Although constant time delay compensates for time mismatch, <b>actual</b> grain <b>flow</b> at a combine harvester head is not equal to the grain flow measured by a sensor due to the dynamics effects. In order to eliminate the dynamics effects, a new method for estimating <b>actual</b> grain <b>flow,</b> called proportional distribution (PD), is proposed. This method assumes that <b>actual</b> grain <b>flow</b> is directly proportional to the feedrate. Based on this assumption, the <b>actual</b> grain <b>flow</b> results from redistributing accumulated grain mass over a certain time according to {{the profile of the}} feedrate. The PD can avoid the dynamics effects because the feedrate is measured at a combine harvester&# 39;s head. Compared with constant time delay, the proposed method can effectively estimate <b>actual</b> grain <b>flow</b> and be applied to improve the accuracy of yield maps...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{empirical}} research on urban networks has used data on infrastructure networks to guesstimate <b>actual</b> inter-city <b>flows.</b> However, {{with the exception}} of recent research on airline networks {{in the context of the}} world city literature, relatively limited attention has been paid to the degree to which the outline of these infrastructure networks reflects the <b>actual</b> <b>flows</b> they undergird. This study presents a method to improve our estimation of urban interaction in and through infrastructure networks by focusing on the example of passenger railways, which is arguably a key potential data source in research on urban networks in metropolitan regions. We first review common biases when using infrastructure networks to approximate <b>actual</b> inter-city <b>flows,</b> after which we present an alternative approach that draws on research on operational train scheduling. This research has shown that ‘dwell time’ at train stations reflects the length of the alighting and boarding process, and we use this insight to estimate actual interaction through the application of a bimodal network projection function. We apply our method to the high-speed railway (HSR) network within the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, discuss the difference between our modelled network and the original network, and evaluate its validity through a systemic comparison with a benchmark dataset of <b>actual</b> passenger <b>flows...</b>|$|R

500|$|Perry was {{succeeded by}} John Grundy, Sr., {{who had arrived}} in the region in 1731 {{at the request of the}} Duke of Buccleuch, who wanted his estates surveyed. Perry was {{building}} the Spalding sluice at the time, and Grundy's work allowed him to study drains, banks, sluices and outfalls. He formed the opinion that mathematical and philosophical principles should be applied to the drainage of low-lying regions. In 1733, he surveyed the parish of Moulton, a little further downstream, to assess how drainage could be improved for the Commissioners of Sewers. He demonstrated the use of a telescopic spirit level, which enabled him to achieve accurate levels, with errors of less than 1 inch per mile (2cm per km). Next he addressed the issue of flow in open drains. Using his mathematical principles, he calculated that water in a drain which was [...] long, and had a fall of [...] over its length should travel at around , taking 1 hour and 28 minutes to travel the length of the drain. Observations in the field showed him that other factors, such as fluid friction, resulted in the <b>actual</b> <b>flow</b> rate being less than half of this. He published a paper of his findings in April 1734, and insisted that accurate mapping and levels, together with physical observation of drains and rivers, were essential to deciding how fenland could best be drained. In the same month, he began working for the Adventurers of Deeping Fen, to produce a drainage scheme. He spent some time mapping [...] of the Welland, and his chief recommendation was for a reservoir and sluice at the outfall of the River Glen, which would enable the outfall to be scoured at low tide, by releasing water from the reservoir.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} a methodology to estimate current commodity inflows to a sub-state region using a supply-side, commodity-by-industry input-output model and commodity flow data for American states. Since the 1993 Commodity Flow Survey {{does not go}} below the state level, the estimation of commodity flows to a particular sub-state region in the United States has always proven difficult. By combining state-level commodity flow data with the supply-side commodity-by-industry input-output model, an estimate of commodity flows to smaller regions {{can be carried out}} entirely based on the regional industrial structure. Since the <b>actual</b> sub-state <b>flows</b> are typically unobserved, the accuracy of the methodology is unknown. However, by applying the same methodology to larger regions, with actual states used as the forecast region, the estimates can be compared to <b>actual</b> <b>flows.</b> We carry out this test of the methodologys accuracy, and report the results...|$|R
30|$|Although the Slepian {{decomposition}} {{offers an}} optimal trade-off between spatial and spectral fidelity, {{there are a}} number of unavoidable side effects. The plots of the ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ ambiguous patches show two such features. Firstly, there is strong aliasing of the signal along the boundary between the regions. Secondly, the strength of the aliasing depends on the slope of the input spectrum. As can be seen from Fig. 3, more leakage occurs when the spectral energy decreases with degree (right hand column), the typical spectral slope of <b>actual</b> <b>flows.</b>|$|R

2500|$|For flow of gases, to {{determine}} whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the Mach number of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3. [...] For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the <b>actual</b> <b>flow</b> pressure becomes). [...] Acoustic problems always require allowing compressibility, since sound waves are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.|$|E
