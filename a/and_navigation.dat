5|$|Humans {{have used}} {{compasses}} for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century. Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation. Using magnetoception various other organisms, ranging from {{some types of}} bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation <b>and</b> <b>navigation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey <b>and</b> <b>navigation,</b> and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1881, {{industrialists}} proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation. Changes {{to the river}} {{over the years have}} included the construction of jetties at the river's mouth, dredging, and the construction of canals <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> locks. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as Lewiston, Idaho.|$|E
5|$|Born in Windlesham, Surrey in 1976, {{where he}} lived and moved to Sherborne. He first learned to sail aged four or five, while visiting his {{grandparents}} at Christchurch, Dorset, and later sailed in a Seafly dinghy with his father, Keith. His talent {{brought him to the}} notice of Jim Saltonstall, who coached him in the Royal Yachting Association youth squad. Simpson attended Pangbourne College, a mixed boarding school in Berkshire, which originated as a nautical college, coaching students in sailing, seamanship <b>and</b> <b>navigation.</b> He studied at University College London, gaining a degree in economics. In addition to sailing, he was a keen footballer.|$|E

5|$|China's power {{began to}} decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the {{subsequent}} Ming Dynastyneglected the importance of China's trade from sea power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and its grip on the Spice trade slacken, and the European powers stepped in. Portugal, with its technological advances in naval architecture, weaponry, seamanship <b>and</b> <b>navigation,</b> took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European Imperialism {{and the age of}} European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s {{and again}} after his {{participation}} in the American Civil War, Raynolds was the head engineer on numerous lighthouse construction projects. He oversaw riverway and harbor dredging projects intended to improve accessibility <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> for shipping. As a cartographer, Raynolds surveyed and mapped the islands and shorelines on the Great Lakes and other regions. At least six lighthouses whose construction he oversaw are still standing. Some are still in use and of these, several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|However, by 2009, {{the airport}} terminal, runway <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> aids were {{upgraded}} with about $25million, which {{was funded by}} the British Columbia government, who gave $4million, the Canadian government, who gave $6.6million and the airport itself for the remaining money and announced in 2007; $13million was used to upgrade the runway, $3million was used to expand the navigation aid, while $4million was used for terminal improvements. The city's intention was to expand and upgrade the airport in order for the economy and tourism to expand. City mayor Peter Milobar and members of the Kamloops Indian Band praised its expansion.

5|$|In 1838, a {{man named}} Mr. Butler {{requested}} permission of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to construct a tunnel or through cut through Nescopeck Mountain for the Lehigh Coal <b>and</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Glen Summit Springs Hotel operated on top of Nescopeck Mountain. It was constructed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. During its most active use, it attracted visitors from the Wyoming Valley and from the East Coast of the United States. The Lehigh Valley Railroad historically passed over the ridge. In the late 1800s, the ridge was prospected for coal.|$|E
