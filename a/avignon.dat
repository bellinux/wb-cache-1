5|$|Following the <b>Avignon</b> Papacy, the Cardinal Nephew was {{responsible}} for the spiritual and temporal governance of the Comtat Venaissin, where the <b>Avignon</b> Popes had resided; in 1475, Pope Sixtus IV raised the Diocese of <b>Avignon</b> to the rank of an archbishopric, to the benefit of his nephew Giuliano della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing sense}} of church-state {{conflicts}} marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of <b>Avignon</b> in southern France during a period known as the <b>Avignon</b> Papacy. The <b>Avignon</b> Papacy ended in 1376 when the pope returned to Rome, but was followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long Western schism with claimants to the papacy in Rome, <b>Avignon</b> and (after 1409) Pisa. The matter was finally resolved in 1417 at the Council of Constance where the cardinals called upon all three claimants to the papal throne to resign, and held a new election naming Martin V pope.|$|E
5|$|He preached and lectured on the Immaculate Conception, {{and rose}} to {{seniority}} under the patronage of the <b>Avignon</b> Papacy and King Robert II of Scotland, becoming Bishop of Galloway and the only Franciscan to hold a Scottish bishopric. Thereafter he was a staunch advocate of <b>Avignon</b> Pope Clement VII against the English-backed Urban VI, for whom he engaged in partisan preaching and writing, famously challenging any English bishop to settle the issue by single combat.|$|E
5|$|In the 1390s Jean Gerson of the University of Paris {{formed a}} council to {{eliminate}} the Western Schism, and in recognition of her negotiating skills he placed Isabeau on the council. The French wanted both the <b>Avignon</b> and Roman popes to abdicate {{in favor of a}} single papacy in Rome; Clement VII in <b>Avignon</b> welcomed Isabeau's presence given her record as an effective mediator. However, the effort faded when Clement VII died.|$|E
5|$|Memories of {{the sack}} of Rome by Celtic tribes from Gaul in 390/387 BC, {{had been made}} into a legendary account that was taught to each {{generation}} of Roman youth, were still prominent despite their historical distance. In 121 BC, Rome {{came into contact with}} the Celtic tribes of the Allobroges and the Arverni, both of which they defeated with apparent ease in the First Battle of <b>Avignon</b> near the Rhone river and the Second Battle of <b>Avignon,</b> the same year.|$|E
5|$|The sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204 brought {{decline to}} the city and its silk industry, and many {{artisans}} left the city in the early 13th century. Italy developed a large domestic silk industry after 2000 skilled weavers came from Constantinople. Many also chose to settle in <b>Avignon</b> to furnish the popes of <b>Avignon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eurostar is a {{high-speed}} railway service connecting London with <b>Avignon,</b> Brussels, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Paris. All its trains traverse the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, {{owned and operated}} separately by Eurotunnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1388 he {{returned}} to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, Boniface IX. Leaving Rome, Paul went {{to the court of}} Amadeus VII of Savoy. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy, Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the <b>Avignon</b> papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow <b>Avignon</b> supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of <b>Avignon.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1947 {{the novel}} was adapted into a French film The Royalists {{directed}} by Henri Calef and starring Paul Amiot and Roland Armontel. Alain Vanzo adapted {{it into an}} opera, premiered in <b>Avignon</b> in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Exemplifying the French School are {{the early}} <b>Avignon</b> Pietà of Enguerrand Quarton; the {{anonymous}} painting of King Jean le Bon (c.1360), possibly the oldest independent portrait in Western painting to survive from the postclassical era; Hyacinthe Rigaud's Louis XIV; Jacques-Louis David's The Coronation of Napoleon; and Eugène Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People.|$|E
5|$|In 1336, an embassy to the French Pope Benedict XII in <b>Avignon</b> {{was sent}} by Toghun Temür, the last Yuan emperor in Dadu. The embassy was led by two Genoese {{travelers}} {{in the service of}} the Mongol emperor, who carried letters representing that the Mongols had been eight years (since Archbishop John of Montecorvino's death) without a spiritual guide, and earnestly desired one. Pope Benedict appointed four ecclesiastics as his legates to the khan's court. In 1338, a total of 50 ecclesiastics were sent by the pope to Peking, among them John of Marignolli, who returned to <b>Avignon</b> in 1353 with a letter from the Yuan emperor to Pope Innocent VI. But soon, the Han Chinese rose up and drove the Mongols out of China, establishing the Ming Dynasty in 1368. By 1369, all foreign influences, from Mongols to Christians, Manichaeans, and Buddhists, were expelled by the Ming Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In July 1793, Captain Napoleon Bonaparte, an {{artillery}} officer, was {{placed under the}} command of General Jean-Baptiste Carteaux to deal with rebels from Marseille situated in <b>Avignon,</b> where army munitions required by the French Army of Italy were being stored. On 24 July, Carteaux's National Guardsmen assaulted <b>Avignon</b> which was held by rebellious Guardsmen. They killed thirty citizens in cold blood during the attack before capturing the town and army supplies. Afterwards, Napoleon travelled to nearby Tarascon to find wagons with which to transport the munition. He visited Beaucaire, across the river from Tarascon, which had been holding an annual fair. Napoleon arrived on 28 July, {{the last day of the}} fair, and went to a tavern where he shared supper and conversation with four merchants– two from Marseille, one from Montpellier and another from Nîmes.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Urban VI {{had been}} elected pope in 1378, Robert of Geneva was elected as a rival pope, taking the name Pope Clement VII and {{removing}} himself to <b>Avignon.</b> The so-called Western Schism subsequently caused a great crisis in the Church and created rivalry and conflict throughout Christian Europe. It was eventually resolved {{as a result of}} the Council of Constance (1414–1418).|$|E
5|$|Strachwitz and his {{men were}} {{questioned}} by a French captain and accused of being spies and saboteurs. They {{were taken to the}} prison at Châlons the next day where they were separated. Strachwitz, as an officer, was placed in solitary confinement. Early in the morning they were all lined up for the firing squad, but a French captain arrived just in time to stop the execution. Strachwitz {{and his men}} were then tried before a French military court on 14 October 1914. The court sentenced them all to five years of forced labour on the prison island of Cayenne. At the same time they were deprived of rank, thus losing the status of prisoners of war. Strachwitz was then taken to the prisons at Lyon and Montpellier, and then to the Île de Ré, from where the prison ship would depart for Cayenne. It is unclear what circumstances prevented his departure, but he was imprisoned at Riom and <b>Avignon</b> instead. At <b>Avignon</b> prison he was physically and mentally tortured by both the guards and the other prisoners. This included being chained naked to a wall, deprivation of food and severe beatings. After one year at <b>Avignon</b> he was given a German uniform and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Fort Barraux.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{was at the}} Papal {{court in}} <b>Avignon</b> in 1371 acting as proctor for Patrick de Leuchars, Bishop of Brechin, making a payment to the papal chamber. Having {{obtained}} his Theology degree, Thomas lectured on the conception of the immaculate Virgin at Paris in 1373 as a Bachelor of Sentences (baccatarius Sententiarum); he had previously been appointed by the Chancellor of the university to deliver the summer lectures on the Sentences.|$|E
5|$|Walter, bishop-elect, {{travelled}} to {{the papal}} court at <b>Avignon,</b> and was provided (appointed) as bishop by Pope Innocent on 18 June 1361. The papal letter of provision expressed displeasure that the chapter (by electing) and Walter (by accepting the election) were ignoring a previous papal reservation of the bishopric. Pope Innocent quashed the election, but nevertheless agreed to appoint (provide) Walter to the bishopric.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{cardinals}} have historically gathered at {{a handful of}} other locations within Rome and beyond, only five elections since 1455 have been held outside the Apostolic Palace. Twenty-eight papal elections have been held outside Rome, in: Terracina (1088), Cluny (1119), Velletri (1181), Verona (1185), Ferrara (October 1187), Pisa (December 1187), Perugia (1216, 12641265, 1285, 12921294, 13041305), Anagni (1243), Naples (1254, 1294), Viterbo (1261, 12681271, July 1276, August–September 1276, 1277, 12811282), Arezzo (January 1276), Carpentras/Lyon (13141316), <b>Avignon</b> (1334, 1342, 1352, 1362, 1370), Konstanz (1417) and Venice (17991800). Three elections moved between locations while in progress: the elections of 1268–71, 1292–94, and 1314–16.|$|E
5|$|Born in <b>Avignon</b> on 22 February 1717, Crillon was {{a member}} of a {{distinguished}} family that had originated in Chieri, Piedmont. His branch of the family had a long history of military service to the French crown. A descendant of the famous 16th-century general Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon ("the brave Crillon"), he was the son of the 3rd Duke of Crillon, François Félix de Berton des Balbes, and Marie-Thérèse de Fabry de Moncault. Louis was the first-born of the couple's six children (four boys and two girls).|$|E
5|$|By 18 April 1390, he had {{obtained}} a Bachelor's degree (in Decrees) from the University of Avignon; he {{appears in the}} <b>Avignon</b> university student rolls on 9 August 1393 and again on 21 October 1394. Thomas {{had obtained}} a doctorate (in Decrees) sometime between 15 July 1401 and 9 June 1410. He witnessed Bishop Henry de Wardlaw's foundation charter of the University of St Andrews on 28 February 1412 and was named in the grant of privileges made to the new university by Pope Benedict XIII on 28 August 1413.|$|E
5|$|Cossa succeeded Alexander V as John XXIII in 1410. John XXIII was {{acknowledged}} as pope by France, England, Bohemia, Prussia, Portugal, {{parts of the}} Holy Roman Empire, and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and Venice; however, the <b>Avignon</b> Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the Kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, and Scotland and Gregory XII was still favored by Ladislaus of Naples, Carlo I Malatesta, the princes of Bavaria, Louis III, Elector of the Palatinate, and parts of Germany and Poland.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to <b>Avignon,</b> renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|During {{his long}} and tumultuous career, Paul was {{appointed}} an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, {{pretended to be}} the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, switched from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again, supported both the See of Rome and the <b>Avignon</b> anti-popes in the Western Schism, and managed to be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved on}} to study civil law at the University of Orléans, and by 24 March 1337, he was serving as the proctor of the Scottish Nation in Orléans. By 7 December 1345, he had {{received}} a Licentiate in Civil Law. On 20 December 1348 he was at <b>Avignon</b> as an envoy of his university, and while there he obtained a grace regarding his own benefice holding from Pope Clement VI. On 7 October 1349, Pope Clement granted an indult to Walter allowing him to be absent from his cure while he continued his studies at Orléans.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years Pembroke {{worked closely with the}} King. He was appointed the King’s lieutenant in Scotland in 1314, and was present at the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn, where he helped lead Edward away from the field of battle. In 1317, however, while returning from a papal embassy to <b>Avignon,</b> he was captured by a Jean de Lamouilly, and held for ransom in Germany. The ransom of £10,400 was to cause Pembroke significant financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|Minor Crusading efforts lingered {{into the}} 14thcentury, and several Crusades were {{launched}} during the 14th and 15th centuries {{to counter the}} expansion of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. In 1309 as many as 30,000 peasants gathered from England, north-eastern France, and Germany proceeded as far as <b>Avignon</b> but disbanded there. Peter I of Cyprus captured and sacked Alexandria in 1365 in {{what became known as the}} Alexandrian Crusade; his motivation was as much commercial as religious. LouisII led the 1390 Barbary Crusade against Muslim pirates in North Africa; after a ten-week siege, the Crusaders signed a ten-year truce.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 2012 at the Européen theatre, Tsamere {{performed}} {{alongside the}} On n'demande qu'à en rire jury member Éric Métayer in Métamère en impro. He performed La tournée du trio with his On n'demande qu'à en rire colleague Jérémy Ferrari, and Baptiste Lecaplain; after {{a tour of}} 12 performances in Zéniths, they did several special performances in February 2014. Tsamere has attended comedy festivals such as the Montreux Comedy Festival, where he performed with Ferrari, and the <b>Avignon</b> Festival. He {{is now part of}} the Ligue Majeure d'Improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{forty minutes}} after his collapse, a police {{helicopter}} took Simpson to nearby <b>Avignon</b> hospital, {{where he was}} pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Dumas refused to sign a burial certificate and a poisons expert from Marseille was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. Two empty tubes of amphetamines and a half-full tube {{were found in the}} rear pocket of his racing jersey, one of which was labelled Tonedron. The British team was called in for questioning and their baggage was searched. Two of the Belgian soigneurs– who looked after riders on the British team including Simpson– locked themselves in their room, got drunk and did not come out.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the few major {{thoroughfares}} in Rome able to cope with a high volume of traffic without congestion, it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman community and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various Sacks of Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to <b>Avignon</b> during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained a maze of densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways.|$|E
5|$|That evening Napoleon and {{the four}} merchants {{discussed}} the revolution, subsequent rebellions, and their consequences. Speaking as a pro-Republican, Napoleon supported the Jacobin cause, and explained {{the benefits of the}} revolution, whilst defending Carteaux's actions in <b>Avignon.</b> One of the merchants from Marseille expressed his moderate views regarding the revolution, and reasons for supporting civil war against a central government. The merchant stressed that Marseille did not fight for the Royalist cause, but opposed the nature of the Convention itself, condemning its decrees and deeming the execution of citizens as unlawful. Napoleon concluded that the people of Marseille should reject counter-revolutionary ideals and adopt the constitution of the French Republic in order to end the civil war and allow the regular army to restore France.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or {{deodoriser}} {{and scattered}} it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When Nero entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths. They {{used it as}} mascara, stirred saffron threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took saffron {{with them when they}} settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the <b>Avignon</b> Papacy in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Edward III {{coincided with the}} {{so-called}} Babylonian Captivity of the papacy at <b>Avignon.</b> During the wars with France, opposition emerged in England against perceived injustices by a papacy largely controlled by the French crown. Papal taxation of the English Church was suspected to be financing the nation's enemies, while the practice of provisions – the Pope providing benefices for clerics – caused resentment in the English population. The statutes of Provisors and Praemunire, of 1350 and 1353 respectively, aimed to amend this by banning papal benefices, as well as limiting {{the power of the}} papal court over English subjects. The statutes did not sever the ties between the king and the Pope, who were equally dependent upon each other.|$|E
5|$|Villani and the Buonaccorsi {{had gained}} an unsavory {{reputation}} {{as early as}} 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for barratry {{for his part in}} building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, <b>Avignon,</b> and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite WalterVI of Brienne to become the next signor of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Hundred Years' War in 1337, Grosmont's attention was turned towards France. He took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later the same year, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for the king's considerable debts. He remained hostage until the next year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release. On his return he was made the king's lieutenant in the north and stayed at Roxburgh until 1342. The next years he spent in diplomatic negotiations in the Low Countries, Castile and <b>Avignon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Clement XIII died {{suddenly}} on 2 February 1769, {{a day before}} {{the date of the}} consistory that he had convoked to examine the demands for the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, in 1762 from the Kingdom of France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around <b>Avignon,</b> Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII left this difficult decision to his successor.|$|E
5|$|Edward II's close {{relationship}} to Gaveston {{had been a}} source of conflict at court, and Gaveston's execution by a group of rebellious barons in 1312 had brought the country to the brink of civil war. As Edmund came of age, he became an important member of the circle around his brother. In 1318, the Treaty of Leake was drafted as an effort to reconcile the opposing parties, and Edmund – as his first public act – was among the witnesses to sign this treaty. Further official appointments followed. In the spring of 1320 he took part in an embassy to Pope John XXII in <b>Avignon,</b> where the mission was to absolve the king of his oath to uphold the Ordinances, a set of restrictions imposed on royal authority by the baronage. Later that year, he joined his brother the king in Amiens, where Edward was paying homage to the French king. In October 1320, Edmund attended his first parliament.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{enjoyed a}} close {{relationship}} with Edward III, and accompanied him abroad on a diplomatic mission in 1329. That same year he was sent on an embassy to negotiate a marriage alliance with King Philip VI of France. His most important task, however, came in connection with a mission to the Papacy in <b>Avignon.</b> The young king—along with his government—was under the dominance of his mother Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer, who had been responsible for the deposition of the king's father. Montagu explained the king's situation, and Pope John XXII asked for a special signal that assure him that he was dealing with the king in person. After Montagu's return, Richard Bury, Keeper of the Privy Seal, wrote to inform the pope that only letters containing the words pater sancte (holy father), in Edward's own handwriting, were indeed from the king. Only Edward, Bury and Montagu were party to the scheme.|$|E
