5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic {{made its way}} to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would {{have to take care of}} 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on) would alert the city government <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E
5|$|The player {{would sit}} at the stand <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> buttons to make their moves, while one panel of lights showed {{the state of the}} game, and another showed the computer's {{calculations}} during its move. The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the demonstrator could describe exactly what the computer was doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what the computer was doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and she thinks about giving up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E

5|$|Chulip is an adventure/simulation game {{in which}} the player must improve the hero's {{reputation}} {{in the community of}} Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player has to find and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when to kiss other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will be happy <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the wrong time to kiss will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered by trial and error. For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game over if the player does not have sufficient health.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the impact}} on morale {{of the fact that}} the Germans were {{effectively}} fighting back in the air created a major scandal in the British parliament <b>and</b> <b>press.</b> <b>The</b> ascendancy of the Eindecker also contributed to the surprise the Germans were able to achieve at the start of the Battle of Verdun because the French reconnaissance aircraft failed to provide their usual cover of the German positions.|$|E
25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend told them he had implicated himself. The prosecution case included {{that there was no}} evidence that Bamber's father had telephoned him. They argued that the father was too badly injured to have spoken to anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he would have called the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was on the gun when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer at her throat <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, they said, to have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E

25|$|In Salta {{he found}} an {{intelligence}} net who was passing information to Goyeneche's royalist army, headed by the city's bishop, whom he forced to leave the territories controlled by the Junta. Even though they suffered from malaria he decided to advance towards Cochabamba. The advanced elements consisting of the battalion of mulattoes and the two cavalry regiments of Hussars and Dragoons, reached Humahuaca, {{while the rest of}} the army positioned itself in Jujuy. He celebrated there the second anniversary of the May Revolution, and he had a new white and light blue flag blessed by the chaplain. The well-planned solemn ceremony helped gain the support of the locals who were distrustful and some supported the royalist army and the dislike of the troops to the Prussian regime imposed by Holmberg. Order was strict and Belgrano ordered capital punishment inflicted for whom disobeyed express orders. One of the deserters due to the strict discipline was Venancio Benavídez, who moved to Goyeneche's forces, which had already taken Cochabamba and he told of the harsh conditions at Belgrano's army. With that intelligence, Goyeneche, who had just reinforced Pío de Tristán, decided to advance towards the south <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> advantage. Belgrano ordered conscription of all able men, forming a troop of cavalry irregulars, but received the order to retreat towards Córdoba from the Junta in Buenos Aires.|$|E
500|$|Dual Destinies {{introduces}} the [...] "mood matrix", {{through which the}} player can gauge the emotions of a witness, such as tones of anger when mentioning certain topics; if the player notices a contradictory emotional response during testimony, they can point out the discrepancy <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> witness for more information. Dual Destinies also introduces [...] "revisualization", where the player reviews vital facts and forms links between evidence to reach new conclusions. Spirit of Justice introduces [...] "divination séances", in which the player is shown the memories of victims moments before their deaths, and must find contradictions in the victim's five senses to determine what has happened. Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney introduces simultaneous cross-examinations of multiple witnesses, with the player {{being able to see}} and hear reactions from the different witnesses to the testimony and using this to find contradictions. Dai Gyakuten Saiban introduces [...] "joint reasoning", where the player finds out the truth by pointing out when their investigative partner Sherlock Holmes takes his reasoning [...] "further than the truth".|$|E
500|$|At the age {{of sixteen}} months, Randles enjoyed {{pressing}} keys on the piano and attempting to [...] "pick out a melody". One day, while Randles was ill, he noticed someone attempting to play Blue Bells of Scotland on the nearby piano. Assuming {{it was one of}} his older children, he requested they stopped and was surprised to find it was Randles who was playing. Due to her age, she needed to hit each key with the side of the hand. He discovered that she could play the basic melody for both the Blue Bells of Scotland and Charley over the water. Her father decided to start teaching her some other simple tunes and the musical notes. Before she could talk, she had the ability to recognise notes <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> piano keys which related to them. Her father went on to teach Randles the melody to the Welsh folk song, Ar hyd y nos. Randles also attempted to play the chords so her father ended up teaching her the full piece.|$|E

2500|$|This {{was done}} by {{building}} a kiln within the building, dividing it into three, the upper floor being used to receive the [...] "green" [...] hops, dry them <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> dried hops.

2500|$|At {{daylight}} German and Ottoman forces {{pushed through}} Es Salt to attack <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> 1st Light Horse Brigade rearguard {{until it was}} [...] from Es Salt. At the same time enemy guns heavily shelled the light horse rearguard and several German and Ottoman aircraft caused a number of casualties when they bombed the retiring columns as they moved down the narrow, steep-sided gorge. The light horse rearguard was about halfway between Es Salt and Umm esh Shert at dawn, when all the British Empire reconnaissance aircraft were sent off carrying four 20-lb. bombs.|$|E
2500|$|Nour also {{questioned}} the national sentiment of Bessarabia's landowning elite, which had largely been integrated into Russian nobility and served Imperial interests. The region's educated classes were Russian-educated, often Russian-oriented, and had therefore lost cheia de la lacătă, care închide sufletul țăranului ("the key that will unlock the peasant's soul"). However, in December 1908, he reported with enthusiasm that the Bessarabian Orthodox clergy upheld {{the use of}} Romanian ("Moldavian") in its religious schools <b>and</b> <b>press.</b> <b>The</b> measure, Nour noted, gave formal status to the vernacular, in line with his own Viața Basarabiei agenda. Nour's [...] "letters from Bessarabia" [...] irritated the Russifying hierarchs of the Orthodox Church. Seraphim Chichagov, the Archbishop of Chișinău, included him among the Church's [...] "worst enemies", but noted that his Romanian nationalism had managed to contaminate only 20 Bessarabian priests.|$|E

2500|$|The drum set for Rock Band {{features}} four rubber drum {{pads and}} a bass pedal. The pads have colored rings {{around the edges}} that correspond to the colored notes on-screen. These pads generally represent a snare drum (red), hi-hat/tom tom (yellow), ride cymbal/tom (blue), and crash cymbals/floor tom (green), though some songs may use the pads for other percussion instruments. [...] The pedal represents the bass drum (orange), with on-screen notes represented as orange horizontal lines across the on-screen drum track. To use the drum controller, players must strike the pads with drum sticks <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> bass pedal to match the scrolling notes on-screen. Drummers can improvise in special [...] "freestyle drum fill" [...] sections of songs, indicated by the on-screen columns for each note turning a solid color. The four pads will commonly change functionality to represent other drums, depending on the requirements of a song. The default pad order can be reversed using the [...] "Lefty Mode" [...] option in the game. The legs of the drum peripheral can adjust in height or be detached if the player wishes to place it on a table-top. The drum controller also features standard controller buttons {{in the middle of}} the peripheral for navigating in-game menus. Overdrive for drummers can be deployed by hitting the crash cymbal (green note for right-handed configuration) that appears directly after a freestyle drum fill. The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter, [...] "velocity sensitive" [...] drum pads, a reinforced bass pedal, wireless capabilities, and compatibility with separately sold cymbals. ION Audio has also produced a premium drum kit that includes cymbals and can be upgraded with a drum brain to be used as an electronic drum kit.|$|E

60|$|Not {{until the}} smile faded, {{which was a}} matter of seconds, did he reach out in the dark <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> first of a row of buttons. There were three rows of such buttons. The {{concealed}} lighting that spilled from the huge bowl under the ceiling revealed a sleeping-porch, three sides of which were fine-meshed copper screen. The fourth side was the house wall, solid concrete, through which French windows gave access.|$|E

6000|$|Which {{of these}} two gave in first I cannot tell, though to me fell the duty of persuading them, for {{whichever}} she was she rebelled {{as soon as the}} other showed signs of yielding, so that sometimes I had two converts in the week but never both on the same day. I would take them separately, <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> one to yield {{for the sake of the}} other, but they saw so easily through my artifice.

60|$|Chesney Wold is shut up, carpets are {{rolled into}} great scrolls in corners of comfortless rooms, bright damask does penance in brown holland, carving and gilding puts on mortification, and the Dedlock {{ancestors}} retire {{from the light}} of day again. Around and around the house the leaves fall thick, but never fast, for they come circling down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow. Let the gardener sweep and sweep the turf as he will, <b>and</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> leaves into full barrows, and wheel them off, still they lie ankle-deep. Howls the shrill wind round Chesney Wold; the sharp rain beats, the windows rattle, and the chimneys growl. Mists hide in the avenues, veil the points of view, and move in funeral-wise across the rising grounds. On all the house there is a cold, blank smell like the smell of a little church, though something dryer, suggesting that the dead and buried Dedlocks walk there in the long nights and leave the flavour of their graves behind them.|$|E
