40|$|This paper {{comprises}} {{a review}} of the rapidly expanding application of nanoscale mineral characterization methodology to the study of ore deposits. Utilising bismuth sulphosalt minerals from a reaction front in a skarn assemblage as an example, we illustrate how a complex problem in ore petrology, can be approached at scales down to that of single atoms. We demonstrate the interpretive opportunities that can be realised by doing this for other minerals within their petrogenetic contexts. From an area defined as Au-rich within a sulphosalt-sulphide assemblage, and using samples prepared on a Focused Ion Beam–Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) platform, we identify mineral species and trace the evolution of their intergrowths down to the atomic scale. Our approach progresses from a petrographic and trace element study of a larger polished block, to high-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) Scanning-TEM (STEM) studies. Lattice-scale heterogeneity imaged in HAADF STEM mode is expressed by changes in composition of unit cell slabs followed by nanoparticle formation and their growth into “veins”. We report a progressive transition from sulphosalt species which host lattice-bound Au (neyite, lillianite homologues; Pb-Bi-sulphosalts), to those that cannot accept Au (<b>aikinite).</b> This transition acts as a crystal structural barrier for Au. Fine particles of native gold track this progression over the scale of several hundred microns, leading to Au enrichment at the reaction front defined by an increase in the Cu gradient (several wt %), and abrupt changes in sulphosalt speciation from Pb-Bi-sulphosalts to <b>aikinite.</b> Atom-scale resolution imaging in HAADF STEM mode allows for the direct visualisation of the three component slabs in the neyite crystal structure, {{one of the largest and}} complex sulphosalts of boxwork-type. We show for the first time the presence of <b>aikinite</b> nanoparticles a few nanometres in size, occurring on distinct (111) PbS slabs in the neyite. This directly explains the non-stoichiometry of this phase, particularly with respect to Cu. Such non-stoichiometry is discussed elsewhere as defining distinct mineral species. The interplay between modular crystal structures and trace element behaviour, as discussed here for Au and Cu, has applications for other mineral systems. These include the incorporation and release of critical metals in sulphides, heavy elements (U, Pb, W) in iron oxides, the distribution of rare earth elements (REE), Y, and chalcophile elements (Mo, As) in calcic garnets, and the identification of nanometre-sized particles containing daughter products of radioactive decay in ores, concentrates, and tailings...|$|E

The gold-bearing massive sulphide mineralization is considered to be the product of an island arc volcano-plutonic process and hydrothermal activity that took place during the Late Cretaceous. In addition to the major gold-hosted opaque minerals such as pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena there are minor phases of tennantite, gold®eldite, Se-bearing <b>aikinite,</b> native silver and bornite in the massive sulphide lenses and stringer zones. Most of the sulphide minerals are Se-bearing. All of the six mineral assemblages that were deposited during the pyrite and copper-pyrite stages of mineralization are gold-bearing. The gold tenor as a rule is less than 1 g/t. Native gold and electrum occur as blebs or intergranular particles in the sulphide minerals. Gold in the early massive pyrite is of submicroscopic type (100 lm) in the late gold-sulphide assemblages. The electrum ®neness in 41 individually studied grains varies between 780 and 992 &with a mean of 895 &. Native silver was found in association with bornite. Cu, Te, Sb and Bi are the most common traceelements in gold and electrum. The Cu-Zn-Pb association is most important as a Au-Ag-carrier.

40|$|D v R I N G {{a recent}} {{examination}} ofsome mineralized veins from the Ratagain intrusion, north-west Scotland, the minerals hessite (Ag 2 Te) and electrum were identified. Because of the rarity of Au-Ag tellurides and primary, precious metal mineralization i the British Isles this occurrence is briefly described. The Ratagain igneous intrusion consists dominantly of diorite, syenite, and quartz monzonite (Nicholls, 1951). It has a Caledonian age and is intruded into Moinian schists. The quartz monzonite inthe {{south and east}} part of the intrusion has been faulted and contains many narrow quartz-calcite-fluorite v ins which are sporadically mineralized. These veins are well exposed {{on the west side}} of Loch Duich, along the road to Glenelg (e. g. grid reference NG 915195) and on the east side of the loch, along the road to Kyle of Lochalsh (e. g. NG 939198). A variety of minerals have been identified in these veins the most abundant being pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, molybdenite, and futile. In addition, hessite, tennantite, <b>aikinite,</b> and marcasite are locally abundant, whilst electrum and gersdorffite have a sporadic distribu-tion. The hessite and electrum occur late in the overall mineral paragenesis. The hessite occurs as small (c. 0. 4 ram), irregularly shaped inclusions in galena, often as myrmekitic ntergrowths.

The mineralization occurs as disseminations and irregular veinlets and mainly com-prises pyrite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite-tennantite, calcite, and quartz. There are small inclusions of bismuthinite, galena, <b>aikinite</b> [(Cu,Pb,Fe,Bi) Sa], and a mineral with a chemistry similar to hodrushite (CusBilzS/z). The tetra-hedrite contains up to 6. 1 wt. ~ bismuth. Four km to the south, at Corrie Buie, are quartz veins, hosted by meta-limestones, containing alena with minor amounts of chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, electrum, schirmerite, and lillianite homologues. The mineralogy of both deposits i consistent with that associated with acid magmatism. There are mineralogical similarities between the two deposits but the style of mineralization atTomnadashan suggests a limited hydro-thermal system and therefore the Corrie Buie veins {{may be related to}} felsic intrusives to the south. A m Tomnadashan on the southern shore of Loch Tay (fig. 1) a small amount of copper mineralization occurs in a late Caledonian diorite intrusion. Four km to the south at Corrie Buie are quartz veins containing alena (fig. 1). Both deposits were mined on a small scale in the 19 th century.

40|$|The Wittichen Co-Ag-Bi-U {{mining area}} (Schwarzwald ore district, SW Germany) hosts several unconformity-related vein-type mineralizations within Variscan leucogranite and Permian to Triassic redbeds. The {{multistage}} mineralization formed {{at the intersection}} of two fault systems in the last 250 Ma. A Permo-Triassic ore stage I with minor U-Bi-quartz-fluorite mineralization is followed by a Jurassic to Cretaceous ore stage II with the main Ag and Co mineralization consisting of several generations of gangue minerals that host the sub-stages of U-Bi, Bi-Ag, Ni-As-Bi and Co-As-Bi. Important ore minerals are native elements, Co and Ni arsenides, and pitchblende; sulphides are absent. The Miocene ore stage III comprises barite with the Cu-Bi sulfosalts emplectite, wittichenite and <b>aikinite,</b> and the sulphides anilite and djurleite besides native Bi, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena and tennantite. The mineral-forming fluid system changed from low salinity (< 5 wt. % NaCl) at high temperature (around 300 °C) in Permian to highly saline (around 25 wt. % NaCl + CaCl₂) at lower temperatures (50 - 150 °C) in Triassic to Cretaceous times. Thermodynamic calculations and comparison with similar mineralizations worldwide show that the Mesozoic ore-forming fluid was alkaline with redox conditions above the hematite-magnetite buffer. We suggest that the precipitation mechanism for native elements, pitchblende and arsenides is a decrease in pH during fluid mixing processes. REE patterns in fluorite and the occurrence of Bi in all stages suggest a granitic source of some ore-forming elements, whereas, e. g. Ag, Co and Ni probably have been leached from the redbeds. The greater importance of Cu and isotope data indicates that the Miocene ore stage III is more influenced by fluids from the overlying redbeds and limestones than the earlier mineralization stages. 26 page(s...|$|E

Latest-generation microanalytical techniques, offering ppm-level precision coupled with micron-scale resolution, represent {{new methods to}} decipher the genetic history of an orebody. The 38. 5 Moz world-class Au-Cu Telfer deposit is hosted within a sequence of Paleo- to Neoproterozoic marine sediments on the northwestern margin of the Paterson Orogeny, Western Australia. The deposit is characterised by two dome structures hosting a series of stratabound and vertically-stacked ore horizons („reefs‟). Pyrite, a typically refractory mineral, is a common component of Au-ores and is the dominant ore mineral at Telfer. Petrographic analysis and Scanning Electron Microscope back-scatter imaging established four morphologically discrete stages of pyrite and an abundance of associated minerals. Laser-Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass-Spectrometry spot analysis and element mapping on selected pyrite grains delineated trace element patterns that allow for development of a model of multi-stage ore genesis. Gold distribution in pyrite indicates deformation-induced remobilisation of initially lattice-bound Au. Gold expelled from the sulphide lattice during remobilisation is observed as grains of electrum and native gold within brittle fractures and fissures as well as micro-, and likely also nanoscale inclusions in pyrite. Silver, Bi, Te, Pb, Tl, Co, Sn and As were also seen reconcentrated into micro-fractures and at grain margins. Oscillatory pyrite growth, expressed by zonation of As, Co and Ni are prominent; the latter two suggesting a metal source of mafic origin. Enrichment of Sn, Bi, Cu ± Zn, Te, Au, and associated presence of exsolved stannite, chalcopyrite and accessory bismuthinite, <b>aikinite,</b> calaverite, tetradymite and tsumoite suggest a granitic source {{for at least one}} generation of pyrite.

These variations way reflect the mixture of deeply circulating meteoric waters with rising, saline, hydrothermal fluids. Homogenization temperatures ranged from ca. 340 C to 80 C. Inclusions in neighbouring early formed quart 2 and sphalerite minerals from the same vein show a temperature rise from ca. 230 to 330 C in the early vein stage, and eventually boiling conditions were reached. At a later stage the fluids cooled from 330 C to ca. 80 C. in the base metal stage. The highest temperatures were obtained from the Tekmezar Group Veins, in comparison to the DarikBy Group Veins, indicating a horizontal temperature zoning in which the Bi-content of the aikinitebismuthinite solid solution minerals increases from West (Saridiken Dere) to east (Kornali Dere). Data obtained from isotherms indicates that the ore-bearing fluids rose along NW-SE trending faults.

Simple cooling of the solutions, pressure fluctuations, density and replacement processes played major roles in the formation of these veins.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{sulphide}} mineralization of Eptadendro (Aberdeen) and Rachi (Baiko) areas hosted in the Upper Tectonic Unit (U. T. U) of eastern Rhodope. The rocks of U. T. U are separated into four categories: ultrabasics (serpentinites), metabasites (hornblendites, amphibolites, and metagabbros), acidic (granitoids, gneisses, and pegmatites) and marbles. The ultrabasic rocks are metamorphosed harzburgites. The metabasites are of magmatic origin and their protoliths are andesitic- to sub-alkaline-basalts of tholeiitic affinity. The acidic rocks have an igneous origin, a calc-alkaline affinity and their protoliths were trondjemites. The detailed geochemical study of the U. T. U. metabasic rocks and the use of well known empirical discrimination diagrams suggest a formation in a tectonic environment which resembles that of an island arc. The mineralogy and mineral chemistry of the U. T. U. rocks have been studied in some details in order to evaluate the metamorphic conditions. Thus, it was confirmed that the U. T. U. have suffered three successive metamorphic episodes: a high-pressure metamorphism of eclogitic facies in Lower Cretaceous (119 ± 3. 5 Ma), a Barrow-type amphibolite facies with intermediate pressures in Paleocene (65. 4 Ma) and a low pressure of greenschists facies overprint in Eocene to Oligocene. Using mineral indicators for geothermobarometry in amphibolites and granitoids temperatures between 509 and 6240 C and pressures between 7 and 8. 5 Kb were estimated. The ore occurrences of Eptadendro and Rachi areas are placed in the U. T. U. and are found along the contacts between granitoids and meta-ultrabasic-basic rocks as well as within the ultrabasic-basic rocks. Two stages of mineralization have been identified: an initial stratabound which is considered of volcanosedimentary origin and a later one of vein-type formed during a hydrothermal episode, related to intrusion of trondjemites. The orebodies exhibit a lenticular to tabular morphology and are concordant with host rocks. Their length does not exceed the 30 meters, while their thicknes is less than one meter. On the basis of the textural features three types of mineralization are distinguished: a disseminated, a vein-type and a semimassive. The ore mineral assemblages consist of pyrite and chalcopyrite as main minerals, minor sphalerite, galena, magnetite and hematite, which form also local concentrations, and traces of hessite, bismuthinite, emplectite, tetradymite, <b>aikinite,</b> wittichenite, siegenite, millerite, bornite, pyrrhotite, covellite and goethite. Chlorite, quartz, calcite and sericite are the main gangue minerals. Folding of thin mineralized layers, brittle or ductile deformation, annealing or porphyroblasting of pyrite are typical metamorphic features confirming that mineralization has been affected by a series of metamorphic and deformation events. Lead isotope characteristics confirmed that lead was orogenic and has derived mainly from the crust and to a lesser extend from mantle. Bisides, lead isotopes give an Upper Cretaceous to Eocene age for the ore mineralization. These data confirm a metallogenetic stage which was connected with the intrusion of the trondjemites in the area. The δ 34 S values of sulphur isotopes for pyrite and chalcopyrite vary between 1. 2 and 4. 6 ‰ (mean value 2. 86 ‰). The sulphur isotopes give ore formation temperatures of 293 ± 340 C and denote that sulphur has probably derived in 90 % from hydrothermal fluids and in 10 % from seawater. From sulphur isotopes data also results a disequilibrium between pyrite and chalcopyrite confirming a two-stages mineralization process. Microthermometric studies revealed the presence of two types of fluid inclusions. ...|$|E
