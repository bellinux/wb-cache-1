5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree.

5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E

5|$|Artistic design, {{including}} {{character and}} monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from Final Fantasy through Final FantasyVI. Amano also handled title logo designs {{for all of}} the main series <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> illustrations from Final FantasyVII onward. Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from Final FantasyVII through Final FantasyX; for Final FantasyIX, however, character designs were handled by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the character designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of Final FantasyVII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy. Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and Akihiko Yoshida. Mihara was the character designer for Final FantasyXI, and Yoshida served as character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics, the Square-produced Vagrant Story, and Final FantasyXII.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the stations is revealing.|$|E
25|$|Image {{rejection}} is {{an important}} factor in choosing the intermediate frequency of a receiver.
