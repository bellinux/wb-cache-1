5|$|On September 16, 2007, due {{in large}} part to the {{participation}} of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially <b>attained</b> <b>a</b> sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so. Top500's fastest supercomputer at the time was BlueGene/L, at 0.280 petaFLOPS.

On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS, and was the first computing project to meet these five levels. In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was IBM's Roadrunner at 1.105 petaFLOPS. On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS. In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS.

5|$|Operationally, the cyclone was {{considered}} to be a Category 4 equivalent storm by the JTWC, with peak winds of 215km/h (135mph). This would have made the system the first recorded storm of that intensity on record in the Arabian Sea. However, in post-storm analysis, it was discovered that 1-minute winds did not exceed 205km/h (125mph). The next storm to reach this intensity was Cyclone Gonu in 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, which became the first known super cyclonic storm in the region. Upon attaining its peak intensity, the storm <b>attained</b> <b>a</b> barometric pressure of 932mbar (hPa), the lowest in the region at the time. The cyclone was ranked as the strongest in the Arabian Sea for six years until it was surpassed by Gonu in 2007, which <b>attained</b> <b>a</b> minimum pressure of 920mbar (hPa). In 2010, Cyclone Phet surpassed the 2001 cyclone as the second-strongest storm in the region, attaining winds of 240km/h (145mph), according to the JTWC.|$|E
5|$|A strong ridge {{over the}} north Atlantic Ocean turned Emmy sharply eastward on August 29. The {{hurricane}} continued to strengthen, and Emmy <b>attained</b> <b>a</b> peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h) shortly after turning to the east while located 500miles (800km) northeast of Bermuda. The hurricane maintained its peak intensity for 42hours while moving eastward at 17mph (27km/h), and slowly weakened after peaking in strength. On September 1, Emmy turned to the east-southeast, and a day later it turned to the northeast as its forward motion decreased. Emmy passed through the Azores on September 3, and the following day it became extratropical {{to the north of}} the islands. The extratropical remnant persisted another six hours before being absorbed by approaching Hurricane Frances.|$|E
5|$|About {{four hours}} after formation, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Bret, upon which it <b>attained</b> <b>a</b> minimum central pressure of 1002mbar. Shortly thereafter, its appearance on radar deteriorated, and convection warmed around the center. With a mid-level anticyclone over Texas, Bret tracked steadily to the west-northwest, {{and began to}} re-organize just before moving ashore; at 12:00UTC on June 29, the storm made landfall just southeast of Tuxpan with winds of 65km/h (40mph). After crossing the coast, the storm quickly degenerated to tropical depression status, though Bret retained a well-organized cloud pattern with deep convection. The center turned to the north-northwest, and early on June 30 Bret dissipated inland over Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Although civilizations in Central America <b>attained</b> <b>a</b> {{relatively}} {{high level of}} sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E

After Island founder and executive Chris Blackwell hired them to work with singer Grace Jones, the duo developed a more sparse, robotic production style with funk and dub influences. This deviated from their past reggae work, {{as well as the}} genre's roots sound and light rhythms. Sly and Robbie recorded primarily at Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas with state-of-the-art equipment, which led to Dunbar's experimentation with electronic drums and drum machines.|$|E
