40|$|As {{a renowned}} s-triazine herbicide, <b>ametryn</b> is {{worldwide}} emitted {{into the atmosphere}} in both gaseous and particulate phases via spray drifts from treatments and post application emissions, but its chemical degradation in the atmosphere has not been well characterized. In this study, the heterogeneous kinetics of particulate <b>ametryn</b> with NO 3 radicals were investigated with a mixed-phase relative rate method. A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS) and an atmospheric gas analysis mass spectrometer were synchronously used to online monitor the decays of particulate <b>ametryn</b> and gas-phase isoprene. The reactive uptake coefficient of NO 3 radicals on <b>ametryn</b> particles was calculated to be 2. 9 x 10 (- 2), according to the measured <b>ametryn</b> loss ratio and the average NO 3 concentration.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to determine final pesticide concentrations and for metabolite identification. The efficiency of aerobic biodegradation of <b>ametryn</b> and methomyl was evaluated by measuring both the decrease in the concentration of the pesticides and global properties such as the chemical oxygen demand (COD). The acute toxicity of <b>ametryn</b> and methomyl was evaluated by use of the ToxAlert 100 biological test, which is based on inhibition of the bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri. There was significant correlation between results from primary and ultimate biodegradation and those from determination of toxicity.

40|$|<b>Ametryn</b> is a {{representative}} of a class of s-triazine herbicides absorbed by plant roots and leaves and characterized as a photosynthesis inhibitor. It is still in use in some countries in the farming of pineapples, soybean, corn, cotton, sugar cane or bananas; however, due to the adverse effects of s-triazine herbicides on living organisms use of these pesticides in the European Union has been banned. In the current study, we characterized the biodegradation of <b>ametryn</b> (100 mg L- 1) by entomopathogenic fungal cosmopolite Metarhizium brunneum. <b>Ametryn</b> significantly inhibited the growth and glucose uptake in fungal cultures. The concentration of the xenobiotic drops to 87. 75 mg L- 1 {{at the end of}} culturing and the biodegradation process leads to formation of four metabolites: 2 -hydroxy atrazine, ethyl hydroxylated <b>ametryn,</b> S-demethylated <b>ametryn</b> and deethylametryn.

O experimento foi realizado em um Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo em blocos casualizados, com parcelas subdivididas. Nas parcelas alocaram-se os herbicidas: <b>ametryn</b> (2. 000 g ha- 1), tryfloxysulfuron-sodium (22, 5 g ha- 1) e a mistura formulada comercialmente, <b>ametryn</b> + trifloxysulfuron-sodium (1. 463 + 37, 0 g ha- 1), e uma testemunha sem aplicação de herbicidas (capinada). Os herbicidas foram aplicados em pós-emergência inicial da cultura. Nas subparcelas, foram plantados os genótipos de cana-de-açúcar: RB 72454, RB 835486, RB 855113, RB 855156, RB 867515, RB 925211, RB 925345, RB 937570, RB 947520 e SP 80 - 1816. Aos 14, 45 e 60 dias após aplicação dos herbicidas (DAT) avaliou-se, por meio de notas, a intoxicação dos genótipos de cana-de-açúcar pelos herbicidas. Aos 14 e 45 DAT, determinaram-se a área foliar e a massa da matéria seca da parte aérea. A altura das plantas foi avaliada aos 14 e 360 DAT, e a produtividade de colmos foi determinada por ocasião da colheita, aos 430 dias após o plantio. O genótipo RB 855156 foi o mais sensível aos produtos aplicados, e os genótipos RB 925345, RB 947520 e SP 80 - 1816, os mais tolerantes. Em todos os casos de intoxicação, verificou-se completa recuperação da cultura até 60 DAT.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Ametryn</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{herbicides}} in the sugarcane culture. Little is known about the interactions between this herbicide and the attributes of soils in the sugarcane region of northeastern Brazil. This knowledge, before recommending herbicide, will minimize the negative effects on the environment, particularly on water resources, and will ensure weed control efficacy. In this work, <b>ametryn</b> leaching potential was estimated through bioassays and chromatography, in five soils from the sugarcane region in northeastern Brazil: Quartzarenic Neosol (Entisol); Red Argisol (Ultisol); Ferrihumiluvic Spodosol (Spodosols); Red-Yellow Acrisol (Oxisol) and Haplic Cambisol (Inceptisols). To achieve this, columns were prepared with samples of the respective soils. On top of these columns <b>ametryn</b> was applied and, 12 hours later, a 60 mm rainfall was simulated. After water draining (72 hours after herbicide application), the columns were longitudinally opened to withdraw samples of each soil, every 5 cm. On some of these samples, <b>ametryn</b> quantification was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography and, on the others, biological assays were performed to confirm the results. <b>Ametryn</b> mobility was influenced by the physical-chemical characteristics of soils, mainly by organic matter content, texture and cation exchange capacity (CEC). However, this cannot be considered for Ferrihumiluvic Spodosol, whose cementing characteristics restrict the infiltration of water and organic compounds. Increased leaching <b>ametryn</b> occurred in Quartzarenic Neosol (Entisol), with higher herbicide concentration in the 5 to 10 cm depth layer, in relation to the 0 to 5 cm surface layer, indicating possible agronomic efficiency loss and higher risk of groundwater contamination...|$|E

Nas parcelas, avaliou-se o efeito dos herbicidas e, nas subparcelas, o efeito do tempo após a aplicação destes. Os herbicidas utilizados foram: 2, 4 -D (1, 30 kg ha- 1), <b>ametryn</b> (1, 00 kg ha- 1), trifloxysulfuron-sodium (0, 0225 kg ha- 1) e a mistura ametryn+trifloxysulfuron-sodium (1, 463 + 0, 0375 kg ha- 1, respectivamente).

O <b>ametryn</b> aplicado isolado ou em mistura com trifloxysulfuron-sodium propiciou maiores TRs, ao passo que o 2, 4 -D apresentou pouca influência nessa variável. Maiores acúmulos de C-CO 2 aos 60 dias após a aplicação dos herbicidas foram verificados nos tratamentos com trifloxysulfuron-sodium, <b>ametryn</b> e na mistura de ambos os produtos.

40|$|Sao Paulo state, Brazil, {{is one of}} {{the main}} areas of sugar cane {{planting}} in the world. Extensive use of <b>ametryn,</b> a triazine herbicide, in sugar cane agriculture and the properties of this herbicide suggest it could be present in the environment as a potential contaminant of soil, surface water, groundwater, and river sediment. In order to clarify the mechanism through which <b>ametryn</b> could be toxic, an in vivo study with Wistar rats was conducted using hematological, biochemical, molecular, morphological and genotoxic approaches. For this purpose, two sub-lethal <b>ametryn</b> concentrations (15 mg and 30 mg/kg/day) were administered to 42 rats divided into three groups (n = 12) by gavage during 56 days, whereupon blood, liver and bone marrow were collected. The results showed <b>ametryn</b> genotoxic activity by in vivo micronuclei testing. This event probably occurred as consequence of oxidative stress induction demonstrated by GSTM 1 transcript levels increase (indicating complexation between <b>ametryn</b> and/or metabolites with GSH) and by SOD activity decrease. Also, Mn-SOD transcripts were increased, probably avoiding mtDNA damage caused by EROS. These mechanisms displayed hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) activation because two major biomarkers were regulated, connexin and cadherin. N-cad transcripts were increased on both exposed groups while E-cad decreased in the T 1 group, indicating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In addition, Cx 43 transcripts were decreased suggesting an increase in collagen content. Volumetric proportion of sinusoids was significantly decreased in T 1 group and no significant alteration in hepatocyte volume was observed, indicating an increase in the space of Disse, due to fibrosis. Hepatocyte nuclei showed significant decrease in diameter and volume. Few hematological alterations were found. We emphasize the importance of other approaches, such as cell death and proliferation assays, so that <b>ametryn</b> toxicity can better be understood. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Six herbicide treatments [trifloxysulfuron plus <b>ametryn</b> (37 plus 1463. 07 g ha- 1), diuron plus hexazinone (1. 170 + 330 g ha- 1), metribuzin (1. 920 g ha- 1), (trifloxysulfuron plus <b>ametryn,</b> 27. 75 + 1097. 3 g ha- 1) plus (diuron plus hexazinone, 702 + 198 g ha- 1), metribuzin (960 g ha- 1) plus (trifloxysulfuron plus <b>ametryn,</b> 27. 75 + 1097. 3 g ha- 1) and metribuzin (960 g ha- 1) plus (diuron plus hexazinone, 702 + 198 g ha¹) ] and two treatments without application were evaluated. The visual injuries caused by the herbicide did not affect stalk number and stalk diameter in sugarcane. However, the plants treated with diuron plus hexazinone presented lower stalk height. The herbicides diuron plus hexazinone, alone and in mixture with trifloxysulfuron plus <b>ametryn,</b> were efficient in the control of all morningglory and woodrose species. Application of trifloxysulfuron plus <b>ametryn</b> alone controlled satisfactorily only I. hederifolia. Metribuzin was efficient in the control of I. grandifolia, I. quamoclit, M. aegyptia and M. cissoides. Besides these species, the association of this herbicide with diuron plus hexazinone resulted in excellent I. hederifolia control. The mixture of metribuzin with trifloxysulfuron plus <b>ametryn</b> was efficient in controlling I. hederifolia, M. aegyptia and M. cissoides. The new emergence of the morningglory and woodrose species evaluated after herbicide application or manual weed elimination would not harm the mechanized harvest of sugarcane stalks in the next harvest...|$|E

Para isso, foram avaliados 120 tratamentos (quatro solos associados a três intensidades de chuva e 10 profundidades), em parcela subdividida no delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com três repetições. Colunas de PVC de 50 cm de comprimento por 10 cm de diâmetro foram preenchidas com os solos e umedecidas; em seguida, aplicou-se o herbicida e simularam-se chuvas no topo delas, nas intensidades especificadas de acordo com o tratamento. Após 72 horas, todas as colunas foram dispostas na posição {{horizontal}} e abertas longitudinalmente, coletando-se amostras dos solos a cada intervalo de 5 cm de profundidade, para posterior extração e quantificação do herbicida e análise por cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência - CLAE. Posteriormente, no restante das amostras de solo, semeou-se ao longo de cada coluna a espécie indicadora Cucumis sativus. Concluiu-se que solos com baixo teor de matéria orgânica e/ou pH mais elevado apresentaram maiores índices de lixiviação do <b>ametryn.</b> Além disso, o método do bioensaio foi mais eficiente na confirmação da lixiviação do <b>ametryn</b> em comparação à CLAE. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate <b>ametryn</b> leaching potential in soil used for pasture in Brazil (Red-Yellow Latosol (LVA) and Red-Yellow Ultisol (PVA)) with different pH values. Thus, 120 treatments were evaluated (four soils related to three rainfall intensities and 10 soil column depths). The experiments were arranged in a completely randomized design in split-plots and three replications. PVC columns of 10 cm diameter by 50 cm length were filled with the soil samples, moistened and placed upright for 48 hours to drain the excess water. The herbicide was applied and rainfall was simulated {{on top of the}} columns at intensities specified according to the treatment. After 72 hours, the columns were opened longitudinally, placed in a horizontal position and soil samples were collected at each 5 cm interval depth for posterior herbicide extraction and quantification by liquid chromatography (HPLC). The remaining soil columns were sown with the indicator species (Cucumis sativus) in the substrate along the opening to evaluate <b>ametryn</b> leaching. After 21 days of emergence, evaluations were conducted to verify the intoxication symptoms caused by <b>ametryn</b> in the plants. It was concluded that soils with low organic matter content and/or higher pH showed higher <b>ametryn</b> leaching rates, and that the bioassay method was more efficient in confirming <b>ametryn</b> leaching than liquid chromatography...|$|E
40|$|A cultura da cana-de-açúcar, por ter desenvolvimento inicial lento até 60 dias após a emergência, apresenta pouca capacidade competitiva com as plantas daninhas. Por isso, o uso de herbicidas nesse período é prática comum no canavial. No entanto, há variação entre genótipos de cana-de-açúcar na tolerância a herbicidas. Os genótipos pouco tolerantes podem ser intoxicados e, em alguns casos, ocorre redução da produtividade da cana-deaçúcar. Neste trabalho, avaliou-se a tolerância de três genótipos aos herbicidas <b>ametryn,</b> trifloxysulfuron-sodium e à mistura {{comercial}} desses, em 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0 e 3, 0 vezes a dose comercial recomendada. O experimento foi realizado em ambiente protegido. Foi empregado o delineamento experimental inteiramente casualizado, com quatro repetições. Os tratamentos constaram dos genótipos SP 80 - 1816, RB 855113 e RB 867515, combinados aos herbicidas <b>ametryn,</b> trifloxysulfuron-sodium e <b>ametryn</b> + trifloxysulfuron-sodium, nas doses de 0, 0, 5, 1, 0 e 3, 0 vezes a dose comercial recomendada pelo fabricante. A intoxicação das plantas (%) foi avaliada aos 14, 28 e 42 dias após a aplicação dos herbicidas (DAT). As outras variáveis aferidas aos 80 dias após a brotação das gemas foram: área foliar e massa da matéria seca da parte aérea. Em geral, os genótipos SP 80 - 1816 e RB 85513 foram menos tolerantes aos herbicidas <b>ametryn,</b> trifloxysulfuron-sodium e à mistura formulada de <b>ametryn</b> + trifloxysulfuron-sodium do que o RB 867515 em todas as doses. Eles apresentaram elevados índices de intoxicação aos 14, 28 e 42 dias após a aplicação dos herbicidas. Concluiu-se que o genótipo RB 855113 foi o mais sensível aos herbicidas, seguido pelo SP 80 - 1816, sendo o RB 867515 o mais tolerante. Due {{to a slow}} initial development up to 60 {{days after}} emergence, sugarcane shows little competitive capacity over weeds. Thus, the use of herbicides during this period is a common practice in the sugarcane crop. However, there is a variation between sugarcane genotypes regarding herbicide tolerance. This work evaluated the tolerance of three genotypes to the herbicides <b>ametryn,</b> trifloxysulfuron-sodium and their commercial formulated mixture in 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 3. 0 times the recommended commercial dose. The experiment was conducted under protected environmental conditions. A completely randomized design was used, with four replications. The treatments were composed by genotypes SP 80 - 1816, RB 855113, RB 867515 associated to herbicides <b>ametryn,</b> trifloxysulfuron-sodium and sodium-ametryn + trifloxysulfuron, at doses of 0, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 3. 0 times the recommended commercial dose. Intoxication of the plants (%) was assessed at 14, 28 and 42 days after application of the herbicides (DAT). The other variables measured at 80 days after crop emergence were leaf area and shoot dry matter. In general, the genotypes SP 80 - 1816 and RB 855113 were less tolerant to the herbicides <b>ametryn,</b> trifloxysulfuron- sodium and the mixture <b>ametryn</b> + trifloxysulfuron-sodium than the RB 867515 at all tested doses. They showed high intoxication levels at 14, 28 and 42 days after herbicide application. It was concluded that genotype RB 855113 was the most sensitive to the herbicides, followed by SP 80 - 1816, with RB 867515 being the most tolerant...|$|E

O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições, em parcelas subdivididas. As parcelas foram compostas pelos herbicidas <b>ametryn</b> e trifloxysulfuron-sodium e pela mistura formulada de <b>ametryn</b> + trifloxysulfuron-sodium, aplicados aos 65 dias após o plantio, além de uma testemunha sem presença de plantas daninhas; e as subparcelas, pelos genótipos RB 72454, RB 835486, RB 855113, RB 867515, RB 947520 e SP 80 - 1816. Decorridos 15 dias da aplicação dos herbicidas, foram realizadas as avaliações de condutância estomática de vapores de água (Gs), gradiente entre temperatura da folha e do ar (&# 916;T) e taxa de transpiração (E), sendo calculada ainda a eficiência do uso da água (WUE). Foi determinada também a matéria seca da parte aérea das plantas. O genótipo RB 855113 foi o que apresentou maiores danos à eficiência do uso da água e transpiração, sendo, por isso, considerado o mais sensível aos herbicidas <b>ametryn</b> e trifloxysulfuron-sodium, enquanto os genótipos SP 80 - 1816 e RB 867515 estiveram entre os mais tolerantes. Condutância estomática, temperatura da folha, transpiração e eficiência de uso da água são características eficientes para identificar danos de herbicidas a plantas cultivadas, principalmente aqueles com efeito sobre a taxa fotossintética. Os genótipos de cana-de-açúcar avaliados diferiram quanto à sensibilidade aos herbicidas aplicados; as variedades SP 80 - 1816 e RB 867515 destacaram-se como as menos afetadas pelo <b>ametryn</b> e trifloxysulfuron-sodium, isolados ou em mistura, enquanto RB 855113 foi a mais sensível. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the effects of the herbicides <b>ametryn</b> and trifloxysulfuron-sodium, applied alone or in mixture, on the characteristics associated to water use efficiency in sugarcane varieties under field conditions. The trial was installed in a completely randomized block design with split-plots and four replications. Plots were composed by the herbicides <b>ametryn,</b> trifloxysulfuron-sodium or a commercial mixture of <b>ametryn</b> + trifloxysulfuron-sodium, applied 65 days after planting, plus a control mechanically free of weed infestation; split-plots were composed by sugarcane varieties (RB 72454, RB 835486, RB 855113, RB 867515, RB 947520 and SP 80 - 1816). Fifteen days after herbicide application, stomatal conductance (Gs), temperature gradient between leaf and air (DT) and transpiration rate (E) were evaluated, and water use efficiency (WUE) was obtained as a function of photosynthesis and transpiration rates. Plant shoots were also collected for dry matter determination. Variety RB 855113 presented the greatest damage to water use efficiency and transpiration and was thus considered the most sensitive to <b>ametryn</b> and trifloxysulfuron, while varieties SP 80 - 1816 and RB 867515 were the most tolerant. In these varieties, herbicides caused only minor changes in water use efficiency and thermal gradient. Stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, transpiration and water use efficiency were effective in identifying herbicide damage to crops, mainly those caused by photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides; sugarcane genotypes showed a different behavior in relation to herbicide susceptibility and varieties SP 80 - 1816 and RB 867515 were the less affected by the herbicide treatments; on the other hand, RB 855113 was the most severely affected...|$|E

40|$|Compared to the Conventional Activated Sludge Process (ASP), Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs) {{have proven}} their {{superior}} performance in wastewater treatment and reuse {{during the past}} two decades. Further, MBRs have wide array of applications such as the removal of nutrients, toxic and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which are impossible or difficult to remove using ASP. However, fouling of membrane {{is one of the main}} drawbacks to the widespread application of MBR technology and Extra-cellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) secreted by microbes are considered as one of the major foulants, which will reduce the flux (L/m 2 /h) through the membrane. Critical flux is defined as the flux above which membrane cake or gel layer formation due to deposition of EPS and other colloids on the membrane surface occurs. Thus, one of the operating strategies to control the fouling of MBRs is to operate those systems below the critical flux (at Sub-Critical flux). This paper discusses the critical flux results, which were obtained from short-term common flux step method, for a lab-scale MBR system treating <b>Ametryn.</b> This study compares the critical flux values that were obtained by operating the MBR system (consisting of a submerged Hollow-Fibre membrane with pore size of 0. 4 μm and effective area of 0. 2 m 2) at different operating conditions and mixed liquor properties.

Para isso, utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado no esquema de parcelas subdivididas, com quatro repetições. Os efeitos dos herbicidas foram avaliados nas parcelas, e o efeito do tempo, expresso em dias após aplicação dos herbicidas (DAA), considerando as diversas amostragens nas subparcelas. Os herbicidas foram aplicados em pós-emergência, quando as plantas de cana-de-açúcar se apresentavam com três a quatro folhas. As características avaliadas foram: a altura e massa seca da parte aérea, o número de folhas, o número de perfilhos e as concentrações de macro e micronutrientes nos tecidos foliares das plantas. As concentrações de N, P e Mg nos tecidos foliares não foram afetadas pelo uso dos herbicidas, independentemente da época de avaliação (15, 30, 45 e 60 DAA). Ao longo do tempo após a aplicação, constatou-se acréscimo da taxa de acúmulo (coeficiente beta 0) dos nutrientes catiônicos Ca, Mg e K em plantas expostas ao ametryn+trifloxysulfuron-sodium. Quando da aplicação do 2, 4 -D, verificou-se redução na taxa de acúmulo de S e alteração na dinâmica dos nutrientes Mg, Ca e K, comparado à testemunha sem herbicida. Os herbicidas provocaram redução na concentração de Fe nessa cultura aos 15 DAA, na seguinte ordem: ametryn+trifloxysulfuron-sodium > <b>ametryn</b> > trifloxysulfuron-sodium > 2, 4 -D. Em relação às plantas de cana-de-açúcar não tratadas com herbicida (testemunha), o herbicida trifloxysulfuron-sodium provocou acréscimo de 22, 10 % no acúmulo de massa seca da sua parte aérea aos 60 DAA. O número de perfilhos observados em plantas tratadas com trifloxysulfuron-sodium foi o dobro do encontrado com <b>ametryn,</b> demonstrando efeito negativo deste herbicida nessa característica. Evidenciaram-se neste trabalho os efeitos dos herbicidas na concentração dos nutrientes e o crescimento das plantas de cana-de-açúcar. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate {{the impact of the}} herbicides <b>ametryn</b> and trifloxysulfuron-sodium, alone or combined, and 2, 4 -D, on mineral nutrition and growth in sugar cane plants. Sugar cane plants with three to four fully expanded leaves were sprayed with <b>ametryn,</b> trifloxysulfuron-sodium, and <b>ametryn</b> + trifloxysulfuron-sodium at the doses of 1. 30; 1. 00; 0. 0225, and 1. 463 + 0. 0375 Kg ha- 1, respectively. A completely randomized design was adopted in a split-plot scheme with four replications. Herbicide effect was evaluated in the whole plots and the effect of time after application in the split-plots. At 15, 30, 45, and 60 days after spraying (DAA), leaf tissue samples were collected and analyzed for height and dry mass of the shoots, number of leaves and tillers, and foliar concentrations of macro and micronutrients of sugar cane plants. The leaf concentrations of N, P and Mg were not affected by herbicide use. After herbicide spraying, increase in the accumulation rate (coefficient beta 0) of the cationic nutrients Ca, Mg and K, was observed in the plants treated with <b>ametryn</b> + trifloxysulfuron-sodium. When 2, 4 -D was applied, a reduction in the accumulation rate of the S and alteration in the dynamics of the nutrients Mg, Ca and K were verified in relation to the other treatments.
