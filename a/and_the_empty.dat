5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> bomb bay space {{was filled with}} an 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay. Only a few of the E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E

Scarpia orders a search, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> food basket and a fan bearing the Attavanti coat of arms {{are found in the}} chapel. Scarpia questions the Sacristan, and his suspicions are aroused further when he learns that Cavaradossi has been in the church; Scarpia mistrusts the painter, and believes him complicit in Angelotti's escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproduction}} of octopuses {{has been studied}} {{in only a few}} species. One such species is the giant Pacific octopus, in which courtship is accompanied, especially in the male, by changes in skin texture and colour. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any spermatophore or sperm already present in the female. He picks up a spermatophore from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female's mantle cavity, and deposits it in the correct location for the species, which in the giant Pacific octopus is the opening of the oviduct. Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> ends may protrude from the female's mantle. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore, and it is stored internally by the female.|$|E

25|$|By {{commutativity}} and associativity one {{can think}} of join and meet as binary operations that are defined on non-empty finite sets, rather than on elements. In a bounded lattice the empty join <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> meet can also be defined (as 0 and 1, respectively). This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices, and many authors require all lattices to be bounded.|$|E

25|$|This is most {{pronounced}} when the boron compound has very bulky substituents.

25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E

When police showed up at the Christy Hotel on April 19 to continue questioning Speck, they found he had left the hotel a few hours earlier, carrying his suitcases and saying he was just going to the laundromat. He had instead left town. A search of his room turned up a radio and costume jewelry Mrs. Virgil Harris had reported missing from her house, as well as items reported missing in two other local burglaries in the past month.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{new company}} had been formed in 1923, Murray's Shaft was {{connected}} to the 120Fathom Level, and then the Skip Shaft was abandoned. The 120Fathom Level became a major production level in the mine for the next thirty years. Murray's Shaft was deepened to the 135Fathom Level in 1924 and to the 150Fathom Level in 1928. Production during the early 1930s came from the four new levels below the 90Fathom Level. However, Murray's Shaft had been sunk on the vein in some rich ore-bearing ground which had been stoped away. Although the shaft was supported with steel girders and timbers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> stope had been backfilled with rock, it was prone to collapses, when the supports gave way and waste rock poured into it. This happened (twice) in 1931 and again in 1933, bringing production to a halt while it was repaired.|$|E
25|$|Hotel {{operators}} in Downtown reacted favorably, predicting {{that the move}} would cause an increase in occupancy rates in their hotels. In 2008 Continental renewed its lease in the building. Before the lease renewal, rumors spread stating that the airline would relocate its headquarters to office space outside of Downtown. Steven Biegel, the {{senior vice president of}} Studley Inc. and a representative of office building tenants, said that if Continental's space went vacant, the vacancy would not have had a significant impact in the Downtown Houston submarket as there is not an abundance of available space, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> property would be likely that another potential tenant would occupy it. Jennifer Dawson of the Houston Business Journal said that if Continental Airlines left Continental Center I, the development of Brookfield Properties's new office tower would have been delayed. As of September 2011 the headquarters moved out, but Continental will continue to house employees in the building. It will have about half of the employees that it once had.|$|E
