5|$|Reviewers complimented the book's {{balanced}} {{presentation of}} Armstrong, grounded {{use of the}} period's thought, and contribution to the historiography of industrial education.

5|$|After {{scattering}} the <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> Kip's Bay, Howe landed 9,000 more troops, but did {{not immediately}} cut off the American retreat from New York Town {{in the south of}} the island. Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the westside of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4:00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on the Heights by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the action, the American {{boats were}} all damaged and their crews {{suffered}} four killed, including Allen, who died some four hours after the battle ended, and three wounded. The pirates suffered heavier casualties, with 14 bodies being counted by the <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} action in addition to several buccaneers presumed drowned. Alligator returned to Matanzas with the recovered prizes; there Allen was buried with an escort provided by the local governor.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{a senior}} Kodokan {{instructor}} named Yamashita Yoshiaki {{traveled to the}} United States {{at the request of}} the Seattle businessman Sam Hill. In Washington, DC, Yamashita's students included Theodore Roosevelt and other prominent <b>Americans.</b> <b>At</b> Roosevelt's request, Yamashita also taught judo at the US Naval Academy. Capitalizing on the publicity, the Japanese Legation in the USA asked the Kodokan to send more judo teachers to America, providing continuity to Yamashita's work. Tomita reluctantly accepted the task; Maeda and Satake embraced the opportunity.|$|E

5|$|In Mesoamerica, wild {{teosinte}} {{was transformed}} through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize, more than 6,000 years ago. It gradually spread across North America {{and was the}} major crop of Native <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> the time of European exploration. Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans, while cocoa, also domesticated in the region, was a major crop. The turkey, {{one of the most}} important meat birds, was probably domesticated in Mexico or the U.S. Southwest.|$|E
5|$|Michelle met Barack Obama {{when they}} were among the few African <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has {{sometimes}} said only two, although others have pointed out there were others in different departments), and she was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.

5|$|The Spanish forces {{expected}} the Americans {{to attack the}} northern region of the island and concentrated their defenses around San Juan and Arecibo. The Spanish government was also aware of a planned landing by the <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> Fajardo, located {{on the east coast}} and had that town fortified. However, the southern and western regions of Puerto Rico were left with little or no defenses at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistrust of}} Standard Oil was {{partially}} {{the result of}} a suspicion toward carpetbaggers, which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions. Union organizers were frequently seen as attempting to support a Northern agenda of promoting opportunities for African <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> the expense of the white population. Because of the situation this created, labor reform was slow to develop. Despite the anti-union sentiments, groups like the International Oil Workers Union attracted membership and held some influence in the industry and state government.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the team}} name of Eastern Michigan University {{changed from the}} Hurons to the Eagles in 1991, the change {{remained}} controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside flap a of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, {{the return of the}} Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.|$|E

5|$|Americans with origins {{from the}} Pacific are the {{smallest}} minority in Texas. According to the survey, only 18,000 Texans are Pacific Islanders; 16,400 are of non-Hispanic descent. There are roughly 5,400 Native Hawaiians, 5,300 Guamanians, and 6,400 {{people from other}} groups. Samoan Americans were scant; only 2,920 people were from this group. The city of Euless, a suburb of Fort Worth, contains a sizable population of Tongan <b>Americans,</b> <b>at</b> nearly 900 people, over {{one percent of the}} city's population. Killeen has a sufficient population of Samoans and Guamanian, and people of Pacific Islander descent surpass one percent of the city's population.|$|E
5|$|In a {{continuation}} of their feud against the Authority, on November 11 on Raw, the half-brothers defeated Randy Orton in a handicap match. It was announced the following week that at Survivor Series, the Rhodes Brothers would team up with the Usos and Rey Mysterio against the Shield and the Real Americans in the traditional Survivor Series elimination match, but they were beaten with Reigns the only survivor of the fight. On November 22 on SmackDown, the half-brothers defeated the Real Americans to retain their tag title. The Rhodes Brothers were scheduled to face the team of Ryback and Curtis Axel, the team of Rey Mysterio and Big Show, and the Real <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> , as they had recently been defeated by each of these teams. Once again, they successfully defended their title.|$|E
5|$|Ladd and the {{commander}} of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors. The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed. It was not until 15:00 hours that the relief effort was launched and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took {{her head out}} of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was the only time that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 17, a drummer {{appeared}} followed by an officer waving a white handkerchief. The bombardment ceased, and the officer was blindfolded and led behind the French and American lines. Negotiations began at the Moore House on October 18 between Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross (who represented the British) and Lieutenant Colonel Laurens (who represented the Americans) and the Marquis de Noailles (who represented the French). To make sure that nothing fell apart between the French and <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> the last minute, Washington ordered that the French be given an equal share in {{every step of the}} surrender process.|$|E
5|$|Several {{villages of}} Christian Delawares lay between the combatants on the Sandusky River and the <b>Americans</b> <b>at</b> Fort Pitt. The villages were {{administered}} by the Moravian missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder. Although pacifists, the missionaries favored the American cause and kept American officials at Fort Pitt informed about hostile British and Indian activity. In September 1781, to prevent further communication between the missionaries and the American military, hostile Wyandots and Delawares from Sandusky forcibly removed the missionaries and their converts to a new village (Captive Town) on the Sandusky River.|$|E
