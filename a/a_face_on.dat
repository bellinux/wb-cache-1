5|$|In July 2016, Disney XD {{announced}} that it had greenlit a put pilot titled Right Hand Guy, which is in consideration for a full series. The show stars a pre-teen who draws <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> his right hand that comes to life and befriends him. The creator, Dan Lagana, took inspiration from Oobi while developing the concept.|$|E
5|$|Triple H {{returned}} to Raw as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> January 7, 2002 at Madison Square Garden. He won the Royal Rumble and received an Undisputed WWF Championship match at WrestleMania X8, where Triple H defeated Chris Jericho for the Undisputed WWF Championship. After holding the title for a month, Triple H dropped it to Hulk Hogan at Backlash. Triple H then became exclusive to the SmackDown! roster {{due to the}} WWF draft lottery and continued to feud with Jericho, culminating in a Hell in a Cell match at Judgment Day, which Triple H won. On the June 6, 2002 episode of SmackDown!, Triple H defeated Hogan in a #1 contender match for the Undisputed WWE Championship at the King of the Ring against The Undertaker, but was unsuccessful at the event.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their return}} to the WWF, Well Dunn had a short series of matches against WWF Tag Team Champions The Headshrinkers, {{including}} a match televised on WWF Wrestling Challenge. Well Dunn became involved in a storyline in which Adam Bomb, who was also managed by Wippleman, turned on the manager and began wrestling as <b>a</b> <b>face.</b> <b>On</b> the August 13 episode of WWF Superstars, Well wrestled a singles match against Bomb; Dunn interfered, and Bomb attacked Well Dunn and Wippleman after the match. This led to a blow off match one week later, in which Bomb teamed with The Smoking Gunns to defeat Kwang (another of Wippleman's wrestlers) and Well Dunn. On August 17, the team also served as lumberjacks in a lumberjack match between Bret and Owen Hart.|$|E

5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
5|$|On April 21, 2009, Stock {{wrestled}} a dark {{match for}} Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), {{where she was}} defeated by Awesome Kong. She then defeated Taylor Wilde in another dark match the following day. On the May 11, 2009, episode of the Spanish-language version of TNA Today, Stock was introduced as Sarita. Stock made her debut as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> the July 16 episode of Impact!, defeating Alissa Flash. During August and September, Sarita teamed with Taylor Wilde in a tournament, where the winners would be crowned the inaugural Knockouts Tag Team Champions. After defeating the teams of Alissa Flash and Daffney and Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed, Sarita and Wilde defeated The Beautiful People (Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky) at No Surrender to win the championship. On November 15 at Turning Point, Sarita, Wilde and ODB defeated The Beautiful People (Lacey Von Erich, Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky) in a six-woman tag team match; as a result, Sarita and Wilde retained the Knockouts Tag Team Championship and ODB the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. On the December 17 episode of Impact!, Sarita and Wilde were defeated by Awesome Kong and Hamada in non-title three-way match, which also included The Beautiful People. This led to a match on the January 4, 2010, live episode of Impact!, where Sarita and Wilde lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Kong and Hamada.|$|E

Gamper painted the picture of <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> a sheet of celluloid, which he then taped to the window of his studio {{overlooking}} Lake Zurich and photographed at sunset, with the setting sun shining through the unpainted eye to create a 'glowing eye' effect. The CD inlay booklet featured a photograph of Blank and Meier standing by the same window, with the painting visible on the window between them.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Voldemort's manifestation is as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> {{the back}} of Quirrell's head, an effect {{achieved}} by computer generated imagery. Ian Hart, the actor who played Quirrell in the same film, provided the voice and the facial source for this character. Voldemort also appears in a scene in the Forbidden Forest where he is seen drinking the blood of a unicorn. As Voldemort's face was altered enough by CG work, and Hart's voice was affected enough, there was no confusion by Hart's playing of the two roles. In that film, he was also shown in a flashback sequence {{when he arrived at}} the home of James and Lily Potter to kill them. In this scene Voldemort is played by Richard Bremmer, though his face is never seen. His next appearance would be in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the 16-year-old Tom Marvolo Riddle (portrayed by Christian Coulson).|$|E

25|$|Magnus {{returned}} as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> 31 January 2013 episode of Impact Wrestling in Manchester, England, interrupting and attacking Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian) who were insulting the country. Afterwards, Magnus wrestled his return match, defeating TNA Television Champion Devon in a non-title match via disqualification after interference from the Aces & Eights. At Lockdown in March, Team TNA, consisting of Magnus, Eric Young, James Storm, Samoa Joe, and Sting defeated Aces & Eights, consisting of Devon, DOC, Garett Bischoff, Knux, and Mr. Anderson in a Lethal Lockdown match. On 21 March episode of Impact Wrestling, Magnus {{was defeated by}} Jeff Hardy in a four-way number one contenders match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which also included Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe. On 18 April episode of Impact Wrestling, Magnus was scheduled to face Devon for his Television Championship, however, was attacked by DOC and Knux before the match could start. Magnus returned on the 9 May episode of Impact Wrestling, defeating DOC after an inadvertent distraction from D'Lo Brown. Later that night, Magnus was again attacked by the Aces & Eights. At Slammiversary XI, Magnus teamed with Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe in a winning effort against Aces & Eights (Garett Bischoff, Mr. Anderson, and Wes Brisco).|$|E
25|$|After a nine-month injury, Nash {{returned}} as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> the April 7, 2003 episode of Raw, {{much to the}} delight of both Shawn Michaels and Triple H, who were feuding with each other. As part of the storyline, Nash was given a choice to remain friends with either Michaels or Triple H. After Nash would not make the decision, Triple H made the decision for him and turned on him with a low blow. This led to Nash and Triple H feuding with one another. Nash teamed up with Michaels and Booker T against Triple H, Ric Flair and Chris Jericho in a six-man tag team match at Backlash which ended with Triple H picking up the win for his team, pinning Nash after hitting him with a sledgehammer. Following Backlash, Nash was granted again a shot at Triple H's title, and the two squared off at Judgment Day with Michaels and Flair in their respective corners. Triple H would get himself disqualified and kept the title as a result, but this did not stop Nash from attacking Triple H following the match, putting him through the announcer's table with a Jackknife Powerbomb. The next month, they fought again in a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood with Mick Foley as the special guest referee, but Nash lost the match.|$|E
25|$|Australia toured in 1961 {{with what}} {{was seen as the}} weakest team they had brought to England for years. Barrington broke a toe early in the season, but {{recovered}} to hit 151 not out against Hampshire and played in the First Test at Edgbaston. Here he dropped Bill Lawry and Bobby Simpson at slip and as a result Barrington gave up fielding in the slips as he felt it required too much concentration and interfered with his batting. Even so, when John Murray was ill he took over as wicket-keeper. Despite their perceived weakness Australia gained a massive 321 run first innings lead and Barrington joined Ted Dexter in a salvage operation on the last day. To counter his weakness against fast bowling he took the unusual decision to change to <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> stance for the second innings, which he kept {{for the rest of his}} career. Dexter hit 180 while Barrington hung on for 190 minutes making 48 not out in their partnership of 161 and the match was saved. He played another rearguard innings of 66 at Lord's in the Second Test and 78 in the first innings of the famous Fourth Test at Old Trafford. He had been ordered by the Chairman of Selectors Gubby Allen to hit out after the tea break and his resulting dismissal saw England fall from 358/6 to 367 all out. In the second innings he was lbw to the part-time bowling of Ken Mackay in England's collapse from 150/1 to 201 all out as they lost the Test by 54 runs and failed to regain the Ashes as expected. Meeting the Australians for Surrey he made 12 and 68 not out (out of 100, the next highest score was 9), then 163, 95, 125 not out, 40, 17 and 78 to ensure his place in the Fifth Test on his home ground. He had fractured his wrist against Middlesex, but played anyway and made 53 and 83 in the draw. He ended with a solid 364 runs (45.50) and 2,070 first-class runs (59.14), but still had to make a Test century in England.|$|E

500|$|Cartoonist Troy Walker, in 2007, sued Hillenburg, whom {{he claimed}} stole {{the idea for}} the SpongeBob SquarePants {{character}} from his 1991 comic strip, Bob Spongee, the Unemployed Sponge, and the eponymous homemade doll. In his original concept, Walker drew <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> a kitchen sponge and attached googly eyes. He produced approximately 1,000 of the [...] "drawn-on" [...] dolls. Walker then placed those models in clear plastic bags that included the comic strip, and sold them at flea markets in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1992. He also placed an advertisement in the Oakland Tribune, selling fewer than 20 dolls. After learning about SpongeBob SquarePants in 2002, Walker concluded, [...] "It obviously fell into the hands of one of the producers of the show. It's a clear pattern of duplication." [...] He did not register the comic strip with the U.S. Copyright Office until 2003.|$|E

The videos contained hidden messages and biblical links related to Jericho. Jericho made his return to WWE television as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> the November 19, 2007 episode of Raw when he interrupted Randy Orton during Orton's orchestrated [...] "passing of the torch" [...] ceremony. Jericho revealed his intentions to reclaim the WWE Championship in order to [...] "save" [...] WWE fans from Orton.
