25|$|The men {{competed in}} cold, wet, windy conditions. Alistair Brownlee {{came out of}} the swim in the lead but was soon part of a 50-man peloton on the bike. However, Brownlee, Stuart Hayes and Reinaldo Colucci broke away to lead the field by 30 seconds {{entering}} the second transition. Once out of transition and on the run, Brownlee dropped Hayes and Colucci and went on to record his second Kitzbühel win, having won previously in 2009. Behind him, Alexander Brukhankov, Brad Kahlefeldt, Sven Riederer, William Clarke and Laurent Vidal formed a group that passed Hayes and Colucci. Halfway through the run, Brukhankov made a break for second place before Riederer broke on the final lap to secure third. Clarke won the battle for fourth as Kahelfeldt finished fifth and Vidal sixth. Meanwhile, McCormack's return to ITU racing triathlon was cut short <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out of the race on the bike. Following the race, Alistair Brownlee led the overall championship standings over Brukhankov with Gómez and Jonathan Brownlee now third and fourth with Riederer moving up to fifth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Chiefs {{receiver}} Danan Hughes gave his team a big opportunity by returning a punt 35 {{yards to the}} Oilers 42-yard line. But Kansas City ended up empty handed {{at the end of}} a drive in which they squandered multiple chances to get into scoring range. First, Montana threw a pass to the end zone that was barely deflected away from receiver Willie Davis by the outstretched arm of defensive back Cris Dishman. On the next play, he completed a pass to J. J. Birden that moved the ball to the 5-yard line, only to see it wiped out by a false start penalty on tackle John Alt. Then after a screen pass that gained nothing, Montana threw another pass to the end zone on third down, this one bouncing off the fingertips of a wide open Davis and forcing Kansas City to punt. Houston then drove to the Chiefs 10-yard line on a drive that included Moon's 16-yard scramble with an unnecessary roughness penalty turning it into a 31-yard gain. But after a penalty pushed them back to the 25, they too failed to score when Lewis knocked the ball out of Moon's hand <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> it back to throw and rookie linebacker Jaime Fields recovered the fumble. Montana completed a 22-yard pass to Davis on the first play after the turnover, and eventually the Chiefs reached the Houston 36-yard line. But Montana threw an incomplete pass on fourth and 1, and the score remained 10–0 at the end of the half.|$|E

25|$|Márquez {{moved up}} to the {{lightweight}} division in order to fight The Ring Lightweight Champion Joel Casamayor on the weekend leading up to Mexican Independence Day at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Nevada. On September 13, 2008, he defeated Casamayor in the 11th round after two knockdowns and captured his sixth world title in three different weight classes. In the first four rounds of the bout, Márquez continually walked into counter punches from Casamayor. It took Márquez until the fifth round {{to be able to}} find the range with his right hand. By the fifth round, a cut over Casamayor's right eye was opened from a clash of heads. Rounds five, six, seven and eight were rounds where Márquez landed straight punches from the outside, but he was also struck by Casamayor whenever he lunged forward. Two minutes into the eleventh round, Casamayor was knocked down by a right punch <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> away from an intense exchange. Casamayor was able to get on his feet, but it was clear he was still shakey from the knockdown. As soon as the action was allowed to resume, Márquez went in for the kill as he let his punches go in furious combination. Casamayor punched back, but he was knocked down again with about 7 seconds left in the round. Referee Tony Weeks stepped in the bout and stopped the fight as he deemed Casamayor unable to continue. The official judges had the fight scored 95–95, 95–95 and 97–93 for Márquez before the 11th-round knockout. After the win, The Ring magazine ranked Márquez second on its pound for pound list and rated him the number one boxer in the lightweight division.|$|E
25|$|At the Belgian Grand Prix, a {{qualifying}} session held {{in mixed}} weather conditions and grid penalties for three drivers allowed {{the team to}} claim its best grid positions of the season, as Senna took 18th, one position ahead of Yamamoto. In the race, however, Senna retired early after suffering a suspension failure which caused him to spin, whilst Yamamoto finished, albeit a place lower than he had started. The Italian Grand Prix that followed {{was held at the}} high-speed Monza circuit, where the F110 was particularly disadvantaged by the team's lack of a low-downforce aerodynamic package. The drivers qualified slowest, with Senna again ahead, and were then elevated a position each when Glock received a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change. In the race, Senna was another early retirement with a failure in his car's hydraulic system, whilst Yamamoto extended his run of finishes with a 19thplace, ahead of Di Grassi, who retired with three laps to go but was classified as a finisher. Yamamoto struck one of his mechanics <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> away from his mid-race pit stop, but the man was not seriously injured. During preparation for the Singapore Grand Prix, the team announced that Yamamoto was to be replaced by Klien for the weekend because he was suffering from food poisoning, although several journalists noticed a seemingly healthy Yamamoto in the paddock, indicating that he had been dropped for sponsorship reasons instead. In his first competitive outing since the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, Klien outqualified Senna by more than a second; both Hispania cars lined up ahead of Felipe Massa's Ferrari on the grid, as he had failed to set a time during the session. In the race, Klien ran ahead of Senna until Senna collected the crashed Sauber of Kobayashi, who lost control in front of him, on his 30thlap. Klien retired two laps later when his F110's hydraulics failed. Yamamoto returned to the driving seat for his home race in Japan; he qualified a tenth of a second behind Senna on the back row of the grid. In the race, Senna made a pit stop on the first lap, along with several other drivers, in response to a safety-car period caused by two first-lap accidents. Yamamoto, meanwhile, remained on track, keeping Trulli and Glock behind him for until lap15 and his own stop on lap31 respectively, whereupon he dropped behind Senna. The two drivers achieved a double finish, with Senna in 15thposition and Yamamoto in 16th, despite the latter suffering from fuel pressure problems.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{original}} trailer {{features a}} jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer {{on a tour}} of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is [...] "tracked" [...] with Herrmann's Psycho theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy The Trouble with Harry; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, [...] "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years.

500|$|In the song's final bridge section, at 2:58, {{the spoken}} phrase [...] "Fucking hell!" [...] appears. Scott admits that {{although}} he was told about it, he could not hear the words originally. Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney, according to Emerick, who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography: [...] "'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but I insisted we leave it in , buried just low enough {{so that it can}} barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know it's there.'" [...] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, also attributes it to Lennon. In Toft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out [...] "Whoa!" [...] then, two seconds later, swore <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> the headphones off.|$|E

Goldstein started using crack cocaine by the age of 20. He said that consuming the drug and deejaying were [...] "about all he did" [...] {{for the next four years}} of his life. He would often disappear from friends and family for days at a time. In 1997, he attempted suicide; the gun jammed in his mouth <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> the trigger. Shortly afterwards, a friend encouraged Goldstein to become sober. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, avoided his friends who still took drugs, and dedicated himself to working as a DJ. Goldstein relapsed after 90 days though subsequently restarted and completed the program. People who complete the AA program are encouraged to sponsor other addicts through the recovery process; Goldstein became a sponsor for several people.|$|E
500|$|On 12January, CIA {{spotters}} {{reported a}} four aircraft formation {{flying in the}} direction of Lima Site 85. They were Soviet-made Antonov An-2 biplanes. Two aircraft continued towards Lima Site 85, while the others turned away. The Vietnam People's Air Force, in one of its few air attacks during the conflict, tried to destroy the radar at Lima Site 85. The An-2s flew over Phou Pha Thi, and their crewmen dropped 120mm mortar shells through the aircraft's floor and then strafed their targets with 57mm rockets mounted on the wing pods. As they repeatedly attacked the facility, ground fire heavily damaged one AN-2, and it crashed into a mountainside. By now, CIA officers and U.S. controllers at Lima Site 85 had managed to contact an Air America helicopter, which was faster than the Soviet-made biplanes. The Huey pilot [...] Captain Ted Moore sighted the remaining An-2, and promptly gave chase. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> alongside, flight mechanic Glenn Woods armed with an AK-47 assault rifle opened fire and caused the biplane to crash into a ridge.|$|E

Carlos Peña, who had never been to the All-Star Game, was a nominee for the All-Star Final Vote, a process in which fans choose one of five players in each league to take the final roster spots on the All-Star squads. Voting began after the initial All-Star rosters were announced. To help garner votes for Peña, the Rays started the [...] "Vote for 'Los" [...] campaign, having T-shirts made with Peña's face on them which players wore during batting practice. The Rays asked fans to bring their laptop computers to Tropicana Field and vote online during the game, as well as using advertisements, online commercials, fliers, merchandise, and even a video message from comedian Rob Schneider. Despite all efforts, Peña would ultimately finish fourth in the voting. Brandon Inge of the Detroit Tigers received the most votes to get the last remaining spot. Even though he didn't win, Peña said he was flattered and humbled to see how many were in support of him to make the All-Star Game.
