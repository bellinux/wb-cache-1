25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E
25|$|At {{the later}} conventions, in Adelaide in 1897, in Sydney later {{the same year}} and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, {{the name of the}} court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court {{completely}} replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect. Other arguments posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English law. Some politicians, such as Sir George Dibbs, supported the petitioners, but others, including Alfred Deakin, supported the design of the court as it was. Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances. Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different matters.|$|E
500|$|There {{were also}} {{disagreements}} within the NSDAP {{leadership on the}} spiritual implications of cultivating a 'Germanic history' in their ideological program. Hitler was highly critical of Himmler's esoteric völkisch interpretation of the 'Germanic mission'. When Himmler denounced Charlemagne in a speech as [...] "the butcher of the Saxons", Hitler stated {{that this was not}} a 'historical crime' but in fact <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> subjugation of Widukind had brought Western culture into what eventually became Germany. He also disapproved of the pseudoarchaeological projects which Himmler organized through his Ahnenerbe organization, such as excavations of pre-historic Germanic sites: ...|$|E

I think, perhaps, it would be not only <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Dick, but it would, also, be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> you," [...] and, for the moment, Sam looked very seriously at his brother.|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} through {{laughing}} Nimbleheels answered Old Mother Nature's questions. He {{explained that he}} had heard about that school, as by this time almost every one in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows had. By chance he learned that Danny Meadow Mouse was attending. He thought that if it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Danny it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> him, so he had come.|$|R
60|$|Another {{idea arose}} {{in the minds of}} the wisest British statesmen. If {{prohibitive}} warfare were <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> America, it would be <b>an</b> equally <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> England. More than that, it would be a better thing if only these two countries possessed the power of waging prohibitive warfare.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "Adults Only" [...] (AO) rating has {{attracted}} a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which {{has been criticized for}} stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers' objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is [...] "true in every entertainment medium", but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ESRB system. The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are generally considered children's products; for example, the availability of a Wii version of Manhunt 2 was condemned by Senator Hillary Clinton over fears that children could use the game's motion controls to act out the game's [...] "many graphic torture scenes and murders".|$|E
2500|$|.....A {{careful study}} of the matter {{convinced}} me that after all it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future of the school that the present one could not be disturbed, for therein lay the suggestion for a design unique in high schools of the country... A quadrangle enclosed by buildings devoted to various departments of school work.|$|E
2500|$|Meat {{produced}} {{in a laboratory}} (called in vitro meat) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat. Reactions of vegetarians vary. Rearing {{a relatively small number}} of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: [...] "A little bit of livestock production is probably <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> environment.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, {{the band}} {{released}} their fifth studio album, The Unforgiving, {{the biggest change}} in their musical direction. Although being largely well received by critics, some reviewers disliked the changes, with Q magazine calling the album [...] "The metal T'Pau". Besides that, some critics found the [...] "1980s pop, rock and metal" [...] influences <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a couple}} of months the Blongers were toasted as the {{solution}} to the town's law enforcement problem (a previous marshal, Milt Yarberry, had murdered two citizens). When Sam and Lou were joined briefly by brother Joe, a prospector in the nearby Cerrillos Hills, a local newspaper wrote: [...] "The three brothers are all of them young, nervy and square western men and it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> town if they were all on the police force." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> feller," [...] said Humphrey. [...] "A {{sight of}} times {{better to be}} selling diments than nobbling about here." ...|$|E

60|$|Nearly every outfit had lame horses {{like our}} old bay, hobbling along bravely. Our grub was getting very light, which was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> horses; {{but we had}} an {{occasional}} grouse to fry, and {{so as long as}} our flour held out we were well fed.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} turned {{over a new}} leaf with a vengeance, for he never would give a sixpence to {{anything}} during old Tomley's time," [...] remarked Morris to Stella. [...] "I suppose that he has taken a great fancy to your father, which is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parish, as those Layards are richer than Croesus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Putting aside your feelings—and mine," [...] said Joan, [...] "it’s <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> {{everybody}} else, isn’t it? We mustn’t consider ourselves—that {{would be}} selfish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm {{not sure}} if dancing is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fellow's game. You never hear of any {{first-class}} pro. dancing. James Braid doesn't dance." ...|$|R
25|$|A science may {{go through}} these cycles repeatedly, though Kuhn notes {{that it is}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> science that such shifts do not occur often or easily.|$|R
6000|$|... “Rather a good {{portrait}} of Throstlewing,” he remarked explosively, turning his large challenging eyes on Treddleford; “somehow {{it reminds me}} very much of Yellowstep, {{who was supposed to}} be such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Grand Prix in 1903. Curious race that was; I suppose I’ve seen every race for the Grand Prix for the last—” ...|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the store he found Andy already busy with a crowd which had begun to collect the moment that the red flag was hung out. Matt had to begin work at once, and this was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> boy, for it kept him from brooding over his parent's possible fate and thus growing melancholy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You will do, senor,' he said; 'you are a {{young man}} of parts and promise, though, as was to be {{expected}} from one of your years, you lack experience. There is stuff in you, senor, and you have a heart, which is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> blunders of a man with a heart often carry him further than the cunning of the cynic; also you have a will and know how to direct it.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All the same, {{it would}} be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> you if you had some clever people--or some society people--coming here often. It would {{advertise}} the place as nothing else would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I will," [...] Captain Donovan said. [...] "I {{need not}} disturb the colonel, {{at this time}} of the evening, but will take it on myself. There are just that number {{quartered}} in the storehouse, close to the gate. I will go down with you, at once, and turn them out and give them orders. It will be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rapparees to have a lesson. They bring disgrace upon our cause by their doings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should n't}} {{wonder if this}} was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole family, though it don't look so. Mrs. Shaw will take it the hardest, but it may stir her up, so she will forget her nerves, and be as busy and happy as mother is," [...] said Polly to herself, in a hopeful mood, for poverty was an old friend, and she had learned long ago not to fear it, but to take its bitter and its sweet, and {{make the best of}} both.|$|E

"Well, {{and it is}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> honour of the Maccolls," [...] said Alan, {{and then}} to me, [...] "Here is my button back again, and I thank you for parting with it, which is {{of a piece with}} all your friendships to me."

6000|$|... "For {{their own}} good, Margaret. I only propose {{it for their}} own good. You can't but {{think it would be}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Ayala to be married to our Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would surely}} be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> her if she could but be brought to believe so," [...] said Frederick. [...] "All her {{attachments}} are there--her own home; my father's home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, but I'm not {{speaking}} from {{his point of}} view." [...] Nash was perfectly lucid. [...] "Moreover, I thought you just now said it would be such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> her." ...|$|R
