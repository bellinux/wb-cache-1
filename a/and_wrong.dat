In 1632, Galileo represented Aristotelianism in his Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo by the strawman Simplicio ("Simpleton"). That same year, William Harvey proved Aristotle wrong by demonstrating that blood circulates.|$|E

5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their sense of right <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by {{the ideology of the}} free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right <b>and</b> <b>wrong.</b> At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right <b>and</b> <b>wrong.</b> If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E

5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E
5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an affront to the reader's sense of social right <b>and</b> <b>wrong.</b> It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E

Both {{the men and women who}} perceived that "makeup behavior" in relatively public places in the presence of strangers was socially acceptable were also prone to engage in makeup application,regardless of the presence of strangers or non-strangers. " Makeup behavior" in public and the perception of social rights <b>and</b> <b>wrongs</b> were influenced by public self-consciousness in men,and external another person-consciousness in women...|$|R

5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902, and that unlike his fictional counterpart, Lad was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers. After living five years with a heart tumor, the dog died on September 3, 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. Terhune reported that he received hundreds of letters from fans asking him to publish more stories about Lad, and that over 1,700 people visit Lad's grave at Sunnybank. In 1922, he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies' Home Journal, with some new stories and some from other magazines. The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> abuse of authority, and justice. Intending {{it to be the}} last book he would write about his late collie, Terhune killed the fictional Lad in the last chapter of the novel. The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of Lad. Seven years and twenty other novels later, he would change his mind and release one more Lad novel, Lad of Sunnybank, which was published by HarperCollins.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept and}} {{scenario}} draft {{was written by}} Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. Episode II was the last main Xenosaga game worked on by Saga prior to her leaving the project in 2005. Their draft was then turned into the game's full script by Norihiko Yonesaka, who was allowed by Takahashi to handle the storyline of the Xenosaga series following Episode I using his extensive notes. According to Takahashi, Yonesaka's role was to take his and Saga's notes {{and turn them into}} a workable game script, something which required parts of the planned scenario to be condensed or cut. According to Arai, the changes were made in consultation with Takahashi, with them treating his plan as a novel and the game as its movie adaptation. In a later interview, Saga said the changes made to the overall scenario for Episode II resulted in subsequent changes to the planned Xenosaga plotline. The game's subtitle is taken from the native title of Beyond Good and Evil, a novel written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The use of Nietzsche's works and concepts was a recurring element in the series; in the context of Episode II, the subtitle was said to represent the blurring of boundaries between concepts of right <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> in addition to symbolizing the complex relations between Jr. and Albedo. As with the other Xenosaga titles, the game made heavy use of Biblical mythology.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E
