Battery backup {{is a big issue}} for all android phones, smart phones and tablet pc, in this research paper we have present an automated battery charging system which uses reverse re engineering of capacitive touch screen which will reduce the problem of battery backup. This advance system uses battery charging by the variation between two membrane which generate capacitance and by this variation the EMF is induced or charge is generated which is used to charge the various levels of lithium cell present in the mobile battery. These capacitive membranes that are made up of piezoelectric crystal are so much sensitive so that the variation between capacitive membranes is possible even by air or small press. This <b>advance</b> <b>charging</b> system contains some methodology of charging the battery that will be explained in this research paper...|$|E

50|$|PV {{systems with}} an {{integrated}} battery solution {{also need a}} charge controller, as the varying voltage and current from the solar array requires constant adjustment to prevent damage from overcharging. Basic charge controllers may simply turn the PV panels on and off, or may meter out pulses of energy as needed, a strategy called PWM or pulse-width modulation. More <b>advanced</b> <b>charge</b> controllers will incorporate MPPT logic into their battery charging algorithms. Charge controllers may also divert energy to some purpose other than battery charging. Rather than simply shut off the free PV energy when not needed, a user may choose to heat air or water once the battery is full.|$|R

40|$|The {{cosmic dust}} {{analyzer}} aboard the Cassini spacecraft includes a charge and velocity detector which senses electric charges > 10 (- 15) C of individual cosmic dust grains {{as they enter}} the instrument. Charge is an important property of each grain, because it affects its orbital dynamics and is a measure of its size. The duration and shape of the charge signal are also important, because they reveal the grain's location and velocity relative to the spacecraft. The velocity, in turn, can be expressed in a heliocentric coordinate system and orbital parameters can be derived and aid in the identification of the grain's origin. We describe the operation of the charge and velocity detector, present results of laboratory calibrations using charged hypervelocity dust particles, show the first dust charge signal obtained from interplanetary space, and discuss potential applications of an <b>advanced</b> <b>charge</b> detector for future space missions.

Since charging lanes will be costly to deploy, this paper investigates the deployment of two types of charging facilities, namely charging lanes and charging stations, along a long traffic corridor to explore the competitiveness of charging lanes. Given the charging infrastructure supply, i. e., the number of charging stations, the number of chargers installed at each station, the length of charging lanes, and the charging prices at charging stations and lanes, we analyze the charging-facility-choice equilibrium of EVs. We then discuss the optimal deployment of charging infrastructure considering either the public or private provision. In the former, a government agency builds and operates both charging lanes and stations to minimize social cost, while in the latter, charging lanes and stations are assumed to be built and operated by two competing private companies to maximize their own profits. Numerical experiments based on currently available empirical data suggest that charging lanes are competitive in both cases for attracting drivers and generating revenue...|$|R
