5|$|Brezhnev was {{adept at}} the {{politics}} within the Soviet power structure. He {{was a team}} player and never acted rashly or hastily; unlike Khrushchev, he did not make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues, and was <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> to hear their opinions. During the early 1970s, Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position. In 1977, he forced the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, making this position equivalent to that of an executive president. While Kosygin remained Premier until {{shortly before his death}} in 1980 (replaced by Nikolai Tikhonov as Premier), Brezhnev was the dominant driving force of the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s to his death in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Redknapp's time at West Ham was {{notable for}} the {{turnover}} of players {{during his tenure}} and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of £16 million, despite the £18 million sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United. Some were notably successful, such as the signings of Stuart Pearce, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic and Ian Wright. Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu; Davor Šuker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances; Christian Bassila, who cost £720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football; Titi Camara; Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to £4.4 million but made only three starts for the club; Rigobert Song; Paulo Futre; and Marco Boogers, a player often quoted {{as one of the}} biggest failures in the Premier League. His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks, while his third season would also see another relegation battle. <b>Always</b> <b>willing</b> to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson who added the impetus needed at the season's end.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, Mohanlal, {{trying to}} change his action hero image, returned to comedic roles with Kilichundan Mampazham, Balettan, Hariharan Pillai Happy Aanu and Mr. Brahmachari. Kilichundan Mampazham, promoted as a comeback vehicle for the actor, received good reviews and a decent box-office collection. Balettan, directed by V. M. Vinu, was also a commercial success. Mohanlal {{played the role of}} Athanipparambil Balachandran, a bank employee <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> to lend a helping hand to others, who is forced to hide many secrets after his father's death leading to his family's mistrust. In 2004, Natturajavu was his only commercial success and Mambazhakkalam became a hit.|$|E

By publishing in Turkish as well as Armenian, Hrant Dink opened up the channels of communication to the society at large for the Armenian community. After Agos started its publication, the participation of Armenians in the political-cultural life in Turkey increased greatly, and public awareness in Turkey of {{the issues of the}} Armenians started to increase. <b>Always</b> <b>willing</b> to speak on the issues faced by Armenians, Hrant Dink emerged as a leader in his community and became a well-known public figure in Turkey.|$|E

Although, on the backdrop of russian revolution, he found his thought process very compatible to the philosophy of socialism after he caught his conscience, so only he stood and won very first election of 1951 under the banner of socialist party. After passing high school, he indulged himself in quit India movement on gandhi's call for immediate independence with passive resistance and went to attend the mass meeting held at gowalia tank maidan in Bombay, where Do or Die was coined by gandhi.|$|E
25|$|Seiya is the eponymous main {{character}} of the Saint Seiya series. He {{is one of the}} eighty-eight Saints of Athena and serves loyally at her side. Seiya draws his superhuman powers from Cosmo, the energy of the Big Bang that lingers inside each being and which connects a Saint to his constellation and Cloth. At the start of the series, Seiya is thirteen years old. His main objective is to find his older sister Seika, who disappeared when he was sent to Greece to train to become a Saint {{under the supervision of the}} Silver Saint Eagle Marin. Due to her physical similarities to Seika, Seiya suspects that Marin may be his sister, but he later discovers he is wrong and finds his real sister. As Seiya starts fighting alongside the other Bronze Saints, albeit reluctantly at first, his motivations shift to the protection of Athena. Seiya is a person of burning passion and spirit, sometimes acting in brash and impulsive ways. Despite this, he's still a brave, kind-hearted and selfless young man; and is <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> to sacrifice himself for justice, his friends and Athena. His most notable characteristic is his absolute determination and refusal to ever give up, even when faced with impossible odds. He also has a habit of making jokes and can be unconcerned about the consequences of his actions.|$|E

He passed on experience to younger pilots and was <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> to discuss tactics, particularly with Squadron Leader Michael Robinson. Dundas, even by this early stage in the war, was {{the only member of}} the original 'A' (Auxiliary) pilots still with 609. Dundas lamented the few who remained were the [...] "sole champions of the Auxiliary attitude".|$|E
500|$|Professor Stearn had a {{reputation}} for his encylopaedic knowledge, geniality, wit and generosity with his time and knowledge, being <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> to contribute to the work of others.

500|$|The House of Lords {{agreed with}} ex parte Kynoch in British Oxygen Co. Ltd. v Minister of Technology (1970).

It also reiterated that for discretion to be unfettered, consideration must be given to exceptional cases. [...] "What the authority must not do is to refuse to listen at all. There can be no objection to , provided the authority is <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> to listen to anyone with something new to say." ...|$|E

500|$|Belldandy is {{exceptionally}} kind-hearted, {{even for}} a goddess. She can easily sense other people's emotions and tries her best to be empathetic to all those around her, displaying a combination of [...] "serene beauty and acceptance". She rarely holds a grudge and is <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> to forgive anyone who does injury to her...unless Keiichi is involved of course. Even though Belldandy tries her best to be as kind as possible, it is revealed that at times she can become very insecure and sad, especially when she is confronted with an implication that involves Keiichi {{in one way or}} another. This aspect of her character provides one of the biggest plot points in the Ah! My Goddess movie: Belldandy's possessiveness of Keiichi could make her an easy target for manipulation or even brainwashing, if the right buttons were pressed; her jealousy of Morgan Le Fay was what allowed Celestin, her teacher, to lure Belldandy into his plans.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{an often}} laid back and sarcastic demeanor, Raynor is {{described}} in the novel Liberty's Crusade as a decent and honorable man that is well liked by those under his command. Robert Clotworthy noted that as such, Raynor is <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> {{to do the right}} thing, no matter how difficult it may be. His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan—the series' main antagonist—despite his former love for her early in the story arc is one of the sacrifices that in Clotworthy's eyes makes Raynor a [...] "true hero in the purest sense of the word". He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause, willing to put it all at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves. It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted. Although often displaying an overzealous attitude, Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day, even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into a bad situation. Raynor himself acknowledges that he is not the most intelligent man there is, but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds.|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Miller had a classically high arm action, {{moving the}} ball sharply either way {{and able to}} make the ball rise from a good length. His action caused {{opposition}} batsmen to perceive that his deliveries were gaining pace after pitching. He was often able to generate more pace than his new ball partner, Lindwall. He was <b>always</b> <b>willing</b> to try something new if the batsman were set, varying his approach from fifteen paces to five and vice versa. A round arm delivery often managed to capture a wicket, surprising the batsman. Compton said that Miller [...] "often had no preconceived idea what he intended to bowl even as he turned to start his run". Miller often mixed slow leg breaks when he was bowling off a run. He once bowled English opening batsman David Sheppard with a googly during a Test. Hutton opined that Miller was the bowler who was least concerned with the position of his bowling mark, and said that he [...] "never felt physically safe against him". His use of bouncers at Trent Bridge during the 1948 tour was seen as excessive by the English crowd, who booed him. Miller simply sat down until the barracking had subsided. He was often required to bowl through pain, pressing a disk into place {{at the base of his}} spine before sending down the next delivery.|$|E
