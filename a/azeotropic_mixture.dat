25|$|There are {{basically}} three dehydration processes {{to remove the}} water from an azeotropic ethanol/water mixture. The first process, used in many early fuel ethanol plants, is called azeotropic distillation and consists of adding benzene or cyclohexane to the mixture. When these components {{are added to the}} mixture, it forms a heterogeneous <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixture</b> in vapor–liquid-liquid equilibrium, which when distilled produces anhydrous ethanol in the column bottom, and a vapor mixture of water, ethanol, and cyclohexane/benzene.|$|E

My aim was to improve the batch distillation separation of <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures.</b> A new algorithm was presented for the determination of product sequences of batch distillation of multicomponent <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Non-conventional configurations were studied by simulation with emphasis on closed operation. The effects of off-cut recycle on a six-batch separation process of a waste solvent mixture were also investigated.

40|$|Separation of <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures</b> is a {{topic of}} great {{practical}} and industrial interest. Most liquid mixtures of organic components form nonideal systems. The presence of some specific groups, particularly polar groups (oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine and fluorine), often results {{in the formation of}} azeotropes. <b>Azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures</b> may often be effectively separated by distillation by adding a liquid material (entrainer) to the system. For the development of separation processes for <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures,</b> {{there is a need for}} insight into the fundamental phenomena of nonideal and azeotropic phase equilibria. This thesis includes a detailed survey on azeotropic phase equilibriumdiagrams of ernarymixtures. Diagram analysis is shown to be an efficient tool for prediction of feasible separations. As a simplifying concept it is proposed that all feasible structures of ternary azeotropic phase equilibrium diagrams can be qualitatively represented by a few elementary cells of which only four have so far been reported to exist. This greatly reduces the complexity of azeotropic istillation analysis and is a key to a simple evaluation of the possibilities and limitations of <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures</b> separation. Insights gained from continuous azeotropic distillation is extended to the operation of batch distillation with focus on the dynamics and control of multivessel and extractive batch distillation as processes for separating <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Practical implications of this renewed insight for the fine- and specialty chemical industries are given in the concluding pages of the thesis. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

25|$|If two {{solvents}} {{can form}} a positive azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents {{will result in}} the distillate being closer in composition to the azeotrope than the starting mixture. For example, if a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and water is distilled once, the distillate will be 80% ethanol and 20% water, which is closer to the <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixture</b> than the original. Distilling the 80/20% mixture produces a distillate that is 87% ethanol and 13% water. Further repeated distillations will produce mixtures that are progressively closer to the azeotropic ratio of 95.5/4.5%. No numbers of distillations will ever result in a distillate that exceeds the azeotropic ratio. Likewise, when distilling a mixture of ethanol and water that is richer in ethanol than the azeotrope, the distillate (contrary to intuition) will be poorer in ethanol than the original but slightly richer than the azeotrope. This means the solution left behind will be richer in ethanol.|$|E

50|$|Zeotropic {{mixtures}} {{have different}} characteristics in nucleate and convective boiling, {{as well as}} in the organic Rankine cycle.

The procedure is well suited to screening candidate entrainers for separating binary <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures</b> as well as determining viable sequences for many-component <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures.</b> ^ Once the distillation train has been synthesized, each column must be {{designed to meet the}} target product compositions. An algorithm for calculating the minimum reflux ratio for ideal, nonideal, and azeotropic distillation columns with significant heat effects is presented. The algorithm applies to single- and multiple-feed columns. An algorithm for determining the number of theoretical trays required for the column at operating conditions is also presented. ^ The column sequences are optimized to ensure that comparisons among alternative entrainers and/or sequences are done on an equitable basis.

50|$|This {{piece of}} {{equipment}} is usually used in azeotropic distillations. A common example is the removal of water generated during a reaction in boiling toluene. An <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixture</b> of toluene and water distills out of the reaction, but only the toluene (density: 0.865g/ml) returns, since it floats {{on top of the}} water (density: 0.998g/ml), which collects in the trap.

50|$|It is {{important}} to select a suitable separation solvent {{for this type of}} distillation. The solvent must alter the relative volatility by a wide enough margin for a successful result. The quantity, cost and availability of the solvent should be considered. The solvent should be easily separable from the bottom product, and should not react chemically with the components or the mixture, or cause corrosion in the equipment. A classic example to be cited here is the separation of an <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixture</b> of benzene and cyclohexane, where aniline is one suitable solvent.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{extractive}} distillation uses a separation solvent, {{which is generally}} non-volatile, has a high boiling point and is miscible with the mixture, but doesn't form an <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixture.</b> The solvent interacts differently with {{the components of the}} mixture thereby causing their relative volatilities to change. This enables the new three-part mixture to be separated by normal distillation. The original component with the greatest volatility separates out as the top product. The bottom product consists of a mixture of the solvent and the other component, which can again be separated easily because the solvent does not form an azeotrope with it.

50|$|Column stills {{behave like}} a series of single pot stills, formed in a long {{vertical}} tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, which is low in alcohol, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column. The temperature of each successively higher stage is slightly lower than the previous stage, so the vapor in equilibrium with the liquid at each stage is progressively more enriched with alcohol. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapor enriched to 40-50% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapor alcohol content of 96%; an <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixture</b> of alcohol and water. Further enrichment is only possible by absorbing the remaining water using other means, such as hydrophilic chemicals or azeotropic distillation.|$|E
50|$|A common {{historical}} {{example of}} azeotropic distillation is {{its use in}} dehydrating ethanol and water mixtures. For this, a near <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixture</b> {{is sent to the}} final column where azeotropic distillation takes place. Several entrainers can be used for this specific process: benzene, pentane, cyclohexane, hexane, heptane, isooctane, acetone, and diethyl ether are all options as the mixture. Of these benzene and cyclohexane have been used the most extensively. However, because benzene has been discovered to be a carcinogenic compound, its use has declined. While this method was the standard for dehydrating ethanol in the past, it has lost favor due to the high capital and energy costs associated with it.Another favorable method and less toxic than using benzene to break the azeotrope of the ethanol-water system is to use toluene instead.|$|E

Considering all possible locations of the univolatility line αAB, three minT <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures</b> with a light entrainer (1. 0 - 2 class), namely, ethanol-water with methanol, ethanol-toluene with acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone-benzene with acetone; three maxT <b>azeotropic</b> <b>mixtures</b> with a light entrainer (1. 0 - 1 a class), namely, water-ethylenediamine with methanol, acetone-chloroform with dichlomethane, and propanoic acid-dimethyl formamide withmethyl isobutyl ketone; and one low-α mixture with a light entrainer (0. 0 - 1 class), namely, ethyl acetate-benzene with acetone, were studied in a stripping extractive column. For the 1. 0 - 2 class, both A and B can be recovered as the bottom product, depending on the location of αAB = 1, which sets limiting values for the entrainer feed flow rate FE/LT for one of the product. In addition, the feasible region of the extractive distillation process is larger than for the azeotropic distillation process. For the 1. 0 - 1 a class, the product is either A or B, depending on the location of αAB = 1, which sets a minimum value of (FE/LT) min for one of the product. For the 0. 0 - 1 class, feasibility depends on the existence αAB = 1. When it does not exist, B is the unique possible product. When it does, both A and B are products, with B below a maximum value of (FE/LT) max,B and A above a minimum value (FE/LT) min,...|$|R
