5|$|Apart {{from not}} smoking, the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} keeping <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight,</b> and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} processed meat, {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{adolescent and}} parent predictors of behavioural {{intention to use}} <b>an</b> online <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> website for adolescents using the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the additional variable of age. It also considered adolescent and parent preferences regarding the content of <b>an</b> online <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> website. Participants included both a community and treatment seeking sample of 67 adolescents and 76 parents who completed a questionnaire booklet containing demographic questions, the TAM scale and {{an evaluation of the}} value of possible website content. The hypothesis that TAM would be a significant predictor of behavioural intention to use the online weight management program was supported. Results contributed to an understanding of behavioural intention to use in the unique setting of <b>an</b> online <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> website and have important implications for researchers, clinicians and designers of obesity and online interventions...|$|R

2500|$|The {{objective}} of OA's definition of abstinence {{is that the}} compulsive eater refrain not from eating, but rather, from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors, and work towards or maintain <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight.</b> [...] Thus, OA calls for the compulsive eater to define {{his or her own}} plan of eating which enables the compulsive eater to abstain from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors, while working towards or maintaining <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Being {{physically}} active and maintaining <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> prevents breast and other cancers {{in the general}} population, as well as preventing heart disease and other medical conditions. Among women with a BRCA mutation, being {{physically active}} and having had <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> as <b>an</b> adolescent {{has no effect on}} ovarian cancer and delays, but does not entirely prevent, breast cancer after menopause. [...] In some studies, only significant, strenuous exercise produced any benefit. Obesity and weight gain as an adult are associated with breast cancer diagnoses.|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{a serious}} and {{increasing}} public health problem in the UK. The author discusses current evidence which suggests that intervention with individual clients is worthwhile, and that the priorities for promoting <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> are to reduce dietary fat and eat a diet high in carbohydrates, in conjunction with moderate daily physical activity. The client is unlikely to achieve <b>an</b> maintain <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> unless they find a diet and forms of exercise that they enjoy. Health professionals can help by providing evidence-based advice tailored to the individual client's preferences. For example, clients can eat more of the fruits and vegetables they like, and sugar need not be excluded from the carbohydrate components of the diet and may be beneficial in making the diet more palatable. Slow, steady weight loss should be the aim leading to maintaining <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> in the long-term. Small acceptable changes to the diet, which can be maintained lifelong, should be encouraged. Some practical suggestions for low energy diets and ways of increasing exercise are included...|$|R
25|$|Prevention is by {{maintaining}} <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> and exercising before pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is a {{treated with a}} diabetic diet, exercise, and possibly insulin injections. Most women are able to manage their blood sugar with a diet and exercise. Blood sugar testing {{among those who are}} affected is often recommended four times a day. Breastfeeding is recommended as soon as possible after birth.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{maintaining}} <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> and eating a diet high in fiber {{and low in}} simple carbohydrates. If there are no symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. In those who are having gallbladder attacks, surgery to remove the gallbladder is typically recommended. This can be either done through several small incisions or through a single larger incision. Surgery is typically done under general anesthesia. In those {{who are unable to}} have surgery, medication to try to dissolve the stones or shock wave lithotripsy may be tried.|$|E
25|$|Consumed {{worldwide}} by {{billions of}} people, wheat {{is a significant}} food for human nutrition, particularly in the least developed countries where wheat products are primary foods. When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a healthy food source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber recommended for children and adults, in several daily servings containing a variety of foods that meet whole grain-rich criteria. Dietary fiber may also help people feel full and therefore help with <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight.</b> Further, wheat is a major source for natural and biofortified nutrient supplementation, including dietary fiber, protein and dietary minerals.|$|E

25|$|Difficulty in chewing and {{swallowing}} makes eating {{very difficult}} and {{increases the risk of}} choking or of aspirating food into the lungs. In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube. As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory-onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{anorexia}} involves restoring <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight,</b> {{treating the}} underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, {{they may be}} used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Sometimes people require admission to hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however, is unclear. Some people will just have a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.|$|E
25|$|Cattle drives had {{to strike}} a balance between speed and the weight of the cattle. While cattle could be driven as far as 25 miles in a single day, they would lose so much weight that they would be hard to sell when they reached the end of the trail. Usually they were taken shorter {{distances}} each day, allowed periods to rest and graze both at midday and at night. On average, a herd could maintain <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> moving about 15 miles per day. Such a pace meant that it would take as long as two months to travel from a home ranch to a railhead. The Chisholm trail, for example, was 1,000 miles long.|$|E
5000|$|Mild {{cases are}} managed by {{limiting}} activity, keeping <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight,</b> and avoiding exposure to high ambient temperatures.

30|$|Anthropometric {{features}} BMI {{was used}} to estimate <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> based on a person’s height.

25|$|Psychological {{factors in}} health had been studied {{since the early}} 20th century by {{disciplines}} such as psychosomatic medicine and later behavioral medicine, but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology. Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine {{of the effect of}} behavior on health. For example, the Alameda County Study, which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight,</b> received adequate sleep, did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer. In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones. These discoveries include {{a better understanding of the}} impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems, and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate as}} to whether the higher rate of breast cancer {{associated}} with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific studies in the United States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese {{women are more likely to}} list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding mammograms. Other reasons obese women may avoid mammography are due to lack of insurance, low income, or embarrassment at the procedure, although when these factors are accounted for, the effect of lower rates of screening are still significant. In contrast, other studies have shown that mammography patterns did not differ among women who were obese compared to those at <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> indicating that there may be biological differences in cancer presentation between these groups.|$|E
500|$|In {{children}}, <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> {{varies with}} age and sex. Obesity {{in children and adolescents}} is defined not as an absolute number but in relation to a historical normal group, such that obesity is a BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. [...] The reference data on which these percentiles were based date from 1963 to 1994, and thus have not been affected by the recent increases in weight. BMI is defined as the subject's weight divided by the square of their height and is calculated as follows.|$|E
50|$|Focusing more on {{lifestyle}} {{issues and}} {{their relationships with}} functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via exercise, enough sleep, maintaining <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight,</b> limiting alcohol use, and avoiding smoking. Health and illness can co-exist, as even people with multiple chronic diseases or terminal illnesses can consider themselves healthy.|$|R
5000|$|Recently it {{has come}} to light that current growth charts for infants under 24 months {{overstate}} the expected weight of babies and lead to potentially obese children.
