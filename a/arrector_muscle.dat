Computer generated 3 D reconstructions of the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle</b> have helped explain why women with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) experience diffuse hair loss rather than the patterned baldness seen in men.   Loss of attachment between the bulge stem cell population and the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle</b> also explains why miniaturization is irreversible in AGA but not alopecia areata.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the immunohistochemical distribution of cytoskeletal proteins in smooth muscles of 15 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 8 patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), 28 patients with various neuromuscular diseases, and 2 normal controls, performing skin and muscle biopsies. Dystrophin immunostaining confirmed absent {{reaction in the}} <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles</b> of DMD patients, faint positive reaction in BMD patients, and strong dystrophin reaction in patients with other neuromuscular diseases and normal controls. Immunostaining of utrophin was positive with variable intensity in the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles</b> in all DMD patients. In BMD patients, utrophin was faintly expressed in the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles</b> in 2 cases, and negative in the other 5 patients. In the other cases of neuromuscular diseases and in normal controls, immunostaining for utrophin was negative in the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles.</b> Staining of the capillary endothelial cells and muscular vessel walls was seen in normal controls, {{as well as in}} DMD, BMD, and other neuromuscular diseases. Vinculin, vimentin and desmin were expressed both in <b>arrector</b> pili smooth <b>muscles</b> and in vessel walls of patients with dystrophinopathy and other neuromuscular diseases, as well as in normal controls. Thus utrophin is normally expressed in the smooth muscle of the vessels and its expression does not vary in neuromuscular diseases. On the contrary, in the <b>arrector</b> pili smooth <b>muscle</b> utrophin is not expressed in normal controls but it is in dystrophinopathies, paralleling the findings in striated muscle, which expresses utrophin in a reciprocal manner with respect to dystrophin...|$|R

50|$|While {{humans have}} {{developed}} clothing {{and other means}} of keeping warm, the hair found on the head serves as primary sources of heat insulation and cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair) as well as protection from ultra-violet radiation exposure. The function of hair in other locations is debated. Hats and coats are still required while doing outdoor activities in cold weather to prevent frostbite and hypothermia, but {{the hair on the}} human body does help to keep the internal temperature regulated. When the body is too cold, the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles</b> found attached to hair follicles stand up, causing the hair in these follicles to do the same. These hairs then form a heat-trapping layer above the epidermis. This process is formally called piloerection, derived from the Latin words 'pilus' ('hair') and 'erectio' ('rising up'), but is more commonly known as 'having goose bumps' in English. This is more effective in other mammals whose fur fluffs up to create air pockets between hairs that insulate the body from the cold. The opposite actions occur when the body is too warm; the <b>arrector</b> <b>muscles</b> make the hair lie flat on the skin which allows heat to leave.|$|R
40|$|The hair {{erection}} <b>muscle,</b> <b>arrector</b> pili, {{is a kind}} {{of smooth}} muscle located in the mammalian dermis. The immunohistochemical study using an antibody against smooth muscle alpha actin (SMA) showed that the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle</b> develops approximately 1 – 2 weeks after birth in dorsal and ventral skin, but thereafter they degenerate. The <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle</b> was not detected in the mystacial pad during any stage of development, even in the neighboring pelage-type hair follicle. A strong signal of SMA in the skin was located in the dermal sheath as well as in some outer root sheath cells in the hair and vibrissal follicles. Positive areas in the dermal and outer root sheaths were restricted to a lower moiety, particularly areas of similar height, where keratinization of the hair shaft occurs. This rule is valid for both pelage hair follicles and vibrissal follicles. At medium heights of the follicle, SMA staining in the dermal sheath was patchy and distant from the boundary between dermis and epidermis. In contrast to SMA, vimentin was expressed over the entire height of the dermal sheath. Unlike the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle,</b> the expression of SMA in the dermal sheath was observed during fetal, neonatal, and adult stages. The presence of actin-myosin and vimentin fibers in supporting cells is thought to be beneficial for the hair follicle to cope with the movement of the hair shaft, which may be caused by physical contacts with outside materials or by the contraction of internal muscles...|$|R
50|$|The bulge {{is located}} in the outer root sheath at the {{insertion}} point of the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle.</b> It houses several types of stem cells, which supply the entire hair follicle with new cells, and take part in healing the epidermis after a wound.

40|$|SummaryThe hair {{follicle}} bulge in the epidermis associates with the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle</b> (APM) {{that is responsible}} for piloerection (“goosebumps”). We show that stem cells in the bulge deposit nephronectin into the underlying basement membrane, thus regulating the adhesion of mesenchymal cells expressing the nephronectin receptor, α 8 β 1 integrin, to the bulge. Nephronectin induces α 8 integrin-positive mesenchymal cells to upregulate smooth muscle markers. In nephronectin knockout mice, fewer <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles</b> form in the skin, and they attach to the follicle above the bulge, where there is compensatory upregulation of the nephronectin family member EGFL 6. Deletion of α 8 integrin also abolishes selective APM anchorage to the bulge. Nephronectin is a Wnt target; epidermal β-catenin activation upregulates epidermal nephronectin and dermal α 8 integrin expression. Thus, bulge stem cells, via nephronectin expression, create a smooth muscle cell niche and act as tendon cells for the APM. Our results reveal a functional role for basement membrane heterogeneity in tissue patterning. PaperCli...|$|R

50|$|The minute muscles {{under the}} surface of the skin called <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles</b> (attached to an {{individual}} hair follicle) contract (piloerection), lifting the hair follicle upright.

This is what also causes goose bumps since humans do not have very much hair and the contracted muscles can easily be seen.|$|R

40|$|Inconsistent {{with the}} view that {{epidermal}} stem cells reside randomly spread along the basal layer of the epidermal rete ridges, we found that epidermal cells expressing stem cell markers in nonglabrous skin exist in direct connection with the distal end of the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle.</b> The epidermal cells that express stem cell markers consist of a subpopulation of basal keratinocytes located in a niche at the lowermost portion of the rete ridges at the distal <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle</b> attachment site. Keratinocytes in the epidermal stem cell niche express K 15, MCSP, and α 6 integrin. α 5 integrin marks the distal end of the APM colocalized with basal keratinocytes expressing stem cell markers located in a well-protected and nourished environment at the lowermost point of the epidermis; these cells are hypothesized to participate directly in epidermal renewal and homeostasis and also indirectly in wound healing through communication with the hair follicle bulge epithelial stem cell population through the APM. Our findings, plus a reevaluation of the literature, support the hierarchical model of interfollicular epidermal stem cell units of Fitzpatrick.

5000|$|Hair is a {{very good}} thermal {{conductor}} and aids heat transfer both {{into and out of the}} body. When goose bumps are observed, small <b>muscles</b> (<b>Arrector</b> pili <b>muscle)</b> contract to raise the hairs both to provide insulation, by reducing cooling by air convection of the skin, as well as in response to central nervous stimulus, similar to the feeling of 'hairs standing up on the back of your neck'. This phenomenon also occurs when static charge is built up and stored in the hair. Keratin however can easily be damaged by excessive heat and dryness, suggesting that extreme sun exposure, perhaps due to a lack of clothing, would result in perpetual hair destruction, eventually resulting in the genes being bred out in favor of high skin pigmentation. It is also true that parasites can live on and in hair thus peoples who preserved their body hair would have required greater general hygiene to prevent diseases.|$|R
50|$|The {{hairs on}} the skin lie flat, {{preventing}} heat from being trapped by the layer of still air between the hairs.

40|$|Peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD) {{catalyze}} {{the conversion}} of arginine residues to citrullines. Five isoforms are known that present distinct tissue locations. In the epidermis, like in the skin, only PAD 1, 2, and 3 are expressed. Their pattern of expression in skin appendages is not known. Here, confocal microscopy analysis using highly specific antibodies demonstrated that PAD 1 and 3 are expressed in human anagen hair follicles, PAD 1 and 2, in <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles</b> and sweat glands, whereas no PAD were detected in sebaceous glands. PAD 1 was detected in the cuticle and the Huxley layer of the inner root sheath (IRS), and in the companion layer. PAD 3 was localized in the medulla, and in the three layers of the IRS.

Our data demonstrate that PAD 3 is the enzyme that deiminates trichohyalin in the medulla and the Henle layer, indicate that PAD 1 and 3 are involved in the hair follicle program of differentiation, and suggest a role for PAD 1 and 2 in the physiology of sweat glands and <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscles...</b>|$|R

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are found}} in hair-covered areas, where they are {{connected}} to hair follicles.

Electron microscopic studies using human fetal and adult skin revealed that myoepithelial cells are developed from basal cells of the coiled tip of fetal gland and not from mesenchymal cells. In order to determine the time of appearance of myoepithelial cells during fetal development, embryonic and newborn mouse skin was also examined.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundLeprosy is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which affects {{not only the}} peripheral nerves and skin, but also various internal viscera through hematogenous spread, especially in lepromatous cases. Histology {{in its own way}} plays a vital role, not only in classifying the established lesion, but also in confirming the clinical diagnosis. During the latent period of subclinical involvement, the apparently normal looking skin might also be undergoing some pathological changes. MethodsWe investigated skin biopsy material taken from 60 patients with clinically diagnosed leprosy at Subharti Hospital, Subharti Medical College, Meerut, India. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Harada's modified allochrome method for acid-fast bacilli were applied for histological investigations. ResultsThe pattern of leprosy among the patients was indeterminate in 25 cases (41. 7 %), tuberculoid in 14 (23. 3 %), borderline tuberculoid in six (10 %), borderline leprosy in four (6. 7 %), borderline lepromatous in four (6. 7 %), and lepromatous leprosy in seven (11. 7 %). Changes were seen in the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle</b> of normal appearing skin in all types of leprosy, but involvement was greater at the lepromatous end of the spectrum compared to the tuberculoid end.

40|$|Summary Background. Anti-CD 34 {{antibodies}} {{label the}} bulge region of mouse hair follicles. However, in human hair follicles, CD 34 immunoreactivity {{is found in}} the outer root sheath below the bulge zone. The immunohistochemical staining of CD 34 in catagen and telogen follicles has not been evaluated. Aims: To characterize the expression of CD 34 immunoreactivity at different stages of the hair cycle in human terminal hair follicles, and to compare the immunostaining pattern of CD 34 with that of CK 15, used here as a marker of the bulge region. Method. Serial vertical sections of human hair follicles in anagen, catagen and tel-ogen phases were immunostained with anti-CD 34 (QBEnd 10) and anti-CK 15 (LHK 15 and C 8 ⁄ 144 B) antibodies. Double-labelling immunofluorescence was also performed. Results. The catagen and telogen follicles studied did not show CD 34 immuno-reactivity in the outer root sheath. The location of CD 34 and CK 15 immunoreactivity in anagen follicles reveals a different staining pattern: CD 34 -positive cells are located in the outer root sheath below the attachment zone of the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle,</b> whereas CK 15 -positive cells are located in the outer root sheath above the attachment zone of the <b>arrector</b> pili <b>muscle.</b> Conclusions.
