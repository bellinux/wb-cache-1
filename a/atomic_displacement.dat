Examination of the Kirkwood model indicates that the standard deviation (sigma) of the static disorder on the (In,Ga) sublattice is around 60 % of the value on the As sublattice and the (In,Ga) <b>atomic</b> <b>displacements</b> are much more isotropic than those on the As sublattice.

50|$|The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} on materials {{is rooted in}} the initial event in which an energetic projectile strikes a target. While the event is made up of several steps or processes, the primary result is the displacement of an atom from its lattice site. Irradiation displaces an atom from its site, leaving a vacant site behind (a vacancy) and the displaced atom eventually comes to rest in a location that is between lattice sites, becoming an interstitial atom. The vacancy-interstitial pair is central to radiation effects in crystalline solids and is known as a Frenkel pair (FP). The presence of the Frenkel pair and other consequences of irradiation damage determine the physical effects, and with the application of stress, the mechanical effects of irradiation by the occurring of interstitial, phenomena, such as swelling, growth, phase transition, segregation, etc., will be effected. In addition to the <b>atomic</b> <b>displacement,</b> an energetic charged particle moving in a lattice also gives energy to electrons in the system, via the electronic stopping power. This energy transfer can also for high-energy particles produce damage in non-metallic materials, as so called ion tracks.|$|E

The mean squares of dynamic displacements of Ni and Ti atoms are identical, but the mean square of static displacements is greater by a factor of 4. 7 for Ni atoms than for Ti atoms. The Debye temperature calculated from the mean squares of displacements of Ni atoms is 360 K; that calculated for Ti atoms in a similar way is 390 K.

30|$|There are two {{different}} types of energy transfer processes the e-beam in TEM can be involved in: radiolysis due to the inelastic scattering of the electron–electron interactions resulting in specimen heating, ionization, and X-rays or Auger electrons generation, and knock-on damage due to the elastic scattering of the electron-atom interactions resulting in <b>atomic</b> <b>displacement</b> creating point defects within the materials or sputtered atoms at the surface of the specimens. Generally, it is known that the degree of energy transfer by radiolysis is reduced at higher e-beam energies while that of the knock-on damage is increased [3]. In our previous report [5], we summarized the theoretical prediction of each process (ionization, heating, and direct <b>atomic</b> <b>displacement)</b> on the energy transfer from high energy electrons to target materials based on the scattering cross-section, i.e., scattering probability, direct <b>atomic</b> <b>displacement</b> cross-section (_d) due to elastic scattering considering the relativistic kinematics of binary collisions (the Mott formula), and inelastic scattering cross-section (_in) using the continuous slow down approximation (the Bethe formula). Here, _d {{is a function of the}} incident e-beam energy (E), atomic mass (M) of the target membrane and displacement energy (Ed), which is the kinetic energy required to displace an atom from its original lattice position to an unstable one. Moreover, _in is a function of E, M, and the electron excitation potential (I). From calculating _d as a function of E, it was concluded that _d started to increase at the critical e-beam energy and continued to increase with increasing the electron beam energy, while _in decreased with the increase in electron beam energy. We theoretically calculated _d and _in for SiNx membranes and experimentally demonstrated that nanopore drilling in SiNx membranes by the incident electron beam energy was the result of direct <b>atomic</b> <b>displacement.</b> The direct <b>atomic</b> <b>displacement</b> energy of SiNx (17  eV) could be determined from the evolution of nanopores as function of the energy and dose of the e-beam, and was well matched with the sputtering energy.|$|E
