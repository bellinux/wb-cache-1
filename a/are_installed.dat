Developers can still use the MPNS on apps that <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> on newer versions of Windows Mobile (Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1), but only if the Windows application was already registered to use the MPNS and has been converted to a Microsoft Silverlight application and modified to re-target the new platform.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instruments}} aboard CryoSat-2 are SIRAL-2, the SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeters; {{which uses}} radar to determine and monitor the spacecraft's altitude {{in order to}} measure the elevation of the ice. Unlike the original CryoSat, two SIRAL instruments <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> aboard CryoSat-2, with one serving as a backup in case the other fails.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices <b>are</b> <b>installed.</b> Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.|$|E
50|$|Windows must <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> into {{a primary}} {{partition}} (and in older systems {{this must be}} the first partition).

5|$|Another legend narrated {{is linked}} to the six Khmer bronze statues (three lions–with heads {{substituted}} later in Burmese style, a three-headed elephant known as Airavata, and two warriors in the form of Shiva), which <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard. These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases.|$|E
5|$|As {{there are}} {{a limited number of}} stalls in the Chapel, only the most senior Knights and Dames Grand Cross <b>are</b> <b>installed.</b> A stall made vacant by the death of a {{military}} Knight Grand Cross is offered to the next most senior uninstalled military GCB, and similarly for vacancies among civil GCBs. Waits between admission to the Order and installation may be very long; for instance, Marshal of the Air Force Lord Craig of Radley was created a Knight Grand Cross in 1984, but was not installed until 2006.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the main}} scoreboard, the {{ballpark}} has three more LED displays.

One of the mosaic panels at the end of the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Japanese {{government}} used Conan {{in campaigns}} to help promote crime awareness among children. Targeting the same audience, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs used Conan {{and his friends}} in two pamphlets: one to promote the ministry's mission, the other to introduce the 34th G8 summit held {{in the country in}} 2010. Several characters in the series featured in the sixth installment of the Anime, Heroes and Heroines commemorative stamp series issued by Japan Post in 2006. Aoyama and his creations are celebrated in his hometown Hokuei, Tottori; a museum with exhibits of his work is located there, and several bronze statues of Jimmy Kudo, Conan Edogawa, and Rachel Moore <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> in various locations throughout the town.|$|E
5|$|In response, SMRT {{announced}} it was replacing important engineering components on all C151 trains by 2019. This included changing the existing Mitsubishi Electric propulsion system for the newer Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) propulsion system by Toshiba, technology currently used in the Tokyo Metro's 1000 series and 16000 series trains {{as well as the}} Kyushu 305 series and Hankyu 1000 series trains. As of July 2015, train sets 055/056 and 131/132 are trialed with the new propulsion system. In tandem with the replacement of the signalling system on the East-West Line and North-South Line with the newer Thales SelTrac signalling system, new equipment <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> in the passenger compartment of the trailer cars.|$|E

5|$|Mist is {{responsible}} for the existence of 'magicite', stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> into a component known as 'glossair rings' that give flight to the vehicles, whether small-sized bikes or large airships, and memstones that function much like recording devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its cost-efficiency, led to it replacing electricity and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|Pipe organs <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> in churches, synagogues, concert halls, schools, {{other public}} {{buildings}} and in private properties. They {{are used in}} the performance of classical music, sacred music, secular music, and popular music. In the early 20th century, pipe organs were installed in theaters to accompany the screening of films during the silent movie era; in municipal auditoria, where orchestral transcriptions were popular; and in the homes of the wealthy. The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls. The organ boasts a substantial repertoire, which spans over 500years.|$|E

5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> on the 757, one powered by each engine, {{and the third}} using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|When James VII {{created the}} modern Order in 1687, he {{directed}} that the Abbey Church at the Palace of Holyroodhouse {{be converted to}} a Chapel for the Order of the Thistle, perhaps copying the idea from the Order of the Garter (whose chapel is located in Windsor Castle). James VII, however, was deposed by 1688; the Chapel, meanwhile, had been destroyed during riots. The Order {{did not have a}} Chapel until 1911, when one was added onto St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh. Each year, the Sovereign resides at the Palace of Holyroodhouse for a week in June or July; during the visit, a service for the Order is held.
