40|$|Weathering of evaporites {{strongly}} {{influences the}} chemistry of continental runoff, making surface waters poorly exploitable for civil uses. In south-central Sicily, this phenomenon is worsened by the occurrence of <b>abandoned</b> <b>landfills</b> of old sulphur and salt mines. The industrial evolution of the Bosco-S. Cataldo mining site leaved two landfills from the early exploitation of a sulphur mine followed by that of a kainite deposit. In particular, the weathering of these landfills leads the dissolved salt (TDS) values up to about 200 g l − 1 in the Stincone–Salito Stream waters. This process induces the V, Cr and Fe desorption from sediments and particulates in the aqueous phase under reducing conditions. At the same time, the weathering of salt minerals releases Rb and Cs, originally contained in halite. The overall processes lead to the V, Cr, Fe, Rb and Cs enrichment of waters from the Stincone–Salito Stream system accompanied by a sharp growth of As content, up to about 13 µg l − 1, caused by As release from Fe-bearing solids due to the high salinity. Therefore, the scenario of the weathering of Bosco-S. Cataldo mine landfills depicts an environment strongly influenced by effects of the growing salinity and euxinic water conditions where the attained TDS, Eh and pH conditions reduce the natural scavenging capability of the interested river system, favouring a growth of residence time of toxic elements in river waters...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A three-layer {{cover system}} {{consisting}} of a barrier layer, drainage layer, and a cover layer is commonly used to cap <b>abandoned</b> <b>landfills,</b> and {{it was hypothesized that}} shredded scrap tires could serve as an effective drainage media for such systems. To evaluate the transmissivity (flow capacity per unit cross sectional area in the lateral direction) of a shredded scrap tire drainage layer in a landfill cover system, laboratory transmissivity tests were performed using two different size tire shreds, large (TS 1) and small (TS 2), that were subjected to simulated landfill cover conditions. The effects of normal stress and the use of a geotextile at the top, bottom, or at both interfaces of the three layer-simulated cover system were investigated. The transmissivity was high and remained almost the same in the tests when the geotextile was used at both the interfaces. In the case when there was no geotextile at the top interface, however, the amount of soil migration into the voids of the tire shreds from the cover soil layer was high. The absence of the geotextile at the bottom interface had a minimal effect on the transmissivity, but the absence of the geotextile at this interface may cause the protrusion of shredded scrap tires into the barrier layer. Based on the results and observations in this study, the presence of a geotextile at the interfaces, irrespective of the tire shred size and stress conditions, prevented a reduction in the performance of the drainage layer...|$|R
40|$|The {{ground beneath}} waste {{disposal}} sites {{is regarded as}} the final and most important barrier to the spread of contaminants. A detailed geological investigation and documentation is a prerequisite for potential waste disposal sites, as well as for assessing <b>abandoned</b> <b>landfills</b> and other contaminated land, particularly before planning remedial action or decontamination. With this in view, BMBF initiated a research program designed to analyse and improve conventional site-investigation methods and to develop effective and economical new ones. Interdisciplinary cooperation involving hydrogeology, geotechnics, remote sensing, geophysics, geochemistry and clay mineralogy has had considerable success in attaining this objective. The research program consisted of 28 individual project carried out by universities, research organisations, federal and state institutes, and companies. These projects, comprising ten predominantly hydrogeological studies, eleven geophysical and seven geochemical studies, as well as site investigations of nine test sites, were focussed on the following tasks: 1. analysis of the ground as a geological barrier; 2. analysis and evaluation of available site-investigation methods; 3. improvement ofconventional methods and development of new ones; 4. application of conventional and new methods at test sites to select the optimal combination of methods; 5. compilation of a handbook on methods. The results of the research program are being used as a basis for a handbook on investigation of the ground beneath landfills and contaminated sites which is being published by Springer Verlag. The handbook has seven parts: remote sensing (issued in May 1995), geophysics, geotechnics, geochemistry, groundwater flow and transport models, clay mineralogy, and soil physics. The other parts of the handbook will be completed by the end of 1996. Thus, the research program on the ground beneath landfills makes a substantial contribution towards enhancing the effectiveness of site-investigation techniques for potential waste disposal sites and for assessing and remediating contaminated sites.

40|$|Abstract—The {{groundwater}} contamination {{from the}} unmanaged <b>abandoned</b> <b>landfill</b> site creates many problems {{to the community}} surrounding the landfill site. An <b>abandoned</b> <b>landfill</b> site in Mae-Hia Sub-district, Mueang District, Chiang Mai Province {{is an example of}} the unmanaged landfill site. Remedial work of groundwater quality needs to understand the geologic conditions. The seismic refraction survey and tomography provide the solution to delineate the geologic conditions. Seven lines of seismic refraction survey were performed using broadside configuration over an area of approximately 0. 12 square kilometer. The refraction data was process as travel-time curves to display the two-dimensional velocity model. The refraction tomography shows both two-dimensional velocity model at a particular depth and three-dimensional velocity model of the shallow subsurface structure. The result demonstrates that the Mae-Hia landfill site has three layers. The upper layer was interpreted as topsoil having a wave velocity range from 124 to 849 meters per second and a thickness of 1. 2 to 9 meters. The middle layer was interpreted as waste material and clayey sand having a wave velocity range from 600 to 1, 719 meters per second and a thickness 2 to 13. 9 meters. The lower layer was interpreted as saturated sand and saturated sand and gravel at the base of the landfill site. It has a wave velocity range from 1, 351 to 2, 000 meters per second and a thickness of 1. 5 to more than 6. 5 meters. Keywords—Velocity model, seismic refraction tomography, Mae-Hia landfill site.

40|$|Abstract This study {{presents}} the environmental evaluation {{of an abandoned}} and potentially contaminated landfill using analyses {{for the presence of}} heavy metals and for methane generation potential. The site is located in the city of Santiago, Chile, and was used as a rural landfill for domestic, industrial and construction waste until 1978, but is now in a heavily urbanized area and surrounded by houses. Analyses performed on 24 samples taken in and around the site show Potential Methane Generation (PMG) values between 1. 6 % and 11. 3 % of maximum projected levels. These low values, compared to those of an active landfill, indicate that waste material stored in the site has a low capacity to generate methane. Concentrations of heavy metals in the surface and deep soil are similar to typical levels for these metals in normal soil, according to international USEPA standards, and do not present imminent risk to human health. The use of the PMG test technique {{for the study of the}} health risk of an <b>abandoned</b> <b>landfill</b> is a new contribution to the Chilean evaluation methodology and management program for Abandoned Sites with Potential Presence of Contaminants (SAPPC).

40|$|The Netherlands {{has about}} 3800 {{abandoned}} landfills {{with a total}} surface of about 9000 ha. As they are often located near urban areas and their influence extends into their surrounding environment they put pressure on available space. Most abandoned landfills were in use until the 1960 s and 1970 s. Their precise geometry and composition are often unknown. The {{same can be said}} about the internal processes and resulting short- and long-term risks of the landfills. As a result landfills are often poorly understood and only monitored by measuring surrounding groundwater composition. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of landfills - especially of their outer boundaries and the lateral variation in composition - a multidisciplinary approach is used consisting of geophysical and chemical measurements to characterise landfills. The aim of this paper is to share experiences from two sites - an <b>abandoned</b> <b>landfill</b> at the Bergen site situated in the coastal realm of the Netherlands and a modern landfill situated at the Landgraaf site in inland, hilly terrain - with a clear focus on the geophysical results.

40|$|We {{have used}} surface-based {{electrical}} resistivity tomography {{to detect and}} characterize preferential hydraulic pathways in the immediate downstream area of an <b>abandoned,</b> hazardous <b>landfill.</b> The landfill occupies the void left by a former gravel pit and its base {{is close to the}} groundwater table and lacking an engineered barrier. As such, this site is remarkably typical of many small- to medium-sized waste deposits throughout the densely populated and heavily industrialized foreland {{on both sides of the}} Alpine arc. Outflows of pollutants lastingly contaminated local drinking water supplies and necessitated a partial remediation in the form of a synthetic cover barrier, which is meant to prevent meteoric water from percolating through the waste before reaching the groundwater table. Any future additional isolation of the landfill in the form of lateral barriers thus requires adequate knowledge of potential preferential hydraulic pathways for outflowing contaminants. Our results, inferred from a suite of tomographically inverted surfaced-based electrical resistivity profiles oriented roughly perpendicular to the local hydraulic gradient, indicate that potential contaminant outflows would predominantly occur along an unexploited lateral extension of the original gravel deposit. This finds its expression as a distinct and laterally continuous high-resistivity anomaly in the resistivity tomograms. This interpretation is ground-truthed through a litholog from a nearby well. Since the probed glacio-fluvial deposits are largely devoid of mineralogical clay, the geometry of hydraulic and electrical pathways across the pore space of a given lithological unit can be assumed to be identical, which allows for an order-of-magnitude estimation of the overall permeability structure. These estimates indicate that the permeability of the imaged extension of the gravel body is at least two to three orders-of-magnitude higher than that of its finer-grained embedding matrix. This corroborates the preeminent role of the high-resistivity anomaly as a potential preferential flow path...|$|R
40|$|In the United States {{more than}} 3. 5 {{billion tons of}} solid waste are {{generated}} annually. Of this, more than 2 billion tons are agricultural waste, such as manure and crop waste. Almost 300 million tons are generated by commercial and industrial activities and municipalities, and another 1. 1 billion tons are attributed to various mining operations (Vaughan, 1969). Increasing amounts of solid waste have had detrimental effects on environmental quality. It has become necessary to reprocess and reuse some, and to provide safe and environmentally acceptable ways of disposing of the remaining waste in properly constructed landfills. Pollution brought about by improperly constructed landfills may be very severe. For example, the contaminants generated by the waste at the old, <b>abandoned</b> Army Creek <b>Landfill,</b> New Castle County, Delaware, were so widespread that the situation received national attention. General and sincere concern expressed by many citizens of our State has prompted the Delaware Geological Survey to prepare this report. The report explains the functioning of a landfill, problems improperly constructed landfills may cause, and the geologic and hydrologic aspects {{that have to be}} considered in selecting a suitable disposal site for solid waste. The report does not contain discussions of other important factors, such as social impact, transportation, and specific health hazards, that must also be considered...|$|R
5000|$|The River Don valley, {{in which}} the {{settlement}} was situated, was a site given to limestone formations which lent themselves to early mining for building purposes. The area in which Levitt Hagg is located was known as Conisbrough Cliffs and was composed of two quarries: Near Cliff, which had been exhausted by 1791; and [...] "Far Cliff" [...] which included the long-gone early industrial hamlet of Levitt Hagg.Limestone from the quarries at Levitt Hagg, which had a vertical height of 75 feet, has been widely used in building in the South Yorkshire area since medieval times. The soft dolomite limestone from {{the banks of the}} Don east of Conisbrough made ideal building material, which yielded profits for some. An account book from the mid-eighteenth century records the expenses of quarrying limestone at the site, which belonged at that time to the Battie-Wrightson family of Cusworth.As well as quarrying operations, barges to be used on the canals were also built on the bank by the village, the first one being completed in 1886. Boat building was abandoned in 1901. The only surviving evidence of industrial activity are abandoned lime kilns, the upper portions of which are still visible. Today Levitt Hagg is the site of an <b>abandoned</b> quarry and <b>landfill</b> site, providing refuge for four species of bats, including whiskered, long-eared, Daubenton's and Natterer's. (The bats and their habitat are protected by law.) ...|$|R
