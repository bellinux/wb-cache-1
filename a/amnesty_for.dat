5|$|During this period, Riel {{had been}} staying with priests of the Oblate order in Plattsburgh, New York, who {{introduced}} him to Father Fabien Martin dit Barnabé in the nearby village of Keeseville. It was here that he received news of Lépine's fate: following his trial {{for the murder of}} Scott, which had begun on 13 October 1874, Lépine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> both Lépine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the Governor General Lord Dufferin commuted Lépine's sentence in January 1875. This opened the door for Mackenzie to secure from parliament an <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> Riel, on the condition that he remain in exile for five years.|$|E

5|$|Elagabalus {{tried to}} have his presumed lover, the charioteer Hierocles, {{declared}} Caesar, while another alleged lover, the athlete Aurelius Zoticus, {{was appointed to the}} non-administrative but influential position of Master of the Chamber, or Cubicularius.

5|$|On December 19, 2013, {{the state}} Duma {{approved}} a general <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> various prisoners; {{among those who}} qualified for amnesty were those in prison for non-violent offences and mothers of young children. It was expected that Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina would be among those who were released. Their release was confirmed on December 23, 2013.|$|E
5|$|A fierce {{defense was}} {{launched}} {{from within the}} walls, even as Bowie and Travis made unsuccessful attempts {{to negotiate with the}} Mexican army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements. Although Santa Anna refused to consider a proposed conditional surrender, he extended an offer of <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> all Tejanos inside the fortress to walk away unharmed. Most Tejanos evacuated from the fortress about February 25, either as part of the amnesty, or as a part of Juan Seguín's company of courier scouts on their last run.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria {{ended its}} {{war with the}} Ottoman Empire and {{prepared}} to suppress the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, a liberal like his predecessor, proposed an <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> the rebels. After a Statist army was overcome at the Battle of Falmagne, the territory was quickly overrun by Imperial forces, and the revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars.|$|E
5|$|In late October 1813, Hurshid Pasha {{declared}} a general <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> the rebels that had survived, though Karađorđe and some senior Serbian religious leaders were specifically exempted. Many rebel leaders accepted Hurshid Pasha's offer of amnesty {{and agreed to}} lay down their arms, the most notable of these being Miloš Obrenović, the rebel commander in Užice. A large number of Serb refugees subsequently returned to their homes, as did many of the Muslims that had been displaced in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's first Reconstruction {{actions were}} two proclamations, with the {{unanimous}} backing of his Cabinet, on May 29. One recognized the Virginia government led by provisional Governor Francis Pierpont. The second provided <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> all ex-rebels except those holding property valued at $20,000 or more; it also appointed a temporary governor for North Carolina and authorized elections. Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmen's rights. The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.|$|E

50|$|Government {{authorities}} offered two <b>amnesties</b> <b>for</b> {{fighters from}} the opposition militia groups, which originated from {{remnants of the}} disbanded Home Army and other organizations. Tens of thousands of oppositionists {{took advantage of the}} amnesties declared in 1945 and 1947. Some were subjected to further prosecution and imprisonment, but the amnesties effectively terminated the anti-communist armed resistance movement.|$|R
5|$|The delegates {{representing}} the provisional government departed for Ottawa in March. Although they initially met with legal difficulties {{arising from the}} execution of Scott, they soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier. An agreement enshrining the demands {{in the list of}} rights was quickly reached, and this formed the basis for the Manitoba Act of 12 May 1870, which formally admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation. However, the negotiators could not secure a general <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> the provisional government.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{recommendation}} of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> possession and usage of these drugs was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce authoritarianism {{and the political}} influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact {{between the military and}} the Peronist unions that sought an <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> the military. He maintained that the armed forced should be subject to the civilian government, and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E

In 2008, he {{was sentenced}} an 11-year prison sentence for his work with the pro-democracy 88 Generation Students Group, and his detention was criticized by human rights groups including Amnesty International, which named him a prisoner of conscience. He was released in October 2011 {{in a series of}} <b>amnesties</b> <b>for</b> political prisoners.|$|R

5|$|France invaded {{and began}} occupying Syria in 1919 and {{following}} the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, Faisal was exiled and the kingdom annulled. Al-Bakri left for Amman in Transjordan, which was {{under the authority of}} Faisal's brother King Abdullah. Al-Bakri would later serve as Abdullah's aide in 1921, a position he held for about two years before returning to Syria after the French issued <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> political exiles. On his return, he became a member of al-Shahbandar's People's Party and actively sought to topple the French authorities in Syria and align the country with the ruling Hashemites in Iraq, Transjordan and the Hejaz. The Hashemites were driven out of the latter in 1925 by the Saudis.|$|E
5|$|Johnson proclaimed <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> all former Confederates on December 25, 1868. Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered for a {{few weeks}} to receive {{assurance}} that it still applied to him even though he had not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E
5|$|Karmal was {{promoted}} to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, introducing a general <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki's and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the Afghan people.|$|E

Most Central Americans, after arriving, worked {{in the service sector}} in informal, low-paying jobs. At the time many immigrated, Houston was experiencing an economic recession.|$|R

5|$|Leiva wrote a {{constitutional}} code {{to regulate the}} actions of the Junta. It stipulated that the Junta could not exercise judicial power, which was reserved for the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires; that Cisneros could not act without the support of {{the other members of the}} Junta; that the Cabildo could dismiss anyone who neglected his duty; that the Cabildo's consent would be required to create new taxes; that the Junta would sanction a general <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> those who had aired opinions at the open cabildo; and that the Junta would invite the other cities to send delegates. The commanders of the armed forces, including Saavedra and Pedro Andrés García, agreed to this code. The Junta swore the oath of office that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, by late June Riel {{was back}} in Manitoba and was soon persuaded to run {{as a member of}} {{parliament}} for the electoral district of Provencher. However, following the early September defeat of George-Étienne Cartier in his home riding in Quebec, Riel stood aside so that Cartier—on record as being in favour of <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> Riel—might secure a seat in Provencher. Cartier won by acclamation, but Riel's hopes for a swift resolution to the amnesty question were dashed following Cartier's death on 20 May 1873. In the ensuing by-election in October 1873, Riel ran unopposed as an Independent, although he had again fled, a warrant having been issued for his arrest in September. Lépine was not so lucky; he was captured and faced trial.|$|E
5|$|The elderly Caxias, almost 72 and widowed since 1874, was in {{poor health}} and could serve {{only as a}} figurehead {{president}} of the government formed on 25 June 1875. Cotejipe was the de facto president. The Caxias-Cotejipe cabinet attempted to dissipate the discord created by the previous cabinet. Their measures included financial aid to coffee farmers, an <b>amnesty</b> <b>for</b> the convicted bishops, and, to please the pro-slavery Conservatives, the selection of new ministers and a call for elections. Caxias, who was a Freemason but also a staunch Catholic, threatened to resign if the Emperor did not grant the amnesty, which PedroII grudgingly issued in September 1875.|$|E

50|$|The {{emigration}} to the Netherlands was so {{devastating to}} the homelands that the Danish-Norwegian king issued penalties {{of death for}} emigration, but repeatedly had to issue <b>amnesties</b> <b>for</b> those willing to return, announced by posters {{in the streets of}} Amsterdam. Increasingly, Dutchmen who search their genealogical roots turn to Norway. Many Norwegians who emigrated to the Netherlands, and often were employed in the Dutch merchant fleet, emigrated further to the many Dutch colonies such as New Amsterdam (New York).|$|R
