Gaining custody of a partner's child where necessary is also made easier by the law.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, {{when he was}} 62, the Los Angeles Police Department hired Wyatt {{and former}} Los Angeles detective Arthur Moore King at $10.00 per day to carry out various tasks [...] "outside the law" [...] such as {{retrieving}} criminals from Mexico, which he did very capably. This led to Wyatt's final armed confrontation. In October 1910, he was asked by former Los Angeles Police Commissioner H. L. Lewis to head up a posse to protect surveyors of the American Trona Company who were attempting to wrest control of mining claims for vast deposits of potash {{on the edge of}} Searles Lake held in receivership by the foreclosed California Trona Company. Wyatt and the group he guarded were regarded <b>as</b> <b>claim</b> jumpers and were confronted by armed representatives of the other company. King wrote, [...] "it was the nerviest thing he had ever seen". With guns pulled, Wyatt came out of his tent with a Winchester rifle, firing a round at the feet of Federal Receiver Stafford W. Austin. [...] "Back off or I'll blow you apart, or my name is not Wyatt Earp". The owners summoned the U.S. marshal, who arrested Earp and 27 others, served them with a summons for contempt of court, and sent them home. Earp's actions did not resolve the dispute, which eventually escalated into the [...] "Potash Wars" [...] of the Mojave Desert.|$|E

At that rate, {{he would be}} the most obliged humble servant in the world. I dare swear for these in particular, he never desired them to be his admirers, nor promised in return to be theirs: that had truly been a sign he was of their acquaintance; but would not the malicious world have suspected such an approbation of some motive worse than ignorance in the author of the Essay on Criticism? Be it as it will, the reasons of their admiration and of his contempt are equally subsisting, for his works and theirs are the very same that they were.|$|E
60|$|October 6.--Left Ravensworth this morning, and {{travelled}} {{as far as}} Whittingham with Marquis of Lothian. Arrived at Alnwick to dinner, where I {{was very}} kindly received. The Duke is a handsome man,[53] who will be corpulent {{if he does not}} continue to take hard exercise. The Duchess very pretty and lively, but her liveliness is of that kind which shows at once it is connected with thorough principle, and is not liable to be influenced by fashionable caprice. The habits of the family are early and regular; I conceive they may be termed formal and old-fashioned by such visitors <b>as</b> <b>claim</b> to be the pink of the mode. The Castle is a fine old pile, with various courts and towers, and the entrance is magnificent. It wants, however, the splendid feature of a keep. The inside fitting up is an attempt at Gothic, but the taste is meagre and poor, and done over with too much gilding. It was done half a century ago, when this kind of taste was ill-understood. I found here the Bishop of [Gloucester], etc. etc.|$|E
6000|$|As usual my silence {{has become}} so dense and coagulated that you might cut monstrous slabs and slices off it for {{distribution}} in your family--were you [...] "maliciously" [...] disposed! But my whole security--as my whole decency (so far <b>as</b> <b>claim</b> to decency for myself goes)--is that we are neither of us malicious, and that I have often enough shown you before that, deep as I may seem to plunge into the obscure, there ever comes an hour when, panting and puffing (as even now!) my head emerges again, {{to say nothing of}} my heart. I have treasured your petit mot from a point of space unidentified, but despatched from a Holland-America ship and bearing a French and a Pas-de-Calais postage-stamp (a bit bewilderingly)--treasured it for the last month as a link with your receding form: the recession of which makes me miss your presence in this hemisphere out of proportion somehow to the--to any--frequency with which fortune enables me to enjoy it. But I still keep hold of the pledge that your retention (as I understand you) of your Paris apartment constitutes toward your soon coming back--and really feel that with a return under your protection and management absolutely guaranteed me, I too should have liked to tempt again the adventure with you; should have liked again to taste of the natal air--and perhaps even in a wider draught than you will go in for. However, I have neither your youth, your sinews, nor your fortune--let alone your other domestic blessings and reinforcements--and somehow the memory of what was fierce and formidable in our colossal country the last time I was there prevails with me over softer emotions, and I feel I shall never alight on it again save as upborne on the wings of some miracle that isn't in the least likely to occur. The nearest I shall come to it will be in my impatience for your return with the choice collection of notes I hope you will have taken for me. You have chosen a good year for absence--I mean a deplorable, an infamous one, in [...] "Europe," [...] for any joy or convenience of air or weather. The pleasant land of France lies soaking as well as this more confessed and notorious sponge, I believe;--and I have now for months found life no better than a beastly sea-voyage of storms and submersions under closed hatches. We rot with dampness, confinement and despair--in short we are reduced to the abjectness, as you see, of literally talking weather. You will see our Nephew Bill, I trust, promptly, in your rich art-world là-bas, and I beg you to add your pressure to mine on the question of our absolutely soon enjoying him over here. I am under a semi-demi-pledge to go to Paris for a fortnight in April--but it would be a more positive prospect, I think, if I knew I were to find you all there. Give my bestest love to Lilla, please, and my untutored homages to the Daughters of Music. Try to see Howells chez lui--so as to bring me every detail. Feel thus how much I count on you and receive from me every invocation proper to this annual crisis. May the genius of our common country have you in its most--or least?--energetic keeping. Yours, my dear Thomas, ever, ...|$|E

Whilst Flores missed his shots, Rigondeaux landed a hook to the head after the bell. As referee Vic Drakulich managed to separate the two, Flores, after a split second, fell backwards. The referee then turned his attention to Flores and after viewing ringside replay, without sound, ruled it a knockout win for Rigondeaux. Rigondeaux said, through a translator, [...] "We both threw punches at the same time and mine landed first. It was only a matter of time the knockout happened." ...|$|E
