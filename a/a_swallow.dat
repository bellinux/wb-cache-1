5|$|Early Greek {{sources have}} it that Philomela {{was turned into}} <b>a</b> <b>swallow,</b> which has no song; Procne turns into a nightingale, singing a {{beautiful}} but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela {{was turned into a}} nightingale, and Procne into <b>a</b> <b>swallow.</b> Eustathius' version of the story has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|E

50|$|In many birds, the {{esophagus}} {{is largely a}} mere gravity chute, and in such events as <b>a</b> seagull <b>swallowing</b> <b>a</b> fish or <b>a</b> stork <b>swallowing</b> <b>a</b> frog, <b>swallowing</b> consists largely of the bird lifting its head with its beak pointing up and guiding the prey with tongue and jaws so that the prey slides inside and down.|$|R
5|$|The current Emperor's flag is a 16-petal chrysanthemum, colored in gold, {{centered}} on a red background with a 2:3 ratio. The Empress uses the same flag, except the shape is that of <b>a</b> <b>swallow</b> tail. The crown prince and the crown princess use the same flags, except with a smaller chrysanthemum and a white border {{in the middle of}} the flags. The chrysanthemum has been associated with the Imperial throne since the rule of Emperor Go-Toba in the 12th century, but it did not become the exclusive symbol of the Imperial throne until 1868.|$|E
5|$|Rendered {{unable to}} speak because of her injuries, Philomela wove a {{tapestry}} (or a robe) that told her story and had it sent to Procne. Procne was incensed and in revenge, she killed her son by Tereus, Itys (or Itylos), boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband. After Tereus ate Itys, the sisters presented him with the severed head of his son, and {{he became aware of}} their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal. He snatched up an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters. They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at Daulia in Phocis. In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' rage and vengeance. The gods transformed Procne into <b>a</b> <b>swallow</b> and Philomela into a nightingale. Subsequently, the gods would transform Tereus into a hoopoe.|$|E

When asked where the food is getting stuck, patients will often point to the cervical (neck) region as the site of the obstruction. The actual site of obstruction is always at or below the level at which the level of obstruction is perceived.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} Legend of Atrahasis, Enlil, {{the king of}} the gods, sets out to {{eliminate}} humanity, whose noise is disturbing his rest. He successively sends drought, famine and plague to eliminate humanity, but Enki thwarts his half-brother's plans by teaching Atrahasis how to counter these threats. Each time, Atrahasis asks the population to abandon worship of all gods, except the one responsible for the calamity, and this seems to shame them into relenting. Humans, however, proliferate a fourth time. Enraged, Enlil convenes a Council of Deities and gets them to promise not to tell humankind that he plans their total annihilation. Enki does not tell Atrahasis directly, but speaks to him in secret via a reed wall. He instructs Atrahasis to build a boat in order to rescue his family and other living creatures from the coming deluge. After the seven-day Deluge, the flood hero frees <b>a</b> <b>swallow,</b> a raven and a dove in an effort to find if the flood waters have receded. Upon landing, a sacrifice is made to the gods. Enlil is angry his will has been thwarted yet again, and Enki is named as the culprit. Enki explains that Enlil is unfair to punish the guiltless, and the gods institute measures to ensure that humanity does not become too populous in the future. This {{is one of the oldest}} of the surviving Middle Eastern Deluge myths.|$|E
25|$|The Wrath of Mulgarath was {{published}} on September 7, 2004. The Grace children {{return from the}} quarry to the Spiderwick estate, {{only to find the}} house in ruins and their mother gone. Hogsqueal the hobgoblin informs them that the house was destroyed by the goblins who have kidnapped their mother and taken her to the palace of their fearsome master, Mulgarath the ogre. Accompanied by Hogsqueal, the siblings journey to Mulgarath's palace, an immense citadel made of garbage where they battle a legion of goblins. Mallory runs the leader through with her sword and is greatly traumatized by having actually killed a living sentient being. Nevertheless, she and her brothers defeat the goblins and discover Mulgarath's plan. The ogre has learned from the Field Guide that fresh cows' milk makes young dragons rapidly mature. He has stolen a number of cows and is using them to breed an army of dragons with which he plans to conquer the world. Byron, the griffin, successfully vanquishes the mother dragon and Simon kills the young ones. Infiltrating the palace, they find their mother and father tied up. They release their father, but discover that he is actually Mulgarath in disguise. Jared has Thimbletack wrap chains around Simon and Mallory. The ogre brags of his plan and reveals that the Field Guide is underneath his throne, and Jared mockingly tells Mulgarath that he and his siblings have killed all the dragons. In a rage, Mulgarath flings Simon and Mallory out of the window but Thimbletack's chains hold, and they don't fall far. Jared stabs Mulgarath in the foot with Mallory's sword, then knocks him out of the window. Mulgarath falls, transforms into <b>a</b> <b>swallow</b> to escape, and is eaten by Hogsqueal.|$|E
25|$|Magda and Ruggero {{have been}} living {{together}} on the French Riviera for some months. They talk about their first meeting and happiness together, living quietly by the sea. Ruggero tells Magda that he has written to his mother to ask for money to pay their growing debts and for her consent to his marriage to Magda. Ruggero imagines their happy married life and the child they may have (Aria: Dimmi che vuoi seguirmi). Magda is deeply touched, but also uneasy: she knows that her past life as a courtesan would make her unacceptable to Ruggero's family, and possibly to Ruggero if he knew who she really was. As Ruggero leaves to post his letter she meditates on her dilemma, torn between her desire to tell Ruggero everything, her wish not to hurt him and her fear of losing his love. Prunier and Lisette arrive. Lisette has had a brief and disastrous career as a music-hall singer: her performance in Nice the previous evening was a catastrophe. She and Prunier bicker with each other while waiting for Magda. When Magda appears, Lisette begs for her job back, and Magda consents. Prunier expresses surprise that Magda can be happy away from Paris, and delivers a message to Magda from Rambaldo: he is happy to take her back on any terms. Magda refuses to listen. Prunier takes his leave of Lisette (first arranging a rendezvous with her for that evening) and Lisette resumes her duties as Magda's maid. Ruggero returns with a letter from his mother, in which she says that if Ruggero's fiancée has all the virtues he has described to her, {{he will have a}} blissful marriage. She looks forward to welcoming the couple to her home and sends Magda a kiss. Magda is unable to keep her secret any longer. She tells Ruggero about her past and declares that she can never be his wife – she would cause his parents too much grief. Ruggero implores Magda not to abandon him (Ma come puoi lasciarmi), but Magda is adamant that they cannot remain together, and that Ruggero must return home. Like <b>a</b> <b>swallow,</b> she flies back to Rambaldo and her old life, leaving Ruggero behind, devastated.|$|E

500|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was first {{formally}} described in 1850 by German ornithologist Jean Cabanis as Cotyle obsoleta, using a specimen collected from near Cairo, Egypt. It {{was moved to}} the new genus Ptyonoprogne, created by German ornithologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach, in the same year. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek ptuon (πτύον), [...] "a fan", referring to the shape of the opened tail, and Procne (Πρόκνη), a mythological girl who was turned into <b>a</b> <b>swallow.</b> The specific name obsoleta means [...] "worn" [...] in Latin.|$|E
