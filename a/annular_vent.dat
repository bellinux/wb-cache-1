2500|$|After {{considerable}} experimentation, Denys Bliss at Hovercraft Development Ltd. {{found the}} solution to this problem. Instead of using two separate rubber sheets to form the skirt, a single sheet of rubber was bent into a U shape to provide both sides, with slots cut {{into the bottom of the}} U forming the <b>annular</b> <b>vent.</b> When deforming pressure was applied to the outside of this design, air pressure in the rest of the skirt forced the inner wall to move in as well, keeping the channel open. Although there was some deformation of the curtain, the airflow within the skirt was maintained and the lift remained relatively steady. Over time, this design evolved into individual extensions over the bottom of the slots in the skirt, known as [...] "fingers".|$|E
40|$|A 30. 5 cm diameter, {{detonation}} driven {{shock tube}} facility has been designed, constructed and tested. The design {{goals of the}} shock tube were to reproduce free field blast wave profiles on a laboratory scale using atmospheric gaseous detonation as the energy source. Numerical simulations were utilized to explore the gas dynamic evolution inside detona-tion driven shock tubes and to select the optimal design parameters for the shock tube. The Friedlander profile {{was used to evaluate}} the generated pressure profiles as an ap-proximation of free field blast waves. It has been found that the detonation driver length should be kept below 20 % of the total length of the tube in order to produce Friedlander waves. Additionally, it has been found that an <b>annular</b> <b>vent</b> can be added to the shock tube to enhance the negative phase of the blast profile, more accurately reproducing real free field blast waves. The shock tube has been constructed in a modular fashion from 2. 54 cm thick steel tubing. An adjustable bag type diaphragm has been employed to allow for a variable driver size and a high voltage ignition system is used to initiate detonation in the driver section. Due to the available location for the shock tube, test...|$|E
40|$|Several {{factors may}} control the {{development}} of a silicic caldera during an eruption: here we match previous studies of caldera forming eruptions with analogue experiments to consider the role of the aspect ratio (thickness/width) of the magma chamber roof. These data suggest that large silicic caldera formation is controlled by: (1) the availability of magma; (2) initial explosive eruption through a conduit connecting the reservoir and the surface; (3) fast depressurization of the reservoir; and (4) chamber roof collapse, with newly-formed fractures connecting the reservoir with the surface and creation of a continuous ring conduit feeding <b>annular</b> <b>vents,</b> capable of sustaining the eruption. The occurrence of the latter condition may depend upon the aspect ratio of the chamber roof: lower ratios (1. 6) form incoherent collapse, which may hinder the continuation of the eruption after an initial partial emptying of the chamber. The aspect ratio of the chamber roof should therefore be considered as a further factor, capable of controlling the formation of large silicic calderas...|$|R
