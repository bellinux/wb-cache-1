2500|$|In {{order to}} give a better insight in [...] "the humours and actions in a case" [...] marshal draws {{the image of the}} [...] "Goat" [...] in Long Lane as a windmill, saying that its {{functioning}} depends on gaming houses, bawdy-houses, receivers and thief-takers the same way as windmill's on four sails. All four of them are regulated by the thief-taker of course. Besides denouncing him as a protector of coiners, prostitutes, etc. Hitchen coins the name of the thief-maker for Wild, used to refer to him by others later. Through a fictional character's eyes, that is some countryman, Hitchen tries to give a panoramic view of the [...] "Goat" [...] with old thieves, spies, suspicious women, Lemon himself sitting in the corner filling remorse for betrayal. This portrayal is considered somewhat clumsy alongside the insertion of [...] "proclamation", a parody of Wild's advertisements, {{in the middle of the}} pamphlet. Here, Wild proclaimed as [...] "His Skittish and Baboonish Majesty", assures the thieves of himself to be better equipped for subverting the course of justice and offers his legal protection and higher financial terms compared to those of their older [...] "locks, fences and flash pawnbrokers". Hitchen finishes his treatise with the list of [...] "flash cases" [...] and Wild's [...] "weekly pensioners". The list of convicts awaiting transportation under the [...] "Transportation Act"(introduced as an <b>alternative</b> <b>punishment</b> to hanging) enables dating of the pamphlet between June to August. As for the publishers, they were Warner and B. Boreham, publishing Wild's responding pamphlet in May.(p.102-104, Howson)Wild's [...] "Answer" [...] was written anonymously and polished most likely by a hack for two guineas. He refers mostly to the years 1713-1714 for he had personal experience of marshals adventures and could not resist the temptation to describe them, including the scene [...] "in a Sodomitish Academy". As other dealings are mentioned while reviewing their partnership, it is more interesting to describe the event when the under-marshal took his assistant, a buckle-maker as Wild refers to himself in his pamphlet, to a house near Old Bailey one night. The buckle-maker, having never met the types marshal was too willing to see, followed him and to his great surprise discovered men talking and behaving in effeminate way. No less surprising appeared marshal's reaction on being referred to as [...] "your Ladyship" [...] or [...] "Madam", even more, he [...] "dallied with the young sparks with a great deal of pleasure". However, no sooner had he seen those who might have exposed his [...] "power of securing the lads to himself", he flew into a rage and threatened to [...] "spoil their diversion". Later that night, marshal lurked with several constables near Mother Clap's House in Fleet street, Holborn, knowing that a masquerade would be held as usual and he would be able to catch several sodomites dressed in woman's apparel, which he did. Next morning detainees stood before the Lord Mayor and were committed to workhouse, but before were ordered to walk through the streets on the way in their bizarre look:"Some were completely rigg'd in gowns, petticoats, head cloths, fine lac'd shoes, furbelow scarves, and masks. Some had riding hoods; some were dressed like shepherdesses, others like milkmaids with fine green hats..." [...] etc. Some time later they were released after Hitchen's application to the Lord Mayor having been threatened by one of them for his previous adventures with them. The experience appeared too humiliating for one of them and in few days he died after the release. Wild completes the narrating with recommending the under-marshal and his expertise to anyone interested in [...] "Sodomitish Academy".|$|E

40|$|Globally, {{the turn}} of the 20 th and 21 st centuries has been a period of major reforms in {{criminal}} law which are connected with the effort to find new methods to deal with crime and to replace or at least complement some inflexible procedures in administration of criminal cases. More and more attention is being paid to alternative proceedings before the court and <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments</b> in criminal cases. The Czech Republic has not fallen behind in the developments. My work seeks to map the options of <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments,</b> with a focus on community service. My work also deals with the legal framework for punishments in form of community service in selected countries. I will also mention the institute of Probation and Mediation Service. The work also points to the prepared amendment to the Criminal Code in connection with community service punishments. The research in my work is divided into two parts. The first part is a quantitative survey of opinions of the general public and the other part is a qualitative survey of opinions of professionals, such as judges, policemen and officers of the Probation and Mediation Service. The main objective of the work is to learn about the general public attitudes to and awareness of application and implementation of <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments.</b> I tried to find out which punishments would be preferred by the general public. Another objective of this work has been to survey opinions of professionals in respect to application and implementation of <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments.</b> In the first survey three of my hypotheses have been confirmed and two have been disconfirmed. Based on results of the secod part of the survey I have devised three hypotheses. The results of my work have shown that although the general public has a certain level of awareness of the issue, the knowledge is very superficial. The general public has demonstrated a significant degree of tolerance and benevolence to persons with <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments.</b> Professionals mostly approve the existing legal framework for the <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments.</b> They find the definition of these punishments in the Criminal Code adequate and they believe that <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments</b> have been used sufficiently. The work will serve as a general overview of the issue...|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} called The <b>Alternative</b> <b>Punishments</b> in czech {{criminal}} law. I have chosen this topic as using {{alternative forms of}} sanctions alongside with traditional punishments {{is a product of}} the last decades in our legal order and remains very actual question untill now. The crime rate is constantly rating therefor it is necessary to react on it adequally with providing a wide range of sanctions. As one of the governing principles in czech criminal law is a principle of humanity the <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments</b> take a pricipal place in our legal order. The main purpose of my thesis is to analyse and clarify the particular forms of <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments.</b> Those sanctions bring a lot of advantages for convicted in contrary to other traditional punishments as they are not issolated from society and have a chance to re-educate themselves. The <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments</b> are useful and cheaper than short-term confinement. This thesis focuses on the analysis of the actual legislation, assesses changes brought by the new criminal code and defines proposals which would imporove the legislation in future. The thesis is composed of eight chapters. First chapter is subdivided into three parts.

40|$|Together {{with the}} reform of the {{criminal}} justice it was necessary to form a complex system of activities concerning the realization and effective usage of the introduced system of <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments</b> and deviations in criminal proceedings. On the basis of this requirement the institution of the Probation and Mediation Service (PMS) of the Czech Republic was established in 2001. The mission of the PMS is to create conditions for <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments</b> use {{in the course of the}} criminal proceedings and to ensure the effective execution of <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments.</b> For this purpose this service carries out the probation and mediation and participates in settlement of disputes between the accused and accusers and makes efforts to appease conflict situations and to restore the respect for rules of law. The integral part of the PMS mission is prevention and reducing the risk of the recurrence of criminal activity. The objective of the thesis is to examine the real public awareness of the Probation and Mediation Service of the Czech Republic, to give account of the lay public attitudes to the institution of <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments.</b> The thesis also studies opinions of <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments</b> in professionals who cooperate with the Probation and Mediation Service. Before the research the following hypotheses were stated: H I: The awareness of the lay public of the Probation and Mediation Service is low. Partial H I: The lay public gets information mostly through the television broadcasting. H II: The cooperation of professionals with the Probation and Mediation Service influences the attitude to <b>alternative</b> <b>punishments,</b> which become more acceptable to be imposed. To verify the hypotheses the quantitative research, the questionnaire method was used. I made up standardised questionnaires with a series of 15 questions. The first research set was composed of the lay public. 100 persons aged 20 { [...] } 60 years were chosen at random. The other research set comprised staff members of subjects cooperating with the Probation and Mediation Service of the Police of the Czech Republic, of local and municipal authorities, of the Employment Office, of the prison system. 50 persons were addressed on the whole. The results show that the H I as well as the partial H I, relating to the awareness of the lay public of the Probation and Mediation Service, were confirmed.

5000|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries {{criminal}} justice was severe, later termed the Bloody Code. This {{was due to}} both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution, (usually by hanging), and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals in England. With modifications to the traditional Benefit of clergy, which originally exempted only clergymen from civil law, it developed into a legal fiction by which many common offenders of [...] "clergyable" [...] offenses were extended the privilege to avoid execution. Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences, but {{under the rule of}} law, it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely. With the development of colonies, transportation was introduced as an <b>alternative</b> <b>punishment,</b> although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon, rather than a sentence in itself. Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands. A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported. Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king's mercy. It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system. There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies. In 1615, in the reign of James I, a committee of the Council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and, consequently, transportation to the colonies. Convicts were chosen carefully: the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners [...] "for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas".|$|E
5000|$|This case is {{an example}} of the {{potentially}} unjust outcomes that can result from mandatory death sentences. On 12 July 2001, Shukar Ali, a 14 year old boy who was convicted of sexually assaulting a 7 year old girl which resulted in her death. At the time, the summer of 1999, Ali lived with his mother and elder sister in the slums of western Bangladesh’s Manikganj District. He was not in a financial position to afford legal assistance , so he was appointed a defence lawyer by the State. This was not standard practice, however in this case was necessary because of the severity of the punishment that Ali would face if found guilty. Ali was sentenced by the High Court Division to death by hanging under section 6 of an earlier version of the Women and Children Repressive Prevention Act, 1995. The court compelled they were compelled to make this decision regardless of his age. The court held [...] "no <b>alternative</b> <b>punishment</b> has been provided for the offence that the condemned prisoner has been charged and we are left with no other discretion but to maintain the sentence if we believe that the prosecution has been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt. This is a case, which may be taken as [...] "hard cases make bad laws".On appeal, the Appellate Division commuted Ali's death sentence to life imprisonment for [...] "until natural death". This was the first time the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has ever overturned a decision. The criminal law in Bangladesh has advanced significantly since Ali was first imprisoned. A law was introduced prohibiting the death penalty and life imprisonment for children. However, children are still held to be criminally responsible at the age of nine.|$|E
