I would like to express my genuine gratitude to each of them, although {{it would be impossible}} for me to name all. First of all, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor, Dr. Harish Sethu, for his tremen-dous time and effort spent in leading, supporting and encouraging me during the last five years. His passion for challenges has given me inspiration; his knowledge of engineering has given me guidance; his perseverance in research has given me confidence. Without his help and effort, it would be impossible for me to even get close to this point. I am also grateful to him for being not only a mentor in my professional life but also a friend in my personal life...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the diverse}} fabric of masculinities that prestigious authors such as Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Tirso de Molina and Agustin Moreto weave into their plots, fashion {{proves to be}} a common thread and a {{particularly}} useful tool. Thus, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> idea of "Fashionable Masculinities" and investigate a few "macho" and/or not so "macho men" in Early Modern drama I hope {{to go beyond the}} traditional interpretations, stereotypes and icons often associated with men [...] -in particular, Spanish men in Golden Age drama. This will be achieved by revisiting typical cases and compared through research and documentation of atypical representations of maleness that could be considered displacements and/or subversions of the social matrix. In effect, this study explores how the male ideal is shaped and judged both by the essence of his personality, as well as his physical appearance (i. e. : clothing, hairstyle, mannerisms, discourse and voice). As such, it becomes evident that masculinity is moulded, influenced, enhanced, exaggerated and even muted as it is subject to the whim of different fashions prevalent at a specific moment in time. Moreover, a multitude of social, cultural, racial and historical factors determine the always changing image of the so called "macho man". Therefore, in order to explore distinct representations of masculinity <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> three different comedias by three different playwrights while comparing how the main character's masculinity fared in three very important spaces: physical, social and sexual. I focus my attention on Saber del mal y del bien by Calderon. Secondly, Don Gil de las calzas verdes by Tirso and explored El lindo don Diego by Moreto. Each one the these represents a different degree of palatable male identities given this particular social construct...|$|R

40|$|The American {{print media}} are a {{powerful}} mechanism for communicating information about places and environment to the American public. When {{it comes to}} a landscape such as the Great Plains, experienced by many Americans as either sleep-through land in a car or flyover land in a plane, the print media may be their only real source of information about this landscape, excluding 30 second soundbites which occasionally appear in electronic media. Often perceived as monotonous or dull, the Plains has been overlaid with powerful images, of garden or desert, of Dust Bowl or Buffalo Commons. But recent media coverage of the Plains struck me, an American Great Plains scholar, as not just negative but morbid. I began working on Great Plains issues almost twenty years ago. As I 2 ̆ 7 ve explored the Plains, I 2 ̆ 7 ve become 2 ̆ 2 Plains sensitive 2 ̆ 2 : my ears prick up when something about the Plains is in the air. My position is one of a Great Plainsperson and 2 ̆ 2 pro-Plains. 2 ̆ 2 I have now lived the majority of my life on {{the eastern edge of the}} Plains (in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and in Omaha, Nebraska). I have spent my academic life engaged in Great Plains research, with my master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis and my PhD dissertation on Plains topics.

40|$|The {{title of}} my thesis {{stems from a}} line in the hit musical The Producers. While this musical depicts the lives of Broadway {{producers}} in a glamorous and comedic way. I wanted to find out what exactly a producer does. As a theatre major, I have been fortunate to learn about many aspects of theatre. However, producing was something that I found interesting, but still did not know much about <b>as</b> <b>I</b> began <b>approaching</b> <b>the</b> end of my college career. As a stage manager, I find it important to know about all aspects of theatre so I can communicate with people in varying positions easily. It was this desire that led me on this journey to produce a performance. In the simplest terms, a producer chooses a script that they want to produce, they find a director, they collect money from investors, they find a location, they help p cast the show, and they supervise the production to make sure that things are progressing the way that they should be (Conte and Langley 11). The men in The Producers follow all of these steps, and with a couple minor alterations, so did 1. This process led to the production of An Afternoon of-isms, which was performed on April 19, 2014.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{questions of}} the continued significance of national cinemas and identities, focussing {{on the case of}} Scottish cinema. As a small, devolved nation with relative autonomy from the United Kingdom, Scotland presents an interesting case for how films are labelled with a national identity, as Scottish films can also often be understood in a British, European, and even global context. Rather than attempting to construct a working model of Scottish cinema based on representation or production context, I ask how films have been constructed <b>as</b> Scottish. <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> concepts of Scotland and Scottish film as sets of meanings that are subject to change over time and in different contexts. This facilitates a perspective which asks in what ways Scotland and Scottishness is constructed in film. I examine how multiple identities are balanced in the filmic construction of Scotland first by considering how Scottish films—both those made in and which are about Scotland—from the early 1980 s to the present construct Scottish identities. I will consider the way these films explored ‘traditional’ Scottish identities in the 1980 s, Scottish masculinity in the 1990 s, and Scottish identities based on ethnicity and gender in the 2000 s and 2010 s. Second, I look at how these films are received as Scottish by examining reviews and other press materials to determine how the Scottishness of the films considered is discursively constructed for potential audiences...|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} delayed at a case, {{and it was}} a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright {{semicircle}} which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes' room.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} that a {{decoration}} of yew trees circled the garden. At the end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge. On {{the other side of}} this hedge, concealed from the eyes of anyone approaching from the direction of the house, there was a stone seat. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> building, soft strains {{floating}} far {{out into}} the night-air became audible, and I knew that the sweet spirit of music, {{to which they were}} all so devoted, was present with them. After listening for awhile {{in the shadow of the}} portico I went in, and, anxious to avoid disturbing the singers, stole away into a dusky corner, where I sat down by myself. Yoletta had, however, seen me enter, for presently she came to me.|$|E
5000|$|The pair next stopped {{briefly at}} the Great Divide in the Rocky Mountains before {{continuing}} on to Seattle. Steinbeck reflected on seeing the Columbia River and how the American explorers Lewis and Clark must have felt when they came west for the first time. He noted the changes the West Coast had undergone in the last 20 years (p. 180): [...] "It was only <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> Seattle that <b>the</b> unbelievable change became apparent... I wonder why progress looks so much like destruction." [...] (181) Steinbeck then drove down the Pacific Coast through Oregon and California. On the way, Rocinante, Steinbeck's overloaded truck, had a flat tire {{and he had to}} change it in a rainstorm. In Steinbeck's retelling of the event, he wrote, [...] "It was obvious that the other tire might go at any minute, and it was Sunday and it was raining and it was Oregon." [...] (185) Though the specialized tires were hard to come by, the problem was resolved in mere hours by the unexpected generosity of a gas station attendant.|$|R
6000|$|I did not {{immediately}} fix a date for my departure, for {{it was necessary for}} me to consider my grandmother's feelings and welfare, and arrange to make her as happy <b>as</b> possible while <b>I</b> should be gone. In the mean time, it was of course necessary that I should take air and exercise; and while doing this one morning in a pretty lane, just out of the village, a figure in the House of Martha gray came into sight a little distance ahead of me. Her back was toward me, and she was walking slower than I was. [...] "Now, then," [...] thought I, [...] "here is a proof of the awkwardness of my position here. Even in a little walk like this, I must run up against one of those sisters. I must pass her, or turn around and go back, for I shall not slow up, and appear to be dogging her footsteps. But I shall not turn back,--that does not suit me." [...] Consequently I walked on, and soon overtook the woman in gray. She did not turn her head <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>approached,</b> for <b>the</b> sisters are taught not to turn their heads to look at people. After all, it would be easy enough for me to adopt the same rule, and to pass her without turning my head, or paying the slightest attention to her. This was the manner indeed in which the general public was expected to act toward the inmates of the House of Martha when met outside their institution.|$|R
40|$|Originally I {{looked to}} curatorial {{practices}} {{to investigate the}} theme of 2 ̆ 7 word and image 2 ̆ 7 due to the interplay of words such as wall texts, brochures, catalogues and promotional cards {{in conjunction with the}} art <b>as</b> image. When <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> research <b>I</b> began to see these various texts as a framing device, or filter, for the work. My research into curatorial practices in contemporary art examines the field 2 ̆ 7 s historical growth and present condition. If in this talk the explicit relationship between words and images seems lost, it is not lost, but rather embedded into the intrinsic nature of exhibition. A viewer utilizes texts to narrate an exhibit, those texts are manifestations of the curator 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts and intentions for the show, and these intentions are formed by a theoretical foundation. My interests grew from the microcosm of text and image relations to the larger history and condition of exhibiting contemporary art and the curatorial profession. A curator can speak personally about his or her own views of how to set up a show, but when exhibiting art is considered generally and historically, many issues come into play. Most important are issues of the art market, the institutional system, the power of the curatorial voice, and the capacity the exhibition has to echo a cultural current...|$|R
