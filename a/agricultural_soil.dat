5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 is almost entirely <b>agricultural.</b> <b>Soil</b> conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E

But the rapid loss in the area of arable soils appears to be economically meaningless because EU is perceived to be dependent on internal food supply anymore. During the period 2000–2006 the European Union lost 0.27% of its cropland and 0.26% of its crop productive potential. The loss of agricultural land during the same time was the highest in the Netherlands, which lost 1.57% of its crop production potential within six years.

40|$|Abstract A culture-independent {{survey of}} fungal diver-sity in four arable soils and one {{grassland}} in Lower Austria {{was conducted by}} RFLP and sequence analysis of clone libraries of the partial ITS/LSU-region. All soils were dominated by the ascomycetous orders Sordariales, Hypocreales and Helotiales, taxa that are known from traditional cultivation approaches to occur in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soils.</b> The most abundant genus in the investigated soils was Tetracladium, a hyphomycete which {{has been described as}} occurring predominantly in aquatic habitats, but was also found in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soils.</b> Additionally, soil clone group I (SCGI), a subphylum {{at the base of the}} Ascomycota with so far no cultivated members, was identified at high frequency in the grassland soil but was below detection limit in the four arable fields. In addition to this striking difference, general fungal community parameters like richness, diversity and evenness were similar between cropland and grassland soils.

500|$|There {{are three}} {{persistent}} sandbars in the Camel estuary: the Doom Bar; the Town Bar at Padstow, about [...] upstream; and the Halwyn Bank just upstream of Padstow, where the estuary changes direction. All three are of similar composition; {{a large proportion}} of their sediment is derived from marine mollusc shells, and as a consequence it includes a high level of calcium carbonate, measured in 1982 at 62 per cent. The high calcium carbonate content of the sand has meant that it has been used for hundreds of years to improve <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> by liming. This use is known to date back to before 1600. High calcium carbonate levels combined with natural sea salt made the sand valuable to farmers as an alkaline fertiliser when mixed with manure.|$|E

In the 12th century it would have {{typically}} have been reached by boat, through a channel in the marshy Babingley River that ran nearby. Following the Norman conquest of England, the land had been granted to Bishop Odo, the Earl of Kent, who may have used it as an administrative centre; there were many Saxo-Norman buildings {{on the site of}} the later castle. Although Norfolk was a prosperous region during this period, the location of the castle was not strategically important: its only militarily significance would have been as a regional muster point, and the surrounding lands were thinly populated, with poor, acidic <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil.</b> The attraction of the site to William is believed to have been that it was a relatively cheap and easy place in which to build a substantial new building and establish a large hunting park.

40|$|Although fungi {{contribute}} significantly to the microbial biomass in terrestrial ecosystems, {{little is known about}} their contribution to biogeochemical nitrogen cycles. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>soils</b> usually contain comparably high amounts of inorganic nitrogen, mainly in the form of nitrate. Many studies focused on bacterial and archaeal turnover of nitrate by nitrification, denitrification and assimilation, whereas the fungal role remained largely neglected. To enable research on the fungal contribution to the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle tools for monitoring the presence and expression of fungal assimilatory nitrate reductase genes were developed. To the ∼ 100 currently available fungal full-length gene sequences, another 109 partial sequences were added by amplification from individual culture isolates, representing all major orders occurring in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soils.</b> The extended database led to the discovery of new horizontal gene transfer events within the fungal kingdom. The newly developed PCR primers were used to study gene pools and gene expression of fungal nitrate reductases in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soils.</b> The availability of the extended database allowed affiliation of many sequences to known species, genera or families.

2500|$|Slovakia lost 41% of its <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil,</b> which {{produced}} approximately 80% of products required for food supply. This was a notable loss for Slovakia, {{but was not}} of clear benefit for Hungary. Due to existing problems with overproduction, annexation caused problems both for local farmers and for the economic policy of Hungary. Only half of Southern Slovakia's 400,000 tons of wheat production was used locally, and the second half had no consumers. The border between the annexed territory and Hungary proper was closed during the military administration, so distribution in this direction was impossible. The situation improved only partially during the civilian administration, when grain and livestock prices remained low. The Hungarian government tried to improve the situation by state intervention purchases, but this failed to resolve the long-term implications of the overproduction. Prices of agricultural goods decreased by 20–30%. Existing cartels in Hungary had limited possibilities to grow the most profitable crops. [...] This resulted in The Economic Association of Nitra County demanding the right [...] "to grow sugar-beet under the same conditions as during Czech rule"; the request was refused.
