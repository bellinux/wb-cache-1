5|$|Legendary {{stories of}} pig-faced women {{originated}} roughly simultaneously in Holland, England and France {{in the late}} 1630s. The stories told of a wealthy woman whose body was of normal human appearance, but whose face was that of <b>a</b> <b>pig.</b>|$|E
5|$|Series 3 {{began on}} 23 September 1995. The {{computer}} game for this series was called Snuffle the Truffles and involved viewers guiding <b>a</b> <b>pig</b> character around a pigpen eating truffles, whilst Trev and Simon invited two guests to review videos in the Video Galleon.|$|E
5|$|Gil Grissom has a {{more than}} passing {{similarity}} to Sherlock Holmes. Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little regard for societal norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} to illustrate a theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing <b>a</b> <b>pig</b> in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with a harpoon.|$|E

A new image of Alice was also released. In July, new photos emerged of Alice holding a white rabbit, the Mad Hatter with a hare, the Red Queen holding <b>a</b> <b>pig,</b> and the White Queen with a mouse.|$|E
5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a touch. Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of <b>a</b> <b>pig,</b> while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E

5|$|Pigs are {{not one of}} {{the main}} forms of {{livestock}} on Welsh farms though there are some specialised units. They used to be kept in small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept <b>a</b> <b>pig</b> in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{intended}} to follow Mrs. Tittlemouse with a tale about <b>a</b> <b>pig</b> {{in a large}} format book similar to the original Ginger and Pickles. On one occasion, she passed an hour sketching inside the pig sty at Hill Top while the pig nibbled at her boots. She abandoned the pig book after fruitless attempts to make progress on it, and, instead, occupied the winter of 191011 with supervising the production of Peter Rabbit's Painting Book, and the composition of The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes.|$|E

5|$|The head {{is small}} {{relative}} to the large body, and quite distinctive in shape, being flat and blunt at the front, like the snout of <b>a</b> <b>pig.</b> Some teeth are chisel-shaped, small and leaf-like, indicating a probable herbivorous diet, although peg-like teeth and a keratinous snout have been considered possible adaptations in some species for feeding on colonial insects. A study of the braincase of Stagonolepis robertsoni has shown that there are similarities between it and those of crocodylomorphs, which may indicate a close relationship.|$|E
5|$|While {{stories of}} pig-faced women vary in detail, {{they have the}} same basic form. A {{pregnant}} noblewoman would be approached by a beggar accompanied by her children, and would dismiss the beggar, and in so doing would in some way compare the beggar's children to pigs. The beggar would curse the pregnant noblewoman, and come the birth of the child it would be a girl, healthy and perfectly formed in every respect other than having the face of <b>a</b> <b>pig.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Miss Williams {{from nearby}} Borley Lodge said {{she saw the}} figure of the ghostly nun in the upstairs window and, {{according}} to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of <b>a</b> <b>pig.</b>|$|E

5|$|Animals is {{the tenth}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. It {{is a concept}} album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late-1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, <b>a</b> <b>pig</b> floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently <b>a</b> <b>pig</b> and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E
5|$|Horse meat {{has been}} used as food for humans and {{carnivorous}} animals throughout the ages. It is eaten {{in many parts of the}} world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather {{has been used}} for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of <b>a</b> (<b>pig)</b> ham as it cures. In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Pink Floyd {{bought a}} three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began {{converting}} the building into {{a recording studio}} and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing {{an image of the}} ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of <b>a</b> <b>pig.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} years, the Oval {{was used}} to host {{the final of the}} Irish Cup as one of Northern Ireland's biggest stadiums along with Windsor Park, with the location of the final often being decided on a coin toss. During the 1985 Irish Cup final, Glentoran supporters released a cockerel and <b>a</b> <b>pig</b> that had been painted blue onto the pitch to antagonize Linfield supporters. The Oval {{was used to}} host the final of the County Antrim Shield in 2012. The Oval has also been used to host the Setanta Cup final. It hosted the 2012 final between Belfast's Crusaders representing the IFA Premiership, and County Londonderry based Derry City, representing the League of Ireland.|$|E

A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson. The Jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by {{the hand of a}} hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for <b>a</b> <b>pig,</b> Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna great pain and then his death.|$|E
