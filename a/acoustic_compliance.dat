This system {{is more efficient}} than ordinary stirling engine because does not use a moving piston[7]. The engine uses thermal power to generate acoustic power. It consists mainly of three parts: a thermodynamic part consisting of a stack, two heat exchangers, and a thermal buffer tube; an acoustic network consisting of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>compliance</b> and an inertance; and a resonator. When thermodynamic part heated, it will generate sounds. The sounds will flow along cylinder tube. Some aspects can be analiyzed to determine performance of tharmoacoustic-standing wave. The effect of temperature difference, stack geometry, stack position determine performance of the thermoacoustic-standing wave. Some research show that acoustic power will increase with increasing of temperature at hot heat exchanger. And optimal position and geometry of stack will generated optimal acoustic power...|$|E

40|$|Anisotropic cloak shells can be {{used for}} the spatial {{transformation}} of a space to alter the propagation of acoustic waves by redirecting them along a pre-determined path. This paper outlines the design, fabrication, and experimental analysis of a circular acoustic cloak shell made of meta-composite material for in-air applications. Based on the three-dimensional coordinate transformation, we first designed an anisotropic circle meta-composite cloak shell according to its impedance values. The cloak shell comprises various layered structures with cavities and tubes, respectively, providing <b>acoustic</b> mass and <b>compliance</b> for the provision of anisotropic material properties. Secondly, we conducted numerical and experimental analyses under practice working conditions to demonstrate the efficacy of the acoustic cloak. The structure of the cloak shell, fabricated by three-dimensional printing (3 D printing), is experimentally evaluated in a semi-anechoic room with a free-field environment. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the acoustic cloaking effects in the scattering far field. Besides the scattering field, the sound field measurement results obtained with the region enclosed by the shell also shows the abilities of the cloak shell in altering the direction of wave propagation along a pre-determined path in air...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the energy pumping {{phenomenon}} for acoustical applications. The concept of energy pumping is to passively reduce the vibrations of a primary system by attaching to it an essentially nonlinear damped oscillator also named Non-linear Energy Sink (NES) creating a strongly nonlinear coupling which localizes and dissipates the vibrational energy. In the con-text of acoustics, a vibroacoustic coupling is used. In an earlier work, we showed experimentally that a loudspeaker used as a Suspended Piston (SP) working outside its range of linearity {{can be used as}} a NES. In this work, the performance and efficiency of a SP NES is studied numerically and experimentally. The con-sidered acoustic medium is a resonant pipe. The coupling be-tween the pipe and the NES is ensured acoustically by a small <b>acoustic</b> <b>compliance</b> (the air in a coupling box). Various observed aspects of energy pumping are presented: behavior under sinu-soidal forcing, pumping threshold, resonance capture and tran-sient response. As a SP NES technology permits an easy control of the moving mass of the NES, the effect of this parameter is also studied...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acoustic source {{with a small}} thickness and high bending stiffness. The high bending stiffness is obtained with a sandwich structure in which {{the face of the}} sandwich structure internal to the source is perforated to increase the <b>acoustic</b> <b>compliance,</b> thereby leading to increased electroacoustic conversion efficiency. Multiple actuators are used to drive the moving component of the acoustic source. Control of the acoustic resonances and structural resonances is required to obtain an even frequency response. The use of collocated decentralized feedback control based on velocity sensing was found to be ineffective for controlling these resonances due to the destabilizing asymmetric modes caused by the coupling of the internal acoustic cavity and the rigid body vibration of the moving component. Resonances can be controlled by a set of independent combinations of symmetric driving patterns with corresponding velocity feedback controllers such that the fundamental mass-air resonance is effectively controlled, as is the lowest bending mode of the moving component. Finally, a compensation scheme for low frequencies is used which enables a flat frequency response in the range of 30 [*]Hz to 1 [*]kHz with deviations smaller than 3 [*]dB...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{boundary}} layer separation control {{has been developed}} that is a derivative of the synthetic jet concept (being used primarily for virtual shape control) which converts acoustic oscillations into mean fluid motions. The new concept, the so-called “directed synthetic jet”, has an acoustically excited neck like the synthetic jet, however the neck is curved in the downstream tangential direction. In this manner, the boundary layer flowing over the neck or slot is energized via suction removal of the approaching low momentum fluid on the in-stroke and tangential blowing of high momentum on the out-stroke, thereby making it in the time average more resistant to separation. The concept has been demonstrated to be energy efficient comparing input power to system benefit, yielding a net power gain and also potent enough to completely suppress boundary layer separation. An electro-acoustic model is presented which describes the actuator characteristics and enables realistic application analysis.

40|$|Thermoacoustic {{systems can}} either {{generate}} acoustic work (i. e., p-v work) from thermal energy, or consume acoustic work to transfer heat from low to high temperature sources. They are the so-called thermoacoustic prime movers or heat pumps, essentially {{acting as the}} acoustical equivalents of Stirling engines or coolers. If a travelling sound wave propagates through a regenerator with a positive temperature gradient along the direction of sound wave propagation, the gas parcels experience a Stirling-like thermodynamic cycle. As such, thermal energy {{can be converted to}} acoustic power. Similar to Stirling engines and thermo-fluidic oscillators, thermoacoustic engines can be externally heated with various heat sources and are capable of utilising low-grade thermal energy such as industrial waste heat and solar thermal energy. Both the simplicity, and even the absence of moving parts of thermoacoustic engines demonstrate that they have the potential for developing low-cost power generators therefore, they have attracted significant research effort for developing coolers or electric generators. The target design principle of a thermoacoustic engine is to maximise acoustic power production within the thermoacoustic core whilst minimising the acoustic losses in the resonator. One of the main issues with current thermoacoustic systems is low efficiency, which is largely attributed to acoustic losses in the resonator and the regenerator. There would be {{a significant impact on the}} thermoacoustic field if a suitable travelling wave resonator were developed with the least losses. Despite the different engine configurations for developing these engines, they all work on the same thermodynamic principle, i. e., the Stirling cycle. In this study, the first issue is resolved by employing a by-pass configuration, and the second is addressed by using a side-branched volume technique. The current study focuses on the investigation of looped-tube travelling-wave thermoacoustic engines with a by-pass pipe. The novelty of such a by-pass configuration is that the by-pass and feedback pipes actually create a pure travelling wave resonator. The engine unit extracts a small amount of acoustic work from the resonator, amplifies it and sends it back to it. As the pure travelling wave resonator has very low losses, it requires very little acoustic power to sustain an acoustic resonance. This idea is analogous to children playing on swings, where a small push could sustain the swinging for a long time. The present research demonstrates that travelling wave thermoacoustic engines with such a by-pass configuration can achieve comparable performances with other types of travelling wave thermoacoustic engines which have been intensively researched. According to the results, this type of engine essentially operates on the same thermodynamic principle as other travelling wave thermoacoustic engines, differing only in the design of the acoustic resonator. The looped-tube travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine with a by-pass pipe was then implemented in the design of an engine with a much longer regenerator and higher mean pressure to increase its power density. A thermoacoustic cooler was also coupled to the engine to utilise its acoustic power, allowing evaluation of thermal efficiency. A linear alternator has also been coupled to the tested engine to develop an electric generator. This research additionally addresses the effect of a side-branched Helmholtz resonator to tune the phase in looped- tube travelling wave thermoacoustic engine. This action is performed in order to obtain the correct time-phasing between the acoustic velocity and pressure oscillations within the regenerator, to force gas parcels to execute a Stirling-like thermodynamic cycle, so that thermal energy can be converted to mechanical work (i. e., high-intensity pressure waves). By changing its volume one can change the acoustic impedance at the opening of the Helmholtz resonator, and thus adjust the acoustic field within the loop-tubed engine. It can essentially shunt away part of the volumetric velocity at the low impedance region of the engine, so that the acoustic loss can be reduced within the engine. Both the simulations and the experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed side-branched volume can effectively adjust the acoustic field within the looped-tube engine and affect its performance. There is an optimal <b>acoustic</b> <b>compliance</b> corresponding to the best performance in terms of acoustic power output and energy efficiency when the heating power input is fixed...|$|E
