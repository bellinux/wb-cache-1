5|$|Arrested and exposed, Sideshow Bob confesses that {{he hated}} Krusty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> he framed Krusty {{was because he}} spent years {{constantly}} being {{on the receiving end}} of the clown's humiliating gags. He vows revenge on Bart, setting up a regular plotline in future episodes. The charges against Krusty are dropped and he regains the trust of the community. Homer then apologizes to Krusty for fingering him in court, and Krusty thanks Bart for standing up for the truth and sticking to his convictions, and a picture is taken of the two shaking hands (which Bart later hangs in his bedroom, refilled with Krusty decor).|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer (2000), on {{the other}} hand, reacts against this {{commonly}} held view and comments {{that the vast majority}} of the runestones were raised in memory of people who are not reported to have died abroad. She argues that few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is that the runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.|$|E
5|$|The character's focal storyline {{involved}} {{a romantic relationship}} with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). She sustained life-threatening injuries after an aviation accident, in the eighth-season finale, which ultimately ended in her death. The character's death resulted in mixed critical feedback <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> given for the departure was Leigh's desire {{to spend more time}} with her family. Rhimes has characterized Lexie as being a dork, as well as having issues with saying how she feels. Leigh has been moderately well received by critics, and was among the cast to receive a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The story {{focuses on}} Class Zero, {{a group of}} {{fourteen}} students from the Vermillion Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. When the Militesi Empire launches {{an assault on the}} other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized for the defense of Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other Final Fantasy titles.|$|E

5|$|Ventus was {{designed}} by director Tetsuya Nomura who {{wanted to create a}} character with an important connection with the series' main character Sora. Ventus bears a strong resemblance to the character of Roxas, both of whom are voiced by Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English. After Ventus' first cameo, Nomura had to state that both of them are different characters, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for such connection would be revealed in Birth by Sleep. Video game websites also commented on Ventus' first appearance, initially confusing him for Roxas during the development of Birth by Sleep, but has since been well received.|$|E
5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for its designation as an SSSI {{is the presence of}} a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well– Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E
5|$|The entire {{second floor}} houses the library. It {{contains}} the scriptures of Gyetengpa, Doduipa, Mamtha, Kangyur, Tengyur and Zungdui, {{which have been}} affected due to insect attacks. The collection in the library consists of two printed books of Tengyur (in 25 volumes), which are commentaries on Buddhist teachings; three sets of Kangyur, the translated version of the canons of Buddhist teachings; and Chanjia Sangbhums in five volumes. Of the three sets of Kangyur, two are handwritten and one is printed. The printed sets are in 101 volumes. One handwritten set has 131 volumes and the other 125 volumes; the letters of these 125 books are washed in gold. The religious text, Gyentongpa, has letters washed in gold in all its pages. At some stage, some of the sacred scriptures were lost <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> was attributed to the monks of the Tsona monastery who used to visit Tawang during winter time. In the past, these monks had demanded that the gilded image of the Buddha be gifted to them. This was not accepted by the Lamas of the Tawang Monastery and as result the Tsona Lamas refused to part {{with some of the}} sacred texts and records of the Tawang Monastery which were with them. They again took away more books in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Ten years later, Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) {{returns home}} from {{boarding}} school and accidentally overhears a conversation from his grandmothers (Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth) concerned Rahul's adoption <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why Rahul left home, whereupon Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, {{and her younger}} sister Pooja (with whom he shared a playful relationship during his childhood) moved to London, and tells his parents that he wishes to pursue further studies in London. Yash is skeptical at first, but once Rohan emphasizes that he is following the family traditions, his parents agree to let him go. In London, Rahul and Anjali now have their own son, Krish. Pooja (Kareena Kapoor), now a popular fashion-obsessed diva, is a student at King's College London, where Rohan enrolls. He and Pooja meet again and he tells her that {{he has come to}} London to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Pooja tells Rahul that Rohan is her friend's brother who currently has nowhere to stay. After some persuasion, Rahul agrees to let Rohan stay as Rohan uses the name 'Yash' to hide his real identity. Right before the family attends Krish's school functin, Sayeeda and Anjali find out his real identity, though they promise to keep quiet. At Krish's school function, Krish leads his class in singing Jana Gana Mana (Indian national anthem), and later recites advice which Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this advice ten years ago, now realizes that Rohan is his brother.|$|E

25|$|Gay, Straight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reason</b> Why: The Science of Sexual Orientation (2010; {{second edition}} 2016) {{is a book}} about the {{development}} of sexual orientation by the neuroscientist Simon LeVay, in which the author argues that sexual orientation is an aspect of gender that emerges from the prenatal sexual differentiation of the brain, and criticizes Freudian and behaviorist explanations of sexual orientation. Gay, Straight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reason</b> Why received numerous positive reviews, praising it for LeVay's wide-ranging overview of scientific research on sexual orientation, but the book also received some mixed or negative reviews, criticizing it on grounds such as LeVay's willingness to rely on studies with inadequate sample sizes. In 2012, Gay, Straight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reason</b> Why received the Bullough Book Award for the most distinguished book written for the professional sexological community published in a given year.|$|E
