500|$|Berkman {{was deeply}} {{interested}} in the debate concerning his action. He was almost heartbroken by the rebuke from Most, who had [...] "preached propaganda by deed all his life—now he repudiates the first <b>attentat</b> in this country". He was encouraged by the words of Kropotkin, who wrote that [...] "Berkman {{has done more to}} spread the anarchist idea among the masses who do not read our papers than all the writings that we may publish. He has shown that there are among the anarchists, men capable of being revolted by the crimes of capitalism to the point of giving their life {{to put an end to}} these crimes, or at least to open a way to such an end." ...|$|E
500|$|Scandinavian punk was {{propelled}} {{early on}} by tour dates by bands {{such as the}} Clash and the Ramones (both in Stockholm in May 1977), and the Sex Pistols' tour through Denmark, Sweden and Norway in July the same year. The band Briard jump-started Finnish punk with its November 1977 single [...] "I Really Hate Ya"/"I Want Ya Back"; other early Finnish punk acts included Eppu Normaali and singer Pelle Miljoona. The first Swedish punk single was [...] "Vårdad klädsel"/"Förbjudna ljud" [...] released by Kriminella Gitarrer in February 1978, which started an extensive Swedish punk scene featuring act such as Ebba Grön, KSMB, Rude Kids, Besökarna, Liket Lever, Garbochock, <b>Attentat,</b> and many others. Within a couple of years, hundreds of punk singles were released in Sweden.|$|E
500|$|Most of the anarchists in Pittsburgh were {{questioned}} by police. Bauer and Nold {{were arrested and}} charged with complicity in Berkman's plot. Everywhere, anarchists took sides for or against Berkman and his <b>attentat.</b> The autonomists supported him, as did many anarchists across the country. Peukert spoke out in his defense. Also defending Berkman was Dyer Lum, an anarchist who had been a comrade of the Haymarket defendants, and Lucy Parsons. Among those who criticized Berkman were Jo Labadie, Benjamin Tucker, and many other anarchists who believed the anarchist struggle should be peaceful. Berkman's most prominent critic was Most, who belittled Berkman as a nuisance or a flunky hired by Frick himself to garner sympathy. Most published an article in his newspaper titled [...] "Reflections on Attentats" [...] in which he wrote that propaganda of the deed was doomed to be misunderstood in the U.S. and that it could only backfire. Most wrote that Berkman's action had proven this; while Berkman may have demonstrated a certain heroism, in all other respects his attempt was a [...] "total failure".|$|E

500|$|On July 23, Berkman gained {{access to}} Frick's office with a {{concealed}} handgun and shot Frick three times, then stabbed him in the leg. A group of workers—far from joining in his attentat—beat Berkman unconscious, and he was carried away by the police. Berkman was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman suffered during his long absence. [...] Convinced Goldman {{was involved in the}} plot, police raided her apartment and—finding no evidence—pressured her landlord into evicting her. Worse, the <b>attentat</b> had failed to rouse the masses: workers and anarchists alike condemned Berkman's action. Johann Most, their former mentor, lashed out at Berkman and the assassination attempt. Furious at these attacks, Goldman brought a toy horsewhip to a public lecture and demanded, onstage, that Most explain his betrayal. He dismissed her, whereupon she struck him with the whip, broke it on her knee, and hurled the pieces at him. She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend: [...] "At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1969, Peter Hoffmann, a Canadian {{historian}} of German descent, {{published a book}} with the title [...] "Widerstand, Staatsstreich, <b>Attentat</b> — Der Kampf der Opposition gegen Hitler" [...] This work lists Strachwitz as {{being part of the}} German military resistance to Nazism. With Generals Hubert Lanz, Hans Speidel and [...] he is shown as being associated with [...] "Plan Lanz", as testified by General der Gebirgstruppe Hubert Lanz. According to Lanz, the plan was to arrest or kill Hitler in early February 1943 during Hitler's scheduled [...] visit to Armeeabteilung Lanz. In his account, Strachwitz's role was to surround Hitler and his escorts shortly after Hitler's arrival with his tanks. Lanz stated that he would have then arrested Hitler, and in the event of resistance, Strachwitz's tanks would have shot and killed the entire delegation. Hitler cancelled the visit and the plan was dropped. Author Röll casts doubt on this account citing that Strachwitz's cousin, Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, who attempted to assassinate Hitler in 1943, had recounted that Strachwitz had expressed the belief to him several times that killing Hitler would have constituted murder. Röll concludes that Strachwitz was too much a Prussian officer to consider assassinating Hitler.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by Most's {{theories}} of <b>Attentat,</b> Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, enraged by {{the deaths of}} workers during the Homestead strike, put words into action with Berkman's attempted assassination of Homestead factory manager Henry Clay Frick in 1892. Berkman and Goldman were soon disillusioned as Most became one of Berkman's most outspoken critics. In Freiheit, Most attacked both Goldman and Berkman, implying Berkman's act was designed to arouse sympathy for Frick. Goldman's biographer Alice Wexler suggests that Most's criticisms may {{have been inspired by}} jealousy of Berkman. Goldman was enraged, and demanded that Most prove his insinuations. When he refused to respond, she confronted him at next lecture. After he refused to speak to her, she lashed him across the face with a horsewhip, broke the whip over her knee, then threw the pieces at him. She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend, [...] "At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason." ...|$|E
