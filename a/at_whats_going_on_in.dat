When all’s said and done, whether you support or disavow the current administration and what it’s done with its time in office, does this commentary work here? Sure it does... We {{need to be able}} to laugh <b>at</b> <b>what’s</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the world, regardless of whether we agree or disagree, but S.H.I.E.L.D. has managed to throw in some biting commentary this season." ...|$|R

It depends on who's in power." [...] The ability {{to adapt to a}} constantly changing world keeps GNP's revues up to the minute in content. For example: [...] "The LA situation cannot be ignored. Right now, right here, the entire focus of a political debate has shifted.

5000|$|The {{antidote}} to both elation and laxity is awareness. We {{have to look}} <b>at</b> <b>what's</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in our mind. Once awareness has told {{us that we are}} too loose or too tight, we {{have to learn how to}} adjust. If the obstacle is elation, we might try relaxing the technique, giving it a bit more room. We could give our outbreath more focus then our inbreath so that the mind has more freedom. ... If the obstacle is laxity, we need to tighten up our practice. We can bring more of our mind to the breathing overall. We could focus on the inbreath. We can stabilize our posture. We might try to perk up by removing a layer of clothing, opening a window, or raising our gaze.|$|R

40|$|Objects take {{up space}} in memory. If your program creates lots of objects, throws them away, and creates more, you might {{eventually}} {{run out of}} memory. To reduce the chance that this will happen, Java has garbage collection. While the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs your program, it also spends little bits of time searching for objects that you’re no longer using, so it can reclaim their memory for use by other objects. You don’t have {{to know anything about}} garbage collection to be an effective Java programmer. But garbage collection is interesting because the JVM uses a lot of hidden data structures to manage memory. These data structures are hidden from your Java program [...] after all, the JVM, just like any other encapsulated module, should hide the details of how it is implemented. Here’s a peak <b>at</b> <b>what’s</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> under the hood.

Brody is adamant that reporting the accident would have compromised his mission with the CIA. Jessica tells him to cut ties with the CIA, but Brody screams back that he can't do so. They are interrupted by {{a phone call from}} Mike (Diego Klattenhoff), advising that Dana went to his place, so Jessica leaves with Chris (Jackson Pace) to get her. Carrie (Claire Danes) is aware that Brody is late for a meeting with Roya (Zuleikha Robinson) and enters his home, finding Brody nearly catatonic and sitting {{on the floor in the}} hallway. Carrie sees that Brody is succumbing to the pressure, and tells him the ordeal is [...] "almost over" [...] and manages to get him to go to the meeting. However, when he sees Roya, Brody expresses his frustration at being constantly left in the dark <b>at</b> <b>what's</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> finally telling Roya [...] "I'm through" [...] and walking away. In an attempt to salvage the operation, Carrie tracks down Brody and takes him to a safe room in a motel.|$|R

50|$|These {{have been}} local and area competitions, {{regional}} and provincial games, some featuring many sports, some {{held in the}} winter season, some in the summer, and some staged indoors with others, outdoors. Some of the competitions had varied recognition and sanctions from national sport governing bodies, while others didn’t.

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of his research, the Belgian physicist Diederik Aerts has shown great creativity in inventing a number of concrete machine-models that have {{played an important role in}} the development of general mathematical and conceptual formalisms for the description of the physical reality. These models can also be used to demystify much of the strangeness in the behavior of quantum entities, by allowing to have a peek <b>at</b> <b>what's</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> - in structural terms - behind the "quantum scenes," during a measurement. In this author's view, the importance of these machine-models, and of the approaches they have originated, have been so far seriously underappreciated by the physics community, despite their success in clarifying many challenges of quantum physics. To fill this gap, and encourage a greater number of researchers to take cognizance of the important work of so-called Geneva-Brussels school, we describe and analyze in this paper two of Aerts' historical machine-models, whose operations are based on simple breakable elastic bands. The first one, called the spin quantum-machine, is able to replicate the quantum probabilities associated with the spin measurement of a spin- 1 / 2 entity. The second one, called the connected vessels of water model (of which we shall present here an alternative version based on elastics) is able to violate Bell's inequality, as coincidence measurements on entangled states can do.
