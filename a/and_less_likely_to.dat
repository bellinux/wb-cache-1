5|$|The {{three major}} {{components}} of peat are humic acid, humins, and fulvic acid. Of these, humins give {{the most reliable}} date as they are insoluble in alkali <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> contain contaminants from the sample's environment. A particular difficulty with dried peat is the removal of rootlets, which {{are likely to be}} hard to distinguish from the sample material.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

50|$|Preventive {{effects on}} alcohol use and {{cigarette}} use were first {{observed in the}} spring of Grade 8, 2.67 years after intervention programs were implemented. Grade 8 youth from CTC communities were 32% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> initiate alcohol use, <b>and</b> 33% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> initiate cigarette smoking than Grade 8 youth from control communities (Hawkins et al., 2009). Preventive effects were again sustained through Grade 10 when CTC panel youth were 29% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> initiate alcohol use <b>and</b> 28% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> initiate cigarette smoking than panel youth from control communities.|$|R

25|$|Although {{structurally}} {{similar to}} chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), tetrafluoromethane does not deplete the ozone layer.

Carbon–fluorine bonds are stronger <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> dissociate.|$|E
25|$|Tenofovir is a {{nucleotide}} analogue and an antiretroviral {{drug that}} {{is also used to}} treat HIV infection.

25|$|Irish {{immigrants}} also swelled {{the working}} population. By 1851, 23% {{of the population}} of Glasgow was Irish in origin.

25|$|Adolescents {{have the}} highest rates of sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) when compared to older groups. Sexually active adolescents are more likely to believe that they will not contract a sexually transmitted infection than adults. Adolescents {{are more likely to have}} an infected partner <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive health care when an STI is suspected. They are also less likely to comply with the treatment for an STI. Coinfection is common among adolescents.|$|E

25|$|Male {{red deer}} retain their antlers {{for more than}} half the year, and are less gregarious <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> group with other males when they have antlers. The antlers provide self-defence, as does a strong front-leg kicking action {{performed}} by both sexes when attacked. Once the antlers are shed, stags tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to cooperatively work together. Herds tend to have one or more members watching for potential danger, while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E
25|$|Undocumented {{immigrants}} in mixed status families tend {{to work in}} jobs that do not provide employee based health insurance and/or employed in occupations that pay off the books. Moreover, we can also expect that poor noncitizen children whose parents lack job-based coverage have lower rates of participation than poor citizen children of U.S. citizens. The lack of insurance for citizen children in mixed-status families means that these children {{are less likely to}} receive timely care for acute conditions, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have their chronic conditions diagnosed and appropriately managed.|$|E

25|$|The longe line (or longe) {{is about}} 30 feet (10 m) long, so the longeing circle {{can have a}} {{diameter}} of 60 feet (20 m). It is usually a flat woven webbing made of nylon, cotton, or Dacron. In the natural horsemanship tradition, the longe line is usually made of round cotton rope, and is often much shorter, as short as 15 or 20 feet. In general, cotton longe lines {{are less likely to}} burn the trainer's hands than nylon, but nylon is more durable <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> break.|$|E
25|$|Compared to children, {{adolescents}} {{are more likely}} to question others' assertions, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> accept facts as absolute truths. Through experience outside the family circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger children do not make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains.|$|E
25|$|The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth {{has found}} that, while pledgers {{are more likely}} to abstain until {{marriage}} than non-pledgers – 99% of whom will have sex before marriage – 88% of the pledgers studied had vaginal intercourse before marriage. Out of those who pledge, there was a significant delay in first experience with vaginal intercourse, with an average delay of 18 months. However, people who took a virginity pledge were found to be less likely to have protected sex upon initiation <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> get STI tested if a concern arose.|$|E
