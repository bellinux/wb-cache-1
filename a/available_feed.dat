25|$|The {{nutritional}} requirements of cattle are usually divided into maintenance requirements, which {{depend on the}} cow’s weight; and milk production requirements, which in turn depend on the volume of milk the cow is producing. The nutritional contents of each <b>available</b> <b>feed</b> are used to formulate a diet that meets all nutritional needs in the most cost effective way. Notably, cattle must be fed a diet high in fiber to maintain a proper environment for the rumen microbes. Farmers typically grow their own forage for their cattle. Crops grown may include corn, alfalfa, timothy, wheat, oats, sorghum and clover. These plants are often processed after harvest to preserve or improve nutrient value and prevent spoiling. Corn, alfalfa, wheat, oats, and sorghum crops are often anaerobically fermented to create silage. Many crops such as alfalfa, timothy, oats, and clover are allowed to dry in the field after cutting before being baled into hay.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{can become}} anxious or {{stressed}} {{if there are}} {{long periods of time}} between meals. They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine. [...] When horses are in a herd, their behavior is hierarchical; the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first. [...] Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little <b>available</b> <b>feed,</b> higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all. [...] Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately, or spread [...] feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat. [...] In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly. [...] Horses may also eat in undesirable ways, such as bolting their feed, or eating too fast. [...] This can lead to either choke or colic under some circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Conventionally, maximum {{capacities}} {{for energy}} assimilation {{are presented as}} daily averages. However, maximum daily energy intake {{is determined by the}} maximum metabolizable energy intake rate and the time available for assimilation of food energy Thrush nightingales (Luscinia luscinia) in migratory disposition were given limited food rations for 3 d to reduce their energy stores. Subsequently, groups of birds were fed ad lib. during fixed time periods varying between 7 and 23 h per day. Metabolizable energy intake rate, averaged over the <b>available</b> <b>feeding</b> time, was 1. 9 W and showed no difference between groups {{on the first day of}} refueling. Total daily metabolizable energy intake increased linearly with <b>available</b> <b>feeding</b> time, and for the 23 -h group, it was well above suggested maximum levels for animals. We conclude that both intake rate and <b>available</b> <b>feeding</b> time must be taken into account when interpreting potential constraints acting on animals' energy budgets. In the 7 -h group, energy intake rates increased from 1. 9 W on the first day to 3. 1 W on the seventh day. This supports the idea that small birds can adaptively increase their energy intake rates on a short timescale...|$|R

40|$|The <b>available</b> <b>feeding</b> time {{of coastal}} Oystercatchers varies {{from day to}} day due to the effect of wind {{direction}} and wind force on the water level. If the birds are not able to feed at all during a day, they lose 30 g, or 6 % of their body weight. The body weight increases with the duration of the <b>available</b> <b>feeding</b> time, irrespective whether it is day or night. Oystercatchers continue to feed at night, at least in autumn and winter. Although wind force and wind direction affect the daily duration of the <b>available</b> <b>feeding</b> time, this variation fades away if calculated over a number of days, and therefore does not affect the birds in the long-term. Does the body weight increase, or decrease, with the higher costs of living associated with low temperatures and strong winds? A decrease in body weight with increased cost of living would suggest. that the birds are not able to find the extra food required to compensate for the higher maintenance level ('undercompensation'). An increase in body weight, on the other hand, would suggest that the birds in these difficult circumstances eat even more than needed in order to increase their body reserves in cases still worse conditions arrive ('overcompensation'). Unfortunately, the field data are confusing. The weak increase in body weight at low temperatures suggests an overcompensation, but the observed clear decrease in body weight with strong winds suggests an undercompensation. However, the increase of body weight with lower temperature is not large and is possibly due to intervening variables, so {{it is not clear whether}} this was an actual overcompensation. The negative effect of wind force on body weight is presumably caused by undercompensation in combination with a decrease in the feeding success...|$|R

50|$|Layered or {{stratified}} {{charge storage}} is {{hot water storage}} tank, typically for solar thermal energy. The warmest storage layer is the top storage cylinder and below this there are colder storage layers through natural layering. The water is fed into different storage levels, depending on the <b>available</b> <b>feed</b> temperature and current temperature layering. The feed takes place via a vertical line via valves, in each case the feed water is fed into the storage layer with the corresponding water temperature. This is achieved by means of self-acting valves, feeding the respective temperature or water density into the temperature layer. The advantage {{is that there is}} no mixing of the storage temperature. Swirling of the water is therefore to be avoided as far as possible in stratified storage tanks because this could lead to intermingling of storage layers. This is reduced by means of measures such as limiting flow velocity and baffle plates at the inlets.|$|E
5000|$|Horses have {{a strong}} grazing instinct, preferring to spend most {{hours of the day}} eating forage. Horses and other equids evolved as grazing animals, adapted to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, the horse adapted to eating prairie grasses in {{semi-arid}} regions and traveling significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Thus, they are [...] "trickle eaters," [...] meaning they have to have an almost constant supply of food to keep their digestive system working properly. Horses can become anxious or stressed if there are long periods of time between meals. When stabled, they do best when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine. [...] When horses are in a herd, their behavior is hierarchical; the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first.

The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the <b>available</b> <b>feed</b> resources, estimate the amount of feed that can be produced per-annum and relate with the annual requirement for the existing livestock population, thus to design strategies fulfilling the dietary requirement of the animals and proper feed production and management systems [...] The {{survey was conducted}} using a semi-structured questionnaire and participatory rural appraisal. In addition, group discussions were held with elders, key informants and development agents. The survey showed that the major feed resources in the area are natural pastures, crop residues, aftermath grazing and weeds. The estimated quantity of these feed resources was below the annual requirement of livestock in the study area. The <b>available</b> <b>feed</b> dry matter was estimated to cover about 69. 9 % of the total maintenance requirement of the livestock in the area. This figure is low were the animals may have access to other feed resources such as leaves and pods of trees and various household and horticultural wastes that are not included in the calculation because of lack of conversion factors; that would have been included in the calculation of <b>available</b> <b>feed</b> resources. The findings also indicated seasonal variability of feed availability; relatively feed is in good supply during June to September. The farmers preserve crop residues for dry season; however, the way of conservation is not generally appropriate and used for other purposes; silage making is not known; hay making is not practiced due to scarcity of grazing land, despite that, available grasses used for roof cover.
