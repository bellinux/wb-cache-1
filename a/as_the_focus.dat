5|$|In {{the second}} season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns' relationship, and the writers often pitched episodes with them <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus,</b> but many {{never came to}} fruition.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{research}} being undertaken, predictions were of a 0.5–1% effect from particulate matter; the variation from prediction {{may be explained by}} cloud formation with the particles acting <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> for droplet creation.|$|E
50|$|The Global Cold Chain Alliance officially {{launched}} in April 2007. The Alliance now acts <b>as</b> <b>the</b> platform for communication, networking {{and education for}} each link of the cold chain. It serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focused</b> voice of <b>the</b> cold chain industry.|$|R
50|$|Ridged mirrors {{can also}} reflect visible light; however, for light waves, the {{performance}} is not {{better than that}} of a flat surface. An ellipsoidal ridged mirror is proposed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> element for an atomic optical system with submicrometre resolution (atomic nanoscope).|$|R
50|$|When these hold, the {{divergence}} becomes infinite at some finite {{value of}} the affine parameter. Thus all geodesics leaving a point will eventually reconverge after a finite time, provided the appropriate energy condition holds, a result also known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> theorem.|$|R
5|$|As the League developed, {{its role}} expanded, {{and by the}} middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of {{international}} activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.|$|E
5|$|In the centre, {{the women}} dance. Their {{interlocked}} {{arms and hands}} create a pattern at {{the centre of the}} canvas, which acts <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the painting. To the right of the central group of dancers a young man drags another woman away from the group of dancers, to join a pair of lovers who lie down together at the right of the painting.|$|E
5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E
50|$|Valle Canal Novo is {{a nature}} reserve near Marano, {{a small town}} in the north east of Italy. Consisting {{primarily}} of a lagoon (or valle), which was historically used for fishing, it is 121 hectares in size and in the same protected area <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foci</b> dello Stella.|$|R

5|$|Like the game, {{the comic}} {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the comic due to the uniqueness of her birth and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} filming {{was carried}} out at Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios and Twickenham Studios in London. Extensive sequences also featured London, notably Trafalgar Square and the exterior of 10 Downing Street. Mereworth Castle in Kent {{was used as the}} home of Sir James Bond, which is blown up {{at the start of the}} film. Much of the filming for M's Scottish castle was actually done on location in County Meath, Ireland, with Killeen Castle, Dunsany, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus.</b> However, the car chase sequences where Bond leaves the castle were shot in the Perthshire village of Killin with further sequences in Berkshire (specifically Old Windsor and Bracknell).|$|E
5|$|With a {{storm track}} {{very close to}} the shore and a {{retreating}} high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A frontal boundary between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder air over the interior served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> for a severe ice storm in central New England. Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas. By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed cold-core low. The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete vesicles {{containing}} alkaline phosphatase. This cleaves the phosphate groups and acts <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> for calcium and phosphate deposition. The vesicles then rupture {{and act as}} a centre for crystals to grow on. More particularly, bone mineral is formed from globular and plate structures.|$|R
50|$|The two {{centers of}} {{attraction}} {{can be considered}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> {{of a set of}} ellipses. If either center were absent, the particle would move on one of these ellipses, as a solution of the Kepler problem. Therefore, according to Bonnet's theorem, the same ellipses are the solutions for the bicenter problem.|$|R
5|$|Yuki started Fairy Cube {{with the}} goal of writing a short series. Because of the story's nature as a serial, she faced page limitations. When {{deciding}} on the ending, she considered having Ian and Rin as the sacrifice to close the demon door, but rejected it, feeling that it would be too unpleasant for the readers, although she expressed her fondness for sad endings. She was also unable to include Ian and Tokage's newfound friendship, because Rin and Ian's romantic relationship served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the story.|$|E
5|$|Although the Quiriguá elite {{were clearly}} Maya in ethnicity, the site {{lies on the}} {{southern}} periphery of the Mesoamerican area and the population was at least bi-ethnic, with ethnic Maya in a minority. The {{majority of the population}} belonged ethnically to the less complex Intermediate Area lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica. The population density of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square mile) in the centre of the city during the Late Classic with an estimated peak population of 12001600; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km2 (3767 per square mile) in central Copán. The low population density indicates that Quiriguá served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> for a dispersed rural population.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1917, the Australians {{were moved}} to Belgium <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of British {{operations}} shifted to the Ypres sector {{in an effort to}} draw German attention away from the French. The first effort came around Messines, on the southern flank, where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines. On 7 June, 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting, the British captured Messines Ridge. Assigned a support role, the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack. The following day, it was committed to hold the gains that had been made during the attack, relieving the New Zealanders around Gooseberry Farm. The 15th remained in the Ypres sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of Ypres in September. In November 1917, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a three-month rest, spending the winter around Templeux-la-Fosse and Hollebeke.|$|E

25|$|The Heading (1:1): As {{is typical}} of prophetic books, an {{anonymous}} editor has supplied {{the name of the}} prophet, an indication of his time of activity, and an identification of his speech <b>as</b> <b>the</b> “word of Yahweh”, a generic term carrying a claim to prophetic legitimacy and authority. Samaria and Jerusalem are given prominence <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> of <b>the</b> prophet’s attention.|$|R

5|$|Stories in {{the series}} {{frequently}} emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and self-sacrifice. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often {{play a central role}} in the creation of the world, and a majority of the Final Fantasy games link crystals and orbs to the planet's life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also a recurring theme {{in the series}} related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was withdrawn}} back to Australia in early 1944 for rest and reorganisation. During this period it was stationed at Tenterfield, where the soldiers experienced a bitterly cold winter, {{before moving to}} Petrie and then Kiari on the Atherton Tablelands. The battalion was reorganised to conform {{with the requirements of}} the jungle divisional establishment, and as a result its vehicles were changed to include jeeps and trailers, instead of trucks, which were considered impractical in the jungle. A change of commanding officer also took place in this time, with Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Haupt– who had previously served as battalion second-in-command before leaving to take over command of the 62nd Battalion in January 1943– returning to take over from Fidock. A long period of training, which included courses in amphibious warfare and various jungle exercises followed, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the fighting in the Pacific shifted away from Australian forces towards the US military. Consequently, it was not until close {{to the end of the}} war that the battalion went into action again. Before this, the battalion contributed to an Australian contingent that was sent to India to lecture British Army officers on the lessons of jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{major change}} in {{international}} trade was {{the rapid expansion of}} the Americas as a market. Glasgow supplied the colonies with cloth, iron farming implements and tools, glass and leather goods. Initially relying on hired ships, by 1736 it had 67 of its own, a third of which were trading with the New World. Glasgow emerged <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants dealing in this lucrative business became the wealthy tobacco lords, who dominated the city for most of the century. Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.|$|E

50|$|Peripheral Light Focusing (PLF) can be {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> of Solar Ultraviolet Radiation (SUVR) at the nasal limbus of the cornea. SUVR incident at the temporal limbus passes across the corneal dome and <b>focuses</b> at <b>the</b> nasal limbus. The limbal region is a stem cell rich tissue {{and as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> of SUVR, it is thought that ocular conditions such as Pinguecula and Pterygium are a result of this increased exposure to SUVR.|$|R
