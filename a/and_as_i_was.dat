I've been to thirty wakes in two years, three this week, one being my cousin, Al's lost a brother in law. It's hit home close to us.

2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing.

40|$|A pragmatic {{approach}} to strategic planning is presented {{for use by}} public and non-profit organizations. Benefits of the process are outlined and two examples of its application are pre-sented-one involving a city government {{and the other a}} public health nursing service. Requirements for strategic planning success are discussed. Several conclusions are drawn, namely that: (7) strategic planning is likely {{to become part of the}} repertoire of public and non-profit planners; (2) planners must be very careful how they apply strategic planning to specific situations; (3) it makes sense to think of decision makers <b>as</b> strategic planners <b>and</b> strategic planners <b>as</b> facilitators of decision making across levels and functions; and (4) there are a number of theoretical and practical issues that still need to <b>be</b> explored. <b>I</b> skate to where I think the puck will be.

The spirit which caused a body of farmers to unite and carry out a system of inspection, the sole object of which would appear to have been the attainment of information which they might apply usefully to the cultivation of their farms. — 2 nd. The results of the system of cultivation pursued. As I believe that a system of careful experiment would be most advantageous to the agriculture of this colony, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> also convinced that the turnip crops grown here fall very far short in weight of even the lowest upon the farms inspected and reported on, I cannot but think that a short abstract of the system pursued, and of the results produced, both as regards the combination of the farmers and the cultivation of their farms, may be acceptable to the agriculturists of Van Diemen's Land...|$|R
