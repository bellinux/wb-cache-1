Employing a modified TAM model, which included the industry environment and convenience factors, we surveyed 164 SMEs to develop a useful refined model of innovation acceptance and continuity of use for international e-trade. We found that usefulness of the innovation was predictive <b>of</b> <b>adoption,</b> whilst <b>convenience</b> only predicted practical use but not continuing use. Moreover, industry variables were powerful predictors. Although e-trade offers SMEs considerable competitive advantage, it appears that widespread adoption is contingent upon a mature infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> {{e-banking}} functionality and investigates the impact of e-banking on the outcomes of customer satisfaction namely, loyalty and positive WOM within the Jordanian Commercial Banks. Design/methodology/approach – A purposive sampling technique was employed to recruit 179 customers representing the desired range of demographic characteristics (e. g. gender, age, and computer use), previous internet experience levels and product-related knowledge. Findings – This research showed that <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> e-banking (accessibility, <b>convenience,</b> security, privacy, content, design, speed, fees and charges) had a positive effect on Jordanian Commercial Bank customers' satisfaction, loyalty, and positive WOM. Originality/value – The paper contributes to previous research by adding to existing knowledge regarding what constitutes e-banking service.

40|$|Recent {{efforts in}} a number of Republican-controlled states to roll back {{previous}} reforms that make the act of voting easier, combined with the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> voter identification laws, signal the strong partisan divisions on matters of election administration. By examining the factors that explain the initial <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> two common <b>convenience</b> voting methods (no-excuse absentee voting and in-person early voting), Daniel Biggers and Michael Hanmer find that partisan considerations were much more limited than one might expect. Republican governors were less likely to adopt in-person early voting but not no-excuse absentee voting and control of or party strength in the state legislature exerted little influence on this decision. Instead, enactment of both reforms seems to have been affected by utility, with elderly and rural population size, as well as geographic size, influencing adoption. These findings contrast with the heightened partisan debate on these matters and provide important insights into the history and future of these reform...|$|R

30|$|These {{findings}} suggest {{that there could be}} a lack of understanding about how password managers work and that even users of the tool may not understand the security benefits of their decision. Any effort which attempts to persuade users to adopt password managers needs to clearly explain the purpose of the tool and the technology behind it, which can reduce users’ misunderstandings, thereby hopefully reducing feelings of suspicion. It is possible that better education about the security benefits of password managers and similar tools, even directed towards current users could help increase <b>adoption.</b> The importance <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> to users <b>of</b> password managers and the relatively high <b>adoption</b> rate <b>of</b> password managers show the power that usable tools have towards motivating secure behavior, even if the users do not necessarily know they are being secure. Our emotion findings highlight how complex feelings of trust and motivation to be secure are intertwined and suggest that cultivating the positives (e.g., energetic, secure) and reducing the negatives (e.g., suspicion) around password managers can further help increase adoption.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{changing}} marketing landscape {{has seen}} the advent and <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> new tools like shopping apps for consumers. The conventional models which have studied Information Technology (IT) acceptance and adoption by consumers have found that adoption {{is a function of}} perceived usefulness and ease of usage. Other models have emphasised Quality, Enjoyment and Trust as significant determinants <b>of</b> the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> IT by consumers. Evolution in IT, changing consumer habits, changing demographics and consumer traits make it imperative to rethink pre-existing theories <b>of</b> acceptance and <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> IT in the context of e-marketing. This paper focuses on the growth of the usage of Apps by consumers in India, explores their functionalities and proposes a new conceptual model for the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> Mobile Apps by consumers shopping on e-commerce sites in India. Convenience, Collaboration, Hedonic Motivation, and Habit are the significant constructs outlined in the proposed model, which focuses on the usage of apps in the wake of task directed and experiential consumer behaviour. We propose that Degree of Internet Savviness and Individual Internet Worth are additional moderating variables which impact the effect <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> and collaboration on App Usage. Implications of the proposed model for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

The advantage of DISP over other Petri net description languages is one <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> and expressiveness, owing to the provision of parallel programming constructs and to the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> a delay insensitive semantics for communication. An example from the literature demonstrates that it may be more convenient for designers to create structured specifications in DISP of delayinsensitive interfaces than to work directly with Petri nets.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{determinants}} <b>of</b> users' <b>adoption</b> momentum <b>of</b> e-banking in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire with four-point Likert scale is applied to 324 usable responses. Ten attributes are tested, namely <b>convenience</b> <b>of</b> usage, accessibility, features availability, bank management and image, security, privacy, design, content, speed, and fees and charges. Findings - Results indicate that all elements for ten identified factors are significant with respect to the users' <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> e-banking services. Privacy and security are the major sources of dissatisfaction, which have momentously impacted users' satisfaction. Meanwhile, accessibility, convenience, design and content are sources of satisfaction. Besides, the speed, product features availability, and reasonable service fees and charges, as well as the bank's operations management factor are critical to the success of the e-banks. WAP, GPRS and 3 G features from mobile devices are of no significance or influence in the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> e-banking services in this study. Results also reveal that privacy, security and convenience factors play an important role in determining the users' acceptance of e-banking services with respect to different segmentation of age group, education level and income level. Research limitations/implications - The use <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> sampling in this study weakens research objectivity. This study excludes the voice of non-users and non-users' views should be taken into account in future study. Practical implications - The results are expected to provide a practical contribution in the area of retail banking and in understanding consumer behavior in the Malaysian business-to-business financial services industry. Originality/value - This paper is the extension of an earlier study by Suganthi et X which identified seven factors affecting the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> internet banking, with 17 elements, This study examines a wider scope of factors that consist of ten attributes with 78 elements based on the extant literature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the factors which {{determine}} the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> best HR practices in Chinese small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach – Regression analysis was utilized to analyse survey data obtained from 345 enterprises operating across China in a wide range of industrial sectors. Findings – Enterprises with greater resources in terms of their size, their relationships with external organizations, their cooperation with foreign partners and the human capital of their CEO were found to be more likely to adopt best HR practices. Contrary to the findings of the existing literature no relationship was found of a relationship between family ownership and the use of best HR practices. Research limitations/implications – The cross-sectional design is an obvious limitation of the study. Other limitations relate to the generalizability of the study findings outside the context in which the research was undertaken, and the use <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> sampling. Practical implications – Enterprises should consider building strategic relationships with external organizations and developing cooperation with foreign partners as a way of leveraging human resource expertise at a limited cost.
