5000|$|The {{leaping bonito}} (Cybiosarda elegans) is {{a species of}} {{saltwater}} finfish from the Scombridae (Mackerel) family. Scombridae includes such tribes as the mackerels, tunas, and bonitos - the latter of which, the Sardini tribe, this fish is a member. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Cybiosarda, which is therefore called a monotypic taxon. [...] Since the bonitos and tunas are close relatives, this fish has variously been referred to by such other common names as <b>Australian</b> tuna, striped <b>bonito,</b> and Watson's bonito.|$|R
