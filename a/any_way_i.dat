I will {{continue}} in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom—that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.|$|E

500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against me while I was on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> still {{felt as if they}} all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist in front of the wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E

500|$|According to The New York Times, [...] "Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo {{forged a}} close relationship" [...] when Williams was away. According to PC Magazine, Williams was [...] "no longer {{involved}} in the day-to-day goings on at the company". He was focused on developing a new startup, and {{became a member of}} Twitter's board of directors, and promised to [...] "help in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can". In 2011, Stone was still with Twitter but was working with AOL as an [...] "advisor on volunteer efforts and philanthropy". In January 2014 Stone announced the release of Jelly, a 'social Q network for mobile'. Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. At that time he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{settling}} the Running with Scissors case in August 2007, Burroughs stated, [...] I consider {{this not only}} a personal victory but a victory for all memoirists. I still maintain that the book is an entirely accurate memoir, {{and that it was}} not fictionalized or sensationalized in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> did not embellish or invent elements. We had a very strong case because I had the truth on my side." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "You can't be {{mates with}} everyone," [...] Warne {{wrote in his}} 2008 book [...] Shane Warne's Century, serialised by The Times in September, [...] "and if there was <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could knock him down to number 101 for the {{purposes}} of this book, I'd be delighted to do so. [...] But having taken on the task, I want to do it seriously, and the fact is that Ranatunga helped to put Sri Lanka on the cricket map. [...] And you know what? [...] Deep down, I'll quietly admit that I rated him as a cricketer." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 1997 {{a gunman}} opened fire from atop the Empire State Building hitting seven people, killing {{one of these}} persons. [...] Giuliani blamed lax gun laws for the shooting: [...] "It should be as {{difficult}} to get a gun in Florida as it is in New York City." [...] In 1997, while the Assault Weapons Ban was in effect, he called for a stricter federal ban on assault weapons and for handgun registration on the federal level. He also endorsed President Bill Clinton's proposals for more stringent federal gun-licensing requirements, [...] "I applaud the President's [...] proposals, and I will support them <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can." [...] In the same speech he said, [...] "[...] [...] {{we may be able to}} find some sort of meaning in this tragedy [...] by using it as a catalyst to revive national gun control efforts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Managed by Newt Joseph, {{the team}} also {{included}} Byron [...] "Mex" [...] Johnson, but otherwise it mostly functioned as a minor-league team staffed by marginal, aging, or young players. Playing throughout Kansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Illinois, and even Utah, large crowds turned out to see Paige throw an inning or two, relying on junkballs. Paige recalled, [...] "Everybody'd heard I was a fastballer and here I was throwing Alley Oops and bloopers and underhand and sidearm and <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could {{to get the ball}} {{up to the plate and}} get it over, maybe even for a strike. But even that made my arm ache like a tooth was busting every time I threw. And the balls I was throwing never would fool anybody in the Negro leagues, not without a fast ball to go with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Takahashi {{said that}} she had been dreaming about the overall {{universe}} of Urusei Yatsura since she was very young. She said that the series [...] "really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series because then I could write <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> wanted to". She wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader. When Takahashi ran out of ideas she would create new characters. Takahashi shared a small 150 square feet apartment with her assistants, and slept in a closet {{due to a lack of}} space. While writing Urusei Yatsura she also began work on Maison Ikkoku and used this experience as well as her university experience as the basis for the setting of that series.|$|E

2500|$|Describing why he {{continued}} using the Guns N' Roses name, instead of labeling the upcoming album an 'Axl Rose solo album', Rose stated [...] "It is something I lived by before {{these guys were}} in it. And {{there were other people}} in Guns n' Roses before them, you know. I contemplated letting go of that, but it doesn't feel right in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> am not the person who chose to try to kill it and walked away. It's not an Axl Rose album, even if it's what I wanted it to be. Everybody is putting everything they've got into singing and building. Maybe I'm helping steer it to what it should be built like." [...] Also in the interview, Rose attributed the breakup of the old lineup to drug addictions and 'an effort from inside the band to destroy him', stating [...] "There was an effort to bring me down. It was a king-of-the-mountain thing," [...] and that he [...] "needed to take control to survive". Rose also described the dissolution as [...] "a divorce".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: [...] "Lasers {{is a great}} album. I'm {{actually}} happy with the record. I feel I got to say what I wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for {{what it took to}} get through it. It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it [...] I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just walk away from it all completely." ...|$|E
2500|$|When she was 15, {{her parents}} separated, and her mother, {{supportive}} of her daughter's desire to act, moved {{with her to}} Los Angeles, where they lived out of their car until Swank's mother saved enough money to rent an apartment. Swank has called her mother the inspiration for her acting career and her life. In California, Swank enrolled in South Pasadena High School, later dropping out because of her ADHD and lack of interest. She described her time at South Pasadena High School, [...] "I felt like such an outsider. I didn't feel like I fit in. I didn't belong in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> didn't even feel like the teachers wanted me there. I just felt like I wasn't seen or understood." [...] She explained that she became an actor because she felt an outsider, [...] "As a kid I felt that I belonged only when I read a book or saw a movie, and could get involved with a character. It was natural that I became an actor because I longed {{so much to be}} those other people, or at least to play them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The feller {{has left}} you, has he?" [...] the Baronet said, beginning, as he fancied, to comprehend. [...] "Well, Becky--come {{back if you}} like. You can't eat your cake and have it. <b>Any</b> <b>ways</b> <b>I</b> made you a vair offer. Coom back as governess--you shall have it all your own way." [...] She held out one hand. She cried fit to break her heart; her ringlets fell over her face, and over the marble mantelpiece where she laid it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so, sir," [...] {{returned}} Ambrose, [...] "I {{would work}} in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> so <b>I</b> could study the humanities, and hear the Dean preach. Cannot you commend me to his school?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} wait here," [...] she said, [...] "I'll go upstairs {{and see my}} uncle. If I {{see that it is}} in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> possible, <b>I</b> will do as you ask." ...|$|R
2500|$|The President of the Massachusetts Senate {{controls}} the calling {{of a constitutional}} convention and its agenda. Senate President Tom Birmingham, an opponent of the amendment, called a joint meeting of the legislature as a constitutional convention for June 19, 2002, and immediately adjourned it for a month saying legislators needed for time to consider the agenda items. When the constitutional convention met again on July 17, the amendment's opponents knew that proponents had the 50 votes needed for passage. Birmingham, who was presiding, moved for adjournment without considering the amendment, and his motion passed 137 to 53. He called the amendment [...] "wrong-hearted and wrong-headed" [...] and defended the procedure: [...] "Everybody recognizes a vote to adjourn was a vote up or down" [...] on the amendment. [...] "I did gavel the last constitutional convention to a recess because I felt the members needed more time to assess.... Today we saw democracy in action. They may not like it, but they lost two to one." [...] A representative of the Catholic Action League, which supported the amendment, said: [...] "Everything that is wrong with Massachusetts state government was apparent today {{for all the world}} to see". One legislator who voted to adjourn said: [...] "For those of us who believe in an open democratic process, this was not a comfortable vote". State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques, an opponent of the amendment and a lesbian, said: [...] "I'm proud to have done anything possible to defeat this hate-filled, discriminatory measure. I'll take a victory on this <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can get it." [...] Arlene Isaacson of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus later explained it was a critical moment because same-sex marriage had no chance of winning a popular vote at the time: [...] "Not that we would lose by a little, because that wasn't an issue. Rather, it was {{that we were going to}} get massacred".|$|E
2500|$|At the 1978 US Open, Evert {{would play}} sixteen-year-old Pam Shriver in the final. [...] Shriver showed Evert {{she was to}} be taken seriously in the match by winning her first service game at 15 points for Evert, which was {{the first game of the}} match. [...] Evert would have a hard time shaking Shriver off during the first set because of mostly double {{faulting}} three-times in one game in the eight game of the set to allow Shriver to break back to level the set 4-games all. [...] Evert would lose the next game to go down 4 games to 5, which she said [...] "I was disgusted with those three double-faults...when I get nervous, serving is one of the first things that goes. [...] But even at 5-4, I felt very confident. [...] I didn't think there was <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could lose." [...] During the subsequent game, Evert would only lose one point on serve to get the match back level at 5 games-all. [...] In the critical 11-game, Evert would show why experience matters and broke the youngster's serve, which allowed Evert to win the opening set 7 games to 5. [...] Evert and Shriver would battle to an even 4-all in the second set before the youngster showed her inexperience by having a 40 to love game, and simply put Shriver could not close it out against the relentless effort of Evert. [...] The points after this was the following: Evert winning on a forehand return, then made a winning volley, then got deuce with a galloping forehand up the line, Shriver won the next point with a booming service to get the advantage with a volley, Shriver on game point lead her forehand astray, lastly Evert won the game by hitting two unreturnable returns. [...] In the tenth game of the set, Shriver tried her best by getting most shots back, but Evert still won the set 6 games to 4, which gave Evert her fourth US Open title in a row and first one on the hard DecoTurf. [...] Evert later said [...] "I felt hungary to win...When the chips were down, I went for passing shots and made them. [...] I hit the lines." ...|$|E
