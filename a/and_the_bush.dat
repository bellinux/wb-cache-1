5|$|In July 2004, Hamdan {{was charged}} with {{conspiracy}} to commit terrorism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration made arrangements to try him before a military commission, established by the Department of Defense under Military Commission Order No. 1 of March 21, 2002. He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG, who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging {{the constitutionality of the}} military commission, and saying that it lacked the protections required under the Geneva Conventions and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E

25|$|Ackerman {{also scored}} {{a victory in}} his efforts to ban downed animals from being sold as meat in supermarkets, {{restaurants}} and butcher stores.

25|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. government officials questioned the lack of large-scale American democracy promotion mechanisms in the MENA region, viewing democracy as a means of promoting moderation and stability and preventing terrorism. This resulted in a ramping-up of diplomatic rhetoric on the necessity of democratization and political reform in the Middle East and an increase in funding for democracy promotion in the region. Spreading democracy was also one rationalization used by neo-conservatives <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration for undertaking the War in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Her work {{is noted}} for a keen {{focus on the}} Australian environment, which began to gain {{prominence}} in Australian art {{in the years following}} World War II. She deals with the relationship between settlers, Indigenous Australians <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush,</b> among other themes. Wright's aesthetic centres on the relationship between mankind and the environment, which she views as the catalyst for poetic creation. Her images characteristically draw from the Australian flora and fauna, yet contain a mythic substrata that probes at the poetic process, limitations of language, and the correspondence between inner existence and objective reality.|$|E
25|$|It was {{claimed that}} calls from Western governments for an {{international}} investigation prompted {{a major shift in}} Uzbek foreign policy favouring closer relations with Asian nations, although the Uzbek government is known to have close ties with the U.S. government, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration had declared Uzbekistan to be vital to US security because it hired out a large military base to US military forces. The Uzbek government ordered the closing of the United States air base in Karshi-Khanabad and improved ties with the People's Republic of China and Russia, who supported the regime's response in Andijan.|$|E
50|$|Broaching is {{primarily}} used to cut square cornered internal keyways. <b>The</b> specific broach, <b>bushing</b> <b>and</b> guide {{are used for}} each given keyway cross-section, which makes this process more expensive {{than most of the}} alternatives. However, it can produce the most accurate keyway out of all the processes. There are three main steps in broaching a keyway: First, the workpiece is set on <b>the</b> arbor press <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> is placed in the opening of the workpiece. Next, the broach is inserted and pushed through, cutting the keyway. Finally, shims are placed between <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> broach to achieve the correct depth necessary for the key.|$|R

25|$|The Urapmin make a {{division}} between the village (Urap: abiip) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> (Urap: sep). These domains are kept separate, and the Urapmin keep their villages free of plant matter. Villages are U-shaped with dirt-packed plazas, with no grass or weeds. Most Urapmin {{have at least one}} house in a village (Urap: am). However, due to the importance of forest gardens for sustenance, the Urapmin spend much of their time in isolated bush houses (Urap: sep am), built in elaborate fashion near gardens and hunting grounds. Villages are arranged by the kamokim, who coax people from sep am or from other villages. When the kamok dies, the village inhabitants disperse.|$|E
25|$|Neoconservatives <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Doctrine {{held that}} the hatred for the West and United States in {{particular}} does not exist because of actions perpetrated by the United States, but rather because the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy. The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of United States are using terrorism as a war of ideology against the United States. The responsibility of the United States is to protect itself and its friends by promoting democracy where the terrorists are located so as to undermine the basis for terrorist activities.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} has officially taken a silent policy towards {{the nuclear weapons}} ambitions {{of the state of}} Israel, while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of Iran and North Korea. Until 2005 when the program was cancelled, it was violating its own non-proliferation treaties in the pursuit of so-called nuclear bunker busters. The 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. was done, in part, on indications that Weapons of Mass Destruction were being stockpiled (lately, stockpiles of previously undeclared nerve agent and mustard gas shells have been located in Iraq), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration said that its policies on proliferation were responsible for the Libyan government's agreement to abandon its nuclear ambitions.|$|E

25|$|The dhole's {{distinctive}} morphology {{has been}} a source of much confusion in determining the species' systematic position among the Canidae. George Simpson placed the dhole in the subfamily Simocyoninae alongside the African wild dog <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> dog, on account of all three species' similar dentition. Subsequent authors, including Juliet Clutton-Brock, noted greater morphological similarities to canids of the genera Canis, Dusicyon, and Alopex than to either Speothos or Lycaon, with any resemblance to the latter two being due to convergent evolution. Some authors consider the extinct Canis subgenus named Xenocyon as ancestral of both genus Lycaon and genus Cuon. Subsequent studies on the canid genome revealed that the dhole and African wild dog are closely related to members of the genus Canis. This closeness to Canis may have been confirmed in a menagerie in Madras, where according to zoologist Reginald Pocock, a dhole interbred with a golden jackal.|$|E
25|$|Only {{two species}} of land mammal are {{indigenous}} to the Houtman Abrolhos, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> rat (Rattus fuscipes). Both are native only to West and East Wallabi Islands, although R.fuscipes has not been collected on East Wallabi Island since August 1967, and is probably extinct there. The tammar wallabi was seen on West Wallabi Island by survivors of the 1628 Batavia shipwreck, and recorded by Francisco Pelsart in his 1629 Ongeluckige Voyagie. This represents the first recorded sighting of a macropod by Europeans, and probably also the first sighting of an Australian mammal. Tammar wallabies were introduced to North Island from East Wallabi Island by fishermen, probably in the 1950s, but failed to establish themselves. In 1987 they were reintroduced again, this time successfully. By the 2000s, there were over 400 wallabies on the island, resulting in overgrazing of native vegetation and increased erosion. Research into the effectiveness of controlling population levels {{by the use of}} implanted contraceptives was begun in 2005, but in July 2007 the research was discontinued and the population culled instead.|$|E
