5|$|The airline's last McDonnell Douglas MD-11 J-Bird (JA8582) {{operated}} {{its final}} flight <b>as</b> <b>Japan</b> Airlines Flight 730 from Hong Kong International Airport to Narita International Airport on 12 October 2004. The aircraft was originally introduced into service on 1 April 1994. In addition, the airline operated its last two McDonnell Douglas DC-10 flights on 31 October 2005.

Another aircraft, JA8541, operated <b>as</b> <b>Japan</b> Airlines Flight 952 from Incheon International Airport to Narita International Airport, touched down at 16:37.

In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the Higashi Ward of Fukuoka City. <b>As</b> <b>Japan</b> previously had no dangerous spiders, signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.|$|E

5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable.

In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E

5|$|Although Watts's {{work was}} seen as {{outdated}} and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and Expressionism drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young Pablo Picasso, who echoed Hope's intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in The Old Guitarist (1903–1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, {{by the time of}} his death in 1904 Hope had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse <b>as</b> <b>Japan,</b> Australia and Poland, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his Summer White House at Sagamore Hill. By 1916, Hope was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for Angelina Weld Grimké's Rachel explicitly use the addition of a copy of Hope to the set to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Japan</b> {{began to}} re-establish itself diplomatically, the Hinomaru {{was used as}} a {{political}} weapon overseas. In a visit by the Emperor Hirohito and the Empress Kōjun to the Netherlands, the Hinomaru was burned by Dutch citizens who demanded that either he be sent home to Japan or tried for the deaths of Dutch prisoners of war during the Second World War. Domestically, the flag was not even used in protests against a new Status of Forces Agreement being negotiated between U.S. and Japan. The most common flag used by the trade unions and other protesters was the red flag of revolt.|$|E

This number dropped significantly as able-bodied soldiers were shipped to other areas in the Philippines, Japan, Japanese-occupied Taiwan, and Manchukuo to work in slave labor camps. <b>As</b> <b>Japan</b> had not yet ratified the Geneva Convention, the POWs were transported out of the camp and forced to work in factories to build Japanese weaponry, unload ships, and repair airfields.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the English sundew or great sundew, is a carnivorous plant species belonging to the sundew family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, although it does occur as far south <b>as</b> <b>Japan,</b> southern Europe, and the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical sundew. It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E
5|$|Each stop usually {{controls}} one rank of pipes, although mixtures and undulating stops (such as the Voix céleste) control multiple ranks. The name of {{the stop}} reflects not only the stop's timbre and construction, but also {{the style of the}} organ in which it resides. For example, the names on an organ built in the north German Baroque style generally will be derived from the German language, while the names of similar stops on an organ in the French Romantic style will usually be French. Most countries tend to use only their own languages for stop nomenclature. English-speaking nations as well <b>as</b> <b>Japan</b> are more receptive to foreign nomenclature. Stop names are not standardized: two otherwise identical stops from different organs may have different names.|$|E
5|$|High-quality {{glass from}} Roman {{manufacturers}} in Alexandria and Syria was exported to {{many parts of}} Asia, including Han China. The first Roman glassware discovered in China is a blue soda-lime glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a glass bottle with opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang. Roman and Persian glassware {{has been found in}} a 5th-century AD tomb of Gyeongju, Korea, capital of ancient Silla, east of China.

5|$|In 1916 the Russian {{government}} decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the Baltic and Black Seas. <b>As</b> <b>Japan</b> and Russia were allies during the war, the Japanese government sold Tango {{and some other}} ex-Russian warships back to Russia in March. The battleship arrived at Vladivostok on 2 April and {{was turned over to}} the Russians on either 3 or 4 April. Her former name had been given to the new dreadnought battleship Poltava, so Tango was renamed Chesma, after the 1770 Battle of Chesma. She departed Vladivostok on 2 July and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 19 September.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Nakayama {{commissioned}} the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida {{to draw up}} a blueprint for the area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard would come out of the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six school buildings would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built {{at the end of this}} boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but <b>as</b> <b>Japan</b> mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.|$|E

Afterward the ship began a refit in 1914 that lasted until late 1916 and was assigned to the 2nd Battleship Squadron upon its completion. During this refit, two 12-pounder anti-aircraft guns were replaced two of the low-angle 12-pounders. She became the flagship of the 5th Battleship Squadron in 1917–18 and served as the flagship for the Japanese commander-in-chief at Nikolayevsk-on-Amur in late 1918 <b>as</b> <b>Japan</b> decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the {{strategy}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy {{was based on the}} radical Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, as promoted by French military advisor and naval architect Emile Bertin. This emphasised cheap torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armoured ships. The acquisition of two German-built s by the Imperial Chinese Beiyang Fleet in 1885 threatened Japan's interests in Korea. A visit by the Chinese warships to Japan in early 1891 forced the Japanese government to acknowledge that the IJN required similarly armed and armoured ships of its own to counter the ironclads; the three lightly armoured s ordered from France would not suffice, despite their powerful guns. The IJN decided to order a pair of the latest battleships from the United Kingdom <b>as</b> <b>Japan</b> lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships.|$|E
