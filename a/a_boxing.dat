40|$|HMGB 1, {{composed}} of the <b>A</b> <b>box,</b> B box, and C tail domains, is a critical proinflammatory cytokine involved in diverse inflammatory diseases. The B box mediates proinflammatory activity, while the <b>A</b> <b>box</b> alone acts as a specific antagonist of HMGB 1. The C tail contributes to the spatial structure of <b>A</b> <b>box</b> and regulates HMGB 1 DNA binding specificity. It is unknown whether the C tail can enhance the anti-inflammatory effect of <b>A</b> <b>box.</b> In this study, we generated fusion proteins consisting of the <b>A</b> <b>box</b> and C tail, in which the B box was deleted and the <b>A</b> <b>box</b> and C tail were linked either directly or by the flexible linker sequence (Gly 4 Ser) 3. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the two fusion proteins had a higher anti-inflammatory activity compared to the <b>A</b> <b>box</b> alone. This suggests that the fused C tail enhances the anti-inflammatory effect of the <b>A</b> <b>box...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the Holland fight, Dyer {{made several}} {{attempts}} at a rematch with Darcy, reportedly {{to the exclusion}} of other fights, in the belief that the encounter would draw a big crowd and a large purse.
