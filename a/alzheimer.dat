5|$|People {{who engage}} in {{intellectual}} activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. This {{is compatible with the}} cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. Education delays the onset of AD syndrome without changing the duration of the disease. Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting <b>Alzheimer</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the <b>Alzheimer</b> type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E
50|$|Early-onset <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, {{also called}} early-onset <b>Alzheimer's,</b> or early-onset AD, is <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease {{diagnosed}} {{before the age}} of 65. It is an uncommon form of <b>Alzheimer's,</b> accounting for only 5-10% of all <b>Alzheimer's</b> cases. Approximately 13% of the cases of early-onset <b>Alzheimer's</b> are familial <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, where a genetic predisposition leads to the disease.

40|$|A 'frontal {{variant of}} <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease' has been {{described}} in patients with predominant behavioural or dysexecutive deficits caused by <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease pathology. The description of this rare <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease phenotype has been limited to case reports and small series, and many clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological characteristics are not well understood. In this retrospective study, we included 55 patients with <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease with a behavioural-predominant presentation (behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease) and a neuropathological diagnosis of high-likelihood <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease (n = 17) and/or biomarker evidence of <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease pathology (n = 44). In addition, we included 29 patients with autopsy/biomarker-defined <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease with a dysexecutive-predominant syndrome (dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease). We performed structured chart reviews to ascertain clinical features. First symptoms were more often cognitive (behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease: 53 %; dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease: 83 %) than behavioural (behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease: 25 %; dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease: 3 %). Apathy {{was the most common}} behavioural feature, while hyperorality and perseverative/compulsive behaviours were less prevalent. Fifty-two per cent of patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease met diagnostic criteria for possible behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia. Overlap between behavioural and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease was modest (9 / 75 patients). Sixty per cent of patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and 40 % of those with the dysexecutive syndrome carried at least one APOE ε 4 allele. We also compared neuropsychological test performance and brain atrophy (applying voxel-based morphometry) with matched autopsy/biomarker-defined typical (amnestic-predominant) <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease (typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, n = 58), autopsy-confirmed/Alzheimer's disease biomarker-negative behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 59), and controls (n = 61). Patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease showed worse memory scores than behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and did not differ from typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, while executive function composite scores were lower compared to behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease. Voxel-wise contrasts between behavioural and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease patients and controls revealed marked atrophy in bilateral temporoparietal regions and only limited atrophy in the frontal cortex. In direct comparison with behavioural and those with dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia showed more frontal atrophy and less posterior involvement, whereas patients with typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease were slightly more affected posteriorly and showed less frontal atrophy (P < 0. 001 uncorrected). Among 24 autopsied behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease/dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease patients, only two had primary co-morbid FTD-spectrum pathology (progressive supranuclear palsy). In conclusion, behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease presentations are characterized by a milder and more restricted behavioural profile than in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, co-occurrence of memory dysfunction and high APOE ε 4 prevalence. Dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease presented as a primarily cognitive phenotype with minimal behavioural abnormalities and intermediate APOE ε 4 prevalence. Both behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease presentations are distinguished by temporoparietal-predominant atrophy. Based on the relative sparing of frontal grey matter, we propose to redefine these clinical syndromes as 'the behavioural/dysexecutive variant of <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease' rather than frontal variant <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease. Further work is needed to determine whether behavioural and dysexecutive-predominant presentations of <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease represent distinct phenotypes or a single continuum...|$|R

5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in <b>Alzheimer</b> disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E

Another study suggests that imatinib may not need to cross the blood–brain barrier to be effective at treating Alzheimer's, as the research indicates the production of beta-amyloid may begin in the liver. Tests on mice indicate that imatinib is effective at reducing beta-amyloid in the brain.
