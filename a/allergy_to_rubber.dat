40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{occupational}} risk groups {{are described as}} examples of prevention of work-related allergy: operating-room nurses of the Erasmus Medical Center and greenhouse workers {{in the western part}} of The Netherlands (the ‘Westland ’ region). Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) allergy is an important health-care problem in the western world. Due to increasing use of rubber gloves, more workers in hospitals and laboratories are exposed to latex allergens. Latex hypersensitivity can induce local symptoms after glove use (usually caused by type-IV <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubber</b> additives), as well as more serious type-I allergic reactions ranging from urticaria and rhinoconjunctivitis to asthma and even anaphylactic shock. Prevalence rates of type-I latex atopy are ranging from 2. 8 to 16. 9 % for hospital personnel. We investigated the prevalence of natural-rubber latex allergy in a population at risk (operating-room personnel) in our hospital. This study was asked for by the Board of Directors in order to evaluate the need for a change in type of glove usage at the operating rooms. Regular OR staff members were tested in 1998 for latex allergy...|$|E

40|$|DG Enterprise (DG III) {{has asked}} the SCMPMD to express its opinion on risks {{associated}} with the use of medical devices manufactured from natural rubber latex. A total of 16 questions dealing with various aspects of <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> products were presented to the SCMPMD. Background Description of the problem Medical devices made from Natural Rubber (NR) may cause allergic reactions to patients and users because of <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> proteinaceous components or chemical constituents of the material. Allergic reactions to proteinaceous allergens in NR products have the potential to provoke life threatening (anaphylactic) reactions in sensitised individuals (type I allergy). This risk is present in health care settings, and in the general public, following contact with NR products or possibly due to cross reactions to different fruits. Allergic contact dermatitis (type IV allergy) caused by chemicals present in NR products is a well known, and frequent, cause for workers compensation claims...|$|R
40|$|Over many years, <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex {{has been}} a major problem among health care workers (HCW). The {{diagnosis}} of occupational allergy requires methods of high diagnostic accuracy in view of certification implications (e. g., a sick worker quits a job). With the development of molecular methods, the frequency of application of recombinant allergens in the diagnostics of allergic diseases continues to increase. This paper reviews the applicability of laboratory tests which use recombinant allergens in the diagnostics of occupational allergy. The diagnosis of latex allergy is based on the presence of clinical symptoms linked with exposure to latex allergens, positive skin prick tests and detection of specific IgE antibodies to latex in serum. Moreover, in some cases specific challenge tests are conducted. The analysis of literature indicates that applying the panel of recombinant latex allergens in diagnostic tests, cross-reactivity can very likely be excluded and/or sensitization can be confirmed without the need for specific challenge tests, which in case of latex allergens carries a potential risk of generalized reactions.

40|$|Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) is {{obtained}} as a milky fluid from the Hevea brasiliensis tree, which is widely grown in South East Asia {{and elsewhere in}} the world. It is found in thousands of everyday consumer and healthcare items. Reports of <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> Natural <b>Rubber</b> Latex have become increasingly common over the past 25 years and severe reactions occur quite frequently. We know of no studies that have determined the number of people affected but there have been suggestions that it is one per cent of the UK population. For the purpose of this fact sheet we will refer <b>to</b> Natural <b>Rubber</b> Latex simply as latex. There are two types of latex allergy: Type I: This is an immediate reaction to proteins in the latex and is potentially life-threatening. Anaphylaxis – the most severe form of allergy – can occur. Type IV: This is a delayed reaction to chemicals used in the latex manufacturing process. Symptoms occur between six and 48 hours after exposure and affect the skin. Although not life-threatening, Type IV latex allergy can be extremely unpleasant. This factsheet aims to answer some of the questions which you and your family might have about living with latex allergy. Our aim is to provide information that will help you to avoid latex, minimise risks and understand how to treat an allergic reaction should it occur...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{reported}} {{prevalence of}} occupational <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex is 8 % to 17 %, {{and that of}} latex-induced occupational asthma is 2. 5 % to 6 %. Conversion of medical facilities to "latex-safe" can reduce employee sensitization, impairment, and disability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the cost of a latex-safe approach, compared with that of continued latex glove use, and to identify the level of worker disability required to make the latex-safe approach financially preferable to a health care institution. METHODS: The costs of 2 strategies [...] latex-safe vs the status quo [...] were calculated from the perspective of 3 health care institutions. A break-even point was calculated for each facility. RESULTS: In all facilities, the cost of using nonlatex gloves exceeded the cost of using latex gloves. In all 3 facilities, however, 1 % or fewer of those at risk would have to become fully disabled or fewer than 2 % would have to become partially disabled for the continued use of latex gloves to exceed the cost of the latex-safe approach. CONCLUSION: Health care facilities, regardless of size, are likely to benefit financially from becoming latex-safe even if latex-related disability levels are extremely low...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Allergic {{reactions}} <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex {{have increased}} during past 10 years especially among {{health care workers}} and patients with high exposure to latex allergens. Allergic reaction to latex is related to many diseases like occupational asthma. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex and potential cross reacting food in operation room staff in Shiraz hospitals. Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study five hundred eighty operation room staff of ten private and state hospitals in Shiraz completed latex allergy questionnaire. They were questioned about personal history and previous history of latex sensitivity, symptoms of latex reactivity and about other <b>allergies</b> particularly <b>to</b> foods that may cross react with latex. Informed consent was obtained and skin prick testing was performed with natural rubber latex. Skin prick tests were done with three potentially cross reacting food (banana, Kiwi, and potato). The obtained data were analyzed with SPSS software and Chi-square test. Results: Among the 580 operation room workers 104 (17. 9 %) of participants were positive to latex skin test. We found a significant association between positive skin test to latex in operation room staff and atopy, urticaria and food allergy. Positive skin test to latex related to positive kiwi skin test (p< 0. 05). The prevalence did not vary by sex, age, education, surgical and non surgical glove users, history of contact dermatitis or smoking status. Conclusion: Latex allergy has a high prevalence in personnel of operation room. Evaluation of present symptom and prediction of future disease necessitate screening test in individuals at risk...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Allergy</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex (NRL) {{has been}} {{frequently}} reported {{in health care}} workers. However, there is little published evidence {{of the outcome of}} hospital intervention programs to reduce exposure and detect cases of sensitization early. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the effects of intervention <b>to</b> reduce NRL <b>allergy</b> in an Ontario teaching hospital with approximately 8000 employees. METHODS: A retrospective review assessed annual numbers of employees visiting the occupational health clinic, allergy clinic, or both for manifestations of NRL allergy compared with the timing of introduction of intervention strategies, such as worker education, voluntary medical surveillance, and hospital conversion to low-protein, powder-free NRL gloves. RESULTS: The number of workers identified with NRL allergy rose annually, from 1 in 1988 to 6 in 1993. When worker education and voluntary medical surveillance were introduced in 1994, a further 25 workers were identified. Nonsterile gloves were changed to low-protein, powder-free NRL gloves in 1995 : Diagnoses fell to 8 workers that year, and 2 of the 3 nurses who had been off work because of asthma-anaphylaxis were able to return to work with personal avoidance of NRL products. With a change to lower protein, powder-free NRL sterile gloves in 1997, <b>allergy</b> diagnoses fell <b>to</b> 3, and only 1 new case was identified subsequently up to May 1999. No increased glove costs were incurred as a result of consolidated glove purchases. CONCLUSIONS: This program <b>to</b> reduce NRL <b>allergy</b> in employees was effectively achieved without additional glove costs while reducing expenses from time off work and workers' compensation claims...|$|R
40|$|Background: In the Department of Occupational and Environmental Dermatology {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the inflow of patients, working as surgical nurses or surgeons. They have been referred due to presumed occupational contact dermatitis. Results from investigated patients have in part been presented previously, where the investigation has shownmultiple contact allergies caused by their occupational use of gloves. Allergens such as diphenylguanidine were found in the gloves and contact <b>allergies</b> <b>to</b> their <b>rubber</b> gloves were found. Many of the patients have been working for decades in their present occupation, but the hand dermatitis had often been present for less than a year. Objectives: To present a follow-up of patientswith hand dermatitis due to gloves. Methods: A follow-up of the patients and a structure for the investigation of the individual patient are given. Results: The cases will be presented with their contact allergies, howtheinvestigation isperformedandtheoutcomeof theprevention by avoiding gloves containing the allergens diagnosed in the individual patients. Conclusions: For health care personnel hand hygiene and the wearing of protective gloves are mandatory. Our findings indicate that the increased need <b>to</b> use <b>rubber</b> gloves {{and at the same time}} the exclusion of latex gloves give rise <b>to</b> new contact <b>allergies</b> which are clinically relevant. In the investigation, and the advice given to the patients, several factors have to be taken into consideration, including the fast change of glove material. The cases indicate the importance of close cooperation between chemists and dermatologists and the possibility to perform chemical analysis. Furthermore, and just as important for this patient group, is that with correct diagnosis and advice the contact dermatitis can actually heal completely and the patients continue in their work...|$|R
40|$|Type I <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex {{can be an}} {{important}} health problem for latex-exposed individuals (e. g., health care workers, spina bifida children). Also beyond these risk groups, a high sensitization rate of varying and partly unknown clinical relevance has been reported. Atopy represents a risk factor for latex allergy and recent studies indicate that patients suffering from pollen allergies may have pollen allergen-specific IgE antibodies which cross-react with latex allergens. In order to investigate whether sensitization to pollen allergens can have priming effects on the production of IgE antibodies against latex in vivo, a mouse model was established. Groups of 10 BALB/C mice were immunized with Al(OH) 3 -adsorbed pollen extracts from timothy grass, ragweed, mugwort, or birch. For control purposes, one additional group received adjuvant only and another group was not immunized. Half of the mice of each group were subsequently immunized with Al(OH) 3 -adsorbed latex glove extract, the other half with adjuvant only. Pollen and latex-specific IgE- and IgG 1 -antibody responses were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and statistically evaluated by analysis of variance. Antibody responses to cross-reactive antigens were investigated by immunoblotting. We found significantly increased IgE reactivities to latex after pollen sensitization and vice versa. Moreover, mice immunized with timothy grass pollen extract alone – without subsequent latex immunization – displayed IgE reactivity to latex. Cross-reactive antibodies were directed against pollen antigens of approximately 60 [*]kDa molecular weight. Our results thus demonstrate a mutual boosting effect of pollen and latex sensitization in vivo which may be also operative in polysensitized plant allergic patients...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Allergy</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex is a well-recognized health problem, {{especially}} among {{health care workers}} and patients with spina bifida. Despite latex sensitization being acquired in health institutions in both health care workers and patients with spina bifida, differences in allergen sensitization profiles have been described between these two risk groups. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vivo reactivity of health care workers and patients with spina bifida to extracts of internal and external surfaces of latex gloves and also to specific extracts enriched in major allergens for these risk groups. METHODS: Gloves from different manufacturers were used for protein extraction, and salt precipitation and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) were applied to obtain the enriched latex extracts. The major latex allergens were quantified by an enzyme immunoassay. The extracts obtained were tested in 14 volunteers using skin prick tests (SPT). RESULTS: Latex glove extracts enriched in the hydrophobic allergens that are most often seen in patients with spina bifida were obtained by selective precipitation, whereas HIC produced extracts enriched in the hydrophilic allergens commonly found in health care workers. The health care workers had positive SPTs to glove extracts from internal surfaces and to the hydrophilic allergen-enriched extracts. By contrast, patients with spina bifida had larger skin reactions both to external glove extracts and to the extracts enriched with the hydrophobic major allergens for this risk group. Despite the protein concentration of these extracts being {{less than half the}} concentration of the commercial extract, the weal-and-flare reactions were of similar magnitude. CONCLUSION: Using novel latex extracts, our study showed a different in vivo reactivity pattern in health care workers and in patients with spina bifida to extracts of the internal and external surfaces of gloves, which suggests that sensitization may occur by different routes of exposure, and that this influences the allergen reactivity profiles of these risk group...|$|R
40|$|Background Natural {{latex rubber}} {{products}} {{have been known}} to cause severe anaphylactic reactions during surgery. Even 25 years after the first description of anaphylactic reactions in the literature, natural latex rubber products are still used in pediatric surgery. Case presentation The following article describes the case of a healthy 4. 5 -year old Caucasian boy who simultaneously developed severe hypotension, tachycardia and bronchospasm during surgery for congenital strabismus sursoadductorius under uneventful anesthesia. An allergy test conducted afterwards showed natural latex rubber as the trigger for this severe intraoperative anaphylactic reaction. This case was special because of the absence of any previous clinical or anamnestical evidence of natural latex rubber allergy. The fact that the child had been previously exposed <b>to</b> natural latex <b>rubber</b> – because the boy’s mother used disposable gloves for her work as a cosmetician at home – was only discovered later. Such contact may have had a slight sensitizing effect that manifested after the initial contact with the conjunctiva through the surgeon’s natural latex rubber gloves. Conclusion Natural latex rubber products have caused severe anaphylactic reactions time and again. Diagnosis is impeded by the highly variable clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis, the non-responsivity of patients, anesthesia-induced changes in blood pressure, surgical drapes, and blood loss. Therefore, use of alternative products and implementation of the right course of action in clinical routine seems to be even more important than raising awareness for <b>allergies</b> <b>to</b> natural latex <b>rubber...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex {{has emerged}} as a major allergy among certain {{occupational}} groups and patients with underlying diseases. The sensitization and development of latex allergy has been attributed to exposure to products containing residual latex proteins. Although improved manufacturing procedures resulted in a considerable reduction of new cases, the potential risk for some patient groups is still great. In addition the prevalent cross-reactivity of latex proteins with other food allergens poses a major concern. A number of purified allergens and a few commercial kits are currently available, but no concerted effort was undertaken to evaluate them. Methods We studied 11 purified latex allergens, Hev b 1 to Hev b 10, and Hev b 13 along with several crude allergen extracts and two commercial ImmunoCAP assays to evaluate specific IgE antibody in the sera from latex allergic patients and controls. Health care workers and spina bifida patients with clinical symptoms of latex allergy, spina bifida patients without latex allergy, and non-atopic health care workers have been studied. Results The results suggest that Hev b 2, 5, 6, and 13 together identified over 80 percent health care workers with latex allergy, while Hev b 6 along with Hev b 1 or 3 detected specific IgE antibody in all sera studied from patients with spina bifida and latex allergy. The ImmunoCAP results using both Hev b 5 amplified and non-amplified closely agreed with the clinical diagnosis of latex allergy in health care workers and in spina bifida. Conclusion Although the purified allergens and crude extracts reacted diversely with IgE from different patient groups, the results indicated that use of certain combinations of purified recombinant antigens will be useful in commercial kits or in in-house assays for detecting specific IgE antibody in the sera. The results suggest that a combination of Hev b 2, 3, 5, 6, and 13 together detected specific IgE in 80 % of the sera from latex allergic patients. Both ImmunoCAPs correctly identified over 95 % of latex allergic patients, however, showed reactivity with a few normal control subjects</p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Due to the {{educational}} process inertia based on textbook literature, teaching of undergraduate students in dental schools is often behind modern practice. From the aspect of minimally invasive dentistry, composites are materials of choice for the reconstruction of most lesions in posterior teeth. The objective {{of the study was}} to systematize data about theoretical and practical teaching of undergraduate students regarding the application of posterior resin composites in the world’s dental schools and compare it with the data obtained from the School of Dental Medicine, University of Belgrade. Material and Methods. MEDLINE database was searched for articles based on keywords dental education and posterior composites. Only articles published in the last five years and those which used the same questionnaire were included in the study. Results. Data were analyzed for the dental schools from the UK and Ireland, Spain, Japan, United States and Canada. Increased theoretical and practical teaching of students regarding posterior composites is noted in most schools. The dominant contraindication for using resin composite is <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> its ingredients. <b>Rubber</b> dam is the most common method of providing aseptic conditions and dry field in the world, whereas in our school it is used in negligible number of cases. In a number of schools, metal matrices and wooden wedges are recommended for the proximal cavity restoration. Glass-ionomer cement is commonly used as a liner. Polishing and finishing of restorations is performed in the same session in 90 - 100 % of the schools except in Japan, where it is carried out after 24 hours. Conclusion.
