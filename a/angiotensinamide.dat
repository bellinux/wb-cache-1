40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the importance of some structural features of asparagyl 1 -Valyl 5 -angiotensin II (<b>angiotensinamide)</b> for its pharmacological actions, the relative potencies of <b>angiotensinamide</b> and five peptide analogues were studied on the blood pressure of the rat, the isolated rat uterus and the isolated guinea-pig ileum. All the modifications of the <b>angiotensinamide</b> structure that were studied led to a decrease of potency which, however, {{was not the same}} on all three preparations. The importance of the guanido group, the phenolic group and the length of the peptide chain for the pharmacological activities of these peptides is discussed...|$|E
