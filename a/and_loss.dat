We find a positive correspondence between a firm’s FAS 159 fair value liability gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> stock returns. Further analysis indicates that fair value gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> from liabilities attributable to the change in a firm’s own credit risk, which are considered counter-intuitive by critics of fair value accounting for liabilities, are also positively related to returns. Lastly, we document that the volatility of earnings that incorporate FAS 159 liability fair value gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> is positively associated with market measures of firm risk. Our study contributes to the controversy over recognition of liability fair value gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> by providing direct empirical evidence that such gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are perceived as economic income by market participants...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the economic implications of fair value liability gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> {{arising from the}} adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (hereafter, FAS 159). Consistent {{with the notion that}} gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> contain value-relevant information, we find a positive correspondence between a firm’s FAS 159 fair value liability gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> current period stock returns. However, further analysis indicates that fair value gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> from liabilities have a negative association with future returns, suggesting that investors misprice this earnings component. This negative association is stronger for firms with low levels of institutional ownership. While the value-relevance tests provide some evidence that fair value changes from liabilities have information content, the negative association with future stock returns suggests that these gains are eventually not realizable or that the market has overreacted to the initial recognition of these gains. Overall, our study contributes evidence regarding the controversy over the recognition of fair value liability gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> by providing direct empirical evidence that such gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are priced by the stock market but subsequently reversed within the next 12 months...|$|R

40|$|A reward or {{punishment}} {{can seem}} {{better or worse}} depending on what else might have happened. Little is known, however, about how neural representations of an anticipated incentive might {{be influenced by the}} available alternatives. We used event-related FMRI to investigate the activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while we varied the available alternative incentives in a monetary incentive delay task. Some task blocks included only uncertain gains and losses; others included the same uncertain gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> intermixed with certain gains <b>and</b> <b>losses.</b> The availability of certain gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> increased NAcc activation for uncertain <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> decreased the difference between uncertain gains <b>and</b> <b>losses.</b> We suggest that this pattern of activation can result from reference point changes across blocks, and that the worst available loss may serve as an important anchor for NAcc activation. These findings imply that NAcc activation represents anticipated incentive value relative to the current context of available alternative gains <b>and</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Developmental psychologists {{traditionally}} have conceived of childhood pri-marily {{as a time}} of positive change, or gain, and old age primarily as a time of negative change, or loss. Life-span developmental psychologists recently have challenged these assumptions, asserting that gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are ubiquitous across the life span. While generally supporting this assertion, we suggest hat the relation between developmental gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> needs {{to be considered in}} more depth. Even life-span developmentalists eem to have assumed that gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are causally related, and that the direction of causality is determined by age. In this paper, we review previous considerations of gains <b>and</b> <b>losses.</b> Then, we show that losses during early life are not necessarily responses to gains, and that gains during later life are not necessarily responses to losses. Finally we suggest criteria and methods for assessing four alternative models (unrelated phe-nomenon, spurious phenomenon, suppression, and compensation) relevant to the causality and directionality of the relation between developmental gains <b>and</b> <b>losses.</b> 6 1989 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R

When mode-division-multiplexed signals occupy a bandwidth far larger than the coherence bandwidth, the mode-dependent gains <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> are averaged over frequency, causing the outage capacity to approach the average capacity. The difference between the average and outage capacities is found to be inversely proportional to the square-root of a diversity order that is given approximately by the ratio of the signal bandwidth to the coherence bandwidth.
