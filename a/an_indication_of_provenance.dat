Alavida Lifestyles Inc. 2011 2 S.C.R. 387, is a Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} {{concerning the}} relevant criteria and basic approach to be {{undertaken by the}} Court in analyzing the likelihood of confusion in Canadian trademark law under the Trade-marks Act, 1985 [...] The test adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada is whether, {{as a matter of}} first impression, the “casual consumer somewhat in a hurry” who encounters the Alavida trade-mark, with no more than an imperfect recollection of any one of the Masterpiece Inc. trade-marks or trade-name, would be likely to think that Alavida was the same source of retirement residence services as Masterpiece Inc. Furthermore, Rothstein J. affirmed a consumer protection principle of trade-marks as <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance,</b> [...] "providing consumers with a reliable indication of the expected source of wares or services." [...] Rothstein J. delivering the majority judgment of the Court held that Alavida’s proposed trade-mark “Masterpiece Living” was confusing with at least one of Masterpiece Inc.’s trade-marks when the registration application was filed on December 1, 2005. Alavida was therefore deemed to be not entitled to registration of its proposed marks, allowing then for the Registrar of Trade-marks to expunge Alavida’s registration from the registrar.|$|E

X-ray fluore-scence and diffraction (XRF and XRD, respec-tively) and Fourier transform infrared spectro-scopy (FTIR) analyses of the mineral recovered at Pico Centeno mining district provides a baseline mineral signature, which was then compared to other Iberian sources and beads from SW Iberian megalithic tombs. We found that the concentrations of trace elements don not allow establishing provenance of the beads, as traditionally claimed. Instead we found that different proportions of phosphate species, which results in P/Al ratios higher than 1, arose during {{the genesis of the}} variscite deposits, modifying the concentra-tions of PO 43 –, H 2 PO 4 – and HPO 42 –.

Magnetic {{mineral inclusion}} characterisation {{is performed using}} a variety of magnetic properties that are related to magnetic mineral abundance, magnetic grain size (domain state), oxidation state and magnetic grain interaction. The magnetic methodology extends that based on a conventional set of environmental magnetic measurements.

Using case studies from the marine Upper Jurassic (Piper Formation) and non-marine Triassic sediments (Otter Bank Sandstone and Foula Sandstone Formations), it is shown that provenance differences, clearly expressed by the results of heavy mineral analysis, are also sensitively displayed by the magnetic mineral inclusion data. The provenance classification is based around use of hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. Simple statistical tools are developed to determine a least-noisy subset of magnetic parameters, which are most suitable for stratigraphic provenance discrimination.

40|$|About sixty well sorted (average {{diameter}} 0. 8 cm) volcanic clasts with tholeiitic affinities {{were found}} {{in the midst of an}} lower Maastrichtian conglomerate outcropping close to Bovec (Slovenian Basin, NW Slovenia) and interpreted as evidence of a deltaic system. The clasts appear to be variably spilitized (i. e. albitization of plagioclase and anomalous Na content), however, they do not show any evidence of sub-solidus recrystallization. The analysis, carried out on nineteen selected samples, point out similar petrographic textures and a strong arc-type chemical signature (i. e. deep Nb negative anomaly, quite low La/Sm and Th/Zr ratio and normative corundum). Chemical data allow us to distinguish, for comparable grade of evolution, variable LREE contents which cannot be related only to crystal fractionation or to a variable grade of crustal contamination, but require compositional differences in the protolithic sources. To have <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>provenance</b> <b>of</b> these clasts, and about their related hydrographic system, their chemical features were compared to those of similarly evolved pre-Maastrichtian magmatic rocks of different ages, locations and geological settings, mainly belonging to the Dinaridic-Carpathian region. Such a comparison seems to indicate a particular affinity with the arc-type magmas which outcropped in the Vardar Ocean in Jurassic times. In particular Bovec clasts show strong chemical similarities with metabasites from the ophiolitic complexes of the Evros (Rhodopes) and Vardar Zone, while they appear quite different from both the more depleted samples from Bükk Mountains (Hungary), and all the calc-alkaline compositions considered. The grain size of the clasts and the complete absence of recrystallization suggest a provenance from a quite delimited and close protolithic area (1 – 3 hundred kilometers) that did not suffer from sub-solidus recrystallization during Late Cretaceous time...|$|R
40|$|During the Late Roman and Byzantine period, natron {{glass was}} made from its raw {{materials}} in {{a limited number of}} primary production centres in Egypt and Syro-Palestine. For the earlier Hellenistic and Roman period, no primary furnaces have been found and the location of primary production during this era remains unclear. Ancient authors such as Strabo and Pliny the Elder suggest that glassmaking sands were found near the River Belus (Israel), in Egypt, near the mouth of the Volturno River (Italy) and also in Spain and France. However, primary production {{in the western part of}} the Mediterranean is not supported by any direct archaeological evidence and possible sand raw materials from these regions have never been evaluated for their suitability to produce glass. In this study the possible existence of a Roman primary glass industry in the western Mediterranean is investigated, based on the occurrence of suitable sand raw materials. 178 beach sands from Spain, France and Italy are evaluated for their suitability for glass production by calculating the composition of hypothetical glasses made from these sands and comparing them to Roman natron glass. The results show that good glassmaking sands are far from common. Only a very limited number of the 178 beach sands analysed would produce a glass with major and minor elemental compositions within the ranges of Roman imperial natron glass. The rest of the sands analysed are unsuitable for glass production in their present form due to their insufficient SiO 2, high Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3, and either too low or too high CaO contents. If the sand raw material was too low in CaO, extra lime could be added to the glass batch in the form of shell or limestone. This was taken into account in a second calculation. Overall, six limited areas could be define where suitable sand raw materials would have been available to the Roman glassmaker. Good glassmaking sands occur in the Basilicata and Puglia Regions (SE Italy), and Tuscany (W Italy). After the addition of an extra source of lime, sands from the Huelva Province (SW Spain), the Murcia Region (SE Spain) and from the Provence (SE France) would also produce glasses with a typical Roman composition. The suitability of the suggested sands was checked by performing a series of melting experiments, which provide further insights in the way Roman glass makers would have had to prepare their raw materials and the used batch recipes. Because of the complex nature of Roman natron glass, the provenance determination of this material remains one of the most challenging problems in the field of archaeometry. In the past decades, several attempts have been made to determine the provenance of ancient glass based on major, minor and trace elemental compositions, rare earth element patterns and isotopic signatures of O, Pb, Sr and Nd. Unfortunately, the major elemental composition of natron glass is relatively uniform and specific objects can almost never be uniquely assigned to their origin. Although the use of Sr and Nd isotope ratios and trace element signatures as <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> has proven promising, there are still unknown factors. The bulk of the Sr in natron glass is believed to have been incorporated with the lime bearing material. Where the lime was derived from Holocene seashell, the Sr isotopic composition of the glass would reflect that of modern seawater. Where the lime was derived from geologically aged limestone, the signature would reflect that of seawater at the time the limestone was deposited, possibly modified by diagenesis. However, also other minerals in the sand, such as feldspar and mica, can influence the Sr budget of the glass batch. Nd in natron based glass originates from the non-quartz mineral fraction of the silica raw material, which is most probably sand. It is well known that the &# 949;Nd value of deep-sea sediments in the eastern Mediterranean varies significantly due to the varying sediment influx from the Nile (fluvial), the Sahara (eolian) and the European continent (fluvial) and shows a pronounced E-W gradient from as high as - 1 at the mouth of the River Nile and the coasts of Egypt and Israel, to - 12 south of Sicily. In the western Mediterranean, the distribution of the Nd isotopic composition is less well known. Only very few results for river particulates and deep sea sediments are published and they all show rather low &# 949;Nd value of around - 10. Although it is not possible to directly compare the Nd isotopic signature of glass to sea-floor sediment, such significant differences between the easternmost part of the Mediterranean Sea and the rest of the basin offer a great potential in tracing the origins of sand raw materials used in primary glass production. Trace elements in raw natron glass are related to the accessory minerals in the glassmaking sand. The mineralogy of the heavy mineral fraction of a sand deposit is determined by the composition of the source rocks and is often a good indication of its origin. However, also the other raw materials, such as the natron and the lime, introduce traces of specific elements to the glass batch. Especially the transition metals, such as Mn, Co, Cu, Sb and Pb, are strongly influenced by the addition of colouring or decolouring agents. Recycling of glass cullet, including small quantities of coloured glass, results in elevated concentrations of these elements. In this study, the applicability of Sr and Nd isotopes and trace elemental analysis for provenancing natron glass is evaluated. A database of Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of possible sand raw materials from the western Mediterranean is presented, as a means of comparison for the growing number of isotopic studies on ancient glass. It is shown that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in natron glass is significantly influenced by the silicate fraction of the sand used and does not always provide a clear indication of the lime source used. The 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotope ratio and &# 949;Nd value of sands is a good indicator for their geological (and sometimes geographical) provenance. The variation of the isotopic composition of Nd in beach sands along the Mediterranean coasts of Spain, France and Italy is presented, and the relation between the Nd isotopic signatures and geologically distinct regions is explained. The use of the isotopic signature of Nd as a proxy for the source of silica in glass is, however, not always straightforward because of the possible overlap of signatures from different suppliers. However, when used in combination with trace element geochemistry, raw natron glass and sand raw materials from the known production centres in the Levant can be readily distinguished from the suitable glassmaking sands identified in the western part of the Mediterranean. Ti, Cr, Sr, Zr and Ba are shown to be the most useful elements for provenancing natron glass. A comparison between the range of the Nd isotope ratios of suitable glassmaking sands and archaeological natron glass from around the Mediterranean, indicates primary production in both the east and west. Hellenistic and Roman (2 nd century BC to 4 th century AD) natron glasses show a wide range of Nd isotopic compositions. This may suggest raw glass production all around the Mediterranean Sea but can also reflect intense recycling of glass from a few big glass producers scattered around the Mediterranean. During the Late Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic period (5 th to 7 th century AD) large scale raw glass production appears to be restricted to the eastern Mediterranean. nrpages: 148 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Among {{other forms}} in the lexicon of Hesychius a preverb ζά ‘much, very’, without <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the dialectal <b>provenance</b> can be found; this form has been quoted as a typical Lesbian {{formation}} by Johannes Grammaticus Philoponus (490 - 580 AD) in his work on Lesbian dialect.

The forms with ζα- are attested also in Homeric poems, and as probable Homeric elements they occur also in the Archaic Lyric. According to Hoffmann, all the glosses found in Hesychius, which display the use of the preverb ζά in place of διά should be interpreted as originating from the Lesbian dialect. It seems however more probable to consider the big group of compound glosses consisting of ζα- to be rather poetical formations. They all belong to the poetical diction (even if the possibility of existing in the vernacular use in some cases cannot be excluded), where since early Epic the metrically caused variants ζα- and δια- existed hand in hand. The occurring interchange ζά for διά for the metrical reason in Sappho and Alcaeus should then be considered another element of Epic/Homeric influence upon an independent Aeolic poetical tradition...|$|R
40|$|Background: Evidence {{suggests}} that consumers potentially put themselves at risk when purchasing medicines on-line. Whilst logos provided by regulators may provide {{some level of}} reassurance {{there may be other}} indicators which could be used by consumers to identify those websites which may be safely used. Objectives: Identify characteristics of on-line pharmacies which are related to whether websites are regulated or non-regulated and those characteristics which could be used by patients to increase the likelihood of accessing regulated sites. Setting: Online pharmacies which supply diazepam, fluoxetine and simvastatin. Methods: Using piloted search terms via Google and Yahoo search engines, identified websites were screened for regulatory status, adherence to regulatory standards, administrative requirements, clinical assessment requirements and additional details deemed to be of relevance to a user. Characteristics of regulated and non-regulated (defined as those with an absence of a correctly linked regulatory logo) websites were compared to identify differences which could be used to improve patient safety. Main outcome measure: Regulatory status, adherence to regulatory standards, quality of information provision, barriers to medicines access. Results: 113 websites sold diazepam, fluoxetine and simvastatin; were identified within the first 100 results. Less than quarter were found to be regulated online pharmacies. 80 websites were willing to sell the medication without a prescription. The unregulated internet pharmacy websites (defined as those with an absence of a correctly linked regulatory logo) were found to adhere more closely to the clinical criteria, were less significantly likely to disclose a contact name and address, telephone number of the pharmacy or demand a prescription prior to sale (P. 05, Fisher’s Exact). Conclusions: The three prescription-only medicines which are liable to abuse, have potentially serious interactions and require counselling to ensure patient safety are readily available via the internet. When purchasing medicines via this route UK consumers should be made {{aware of the importance of}} regulatory logos and additionally should ensure that the seller can be meaningfully contacted by the contact details provided.
