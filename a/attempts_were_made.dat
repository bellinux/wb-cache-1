5|$|Multiple escape <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> {{throughout}} the history of the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made,</b> tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to {{keep a close eye on}} others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|A Maralinga cleanup {{operation}} codenamed Operation Brumby {{was conducted}} in 1967. <b>Attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to dilute the concentration of radioactive material by turning over and mixing the surface soil.

In 982AD the Icelandic Althing (parliament) passed laws prohibiting the importation of horses into Iceland, thus ending crossbreeding. The breed has now been bred pure in Iceland for more than 1,000years.|$|E

50|$|In 1884 an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> at {{autonomy}} {{with the}} formation of two West Indian Conferences, however by 1903 the venture had failed. It was not until the 1960s that another <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> at autonomy. This second attempt resulted in the emergence of the Methodist Church in the Caribbean and the Americas in May 1967.|$|R
5|$|Dodington was {{the site}} of the Buckingham Mine where copper was extracted. The mine was {{established}} before 1725 and followed earlier exploration at Perry Hill, East Quantoxhead. It was financed by the Marquis of Buckingham until 1801 when it was closed, until various <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to reopen it during the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Prior to selection, the Maralinga {{site was}} {{inhabited}} by the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara Aboriginal people, {{for whom it}} had a great spiritual significance. Many were relocated to a new settlement at Yalata, and <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to curtail access to the Maralinga site. These were often unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{increasing}} commercial and business activity on Jaffa Road never materialized. Several <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> {{to bring a}} pedestrian presence to the street, such as {{the construction of the}} Windows residential tower next door, but to date nothing has been successful and the project has been deemed a commercial failure.|$|E

5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> {{to alter the}} Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back {{in the direction of}} his Virginia plan.|$|E
5|$|By 1906, erosion {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{at the base}} of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> at preservation, rot had already set in, and the tree was permanently weakened.|$|E
5|$|For centuries {{there has}} been a general market held each Friday in the Market Place. The market has been in decline for some years and in 2010 <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to {{revitalise}} it. However, after initial interest, the number of stallholders slowly decreased. In recent months a number of suitcase traders have been supporting the market on a regular basis and this has attracted local interest.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Tintin in the Congo came under {{criticism}} for both its perceived racist colonial {{attitude toward the}} Congolese and for its glorification of big-game hunting. Accordingly, <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing {{it as one of}} Herg√©'s weakest works.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} Republic, <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by the {{aristocracy}} to limit the increasing level of chaos associated with the obstructive tendencies and democratic impulses {{of some of the}} senators.

Other laws were enacted to outlaw the so-called omnibus bills, which are bills, usually enacted by a single vote, that contain a large volume of often unrelated material.|$|E
5|$|Other federal {{government}} agencies also worked to undermine organizations, {{such as the}} CPUSA, they considered subversive: The Internal Revenue Service investigated 81organizations that were deemed to be subversive, threatening to revoke their tax exempt status; Congress passed a law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining federal housing benefits; and <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to deny Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers.|$|E
