25|$|For each {{natural number}} k {{there is a}} sort of {{variables}} that ranges over all k-ary relations on the individuals. If R is such a k-ary relation variable and t1,..., t'k are first-order terms then the expression R(t1,...,t'k) is an <b>atomic</b> <b>formula.</b>|$|E
5000|$|These wffs are {{compound}} formulae. They are not <b>atomic</b> <b>formulae</b> but {{are built}} up from <b>atomic</b> <b>formulae</b> using logical connectives. They are also not sentences because they contain free variables:* F(x) ∧ G(a, z)* G(a, z) ∨ H(x, y, z) ...|$|R

25|$|A sort of {{variables}} that range over sets of individuals. If S is a variable {{of this sort}} and t is a first-order term then the expression t ∈ S (also written S(t), or St to save parentheses) is an <b>atomic</b> <b>formula.</b> Sets of individuals can also be viewed as unary relations on the domain.|$|E
25|$|Systems of {{constructive}} set theory, such as CST, CZF, and IZF, embed their set axioms in intuitionistic {{instead of}} classical logic. Yet other systems accept classical logic but feature a nonstandard membership relation. These include {{rough set theory}} and fuzzy set theory, in which {{the value of an}} <b>atomic</b> <b>formula</b> embodying the membership relation is not simply True or False. The Boolean-valued models of ZFC are a related subject.|$|E

50|$|This {{process is}} {{continued}} until {{there are only}} <b>atomic</b> <b>formulas</b> in each side. The process can be graphically described by a rooted tree graph, as depicted on the right.

2500|$|Expand {{the formula}} [...] into a formula [...] in the {{language}} of the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory with automorphism j using the definition of membership in the model of NFU. Application of any power of j to both sides of an equation or membership statement preserves its truth value because j is an automorphism. Make such an application to each <b>atomic</b> <b>formula</b> in [...] in such a way that each variable x assigned type i occurs with exactly [...] applications of j. This is possible thanks to the form of the atomic membership statements derived from NFU membership statements, and to the formula being stratified. Each quantified sentence [...] can be converted to the form [...] (and similarly for existential quantifiers). Carry out this transformation everywhere and obtain a formula [...] in which j is never applied to a bound variable.|$|E
