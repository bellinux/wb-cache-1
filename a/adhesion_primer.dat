40|$|The recent {{development}} of Raman microscopes with high optical throughput and very sensitive CCD cameras {{has led to}} Raman spectroscopy again competing effectively with FTIR methods for materials analysis. Modem Raman instruments, designed to operate confocally without serious alignment or energy trade-off problems, allow depth profiling of optically transparent polymers and polymer matrices to be routinely obtained with a spatial resolution of 1 - 2 mu m. The use of such an instrument is illustrated by describing recent work on polymeric material problems including, 1 The distribution and redistribution of small molecules in polymeric matrices. 2 The monitoring of <b>adhesion</b> <b>primer</b> diffusion at a polymer/silica interface. 3 The determination {{of the extent of}} interdiffusion and interaction at a polymer/polymer interface. 4 A comparison of confocal and micotoming approaches to polymer laminate analysis. The range of possible applications is increasing rapidly. It is clear that Raman microscopy will become a very important tool for future materials analysis, both in the polymer area and many other areas...|$|E
40|$|Bolts, {{shotcrete}} and mesh {{are today}} {{a part of}} the standard ground support system, although it becomes economically challenging to combine them sufficiently to support seismically active ground that requires increased yielding and energy-absorbing capabilities. An alternative to the current ground support system is the Thin Spray− On Liner (TSL) that may possess significant yielding properties. TSL has the potential ability to support seismically active ground in terms of deformation and rock bursting, common in deep mining. This thesis is {{a part of the}} investigation; to prove whether the current formulation of the Thin Spray− On Liner could be implemented as an alternative ground support system and improve the support capabilities for complex ground types. The thesis will complete and deliver a conclusive trial site results summary. A qualified ground control team put together a set of 11 large-scale trials in an underground environment within an active mine, Nickel Rim South in Sudbury. Each trial examined the geotechnical capabilities with respect to the engineering and health & safety aspects of the TSL. These trials are a Proof of Concept phase towards proving the liner as a superior component in underground rock support. This TSL was developed to achieve the de-bonding, toughness and tear resistant ground support parameters. The thesis focuses on the specific geotechnical testing conducted at the Nickel Rim South Mine during the first quarter of 2012. Subsequent testing has been completed and liner development continues that is not covered within this thesis. Out of the 11 planned tests, 8 were executed during this period, and the rest will be executed later. Some of the results from the test trials are of a long− term nature and therefore the majority of the test results are not yet available. Before any tests could be executed, the isocyanate levels were measured and the results served as a base when setting up the PPE (Personal protective equipment) safety protocol. In addition some practical concerns arose during the trials, which were successfully solved after a few adjustments. The test results available for the full composite liner material concluded that peel− back at the leading edge next to the face blast, together with fly− rock damage, was severe, due to primer adhesion failure and this test was therefore considered to have failed. A comment should made in qualification of the above statement that the leading edge of the PCM(Polymeric Composite Membrane) was not bolted which was contrary to the project scope that suggested treating the PCM much like mesh prior to a blast and the wall was not high-pressure water scaled. The same test was performed on topcoat only, with significant improvement. The coverage of the topcoat only on top of shotcrete is poor, due to the pebbly nature and fibers protruding out from the shotcrete. The robot managed to apply the TSL with sufficient coverage and consistent thickness on the walls and the pillar nose, except for the edges where the guns flip over occurred and missed large perimeter patches, which was not dealt with till later in the testing. These results indicate the requirement of a rehab procedure for damage caused to the liner, although the damage could partly appear due to the fact that the top coat could have been not yet fully cured and in its strength building process at the time of face blast. No determination was made of the PCMs actual strength required at the time of face blast during the cure cycle. There are speculations whether adhesion failure could be diminished by using a higher <b>adhesion</b> <b>primer</b> but without the foaming properties, which would result in a primer with lacking properties to fill the gaps for superior coverage while providing higher adhesion. In addition, bolting of the leading edge could be implemented to partially address the peeling issue. It is however important to investigate that the adhesion fails due to a rock failure and retains the loose material, unlike adhere and tear. The trial results are only investigated on the rock walls, in order to make a fair judgment on the liners performance and capability it should in addition be applied on the shoulders and the back to accomplish full rounds.

40|$|Magnesium is {{electrochemically}} {{the most}} active metal employed in common structural alloys of iron and aluminum. Mg is widely used as a sacrificial anode to provide cathodic protection of underground and undersea metallic structures, ships, submarines, bridges, decks, aircraft and ground transportation systems. Following the same principle of utilizing Mg characteristics in engineering advantages in a decade-long successful R&D effort, Mg powder is now employed in organic coatings (termed as Mg-rich primers) as a sacrificial anode pigment to protect aerospace grade aluminum alloys against corrosion. Mg-rich primers have performed very well on aluminum alloys when compared against the current chromate standard, but the carcinogenic chromate-based coatings/pretreatments are being widely used by the Department of Defense (DoD) to protect its infrastructure and fleets against corrosion damage.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in corrosion prevention by protective coatings is the loss of coating adhesion under environmental influence. In this work, the adhesion of epoxy cataphoretic coatings was examined on steel and steel modified by Zn–Fe and Zn–Co alloys. The dry and wet <b>adhesions</b> of epoxy <b>primers</b> were measured by the direct pull-off standardized procedure, as well as indirectly by the NMP test. The corrosion stability of the coated samples was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was shown that under dry testing conditions all the samples exhibited very good adhesion. However, different trends of adhesion loss of different protective systems during exposure to a corrosive agent (3 % NaCl solution) were observed. The lowest adhesion values were obtained for epoxy coating on the steel substrate. The change in adhesion of the epoxy coating on steel modified by Zn–Co alloy during immersion in 3 % NaCl solution for 24 days was the smallest of all the investigated samples. Electrochemical impedance measurements in 3 % NaCl solution confirmed the good protective properties of this protective system, i. e., greater values of pore resistance were obtained...|$|R

Group II was handled similarly to Group I, except that Ortho Primer was applied instead of XT Primer. After etching, the enamel in Group III was contaminated with saliva, Ortho Primer was then applied and bonding performed using Transbond XT. In Group IV, Concise was used conventionally.

40|$|A {{thermoplastic}} adhesive bonding process {{was developed for}} galvanized steel to polypropylene (PP) composite using a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) based adhesive with a total process cycle of less than 120 seconds. The processing temperature significantly affected the strength of adhesive bonded lap joints. Cataplasma and cyclic moisture/temperature aging tests demonstrated that the hot-dipped galvanized steel with a polyester melamine based primer did not improve the joint durability of galvanized steel to PP composite bonded with this HDPE based adhesive. The significant loss in the <b>adhesion</b> of the <b>primer</b> to galvanized steel under Cataplasma environment {{was due to the}} blistering of the primer. The blistering was essentially a process of the cathodic disbondment. ^ The fracture performance of HDPE based adhesive bonded double cantilever beam (DCB) aluminum joints was investigated. The fracture toughness, 1. 77 kJ/m 2, of the joints with a bondline thickness of 0. 2 mm at a testing crosshead speed of 5. 08 mm/minute, derived from beam theory equation, was significantly different from fracture toughness, 2. 54 kJ/m 2, obtained by cohesive zone model (CZM) approach, in which Needleman 2 ̆ 7 s modified exponential traction-separation law was employed. The large amount of deformation occurring in adhesive ahead of the crack tip significantly contributes the fracture toughness of joints. A modified equation was proposed to compute the fracture toughness of the adhesive bonded DCB joints. ^ The mechanical properties of the adhesive bonded DCB joints are strongly rate-dependent due to the viscoelasticity of the adhesive layer. A new rate-dependent cohesive zone model was developed to analyze the rate-dependent fracture behavior. The model consists of a rate-independent cohesive zone model in parallel to a Maxwell element. The numerical simulations were in good agreement with the experimental data for various testing crosshead speeds and for a relaxation test. A generalized rate-dependent CZM was suggested. ...|$|R
40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau d'Enginyeria Química, Facultat de Química, Universitat de Barcelona, Curs: 2013 - 2014, Tutors: José Maria Gutiérrez González, Carmen González Azón i Luis Martínez BarrioThe {{demand for}} a higher plastic content in {{automobiles}} {{in order to increase}} gas mileage by decreasing vehicle weight creates a need to develop coatings that will adhere to these materials. Adhesion to thermoplastic olefin (TPO) substrates, like blends of polypropylene (PP), is often difficult to attain due to the low surface energy and the nonpolar nature of the surface. One always specifies, therefore, that the surface of the substrate must be pretreated. Pretreatment methods can vary, from oxidation of the surface, e. g., plasma or flame, to diffusion and mechanical interlocking of an applied polymer to the surface. Mechanical interlocking to the nonpolar TPO surface can be achieved through the use of an adhesion promoter, namely a chlorinated polyolefin (CPO). The type of CPO used, in addition to the types of solvents and flame treatments used, can substantially influence the degree of adhesion/cohesion obtained within the CPO/TPO system. PP is a TPO that is used in automobile construction. In this report it is described a set of experiments that provide quantitative information about how CPOs optimize the adhesion of a commercial primer coating to PP. The study was performed according to eight CPOs and two different ways of flame treatment. The CPOs were prepared by mixing them with a standard primer in order to investigate what type of CPO optimized better the <b>adhesion</b> of the <b>primer</b> to a PP substrate. On the other hand, the experiments were started with non ideal parameters for the flame treatment and were changed for the final experiment to work at its best. To study the paint adhesion a steam jet test was used. This consists of an assay based in high pressure cleaners. A hot water jet impacts into the paint system during a specific time and tests the paint adhesion to the substrate...|$|R

The current metal coating process is a multi-step process. The surface is cleaned, primered, dried and then painted. The process is labor intensive and time consuming. The wash primer is a conversion coating, which prepares metal surface for better paint <b>adhesion.</b> The wash <b>primers</b> currently used often contain hexavalent chromium (Cr 6 +), which seals the pores in the conversion coating. The presence of hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) make waste disposal expensive and pose dangers to workers. The novel technique of in-situ phosphatizing coating (ISPC) is a single-step, chrome-free alternative to the present coating practice. Formulation of an ISPC involves predispersal of an in-situ phosphatizing reagent (ISPR) into the paint system to form a stable formulation. The ISPR reacts with the metal surface and bonds with the paint film simultaneously, which eliminates the need for a conversion coating. In acid catalyzed paint systems, such as polyester-melamine paints, the ISPR also catalyzes cross-linking reactions between the melamine and the polyester polyols. ISPCs are formulated using commercially available coating systems including: polyester-melamine, two-component epoxy, polyurethane and high-hydroxy content polyester-melamine coil coating. The ISPCs are applied to metal substrates and their performances are evaluated using electrochemical, thermal and standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing methods. In addition, ISPCs were designed and formulated based on: (1) phosphate chemistry, (2) polymer chemistry, (3) sol-gel chemistry, and (4) the ion-exchange principle. Organo-functionalized silanes, which serve as excellent coupling and dispersion agents, are incorporated into the optimized ISPC formula and evaluated using standard ASTM testing methods and electrochemical spectroscopy. Also, an ion-exchange pigment, which leads to better adhesion by forming a mixed metal silicate surface, is dispersed into an ISPC and the performance of the final coating formulation is evaluated. Successful ISPCs formulated for multiple coating systems exhibited excellent adhesion, hardness and gloss, which supports their suitability as a chrome-free, single-step alternative for aerospace, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and coil coating applications...|$|R
