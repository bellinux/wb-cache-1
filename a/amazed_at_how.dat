500|$|West asked comedian Chris Rock {{to appear}} on the song. Rock, a fan of West's, mused that he was more than happy to {{collaborate}} with West, and said, [...] "you'd be <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> many people want to work with you if you just ask, if you just make a call." [...] He had previously collaborated on other hip hop songs, such as with rappers Ludacris, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Ice Cube on the track [...] "You Ain't Gotta Lie (Ta Kick It)". Rock described his collaboration with West as exciting in nature, commenting that he was always open to working on unusual ventures.

After the presentation I said, 'Al, I'm absolutely blown away. There's a lot of details you could get wrong.'...I could find no error." [...] Michael Shermer, scientific author and founder of The Skeptics Society, wrote in Scientific American that Gore's slide show [...] "shocked {{me out of my}} doubting stance."

He was anointed with the Spirit without measure (John 3:34). 2. He had all grace perfect in him (John 1:16). 3. Never none so soaked in the bosom of his Father's love as himself (Prov 8:23-30). 4. Never none so {{harmless}} and without sin as he was, and, consequently, never man had so good a conscience as he had (Heb 7:26). 5. Never none prepared such a stock of good works to bear him company at the hour of death as he. 6. Never none had greater assurance of being with the Father eternally in the heavens than he. And yet, behold, when he comes to die, how weak is he, <b>how</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> death, <b>how</b> heavy, how exceeding sorrowful! and, I say, no cause assigned but the approach of death.|$|R
500|$|Giving {{the episode}} a 7.5 out of 10, Eric Walters of Paste stated, that [...] "Unlike last year, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{did not feel}} like a Flash episode {{featuring}} Team Arrow." [...] He expected the 2015 crossover would be bigger than previous years' noting: [...] "It is, but it's also far from complete." [...] He felt that [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{was not so much}} a The Flash episode, but more like [...] "the first half of something much larger". In the end, he wished [...] "the show had embraced it fully". Den of Geek's Mike Cecchini gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, saying: [...] "I'm really kind of <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> just <b>how</b> much work [...] "Legends of Today" [...] gets done without just becoming a massive mess." [...] He described it as [...] "a proper two-parter this year" [...] and concluded: [...] "Amidst all the Legends of Tomorrow hooplah and the fun of getting the teams together, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] still manages to move the main Flash season 2 storyline forward in a couple of neat ways." ...|$|R
500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E
500|$|Bates goes {{hunting with}} a native, who brings down a crested oropendola with a {{blowpipe}} {{at a range}} of 30 yards (27 metres); {{he notes that the}} usefully silent weapon can kill at twice that range, but that he and Wallace [...] "found it very difficult to hold steady the long tubes". Around a campfire, he listens to tales; the Bouto or river dolphin used to take [...] "the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging loose to her heels, and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega, to entice the young men down to the water" [...] where the Bouto would grab them and [...] "plunge beneath the waves with a triumphant cry". They go turtle-hunting; and Bates kills an alligator with a heavy stick. He finds many footprints of the jaguar, and [...] "the great pleasure" [...] of seeing the [...] "rare and curious umbrella bird". Arrived in Catua, he admires a woman of 17: [...] "her figure was almost faultless", and her blue mouth [...] "gave quite a captivating finish to her appearance", but she was [...] "extremely bashful". He is <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> much alcohol the [...] "shy Indian and Mameluco maidens" [...] can drink, never giving way to their suitors without it.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although at {{the time}} of Zero-on Niikuni was not yet aware of the {{international}} avant-garde poetry movement, he arrived at the same methodology as the concrete poetry movement in countries that used the alphabet. When Pierre Garnier saw Zero-on, he was <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> similar works they strove for and produced although the languages they spoke differed so much. This was the beginning of their friendship. Later, Garnier and Niikuni collaborated on Nichifutsu Shishū (...) , producing works such as the Micropoem. Niikuni was noted abroad {{as an example of a}} writer that relied on ideographs (kanji), and requests to display his works kept coming in. Niikuni progressed to methods like graphic design and emphasizing communication after Zero-on, but he would not budge from expressing through kanji characters.|$|E

2500|$|During filming, {{fourteen}} different {{horses were}} used as the main horse character Joey, eight of them portraying him as an adult animal, four as a colt and two as foals; four horses played the other main equine character, Topthorn. Up to 280 horses were used in a single scene. A farrier was on set to replace horseshoes sucked off in the mud during filming, and the horses playing the main horse characters had a specialist equine make-up team, with their coats dyed and markings added to ensure continuity. Equine artist Ali Bannister {{was responsible for the}} 'hair and make-up' of the horses, as well as drawing the sketches of horses that are featured in the film. Extra filming involving a bay foal took place in California in March 2011. Working with horses on this scale was a new experience for Spielberg, who commented: [...] "The horses were an extraordinary experience for me, because several members of my family ride. I was really <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> expressive horses are and how much they can show what they’re feeling." ...|$|E

2500|$|New Bedford was {{featured}} on America's Most Wanted on February 11, 2006, for three unsolved murders: that of Marcus Cruz in 2001, Cecil Lopes III in 2004, and Dana Haywood in 2005, run {{as part of}} a report on the Stop Snitching phenomenon that has hindered police investigations nationwide. [...] "Americas Most Wanted" [...] senior correspondent Tom Morris, who spoke with sources in New Bedford for the piece, said he usually cannot discuss the number or content of calls in response to a particular segment. But he said he'd make an exception in this case. [...] "I was <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> minimal the response was. I'm still wondering if we actually aired the show or not," [...] he said. [...] "We expected people to call in and maybe say 'Hey, I was there July 4 when Dana Haywood was killed' ... but we received no useful information." [...] The show received just a handful of calls and one e-mail thanking its producers for running it, the fewest ever for any episode in the show's history, Mr. Morris said. [...] "I've been doing this for 13 years," [...] he said. [...] "I was really surprised by this." [...] He said the show, which aired Feb. 11, received good ratings.|$|E

5000|$|... "Alternative R&B" [...] {{was once}} {{used by the}} music {{industry}} during the late 1990s to market neo soul artists, such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, and Maxwell. There has been a variety of discussion about the differing genre terms, with several critics describing the music under the broad category of [...] "alternative R&B" [...] or [...] "indie R&B". The term [...] "hipster R&B" [...] has been commonly used, as has the term [...] "PBR&B"—a combination of [...] "PBR" [...] (the abbreviation for Pabst Blue Ribbon, a beer most recently associated with the hipster subculture) and R&B. The first use of [...] "PBR&B" [...] was on Twitter by Sound of the City writer Eric Harvey on a March 22, 2011, post. Three years later, <b>amazed</b> and distressed <b>at</b> <b>how</b> far the term—meant as a joke—had traveled, Harvey wrote an extensive essay about it for Pitchfork. Slate suggests the name [...] "R-Neg-B", as a reference to [...] "negging". The genre has sometimes been called [...] "noir&B". However, the terms are often criticized for [...] "pigeonholing" [...] artists into hipster subculture and being used in a derisive manner.|$|R
