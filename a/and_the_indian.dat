5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
