5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may <b>all</b> <b>be</b> present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} <b>all</b> <b>be</b> guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E

Donald, Goofy, and Pluto would <b>all</b> <b>be</b> appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity. The Silly Symphonies, which garnered seven , ended in 1939.|$|E

Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should <b>all</b> <b>be</b> unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E

5|$|Jovan Vladimir {{was buried}} in Prespa, in the same church in front {{of which he was}} martyred. His relics soon became famous as {{miraculously}} healing, attracting many people to his tomb. Shortly after his death he was recognized as a martyr and saint, being commemorated on 22May, his feast day. At that time, saints were recognized without any formal rite of canonization. Vladimir was the first ruler of a Serbian state who was elevated to sainthood.
