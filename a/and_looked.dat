5|$|After the {{completion}} of the opera Britten went into the National Heart Hospital and was operated on in May 1973 to replace a failing heart valve. The replacement was successful, but he suffered a slight stroke, affecting his right hand. This brought his career as a performer to an end. While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> after him until his death.|$|E
5|$|Big Brother: A Decade in the Headlines was {{transmitted}} on 30 May <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{back at the}} social, {{political and}} cultural changes that Big Brother had made to society since it began. The documentary was hosted by Grace Dent and featured participation from Mark Frith, Carole Malone, Oona King, Peter Tatchell, Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Ian Hyland.|$|E
5|$|Charlton offered {{alternative}} policies <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> to be favourite {{until he}} was hospitalised with illness halfway through the campaign. Labor still won the most seats as a single party, but Charlton was unable to defeat a strong government coalition. Labor remained in opposition.|$|E

60|$|Sammy Jay {{looked at}} Blacky the Crow, <b>and</b> Blacky <b>looked</b> at Chatterer, <b>and</b> Chatterer <b>looked</b> at Happy Jack, <b>and</b> Happy Jack <b>looked</b> at Peter Rabbit, <b>and</b> Peter <b>looked</b> at Unc' Billy Possum, <b>and</b> Unc' Billy <b>looked</b> at Bobby Coon, <b>and</b> Bobby <b>looked</b> at Johnny Chuck, <b>and</b> Johnny <b>looked</b> at Reddy Fox, <b>and</b> Reddy <b>looked</b> at Jimmy Skunk, <b>and</b> Jimmy <b>looked</b> at Billy Mink, <b>and</b> Billy <b>looked</b> at Little Joe Otter, {{and for a}} minute nobody could say a word. Then Little Joe gave a funny little gasp.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now {{you are a}} beauty!' {{said the}} Ethiopian. 'You can lie out on the bare ground <b>and</b> <b>look</b> like a heap of pebbles. You can lie out on the naked rocks <b>and</b> <b>look</b> {{like a piece of}} pudding-stone. You can lie out on a leafy branch <b>and</b> <b>look</b> like {{sunshine}} sifting through the leaves; and you can lie right across the centre of a path <b>and</b> <b>look</b> like nothing in particular. Think of that and purr!' ...|$|R
5|$|Chuniya {{took the}} child to her village of Haripur <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> after him for {{five and a half}} years after which she died. Rambola was left to fend for himself as an impoverished orphan, and wandered from door to door begging for alms. It is {{believed}} that the goddess Parvati assumed the form of a Brahmin woman and fed Rambola every day.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite. The writers created {{the role of a}} Queen Amphitrite especially for Beckham. The former Spice Girl accepted the role because her sons, Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz, love the show, were excited when their mother told them of the role, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> forward to watching the episode with her.|$|E
5|$|Silva re-opened {{the action}} {{standing}} {{with a combination}} of punches and kicks. Jackson answered with a straight right hand, knocking Silva on to the canvas. Jackson followed Silva down <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> to finish the fight in Silva's closed guard. Jackson moved into side control shortly after and landed a clean knee strike to Silva's head followed by several punches, again to the head to end the round.|$|E

5|$|Smith's {{injuries}} {{also made}} him permanently unable {{to sit for}} long periods without pain, so when he attended conferences as a politician, he would briefly rise from his seat from time to time. During his talks with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson aboard HMS Tiger in 1966, Smith regularly got up <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> out of a porthole; the British incorrectly interpreted this as Smith feeling intimidated by Wilson, or seasick.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hospital}} in Ashford is William Harvey Hospital, in nearby Willesborough. It {{is named after}} William Harvey, the doctor who discovered the blood circulatory system. The hospital was built because the government decided the old hospital would be too small for demand as Ashford grew, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> for a 30-acre site that could have a hospital built on a budget of £7–8million. Work started on building the {{hospital in}} 1973 and it was commissioned in 1977, opening in 1979.|$|E
5|$|There were 10 gunmen, nine of {{whom were}} {{subsequently}} shot dead and one captured by security forces. Witnesses reported that {{they seemed to be}} in their early twenties, wore black T-shirts and jeans, and that they smiled <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> happy as they shot their victims.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{her return}} to the region in 1957, she was inaugurated as the College's President, and {{attended}} other events that were deliberately designed to be multi-racial. During her daughter's extensive tour of the Commonwealth over 1953–54, Elizabeth acted as a Counsellor of State <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> after her grandchildren, Charles and Anne.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo got {{the ball}} back at their own 21-yard line and were only able to advance it to their 34-yard line before punting the ball back to Connecticut. UConn cornerback Jasper Howard {{returned}} the ball 26yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed the ball to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing {{the ball to the}} Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, UConn held a 7–3 lead <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> to be in position to score more when the second quarter began.|$|E
5|$|Despite this form, his Test {{campaign}} started poorly with an ineffective 1/130 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. He {{then broke}} {{down with a}} back injury in a match against Kent <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> unlikely to play. With Benaud already sidelined with a shoulder injury, Australia looked severely weakened without their two main bowlers. Despite again complaining about frailties of his body, Davidson vowed to play and produce a special performance for friend and stand-in captain Neil Harvey in the Second Test at Lord's.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, {{suppose he}} pulls gently a minute, and then stops <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> round, <b>and</b> then I {{tell him to}} go on, and he pulls a minute again, and then stops <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> round.” ...|$|R

60|$|The {{force of}} {{contrast}} makes {{the charm of}} this entry into Italy; for, after {{the grandeur of the}} Alps and the gloomy wildness of Gondo, the smiling scene is doubly lovely as one drives down to Domo d'Ossola. Weariness, hunger, and sleep were quite forgotten; and when our travellers came to Lago Maggiore, glimmering in the moonlight, they could only sigh for happiness, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> <b>look.</b>|$|R
5|$|In Q2, lap times {{improved}} {{and the two}} Mercedes drivers led the way, with Rosberg {{a little over a}} tenth of a second ahead of teammate Hamilton. Fernando Alonso went faster than Valtteri Bottas <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> to make it into Q3, when Max Verstappen went faster and eliminated the McLaren driver. Also not in the top ten were both Lotus and the second McLaren of Jenson Button. Conditions soon worsened, preventing faster lap times. Many drivers spun out {{in the latter part of}} the session, complaining about aquaplaning.|$|E
5|$|It is rumoured that Briatore {{arranged}} {{an agreement}} with Red Bull that, if they offered Webber a race seat, Renault would supply them with engines. On 26 January 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, and Webber drove the car in a shakedown in Barcelona on the same day. The car featured heavy revisions to the team's previous cars <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> very much like designer Adrian Newey's previous cars which had either won or {{come close to the}} World Title. The car was fitted with a Renault RS27 engine.|$|E
5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> for another opportunity. Perhaps {{it was due to}} this lukewarmness that Władysław was never able to inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
60|$|BIGELOW--Listen to that rumpus, will you! The {{kids are}} {{having the time}} of their lives. [He goes to the window <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> out--delightedly.] Your wife is playing hide and seek with them. Come <b>and</b> <b>look.</b>|$|R

5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} son was a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son. With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever {{in the care of}} Sejanus <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> toward the sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula) as possible heirs.|$|E
