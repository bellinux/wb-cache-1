25|$|Absolute or {{anhydrous}} alcohol refers to ethanol {{with a low}} water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If azeotropic distillation is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene). Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. <b>Absolute</b> <b>ethanol</b> {{is used as a}} solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol is an <b>absolute</b> <b>ethanol</b> with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|At {{pressures}} {{less than}} atmospheric pressure, {{the composition of the}} ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures, and at pressures less than 70torr (9.333kPa), there is no azeotrope, and it is possible to distill <b>absolute</b> <b>ethanol</b> from an ethanol-water mixture. While vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical, pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research. In this technique, a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6% ethanol. Then, fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6% azeotrope, leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Apart from distillation, ethanol may be dried by {{addition}} of a desiccant, such as molecular sieves, cellulose, and cornmeal. The desiccants can be dried and reused. Molecular sieves {{can be used to}} selectively absorb the water from the 95.6% ethanol solution. Synthetic zeolite in pellet form can be used, as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents, including cornmeal, straw, and sawdust. The zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot carbon dioxide. Cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated, but where ethanol is made from grain, they are often available at low cost. <b>Absolute</b> <b>ethanol</b> produced this way has no residual benzene, and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations.|$|E

2500|$|Tabun {{was made}} on an {{industrial}} scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader. In the chemical agent factory in Dyhernfurth an der Oder, codenamed [...] "Hochwerk", at least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. The manufacturing process consisted of two steps, the first being reaction of gaseous dimethylamine (1) with an excess of phosphoryl chloride (2), yielding dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride (3, codenamed [...] "Produkt 39" [...] or [...] "D 4") and dimethylammonium chloride (4). The dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride thus obtained was purified by vacuum distillation and thereafter transferred to the main Tabun production line. Here it was reacted with an excess of sodium cyanide (5), dispersed in dry chlorobenzene, yielding the intermediate dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide (not depicted in the scheme) and sodium chloride (8); then, <b>absolute</b> <b>ethanol</b> (6) was added, reacting with the dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide to yield tabun (7) and hydrogen cyanide (9). After the reaction, the mixture (consisting of about 75% chlorobenzene and 25% tabun, along with insoluble salts {{and the rest of}} the hydrogen cyanide) was filtered to remove the insoluble salts and vacuum-distilled to remove hydrogen cyanide and excess chlorobenzene, so yielding the technical product, consisting either of 95% tabun with 5% chlorobenzene (Tabun A) or (later in the war) of 80% tabun with 20% chlorobenzene (Tabun B).|$|E

In the present study, three medicinal plants (Asphodilus tenifolius, Aerva javanica and Fagonia indica) were collected from Pothohar plateau {{on the basis of}} ethno-botanical uses. Different solvent (<b>absolute</b> and aqueous <b>ethanol,</b> <b>absolute</b> and aqueous methanol and absolute and aqueous acetone) extracts of all the plants obtained through different extraction techniques (Stirring, orbital shaking, sonication and reflux) were evaluated for their antioxidant activities (by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl and superoxide radical scavenging assays, reducing power and ÃŸ-carotene linoleic acid system), antimicrobial activities (by Disc diffusion and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration assays) and phytochemical studies (total phenolic and flavonoid contents). All the plant extracts exhibited good antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Aqueous solvent extracts showed better activities as compared to pure solvent extracts. Out of four extraction techniques, extracts obtained from sonication exhibited better activities and phytochemical constituents. In case of Asphodilus tenifolius aqueous ethanol while for Aerva javanica and Fagonia indica aqueous methanol proved to be best solvent for the extraction of bioactive compounds.

30|$|The {{utilization}} of pervaporation {{for the production}} of <b>absolute</b> (anhydrous) <b>ethanol</b> through its coupling with the previous distillation step has been reported. The modeling and optimization of the process using MINLP tools showed 12 % savings in the production costs considering a 32 % increase in membrane area and the reduction in both reflux ratio and ethanol concentration in the distillate of the column (Lelkes et al. 2000, Szitkai et al. 2002). Through pilot-plant studies, the integration of distillation process with the pervaporation has been achieved resulting in good indexes in terms of energy savings. These savings are due to the low operation costs of pervaporation and to the high yield of dehydrated ethanol, typical of pervaporation processes (Tsuyomoto et al. 1997). The comparison between azeotropic distillation using benzene and pervaporation system using multiple membrane modules showed that, at the same ethanol production rate and quality (99.8 wt.%), operation costs, including the membrane replacement every 2 – 4 years, are approximately 1 / 3 – 1 / 4 of those of azeotropic distillation.|$|R
