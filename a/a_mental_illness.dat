5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E

Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960â€“1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatric diagnoses {{take place}} {{in a wide variety of}} {{settings}} and are performed by many different health professionals. Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a differential diagnosis procedure where a mental status examination and physical examination is conducted, with pathological, psychopathological or psychosocial histories obtained, and sometimes neuroimages or other neurophysiological measurements are taken, or personality tests or cognitive tests administered. In some cases, a brain scan might be used to rule out other medical illnesses, but at this time relying on brain scans alone cannot accurately diagnose <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> or tell the risk of getting <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> in the future. A few psychiatrists are beginning to utilize genetics during the diagnostic process but on the whole this remains a research topic.|$|E
