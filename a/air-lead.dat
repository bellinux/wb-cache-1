40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{association}} between <b>air-lead</b> levels and crime rates across 2, 772 U. S. counties. Data for the analysis come from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Census, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Results suggest that <b>air-lead</b> levels have a direct effect on prop-erty and violent crime rates even after adjusting for general levels of air pollu-tion and several structural covariates of crime. We also find that resource depri-vation interacts with <b>air-lead</b> levels. The association between <b>air-lead</b> levels and crime rates—property and violent—is strongest in counties that {{have high levels of}} resource deprivation and weakest in counties that have low levels of deprivation. This interaction is consistent with arguments and evidence in the health care literature that populations most at risk of lead poisoning are least likely to get the resources required to prevent, screen, and treat the illness. 214 Contemporary research suggests that lead exposure is a potential source of crime an...|$|E
40|$|In 1967, {{the problem}} of {{occupational}} lead exposure came to public attention in Korea. Since then, regular {{progress has been made}} in lowering workplace lead exposures, instituting new workplace controls, and implementing health examinations of ex-posed workers. Past serious lead poisoning episodes made it possible to introduce biological monitoring programs on a volun-tary basis in high-lead-exposure facilities in Korea. Industry-specific occupational health services for lead workers in Korea during the last 22 years can be categorized into three phases. During the first phase (1988 - 1993), efforts were directed at increasing awareness among workers about the hazards of lead exposure, biological monitoring of blood zinc protoporphyrin began, and a respiratory protection program was introduced. During the second phase (1994 - 1997), a computerized health management sys-tem for lead workers was developed, blood-lead measurement was added to biologic monitoring, and engineering controls were introduced in the workplace to lower <b>air-lead</b> levels to comply with <b>air-lead</b> regulations. Finally, during the third phase (1998 -pres-ent), a new biomarker, bone-lead measurement by X-ray fluorescence, was introduced. Bone-lead measurement proved to be useful for assessing body burden and to demonstrate past lead exposure in retired workers. Occupational health service practice for lead workers, including the industry-specific group occupational health system, has brought considerable success in the pre-vention of lead poisoning and in reducing the lead burden in Korean lead workers during the last several decades. The successful achievement of prevention of lead poisoning in Korea was a result of the combined efforts of lead workers, employers, relevan...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 58 - 63) The {{occurrence of}} lead in human populations {{is due to a}} number of occupational and environmental exposures. Associations between the levels {{of lead in}} blood and exposures to lead in air, soils, foods, water, paints and other materials are well documented, and have been reviewed within this study. In examining automobile emissions as a source of exposure, a number of prior investigations have studied the relationship between blood-lead and exposures to lead in air and soil environments. In reviewing the literature, it is suggested that major limitations are {{associated with the use of}} either soil- or <b>air-lead</b> in reflecting total exposure to lead emissions. In the present study, the deposition of airborne lead is examined in an area of residential housing adjoining a major Los Angeles freeway. Site-specific determinations of lead deposition rate, or the mass of lead aerially deposited per unit area per month, were made with a sampling device developed pursuant to this research. The regression of deposition rate on the variable, distance from freeway, was examined. (See more in text...|$|E
