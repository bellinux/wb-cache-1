Her first role afterwards was playing Osatko {{in the chorus}} of Around the World in 80 Days at the Liverpool Playhouse during the 1990–91 pantomime season. She had ten lines in Japanese. Her next role came {{at the end of}} the year in the Manchester Royal Exchange's production of Medea. Ripley recalled, [...] "It was only my second job, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> all very seriously, in my Greek sarong and my torch of fire, having to burble in tongues." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the Slime came to Yuji Horii, the creator of Dragon Quest, from a role-playing game called Wizardry. [...] "I was really hooked on 'Wizardy,' the PC game, ... There's...slime-looking characters ..., so I got the inspiration from it. I was doodling the slime-looking character <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to Mr. Toriyama, who did the character design, and he made it the Slime we see today." [...] Horii said that when it was originally conceived, the Slime was [...] "a pile of goo", but Toriyama's design came back as a tear-drop which they considered [...] "perfect".|$|E
500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights. His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that I looked at it much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made me even more obstinate, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E

500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live {{the rest of my life}} with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E

The other [...] "communications"? They were buried in newsletters, websites, or handouts (many of them technical, in small print). I didn't take the medicine every day.

2500|$|Kimmel, however, was upfront with {{wanting to}} discuss the fiasco at hand, and upon his appearance, {{attempted}} to steer the questions that way: {{when asked about his}} favorite prank, he responded, [...] "I think the best prank I ever pulled was, I told a guy once, 'Five years from now I'm going to give you my show.' And then when the five years came, I gave it to him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> back, almost instantly."

2500|$|Nonetheless, the City Attorney {{stood behind}} its legal opinion and {{environmentalist}} and former Sierra Club president Adam Werbach was later sworn in. The second appointee, architect Robin Chiang, was rescinded because Brown {{had already made}} one appointment, Andrew Lee, son of one of Brown's fund-raiser Julie Lee, {{who was convicted of}} mail fraud and witness tampering on July 12, 2008. Daly and his allies on the board said Andrew Lee represented political patronage at its worst. According to John Rizzo, vice chairman of the Bay chapter of the Sierra Club, Daly's appointments would add [...] "expertise to the SFPUC that was greatly lacking and is a great improvement" [...] Brown said that Daly's action went beyond betrayal and that he considers his relationship with Daly, who he had praised in recent months, over. The custom of assigning the acting mayor position to supervisors on a [...] basis was discontinued as a result of Daly's appointments. Daly said by way of explanation for his actions, [...] "I'm an activist. I had an opportunity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> I stand by what I did. It was the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's {{always a}} nice feeling. Sometimes {{you hear it}} on the streets or someone has it on their mobile phone or something… it's a nice feeling! Actually, I did an {{interview}} {{about a year ago}} with a newspaper from America and they talked about how much it's been used in sports in America… which I didn't know so much about. Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, I had that 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, {{and it turned out to}} be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well. Nowadays, we don't rehearse it, but when we play it live, it is still just so amazing! It does communicate so well with the audience and we really love playing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 18, 2012 on his Twitter Hamiltion {{announced}} that he was releasing an independent album entitled Ill Doesn't Mean Classic it would include the Eminem produced song [...] "I Don't Care", it was released as a mixtape on July 7, 2012. On July 30, 2012, Hamilton released a collaboration mixtape entitled Cinematic Hallucinations: The Bully And The Pet with rapper S.K.E. The Heistman. On August 17, 2012 during an interview Hamilton talked about his change in his music stating [...] "When I was incarcerated, my songs got a little more aggressive, but after I did some time and came back to NYC, I was a little upset at my fans because they were saying some pretty harsh things about me when I was locked up. This is not how you should approach somebody whos been showing you guys free love". Hamilton also talked about how mental illness and drug use didn't {{have anything to do with}} him taking a step back from music stating [...] "People were blaming insanity because certain details didn't hit the surface, but it had nothing to do with drugs, it had nothing to do with alcohol". Hamilton also discussed about his former deal with Interscope Records stating [...] "MC Lyte said it best it was a fight to get me off Interscope. I put out more projects than the entire Interscope roster from 2008 to 2010, and it took Eminem to come out and trump that, as far as getting physical sales numbers. Interscope had to choose between traditional and the new wave, and I said this new wave costs yall less money and less compromise but it took people on the inside to say to Interscope yall don't know what you're doing with this kid. A lot of the inner workings weren't made clear to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> very personally". On December 21, 2012 Hamilton released his extended play entitled The Come Down.|$|E

2500|$|I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned {{after my}} father. And I have built this {{sanctuary}} for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, {{and made me}} look upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and {{in the days of}} his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old. And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim, and take it. And I assaulted it, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it,</b> for Chemosh restored it in my days.
