5|$|BWV Anh. 30 is a Magnificat in C major for SSAATTBB choir <b>and</b> <b>orchestra,</b> copied by Bach around 1742. The {{manuscript}} score indicates no composer, {{but according}} to a 2012 study it is a 17th-century work, composed by Pietro Torri before his 25th birthday. An earlier attribution of the work had been to Antonio Lotti.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{the work}} has two large concerto {{movements}} for organ <b>and</b> <b>orchestra,</b> probably from a lost concerto for keyboard, oboe or violin, perhaps indicating that the cantata was composed for a seasonal choral absentia at Thomaskirche.

5|$|In June 1976, {{the last}} year of his life, Britten {{accepted}} a life peerage – the first composer so honoured – becoming Baron Britten, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk. After the 1976 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten and Pears travelled to Norway, where Britten began writing Praise We Great Men, for voices <b>and</b> <b>orchestra</b> based on a poem by Edith Sitwell. He returned to Aldeburgh in August, and wrote Welcome Ode for children's choir <b>and</b> <b>orchestra.</b> In November, Britten realised that he could no longer compose. On his 63rd birthday, 22 November, at his request Rita Thomson organised a champagne party and invited his friends and his sisters Barbara and Beth, to say their goodbyes to the dying composer. When Rostropovich made his farewell visit a few days later, Britten gave him what he had written of Praise We Great Men.|$|E
