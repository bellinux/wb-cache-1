5|$|On 26January 2010, nearly 14years later, the World Meteorological Organization {{announced}} that the wind gust was the highest recorded worldwide. This gust surpassed the previous non-tornadic wind speed of 372km/h (231mph) on Mount Washington in the United States in April 1934. The long delay was {{partly due to the}} anemometer not being owned by the BoM, and as a result the agency did not enact a follow-up investigation. Despite the high winds, the anemometer and a nearby building were not damaged due to the winds occurring over <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>short</b> time.|$|E
5|$|Sherlock Holmes Baffled is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>short</b> American silent film {{created in}} 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin.

The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.|$|E
