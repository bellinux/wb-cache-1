Correlation between inherent conformational variations in a protein and conformational differences in its homologues of known structure is still unclear. In this study, {{we have used}} a structural alphabet called Protein Blocks (PBs). PBs are used to perform abstraction of protein 3 -D structures into a 1 -D strings of 16 alphabets (a-p) based on dihedral <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> pentapeptides. We have analyzed the variations in local conformations in terms of PBs represented in the ensembles of 801 protein structures determined using NMR spectroscopy. In the analysis of concatenated data over all the residues in all the NMR ensembles, we observe that the overall nature of inherent local structural variations in NMR ensembles is similar to the nature of local structural differences in homologous proteins with a high correlation coefficient of. 94. High correlation at the alignment positions corresponding to helical and β-sheet regions is only expected. However, the correlation coefficient by considering only the loop regions is also quite high (. 91). Surprisingly, segregated position-wise analysis shows that this high correlation does not hold true to loop regions at the structurally equivalent positions in NMR ensembles and their homologues of known structure. This suggests that the general nature of local structural changes is unique; however most of the local structural variations in loop regions of NMR ensembles do not correlate to their local structural differences at structurally equivalent positions in homologues...|$|R

Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB) is responsible for the monitoring the quality of rubber to maintain a successful rubber clone breeding program. One of the important factors that affect the quality of raw rubber is the clonal origin of the rubber tree. Currently, clone inspectors classify the rubber tree clones manually using leaf features. There are several features such as leaf tip, leaf base to identify the type of clone. An automated clone classification process is needed to facilitate the inspection process. This research focuses on extracting one of the features for identifying clones which are overlapping leaf features. The challenge <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> leaf identification is the similarity of the intensity levels. However, it can be classified using shape and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> leaves. Therefore, a new feature extraction framework is required to extract shape and angle features. In the new framework, key point extraction method is combined with the nearest neighbor algorithm to extract shape feature. While, angle feature is developed using Hough transform. The proposed method able to detect edge, ridge, and blob features and identify <b>angle</b> between petioles <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> leaves. This study identified that <b>angle</b> degrees <b>of</b> the <b>overlapping</b> leaves are in the range between 30 ° and 55 ° while <b>angle</b> degrees <b>of</b> non-overlapping leaves are in the range between 55 ° and 90 °. In order to validate the result, the identification method has been tested with fifty rubber leaf images that comprise <b>of</b> both <b>overlapping</b> and non-overlapping features images. The results indicated that forty six overlapping and non-overlapping leaf images matched successfully with correct templates. As a conclusion, the proposed features and their extraction method can be used to identify overlapping and non-overlapping rubber tree leave...|$|R

The DC components of these current bias magnetomotive forces in respective magnetic cores of the transformer. Thus the iron cores are asymmetrically magnetized. To avoid various abnormal phenomena {{associated with this}} asymmetrical magnetization, we often use the so-called Greatz connection. However, even in this case {{a transformer}} is sometimes asymmetrically magnetized due to unbalance <b>of</b> control <b>angles</b> and variations <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>angles</b> due to ripples of DC cur. rent. The performance of static inverter is greatly affected by the extent of asymmetrical magnetization.

Their high-speed slurry erosion characteristics have been systematically studied. SUS {{304 stainless steel}} {{was selected as the}} comparison material. Experimental results show that the NiCrBSi sprayed coating exhibits a much better slurry erosion resistance than the SUS 304 stainless steel. The erosion rate for the NiCrBSi sprayed coating slightly increases with the impinged angle. However, a maximum erosion rate appears at an impinged <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> around 30 degrees for SUS 304 stainless steel. Both NiCrBSi sprayed coating and SUS 304 stainless steel exhibit impinged surfaces with lots of furrows at an impinged <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 30 degrees. At a high impinged <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 90 degrees, the SUS 304 stainless steel exhibits an impinged surface with lots <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> and irregular concavities, while, these features are less obvious for NiCrBSi sprayed coating. The hardness of SUS 304 stainless steel increases significantly with increasing impinged angle during the high-speed slurry erosion. But, there is no obvious work hardening for the NiCrBSi sprayed coating due to its extra-high hardness and less plastic deformation, even at a high impinged <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 90 degrees.

Here we use molecular dynamics to test the flexibility of Escherichia coli RRF (ecRRF) with and without decanoic acid bound to a hydrophobic pocket between domains 1 and 2, and Thermus thermophilus RRF (ttRRF) with and without a mutation in the hinge between domains 1 and 2. Our simulations show that the structure of ecRRF rapidly goes from having an interdomain <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 124 ° to an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 98 ° independently of the presence of decanoic acid. The simulations also show that {{the presence or absence of}} decanoic acid leads to changes in ecRRF flexibility. Simulations of wild-type and mutant ttRRF (R 32 G) show that mutating Arg- 32 to glycine decreases RRF flexibility. This was unexpected because the range <b>of</b> dihedral <b>angles</b> for arginine is limited relative to glycine. Furthermore, the interdomain <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> wild-type T. thermophilus goes from 81 ° to 118 ° whereas the R 32 G mutant remains very close to the crystallographic <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 78 °.
