When Mary Tudor asserted her right to the throne, an expedition against her base in East Anglia became inevitable. Northumberland marched on 14July, <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> eldest sons, John and Ambrose.

A short while later, all four men began fighting in the ring, and the match ended in a no-contest.|$|E
5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> {{wife and}} her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been {{appointed}} Lieutenant Governor of New York.

5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay sardine fishing boat, the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} {{the coast of}} the Gulf of California collecting biological specimens.

Steinbeck hoped that the trip would help rescue their failing marriage, but it seems to have had the opposite effect: the marriage ended soon after they returned. Steinbeck's lawyer and friend, Toby Street, was also on board as far as San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{attended}} {{the world premiere}} of Wonderwall, held at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 1968, <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> wife Pattie Boyd, Starr and Birkin.

Wonderwall Music therefore became Apple's first album release, as well as the first solo album {{by a member of the}} Beatles.|$|E
