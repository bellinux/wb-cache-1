40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the evaluation, modification and modelling {{of a mass}} flow feeding silo, stand pipe and standard <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> system for use in handling and transporting alumina in the aluminium smelting industry. Stability and repeatability of gravitational flow rates from feeding silos and stand pipes (addressed as interfaces) is crucial from operational {{point of view and}} needs to be achieved before one can further estimate and model the flow of alumina and the capacity of an <b>air</b> <b>slide.</b> Although techniques for design of storage vessels (based on the flow characteristics of particulates) have been in the public domain since the 1960 ’s, they have been slow to gain acceptance in the industry (due to a lack of awareness of their existence amongst engineers). The use of the stand pipe concept to increase flow rates during gravity discharge and to achieve stability of flow has been examined experimentally in a small rig at Tel-Tek department of POSTEC. The stand pipe should be integrated into the mechanical design of an <b>air</b> <b>slide,</b> because if the material cannot be delivered (discharged) properly from the feeding unit onto the <b>air</b> <b>slide,</b> there will be no stable conveying conditions. It has been found by Gu, Arnold and McLean (1993) that the stand pipe is efficient only if it is kept full of powder - the feeding silo acting more as a buffer for the stand pipe. Their concept was implemented in practice during the tests conducted at POSTEC by monitoring the weight of material in the stand pipe and the flow rates of alumina in real time by using LabView software and weighing cells. What makes the research work reported in this document unique is the integration of different mechanical and modelling concepts from different engineering fields (continuum and soil mechanics, fluid dynamics, rheology, cybernetics and powder technology). Previous work undertaken by Haugland (1998) for Hydro focused the flow of alumina as a Newtonian fluid and was itself based on the modelling work of Woodcock (1978). Yet, besides their work, no accurate mathematical model has been developed which could be used to predict the velocity and mass flow rates of alumina flow and capacity of an <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> for a range of alumina qualities. Such a model would be extremely useful when designing new <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> systems, as the capacity of air slides could be predicted from the rheology of powder and the knowledge of bulk particulate characteristics. Previous research, measurement campaigns and extensive literature studies, all point out that in terms of controlling discharge from gravity flow equipment (and after studying the transport behaviour of an <b>air</b> <b>slide),</b> it is often the gravity discharge approach that generates the greatest degree of variability, in terms of both consistency and repeatability. The root of the problem of inconsistent discharge rates has been identified to lie with the flow channel development within the feeding silo and/or the stand pipe (discharge head). The potential causes of flow irregularities are even more critical to be aware of, in the cases where mass flow principles are intended to be applied - {{especially in the case of}} highly segregable materials like alumina blends. This thesis is aimed at developing a reliable means for predicting the average velocity of alumina flow and capacity and also to understand the mechanisms that govern the flow behaviour. To enable online estimation and further modelling of full-scale <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> capacity, a small-scale rig with adjustable length was built at POSTEC in 2012 and further modified in 2013. <b>Air</b> <b>slide</b> capacity (alumina flow rates) for different lengths of 3 m, 7 m and 15 m and inclination angles from 0 to 3. 1 degrees of <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> were measured by using pressurized air in the range of 3 to 6. 5 barg. Empirical models have been developed from test results as a first step. It was found based on empirical models that the velocity of alumina bed has a power law behaviour. However, these models would require the use of expensive and time-consuming <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> trials to determine the values of the power law coefficients for each alumina quality. The degree of segregation when handling and transporting alumina has proven to be quite considerable, in terms of undesirable effects on the production process. This thesis was prompted by several measurement programmes of work undertaken for Hydro by the author with the aim of mapping the performance of volumetric feeders and the degree of segregation in a feeding <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> rig at The Reference Centre in Årdal. Sampling from feeders and chemical analysis of the samples have clearly shown the degree of segregation, especially when fluidizing and transporting binary mixtures of alumina and aluminium fluoride. Pressure measurement results showed pressure drops along the air supply tube, which also have been found to have an impact on segregation. Fluidization and shearing trials have been conducted both on alumina and binary mixtures in order to establish a benchmark procedure for powder characterisation that could be used as an operational support tool. Currently the minimum fluidization velocity for all Hydro Aluminium plants is set to 2. 0 cm/s, which is much higher than what it is actually needed to achieve an optimal fluidization. There is a strong analogy with the flow of Newtonian or non – Newtonian fluids in an open channel that can be applied to the flow of fluidized alumina on an <b>air</b> <b>slide.</b> In this thesis, the hydrological non- Newtonian model developed from the general Saint-Venant model of open channel in a rectangular channel has been applied as a second step. Such theoretical mechanistic models, based on the mass and momentum balance with bottom friction along the powder bed, are numerically challenging to solve. The model requires use of rheometrical benchmark tests to determine the flow index coefficients for a specific quality of alumina for a given initial inlet bed depth and steady state estimated capacity. The use of an Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) solver in MATLAB to predict the height and the velocity of alumina bed in an open channel seemed promising and showed similar trends when compared to the alumina bed results obtained from the <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> tests conducted at POSTEC. Results obtained so far indicate that a more detailed analysis needs to be conducted in order to find out how to ‘fine tune’ the model parameters to further improve the model fit to measurement data. Although more experimental data is needed, e. g. shear stress measurements and flow coefficients at different fluidization velocities and for different alumina qualities, the correlation between measurements and the model obtained so far confirmed that further investigation would be justified. Thus, the effect of interfaces, the feeding silo and the stand pipe should be considered and included into further design approaches for mechanical equipment, by balancing headroom availability in pot rooms versus increase in transport capacity of bulk solids to optimize production...|$|E
40|$|Mineral {{processing}} {{plants in the}} United States and throughout the world process material that is finely ground and placed into bags for shipping to the consumer. These bags normally range from 50 to 100 pounds in weight. Once the material is placed in these bags, a bag stacker loads the bags onto pallets. A bag stacker is exposed {{to a lot of}} dust that is mainly released by the force from loading the bag onto the pallet. The two main sources are the dust {{on the outside of the}} bag and the dust that escapes from inside the bag as it is loaded. The Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) records indicate the bag stacker's dust exposure is one of the highest of all workers at mineral processing operations. Ways to reduce the dust exposure and strain to the bag stacker are in constant development. Recently, automated systems have been built. These systems range from fully automated, which totally remove the worker from the bag-stacking process, to semi-automated systems, in which the bag stacker still performs some of the functions. This Hazard Control deals with controlling the bag stacker's dust exposure during use of a semi-automated palletizing machine. The worker slides the bags into position on the palletizing machine. Once an entire layer of bags is positioned, the bag stacker operates the controls on the palletizing machine to lower the layer of bags onto the pallet. An <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> is built into the semi-automated palletizing machine so the bags are easier to move. This slide uses a metal table with air jets that exit through small holes at high velocities, similar to an air hockey game. The dust problem occurs because the <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> causes dust to blow up onto the bag stacker, significantly increasing the dust exposure. NIOSH researchers became aware of this problem while working at a mineral processing operation that was having problems with a bag stacker who was overexposed to dust. The <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> on the semi-automated palletizing unit was determined to be the main cause for the high dust concentrations. The impact of the <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> on the bag stacker's dust exposure was found by using real-time dust monitors. Figure 1 shows the bag stacker's average respirable dust exposure while working with product bags of three different mesh sizes when the <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> was either on or off. The bag stacker's respirable dust exposure was 5 to 11 times higher when the <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> was on compared with when it was off. This mineral processing operation used an exhaust ventilation system with an exhaust hood at the back of the palletizing unit. The exhaust ventilation system was not powerful enough to immediately capture the dust blown up from the <b>air</b> <b>slide.</b> An overhead air supply island system (OASIS) was also used to provide an envelope of clean air over the bag stacker. The OASIS at this operation brings in outside air through two different filter stages and directs the clean air down over the bag stacker. This envelope of clean air was not powerful enough to overcome the dust that was being blown up into the bag stacker's breathing zone from the <b>air</b> <b>slide.</b> The key to lowering the bag stacker's dust exposure to MSHA-acceptable concentrations was to make a few simple changes and to slightly modify the bag stacker's work habits. The bag stacker had been leaning out over the <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> table and placing his upper torso in the front part of the exhaust ventilation system capture hood. Therefore, NIOSH researchers suggested that the exhaust hood be modified to make it physically impossible for the bag stacker to place his or her upper torso into the hood (Figure 2). The next modification involved installing plastic stripping around the perimeter of the OASIS. The plastic stripping gave the bag stacker a physical indication of the clean air boundary provided by the OASIS. Testing was repeated after the changes were made to the semi-automated palletizing system. This time, the testing showed that the changes to the system had minimized the impact of <b>air</b> <b>slide</b> contamination to the bag stacker. Once again, three product sizes of mesh bags were evaluated. No increase was found in the bag stacker's dust exposure with two of the products, and only a very slight increase was found with the other product. The changes made to the bag palletizing process accounted for the reductions of the bag stacker's respirable dust exposure to MSHA-acceptable dust concentrations. NIOSH researchers believe that all operators using this type of semi-automated palletizing system need to be aware of the serious dust contamination that can occur to the bag stacker from the <b>air</b> <b>slide.</b> To control high dust exposures from air slides on semi-automated palletizing units (Figure 3), make the following modifications: 1. Use an exhaust ventilation system with an effective hood design to capture the dust generated during the bag stacking process. 2. Use an OASIS to provide an envelope of clean air over the bag stacker. 3. Place plastic stripping around the OASIS to provide a boundary of the clean air from the system. 4. Modify the bag stacker's work practices to have the worker stay within the envelope of clean air provided by the OASIS. NIOSH No. 2002160...|$|E
