5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is closely}} related to the much larger and more recent tyrannosaurid Tyrannosaurus rex. Like most tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus was a multi-tonne bipedal {{predator}} equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. Daspletosaurus had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> proportionately longer than in other genera.|$|E

5|$|On June 16, nearly {{identical}} ultimata were issued to Latvia and Estonia, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> given only eight hours to respond. With Lithuania already in Soviet hands, armed resistance in Latvia or Estonia {{was even more}} futile. All three states were occupied and lost their independence.|$|E

5|$|On October10, another {{tropical}} depression formed {{further to the}} north of the previous storm. It possibly developed from the same tropical wave that spawned the previous depression, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not the same system. The depression maintained a general northward movement throughout its duration, dissipating on October12.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{brook trout}} {{naturally}} reproduce in Little Catawissa Creek. However, introducing rainbow trout into the creek is forbidden, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> historically stocked {{there by the}} Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. River chubs were historically present in the creek, but have disappeared. The reason for this disappearance is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E

5|$|All of Chaplin's films {{up to and}} {{including}} The Circus (1928) were silent, although many were re-issued with soundtracks. City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) were essentially silent films, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> made with soundtracks consisting of music and sound effects, with talking sequences in the latter film. Chaplin's last five films were all talking pictures. Aside from A Countess From Hong Kong, all of Chaplin's films were photographed in 35mm black-and-white.|$|E
5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not penalized, Nuggets coach George Karl and Knicks coach Isiah Thomas {{were both}} {{scrutinized}} {{for their part}} in the brawl. Carmelo Anthony was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it wanted to keep its image free from violence.|$|E

50|$|Often {{included}} among the pseudepigrapha are 3 and 4 Maccabees because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not traditionally found in western Bibles, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in the Septuagint. Similarly, the Book of Enoch, Book of Jubilees and 4 Baruch are often listed with the pseudepigrapha <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> commonly included in Ethiopian Bibles. The Psalms of Solomon {{are found in}} some editions of the Septuagint.|$|R

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> still allies, San Martín {{began to}} {{distance}} himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín thought that it was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the 1998 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1997–98 FA Premier League. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> 12 points behind league leaders Manchester United {{by the end of}} February 1998, a nine-match winning streak, culminating in a 4–0 win over Everton on 3 May 1998, ensured Arsenal won the title. Arsenal beat Newcastle United 2–0 in the 1998 FA Cup Final to complete the domestic double. Given they won both honours, the other Charity Shield place went to league runners-up Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Brenda Chinnery, {{formerly}} of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana, independently described Prenoceratops in 2005 and published a new phylogeny.

5|$|Hibs {{had some}} success after being reformed, winning the 1902 Scottish Cup and their first league {{championship}} a year later. After this, however, the club endured a long barren spell. The club lost its placing in the league, and were relegated {{for the first time}} in 1931, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> promoted back to the top division two years later. The notorious Scottish Cup drought began as they reached three cup finals, two in consecutive years, but lost each of them.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} years, Bonds batted as the leadoff hitter. With Van Slyke {{also in the}} outfield, the Pirates had a venerable {{defensive}} tandem that worked together to cover {{a lot of ground}} on the field <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not close off the field. The Pirates experienced a surge in fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener.
