5|$|<b>A</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weather {{allowed the}} RAF to finally fly combat {{missions}} against the German forces surrounding Urquhart's men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions {{throughout the day}} and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe {{over the next two}} days but to little effect.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} term, 1999 to 2004, there was <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grand {{coalition}} {{resulting in a}} centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties. This {{was reflected in the}} Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary was 18 {{during the}} season and still {{eligible}} for the Under-19s and she represented her state during the tournament, which {{was held in the}} middle of <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> WNCL. She scored 119 runs at 19.83 and took nine wickets at 15.55 with a best of 4/27 against the Australian Capital Territory. At the end of the season, Ebsary was chosen in the Australia Youth team to play New Zealand A and New Zealand. In four matches she took two wickets at 32.00 at an economy rate of 2.66 but had no impact with the bat, scoring five runs at 1.66.|$|E

At Wimbledon, Kuznetsova lost in the fourth round to Agnieszka Radwańska, after leading by <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third and final set.|$|E
5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first big {{confrontation between the}} Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
5|$|Winch {{launches}} {{are much}} cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch {{may also be}} used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of {{the shape of the}} field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. <b>A</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.|$|E

5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by {{the second year of}} King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{continued}} to the west-northwest; late on August 9, the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide eyewall, {{a very unusual}} occurrence in a small and weak tropical storm. Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-level ridge. The storm briefly weakened late on August 10; it re-strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h). Soon after, strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On August 12, Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a 45mph (75km/h) tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States. After paralleling the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 {{to the east of}} New Jersey. Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Daily life at Fort Greble {{was similar}} to that {{experienced}} by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses. A soldier's normal day began with reville before sunrise and was immediately followed by morning muster, at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call. Following muster, the day was filled with work on improving the fort's defenses and drill of various types, usually consisting of gunnery practice, but also including infantry and parade drill. This schedule usually continued, broken by meal and rest breaks, until taps was called at 8:00 or 9:00p.m. Sunday was <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> routine as the muster was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call. Sunday afternoons were a soldier's free time, and this was usually filled by writing letters home, bathing, or simply catching up on extra sleep.|$|E

5|$|During December 1796 {{and early}} January 1797, the French army {{repeatedly}} attempted {{to land in}} Ireland. Early in the voyage, the frigate Fraternité carrying de Galles and Hoche, was separated from the fleet and missed the rendezvous at Mizen Head. Admiral Bouvet and General Grouchy decided to attempt the landing at Bantry Bay without their commanders, but severe weather made any landing impossible. For {{more than a week}} the fleet waited for <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm, until Bouvet abandoned the invasion on 29December and, after a brief and unsuccessful effort to land {{at the mouth of the}} River Shannon, ordered his scattered ships to return to Brest. During the operation and subsequent retreat a further 11ships were wrecked or captured, with the loss of thousands of soldiers and sailors.|$|E
5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{the band}} started {{work on their}} next album, Night in the Ruts. Aerosmith decided to go on tour during <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{recording}} schedule but tensions within the band were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to Cleveland Stadium on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the World Series of Rock festival. In a heated argument backstage, Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw {{a glass of milk}} at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument Perry quit the band and left (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). In leaving, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure Perry formed a new band called the Joe Perry Project.|$|E

5|$|In the north, Coba on {{the eastern}} side of the Yucatán Peninsula raised at least 23 large stelae. Although badly eroded their style and texts link them to cities from the Petén Basin. At the {{southern}} periphery of the Maya region, Copán developed a new high-relief style of stelae and in 652 the twelfth king ChanImixK'awiil arranged a series of these stelae to define the sacred geometry of the city, and to celebrate his royal rule and his ancestors. His son and successor UaxaclajuunUb'aahK'awiil further developed this new high-relief style of sculpture and erected a series of intricately decorated stelae in the city's Great Plaza that brought the carving of stelae close to full in-the-round three-dimensional sculpture. Both of these kings focused on their own images on their stelae and emphasised their place in the dynastic sequence to justify their rule, possibly linked to <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dynastic sequence with the death of the eleventh king of Copán.|$|E
5|$|Poland's {{communist}} government attempted {{to destroy the}} union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, {{but in the end}} was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks {{between the government and the}} Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the {{communist government}}al system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking in strength, Nicholas {{weakened}} due {{to increasing}} southwesterly wind shear, {{and the center}} of circulation briefly became exposed from the deep convection. In response to <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge, the storm turned to the north on October 18. Nicholas turned more to the west on October 20, and later on the winds in the storm decreased to minimal storm strength. Convection diminished greatly, though Nicholas unexpectedly re-strengthened as deep convection refired. After reaching winds of 50mph (85km/h), the storm again weakened due to increasing shear, and after turning to the northwest Nicholas degenerated into a tropical depression on October 23. Nicholas tracked northward in response to <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge, and on October 24, after degenerating to a remnant low pressure area, Nicholas lost what tropical characteristics it retained and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnant storm executed a large anticyclonic loop, resulting in a westward motion and a brief re-intensification into an extratropical storm on October 29. The storm continued to the west along a warm front associated with a non-tropical low to its southwest, and executed a second anticyclonic loop to the south. On October 30, convection increased over the low-level circulation of what was left to Nicholas, and the National Hurricane Center indicated a potential for tropical or subtropical development as it moved towards warmer waters. The system executed a small cyclonic loop, and on October 31 the system organized into a tropical low. It turned westward towards a non-tropical low, and on November 1 the remnants of Nicholas was absorbed by the low.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved slowly}} to the north-northwest through <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120miles (190km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina.|$|E

When the captain gets drunk and falls overboard, Picasso takes the boat to Florida, and meets up with Jesus Castro, the lead drug smuggler. Castro intimidates Picasso into running the drugs from Miami to Boston, however after Picasso collects the $1.5 million payment from the Irish Republican Army, he escapes by train to the New England town of Tyburn, where a winter storm is picking up force. He decides to lodge at the seaside Admiral Benbow Inn for the weekend, until he can depart for Italy.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} January, a broad low persisted {{south of}} the Chagos archipelago, {{becoming}} a tropical disturbance on January30 about 650km (400mi) south of Diego Garcia. The convection gradually organized as the system moved to the south-southwest, steered by <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ridge to the south caused by the remnants of Cyclone Charly. Initially the circulation was very broad, and due to its involvement with the monsoon, it resembled a monsoon depression. Early on February1, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression while turning more to the south. Around that time, it passed about 500km (310mi) east of Rodrigues. The system became extratropical on February3, after increased wind shear weakened the convection. The former depression intensified as an extratropical storm, attaining gale force winds while accelerating its forward motion due to an approaching trough. The system was no longer tracked after February6 as it approached the polar latitudes.|$|E
