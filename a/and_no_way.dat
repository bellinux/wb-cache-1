5|$|Having {{recovered}} the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> {{to stop the}} clock, Florida State was able to run out the remaining time {{in the game and}} secure a 2722 victory. Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received personal foul penalties. The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In late 2009, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) held a poll {{on their}} {{official}} website to allow fans {{to choose a}} name for their February pay-per-view. The choices included Elimination Chamber, Heavy Metal, Battle Chamber, Chamber of Conflict <b>and</b> <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out, which had been {{the name of the}} preceding Elimination Chamber-based event. The name Elimination Chamber won, but the event was still promoted as No Way Out in Germany.|$|E
5|$|By late November 1917, the Germans in East Africa {{were left}} with few options {{if they wanted to}} {{continue}} the war. They were outnumbered drastically and were split up into several different columns. The two largest of these, under Theodor Tafel and Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, were completely cut off from each other. Although von Lettow-Vorbeck's column had defeated a large British force at the Battle of Mahiwa he had lost a large number of troops and expended virtually his entire supply of modern ammunition. With only antiquated weapons <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of resupplying, von Lettow-Vorbeck decided to invade Portuguese East Africa in hopes of acquiring sufficient supplies to continue the war. There was no legal impediment to this attack; Germany had declared war on Portugal on 9 March 1916.|$|E

She made {{her return to}} the main WWE roster at the Extreme Rules {{pay-per-view}} on 29 April, replacing Beth Phoenix, who was not medically cleared to compete, in a match for the WWE Divas Championship. Despite interference from Brie Bella, Layla defeated Nikki Bella to win the WWE Divas Championship for the first time. The following night on Raw, she successfully defended the championship against both Nikki and Brie in a triple threat match, and retained twice against Beth Phoenix at the Over the Limit <b>and</b> <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out pay-per-views in May and June respectively. On the 20 August episode of Raw, Kaitlyn won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Layla's Divas Championship. At Night of Champions, Kaitlyn {{was removed from the}} championship match following a storyline injury and replaced with Eve Torres. Torres would go on to defeat Layla for the Divas Championship, ending her reign at 140 days.|$|E

Later there were {{allegations of sexual}} abuse by the founder Luis Fernando Figari. There were also detailed allegations about the founder's extreme right-wing and phalangist activism in his youth. Following an investigation, on 30 January 2017, the Vatican's Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life ordered that Figari be “prohibited from contacting, in any way, persons belonging to the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> have any direct personal contact with them.”.|$|E

25|$|Despite its name, Section IV also {{contains}} provisions referring to barristers. Before {{the passing of}} the act there was no contractual relationship between a barrister and the instructing solicitor, or between a barrister and his client. This made it very difficult to obtain damages or recover money if there was a problem. A barrister was paid only as a matter of honour—there was no contract requiring that he be paid for his services, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of gaining his fee if he was not. The way that the legal profession got around this was by making it an act of professional misconduct for a solicitor not to pay the fees of a barrister in a case.|$|E

25|$|By {{this time}} Johnson had {{lost control of}} the Democratic Party, which was {{splitting}} into four factions, each of which generally disliked the other three. The first consisted of Johnson (and Humphrey), labor unions, and local party bosses (led by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley). The second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind McCarthy. The third group were Catholics, Hispanics and African Americans, who rallied behind Robert Kennedy. The fourth group were traditionally segregationist white Southerners, who rallied behind George C. Wallace and the American Independent Party. Vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party, and Johnson could see no way to win the war <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to unite the party long enough for him to win re-election.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War on December 7, 1941, Allied Forces had little or no concrete knowledge about Japanese aircraft and their performance capabilities. The air war over China had been in full swing for over four years, little attempt had been made by Allied Intelligence agencies to learn very much about the Japanese equipment, tactics and potential. Due to severe cuts in military funding following WWI, intelligence units had not been developed for gathering and disseminating this type of information, and the bulk of concern was placed on Hitler's growing airpower and conquests in Europe. Once the US was involved in the War with Japan, there was a frantic effort to fill this information void. There was no meaningful list of Japanese aircraft types, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to identify these aircraft when encountered in combat. During this period, every single-engine Japanese fighter was identified as a Zero, and anything else was called a Mitsubishi or a Nakajima.|$|E
25|$|A {{bookkeeper}} on {{the eighth}} floor was able to warn employees on the tenth floor via telephone, {{but there was no}} audible alarm <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to contact staff on the ninth floor. According to survivor Yetta Lubitz, the first warning of the fire on the ninth floor arrived {{at the same time as}} the fire itself. Although the floor had a number of exits, including two freight elevators, a fire escape, and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place, flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women's purses. The foreman who held the stairway door key had already escaped by another route. Dozens of employees escaped the fire by going up the Greene Street stairway to the roof. Other survivors were able to jam themselves into the elevators while they continued to operate.|$|E

25|$|In {{his final}} term at Oxford Fry {{suffered}} his first (but not last) bout of mental illness, suffering a mental breakdown. There {{were a number}} of contributing factors to this. During his time at Oxford Fry had accumulated disturbingly large debts. In an attempt to alleviate his financial difficulties, Fry capitalised on his reputation to make some much-needed money. As well as writing articles (including one for Wisden), he did some private tutoring but although such activities reduced his debts they did not clear them and, further increased the intense pressure on his time. Fry's continuing indebtedness provides the most obvious explanation for his acceptance of an offer to do some nude modelling. These financial problems combined with his mother being seriously ill, placed an unbearable strain on him. Although he was able to sit his final exams, he was hardly in any fit state to do so, having hardly read a line for weeks. The result was Fry scraping a Fourth, bringing one of Oxford's most spectacular and successful careers to an inglorious end. So in the summer of 1895, only months after being the toast of Oxford, Fry found himself saddled with mounting debts <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> with which to repay them. In the short term, cricket came to his rescue. He was offered, and accepted, the chance to tour South Africa as a member of Lord Hawke's 1895–96 England touring party.|$|E
500|$|With Hardy still feuding with Johnny Nitro and {{the other}} members of MNM into 2007, he was {{challenged}} once again by Nitro at New Year's Revolution in a steel cage match for the Intercontinental Championship.

The next night on Raw, February 19, Hardy lost the Intercontinental Championship to Umaga. In April 2007, Hardy competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23. During the match, Matt threw Edge onto a ladder and encouraged Hardy, who was close to the winning briefcase, to finish him off. Hardy then leaped off the [...] ladder, drove Edge through the ladder with a leg drop, seemingly injuring both Edge and himself.
