500|$|This is {{not universally}} agreed upon. [...] Anton Bierl argues that Sappho's offer to pray to Hera is contrasted with a {{masculine}} ideology {{in which the}} pursuit of wealth is {{the solution to the}} family's problems, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggests</b> a male relative of Sappho as the addressee of the poem. [...] Lardinois sees the argument that Sappho's mother could have gone to pray to Hera for her son's safe return herself, and therefore it does not make sense for her to send Sappho to do so on her behalf, as the strongest against the thesis that the addressee is Sappho's mother, arguing on this basis for a male addressee. [...] In contrast, Mueller and Leslie Kurke both argue that the addressee is probably meant to be female, based on Sappho's use of the word [...] to describe their speech: meaning [...] "chattering" [...] or [...] "babbling", the word has negative connotations which would make Sappho unlikely to use it to address a man. [...] Anja Bettenworth has argued that the addressee is of a lower social status than Sappho, again based on the use of , but Kurke argues that the addressee is likely {{to be in a position}} of authority over Sappho, as Sappho expects them to send her to pray to Hera.|$|E

5000|$|The Big Five {{personality}} traits, {{also known}} as the five factor model (FFM), is a model based on common language descriptors of personality. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as [...] "conscientious" [...] {{is more likely to be}} described as [...] "always prepared" [...] rather than [...] "messy". This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggests</b> five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche. The five factors have been defined as openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE. Beneath each proposed global factor, a number of correlated and more specific primary factors are claimed. For example, extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions.|$|E
