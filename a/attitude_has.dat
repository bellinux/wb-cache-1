5|$|Under {{the name}} piping shrike, the white-backed magpie was {{declared}} the official {{emblem of the}} Government of South Australia in 1901 by Governor Tennyson, and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904. The magpie is a commonly used emblem of sporting teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> been likened to the Australian psyche. Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The Collingwood Football Club adopted the magpie from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892. The Port Adelaide Magpies would similarly adopt {{the black and white}} colours and Magpie name in 1902. Other examples include Brisbane's Souths Logan Magpies, and Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the magpie emblem have been heated at times. Another club, Glenorchy Football Club of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed in the same league as another club (Claremont Magpies) with the same emblem.|$|E
25|$|Law {{and order}} – During the 2002 campaign, {{law and order}} came to the forefront, {{especially}} with respect to unruly youths from poor suburbs. In late 2005, {{in some of these}} suburbs significant unrest erupted. Again, law and order was a forefront issue, mainstream candidates tackled the problem of reining in unruly youngsters. Sarkozy proposed measures for harsher criminal procedure for youngsters, while Royal proposed to send unruly youths to centres under military discipline. Sarkozy's <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> been widely criticised on the left, and also by the UMP minister Azouz Begag, who defected his party to support Bayrou following Sarkozy's management of the autumn 2005 crisis.|$|E

50|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} a search for meaning is common in conspiracism. Once cognized, {{confirmation}} bias and avoidance of cognitive dissonance may reinforce the belief. In a context where a conspiracy theory has become popular within a social group, communal reinforcement may equally play a part. Research carried out at the University of Kent suggested people {{may be influenced by}} conspiracy theories without being aware that their <b>attitudes</b> <b>have</b> changed. After reading popular conspiracy theories about the death of Princess Diana, participants in the study correctly estimated how much their peers' <b>attitudes</b> <b>had</b> changed, but significantly underestimated how much their own <b>attitudes</b> <b>had</b> grown to favor conspiracy theories.|$|R
500|$|Trotter's racial {{activism}} blossomed in 1901. He {{helped found}} the Boston Literary and Historical Association, which became, according to biographer Stephen Fox, [...] "a forum for militant race opinion". [...] He also joined the Massachusetts Racial Protective Association, another local group that promoted political goals of equality. Under {{the aegis of the}} latter group, Trotter in October 1901 gave his first major protest speech, attacking Washington's accommodationist stance: [...] "In Boston [...] said that the Negro should wait for the franchise until he had got property, education and character. Washington's <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> ever been one of servility." ...|$|E
500|$|Dante's {{confident}} and fearless <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> gained him widespread popularity. When first introduced, Game Informer {{described him as}} [...] "one of the most bad-ass characters around," [...] citing the contrast between his character and those previously seen in the Resident Evil series. His design and personality received praise from numerous reviews, such as IGN, who referred to him as [...] "a dark antihero kind of guy even a down-in-the-dumps, disgruntled teenager would love." [...] GameSpy described his appearance as [...] "awe-inspiring to look at", feeling his attire was reminiscent of Vincent Price. Empire also ranked Dante on their list of the 50 greatest video game characters as 38th, adding Dante is [...] "surely one of the coolest" [...] ones {{in the history of}} video gaming.|$|E
500|$|Meta Knight is an enigmatic, yet honorable swordsman {{who follows}} a chivalric code; this is {{exemplified}} when he gives Kirby a sword {{with which to}} fight.

He also sports a navy blue mantle called the , which can change into a pair of wings and allows him to teleport. However, these wings appear directly attached to his body in Kirby's Return to Dream Land and Kirby: Planet Robobot. Initially one of Kirby's enemies, he has since developed into Kirby's rival, and has been described as an antihero. However, he has benign intentions, as he will often fight alongside or assist Kirby when necessary for his survival or {{for the sake of the}} world. This <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> led to debate about his allegiances and has earned him the label [...] "frenemy".|$|E

500|$|While {{most of the}} {{university}} community is against {{the actions of the}} radical movements, this has not prevented the stigmatization of the student body by the general population. This <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> led to the belief that the guerrilla and subversive groups that operate in Colombia have clandestine operatives inside {{the university}}, a belief that has been supported by the discovery of unconventional weaponry inside the university grounds. [...] This has resulted in the targeting of student activists by criminal and paramilitary groups. [...] On October 4, 2006, a student of Technology of Prehospital Attention and representative at the Academic Council, Julian Andrés Hurtado, was killed by hitmen. [...] In his honor, the Government of Valle del Cauca and the Institute for the Development of Valle del Cauca ( [...] , INFIVALLE) established a scholarship program that bears his name. [...] Another situation that reflects the stigmatization of the student body is the unfounded arrests of students during the disturbances, such as those that occurred on April 3, 2008, when four students were captured without substantial evidence, and eventually released when it was demonstrated that they were not even near the confrontation site {{at the time of the}} disturbances.|$|E
500|$|Stan {{is portrayed}} as the everyman of the group, as the show's website {{describes}} him as an [...] "average, American 4th grader". Kyle is the lone Jew among the group, and his portrayal in this role is often dealt satirically. Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. They are best friends, and their friendship, symbolically intended to reflect Parker and Stone's friendship, is a common topic throughout the series. Eric Cartman (usually nicknamed by his surname only) is loud, obnoxious, and amoral, often portrayed as an antagonist. His anti-Semitic <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> resulted in a progressive rivalry with Kyle, although the deeper reason is the strong clash between Kyle's strong morality and Cartman's complete lack of such. Kenny, who comes from a poor family, wears his parka hood so tightly that it covers most {{of his face and}} muffles his speech. During the show's first five seasons, Kenny would die in nearly every episode before returning in the next with little-to-no definitive explanation given. He was written out of the show's sixth season in 2002, re-appearing in the season finale. Since then, Kenny's death has been seldom used by the show's creators. During the show's first 58 episodes, the boys were in the third grade. In the season four episode [...] "4th Grade" [...] (2000), they entered the fourth grade, but have remained ever since.|$|E
500|$|After he {{admitted}} to suffering from drink and gambling addictions he visited the Sporting Chance clinic, determined to turn his life around. After his rehabilitation, he was originally offered a trial with League One side Brighton & Hove Albion, where he scored two goals in two reserve team games against Brentford and Leyton Orient. He left without an offer of a contract, but was offered another trial with League Two side Rotherham United, where he played in a reserves victory over Huddersfield Town. On 12 November, Roberts was offered {{a contract with the}} [...] "Millers". Manager Ronnie Moore commented: [...] "He's only 22 but has real talent... people say he comes with baggage but his <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> been first class. I think he deserves a second chance." [...] Later in the month Roberts signed a one-month contract. The following month the option to extend Roberts' Rotherham deal {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season was taken. In his fifth appearance for Rotherham, a 4–2 win over Yorkshire rivals Bradford City, he scored his first goal for the club in 'sensational' fashion by finding the net with a free kick from fifty yards out. However, in April 2010 it was announced he had been sacked from Rotherham for breaking club discipline rules several times. The club did not divulge what the final breach was; though the [...] "bitterly disappointed" [...] manager said that while the player was [...] "full of remorse" [...] his teammates would not be [...] "too sorry to see him go".|$|E

500|$|Bart's rebellious <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> {{made him}} a {{disruptive}} student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever and proud of it. He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and {{is well aware of}} it, having once declared, [...] "I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?" [...] On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster, although Bart ultimately outsmarts her in the end. In [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] (season three, 1992) Bart becomes hall monitor and his grades go up, suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention, not because he is stupid. This idea is reinforced in [...] "Brother's Little Helper", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention deficit disorder. His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family. Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has, on a few occasions, helped Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel: In [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] (season five, 1994), Bart accidentally got Skinner fired and befriended him outside the school environment. Bart missed having Skinner as an adversary and got him rehired, knowing that this would mean that the two could no longer be friends.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{received}} generally negative {{reviews for}} her portrayal. Jamey Giddens of Zap2it {{wrote of the}} decision to sign Francis onto the series: [...] "Maria Arena Bell just made Brian Frons kick a puppy in the face." [...] After her debut, he called Francis' portrayal of Genevieve [...] "embarrassingly-bad", stating: [...] "I'm sure I will catch hell for going here about a daytime treasure, but Francis' portrayal of Cane and Caleb's (Daniel Goddard) unhinged mother has been cartoonish and abysmal from her first air show. I don't know if Francis is painfully attempting to channel the late Elizabeth Taylor’s fun, campy turn as Luke and Laura's arch nemesis Helena Cassadine on General Hospital 30 years ago, or going for Evil-Lyn from the old He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, but she's missing the mark either way." [...] He also wrote that as much as he would [...] "love to solely blame this performance on the writing—because let’s face it, the story is dreadful—Francis is the one making the choices to jerk, gasp and wince as Genevieve registers each and every emotion or painful memory. This is not the Genie Francis we know and love." [...] Adam Hughes of Yahoo! wrote of viewers' reactions to Francis' debut and her portrayal, stating: [...] "Since Francis arrived on the scene this spring, fan reaction to her revised on-screen <b>attitude</b> <b>has</b> been a mixed bag, but she continues to draw a ton of interest to her new CBS television digs. Former General Hospital followers may find her more biting character hard to swallow, and longtime fans of The Young and The Restless have watched her push aside some of their favorites, but Francis has undoubtedly shaken up the local landscape. Buzz is half the game when comes to keeping soap opera fans interested, and Francis has certainly delivered that." ...|$|E
