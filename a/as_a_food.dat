5|$|Use of this {{mushroom}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> source {{also seems}} to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of A.muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak. It is also consumed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{paper by}} food {{historian}} William Rubel and mycologist David Arora gives {{a history of}} consumption of A.muscaria <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> and describes detoxification methods.

The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous {{is a reflection of}} cultural bias, as several other popular edible species, notably morels, are toxic unless properly cooked.|$|E

5|$|Burying beetles are {{attentive}} parents, {{and participate}} in cooperative care and feeding of their offspring. Both parents work to bury small animal carcass to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> resource for their young and build a brood chamber around it.

After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae clean of fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E

Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young.
