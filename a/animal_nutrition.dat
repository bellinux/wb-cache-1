North East Scotland College has several campuses in the city and offers a wide variety of part-time and full-time courses leading to several different qualifications in science. The Scottish Agricultural College is based just outside Aberdeen, on the Craibstone Estate. This is situated beside the roundabout for Aberdeen Airport on the A96. The college provides three services—Learning, Research and Consultancy. The college features many land based courses such as Agriculture, Countryside Management, Sustainable Environmental Management and Rural Business Management. There are a variety of courses from diplomas through to master's degrees. The Marine Laboratory Aberdeen, which specialises in fisheries, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute (soil science), and the Rowett Research Institute (<b>animal</b> <b>nutrition)</b> are some other higher education institutions.|$|E

The extent of Rowett's contribution is not recorded; in an (undated) prospectus for the southern expedition Shackleton had estimated the total cost as [...] "about £100,000". Whatever the total, Rowett appears to have funded the lion's share, enabling Frank Wild to record later that, unique among Antarctic expeditions of the era, this one returned home without any outstanding debt. According to Wild, without Rowett's actions the expedition would have been impossible: [...] "His generous attitude is the more remarkable in that he knew there was no prospect of financial return, and what he did was in the interest of scientific research and from friendship with Shackleton." [...] His only recognition was the attachment of his name to the title of the expedition. Rowett was, according to Huntford, [...] "a stodgy, prosaic looking" [...] businessman, who was, in 1920, a co-founder and principal contributor to an <b>animal</b> <b>nutrition</b> research institute in Aberdeen known as the Rowett Research Institute (now part of the University of Aberdeen).

Treatments included three diets: frozen natural (mussel) food (M), dry formulated pellet (P) and starvation (S). Gut samples were collected at the initiation of the experiment, and after 3 and 6 months. Tank water and diet samples were also analyzed for bacterial 16 S rRNA gene diversity. Statistical analysis separated the two groups fed or starved (M and P vs. S samples). Most gut bacteria were {{not related to the}} water or diet bacteria, while bacterial diversity was higher in the starvation samples. M and P samples were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria and Tenericutes. Phylotypes clustering in Photobacterium leiognathi, Shewanella sp. and Entomoplasmatales had high frequencies in the M and P samples but low sequence frequencies in S samples.
