5|$|Unusually for a river, the Saw Mill's waters have {{consistently}} had a slightly alkaline pH, suggesting {{it has not}} been as affected by acid rain as other Hudson tributaries. In 1951, <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>Department</b> of Health survey reported pH between 7.25 and 9.1. Four decades later, another study found pH readings rising steadily from 7.59 in Chappaqua to 8.24 in Yonkers. Similarly, a 2007 Manhattan College study done for the New York State Water Resources Institute found a median low of 7.36 in Chappaqua and a median high of 7.81 near Torre Road in Yonkers, with a drop to 7.67 at the tunnel, for a total median for the river of 7.59. The lowest recorded pH in the year-long study was 7.1 at Chappaqua with the highest reading, 8.17, at Torre Road. All results were between 6.5 and 8.5, the range required by state regulations.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} form of protective body armor was chainmail. There are also {{references to the}} practice of wearing two coats of mail (dir’ayn), the one under the main one being shorter or even made of fabric or leather.

They also possessed spears and daggers. Umar was the first Muslim ruler to organize the army as <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>department.</b> This reform was introduced in 637.
