50|$|Tunnels, due {{to their}} nature, {{restrict}} fields of fire and thus any troops in a tunnel usually {{only have a few}} areas exposed to fire or sight <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> particular <b>time.</b> Also they can be part of an extensive labyrinth and have cul-de-sacs as well as reduced lighting that can create a closed-in night environment.|$|R
5|$|The gaps are {{not seen}} in a simple {{snapshot}} of {{the locations of the}} asteroids <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.|$|E
5|$|To run {{a typical}} peak morning commute, BART {{requires}} 579 cars. Of those, 535 {{are scheduled to}} be in active service; the others are used to build up four spare trains (essential for maintaining on-time service). <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> the remaining 90 cars are in for repair, maintenance, or some type of planned modification work.|$|E

Approximately 400 are full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, augmented by approximately 1100 traditional part-time air guardsmen. Approximately 100 additional foreign military {{personnel are}} also temporarily assigned to the 118 AW <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> for training in the C-130E or C-130H aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Bennett {{noted that the}} two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were {{precisely}} separated in time with little, if any, overlap. Due to this, and to their gross overall similarity, he suggested that they probably represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of Pteranodon would have been present <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> and P. sternbergi (or Geosternbergia) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of P. longiceps.|$|E

According to this estimate, the total biomass of all the ants in the world is approximately equal to the total biomass of the entire human race. Also, according to this estimate, there are approximately 1 million ants for every human on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Kumba {{features}} four {{steel and}} fiberglass trains, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train. The block sections only allow for three trains to be on the track <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> meaning the ride can still operate at full capacity when one train is receiving maintenance. Under three train operation, the ride caters for 1,700 riders per hour.|$|E

5|$|Lord Howe Island {{is known}} for its geology, birds, plants, and marine life. Popular tourist {{activities}} include scuba diving, birdwatching, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, and fishing. To relieve pressure on the small island environment only 400 tourists are permitted <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time.</b> The island is reached by plane from Sydney Airport or Brisbane Airport in less than two hours. The Permanent Park Preserve declared in 1981 has similar management guidelines to a National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{writing system}} (often called hieroglyphs from a {{superficial}} {{resemblance to the}} Ancient Egyptian writing) is a logosyllabic writing system, combining a syllabary of phonetic signs representing syllables with logogram representing entire words. Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.|$|E
