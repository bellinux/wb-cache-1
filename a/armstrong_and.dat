5|$|Armstrong's {{second and}} last spaceflight was as {{commander}} of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. <b>Armstrong</b> <b>and</b> Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to {{the lunar surface}} and spent {{two and a half}} hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon.

5|$|<b>Armstrong</b> <b>and</b> Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. <b>Armstrong</b> <b>and</b> Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E

5|$|Enterprise {{was armed}} with two 100-pounder smoothbore, muzzle-loading Somerset cannon and two rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns.

Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an {{armoured}} target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration, and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the guns from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Following the flight, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked <b>Armstrong</b> <b>and</b> {{his wife}} {{to take part in}} a 24-day {{goodwill}} tour of South America.

In Paraguay, Armstrong impressed dignitaries by greeting them in their local language, Guarani; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born Alberto Santos-Dumont, who was regarded as having beaten the Wright brothers with the first flying machine with his 14-bis.|$|E
50|$|Heyward wrote {{additional}} scenes for the film, to {{the dismay}} of Armstrong. Tenser tried to arrange it so that two versions would be made, <b>Armstrong's</b> <b>and</b> Heyward, but there was not enough money so a fourth draft was written which cobbled together all the drafts.|$|R
5000|$|In 1920, Armstrong Whitworth {{acquired}} {{the engine and}} automobile manufacturer Siddeley-Deasy.

When Vickers <b>and</b> <b>Armstrong</b> Whitworth merged in 1927 to form Vickers-Armstrongs, <b>Armstrong</b> Whitworth Aircraft <b>and</b> <b>Armstrong</b> Siddeley were bought out by J. D.
