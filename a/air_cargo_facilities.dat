25|$|In July 2003, former Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin {{announced}} a new terminal to be named for Maynard H. Jackson, Jr.. The new international terminal would be built {{on the east side}} of the airport near International Concourse E, on a site that had been occupied by <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities</b> and the midfield control tower. It has added twelve new gates able to hold wide-body jets, which can be converted to sixteen narrow-body gates, as well as check-in desks and a baggage claim area solely for international carriers. Additionally, the international terminal has its own parking lot just for international passengers with over 1,100 spaces. Arriving international passengers whose final destination is Atlanta can keep their luggage as they proceed to exit the airport. The new terminal is connected to Concourse E by the tram and also has ground transportation access via I-75.|$|E
25|$|Laredo {{is served}} by the Laredo International Airport. Daily flights are {{available}} to Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Tri-weekly flights to Las Vegas, Nevada are available. After Laredo Air Force Base closed in the mid-1970s, the federal government handed over the old air force base and property to the City of Laredo for a new municipal airport. From the mid-1970s until the mid-1990s, the airport utilized a small terminal for passenger airline service and several old hangars for air cargo and private aircraft. A new state-of-the art passenger terminal was built along the then newly constructed Loop 20 to accommodate larger jets and to increase passenger air travel through Laredo. Expansion of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities,</b> taxiways and aprons, air cargo carriers such as DHL, FedEx, UPS, BAX, and others have responded by adding commercial air cargo jet services. Laredo also has two medical helipads, at Laredo Medical Center and Doctor's Hospital.|$|E

Cargo carriers such as LAN Cargo, Atlas Air, Southern Air, Amerijet International and DHL operate from this area. The largest privately owned facility is the Centurion Cargo complex in the northeast corner of the airport, with over [...] of warehouse space. FedEx and UPS operate their own facilities in the northwest corner of the airport, off of 36th Street. In addition to its large passenger terminal in Concourse D, American Airlines operates a maintenance base to the east of Concourse D, centered around a semicircular hangar originally used by National Airlines which can accommodate three widebody aircraft.|$|E

The next day, the architect sued the airport claiming [...] "fraud" [...] and [...] "bad faith", blaming the airport authority for the problems. In early 2007, the General Manager awarded a new design contract on the new international terminal to Atlanta Gateway Designers (AGD). Construction began in the summer of 2008.

40|$|Abstract: Asia {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing regions within the global air {{transport}} market. Since the 1990 s, air cargo volumes in the region have increased dramatically. In response to such trends, many Asian countries have opened new airports or expanded existing <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities</b> to accommodate more cargo and to be developed as a regional air logistics hub. Although air cargo accounts for only 0. 3 % by weight of all cargo traded by Korea, its value share was much higher at more than 30 %. The interests in developing Korea’s air cargo industry arise due to the fast growth of the sector, and to the push by shippers and traders, and freight carriers. This paper presents an analysis of the development of air cargo industry in Korea. The characteristics and trends of air cargo industry in Korea and Northeast Asia are assessed. To identify current situation and facing problems of air cargo industry, several factors such as geographical location, costs, infrastructures, customs, and air transport policies are reviewed. The analysis includes various role players such as shippers, forwarders, airlines, customs office, airport authorities, and government. Some other issues included in this paper are air cargo information system for efficient air cargo business, sea-&-air transport, and express cargo transport, etc. Finally, this study suggests some policy implications for the development of air cargo industry in the region for the 21 st century. Key words: air cargo, efficiency 1...|$|E
40|$|The Middle Eastern city of Tehran, Iran has poor {{air quality}} {{compared}} with cities of similar size in Europe and North America. Spatial annual and seasonal patterns of SO 2 and PM 10 concentrations were estimated using land use regression (LUR) methods applied {{to data from}} 21 air quality monitoring stations. A systematic algorithm for LUR model building was developed to select variables based on (1) consistency with a priori assumptions about the assumed directions of the effects, (2) a p-value of < 0. 1 for each predictor, (3) improvements to the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) R(2), (4) a multicollinearity index called the variance inflation factor, and (5) a grouped (leave- 25 %-out) cross-validation (GCV) for final model. In addition, several new predictive variables and variable types were explored. The annual mean concentrations of SO 2 and PM 10 across the stations were 38 ppb and 100. 8 μg/m(3), respectively. The R(2) values ranged from 0. 69 to 0. 84 for SO 2 models and from 0. 62 to 0. 67 for PM 10 models. The LOOCV and GCV R(2) values ranged, respectively, from 0. 40 to 0. 56 and 0. 40 to 0. 50 for the SO 2 models; they were 0. 48 to 0. 57 and 0. 50 to 0. 55, respectively, for the PM 10 models. There were clear differences between the SO 2 and PM 10 models, but the warmer and cooler season models {{were consistent with the}} annual models for both pollutants. Although there was limited similarity between the SO 2 and PM 10 predictive variables, measures of street density and proximity to airport or <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities</b> were consistent across both pollutants.

40|$|In this paper, we {{documented}} results {{produced by}} a prototype resource allocation system that performs transfer planning for an <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> handling <b>facility</b> using a constraint-based approach.

This resource allocation problem is modelled as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP) in this research. The key objective is to optimise {{the use of the}} <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> handling <b>facility,</b> to minimise any delay to aircraft departure, and to fulfil customer service commitments.

40|$|Iowa’s Rail Environment Iowa’s rail {{transportation}} system provides both {{freight and passenger}} service. Rail serves a variety of trips, including those within Iowa and those to other {{states as well as}} to foreign markets. While rail competes with other modes, it also cooperates with those modes to provide intermodal services to Iowans. In 2009 Iowa’s {{rail transportation}} system could be described as follows: Freight Iowa’s 130, 000 -mile freight transportation system includes an extensive railroad network, a well-developed highway system, two bordering navigable waterways, and a pipeline network as well as <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities.</b> While rail accounts for only 3 percent of the freight network, it carries 43 percent of Iowa’s freight tonnage. A great variety of commodities ranging from fresh fish to textiles to optical products are moved by rail. However, most of the Iowa rail shipments consist of bulk commodities, including grain, grain products, coal, ethanol, and fertilizers. The railroad network performs an important role in moving bulk commodities produced and consumed in the state to local processors, livestock feeders, river terminals and ports for foreign export.
