5|$|Besides {{the final}} scene, other aspects were discussed: Garcia noted the acting of Richard Madden {{and how the}} Freys had been introduced. Ryan praised {{the wide range of}} {{emotions}} used by Emilia Clarke while playing Daenerys, and how Peter Dinklage played Tyrion's frustration and confusion during the episode. Both she and McNutt were glad that Tyrion's exposition scene in the tent with Bronn and Shae did not use sex to keep viewers, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in past episodes.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} to fire at trajectories with a steep angle of descent, howitzers can be fired directly, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by the 11th Marine Regiment at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, during the Korean War. Two field batteries fired directly upon {{a battalion of}} Chinese infantry; the Marines were forced to brace themselves against their howitzers, as they {{had no time to}} dig them in. The Chinese infantry took heavy casualties, and were forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} annexation of Texas {{stems from the fact that}} Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E

5|$|As {{with nearly}} every Dragon Quest game, Koichi Sugiyama {{composed}} the musical score. <b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> for Dragon Quest VI, the original sound version was bundled with the symphonic suite in a two-disc set called Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi Symphonic Suite + OST. The entire first disc {{and the opening}} track of the second disc consists of the symphonic suite, {{while the rest of}} the second disc is the original sound version. The Symphonic Suite was released alone on Super Audio CD later that year, and re-released in 2009. A disc titled Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi on Piano was also released, and contained 27 piano-arranged tracks. The Symphonic Suite was later re-recorded in 2006 along with the rest of the music from the series. An original soundtrack for the 3DS remake was released on March 19, 2014, and features the original recordings by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra from the remake.|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a {{straight}} stem and a rounded stern, but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in the earlier , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost {{less than that of}} any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly a knot slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} {{preschool}} education {{in each country}} was assessed through research and interviews with television producers, researchers, and educational experts, which paralleled what the producers of Sesame Street did in the late 1960s. Then they convened the experts {{in a series of}} meetings, held in the individual countries, to create and develop a curriculum, the show's educational goals, and its set and characters, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in 1968 in the US. Finally, they held a series of meetings, both at the CTW offices in New York City and in the individual countries, to train the co-production team in the CTW model. Writing seminars were also held in New York.|$|E

5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} animators studied real-life {{animals for}} reference, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> for the 1942 Disney film Bambi. Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios {{on several occasions}} {{with an assortment of}} lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity. The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill. The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—which, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flare—and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish. Because the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through use of longer shots following the characters.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E

5|$|US {{cast members}} Kevin Clash and Marty Robinson have cast and trained the {{international}} puppeteers. At first, Muppet builder Kermit Love constructed the puppets {{for the new}} shows in the US. According to Gikow in 2009, Jim Henson's Creature Shop, overseen by Connie Peterson, has taken over puppet creation. The producers of Sisimpur, the Bangladesh co-production, created their own traditional puppets because their puppet-making craft is thousands of years old and {{an important part of}} their culture. The producers of each co-production developed and built their own sets, live-action videos, and animations in-country. After they developed, produced, and aired the new show, they conducted research to ascertain whether their curriculum goals were met, just <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in the US after the first season of Sesame Street. According to producer Nadine Zylstra, they faced unusual challenges rarely experienced in the US. For example, riots and conflicts between Serbs and Albanians in 2004 delayed production of the Kosovo co-production for three months. In 2005, a nationwide strike in Bangladesh temporarily stalled production of their show.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with Chinese characters, Japanese Buddhist {{scholars}} sometimes created multiple {{characters with}} the same phonological value to add meaning to Siddhaṃ characters. This practice, in effect, represents a 'blend' of the Chinese style of writing and the Indian style of writing and allows Sanskrit texts in Siddhaṃ to be differentially interpreted as they are read, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with Chinese characters that the Japanese had adopted. This led to multiple variants of the same characters.|$|E

25|$|Brahmagupta's Brahmasphuṭasiddhanta is {{the first}} book that {{mentions}} zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers. Zero plus a positive number is the positive number and negative number plus zero is a negative number etc. The Brahmasphutasiddhanta is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by the Babylonians or as a symbol {{for a lack of}} quantity <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by Ptolemy and the Romans.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} {{style of}} lead drum accompaniment for the chekeré ensemble known as agbe or guiro, is {{played on the}} high-pitched quinto, instead of the lower-pitched tumba <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in earlier times.
