The Seattle Art Museum (SAM) opened in 1933; SAM opened a museum {{downtown}} in 1991 (expanded and reopened 2007); since 1991, the 1933 building has been SAM's Seattle <b>Asian</b> <b>Art</b> Museum (SAAM). SAM also operates the Olympic Sculpture Park (opened 2007) on the waterfront north of the downtown piers. The Frye Art Museum is a free museum on First Hill.|$|E

5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, {{an expert}} on South <b>Asian</b> <b>art</b> and H. Bhattacharya, author of Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject of}} Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One invocation to her calls her the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with the severed head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the historical and contemporary articulation of the ‘value’ of South <b>Asian</b> <b>Arts</b> in Britain. Having examined the development of minority arts in Britain and in particular ‘South Asian Arts’, I examine how South <b>Asian</b> <b>arts</b> organisations have presented the ‘cultural value’ of these arts to funders and participants. Taking ‘cultural value’ {{to refer to the}} value associated with engaging with and participating in art and culture (Crossick and Kaszynska, 13) this {{article examines}} how South <b>Asian</b> <b>arts</b> in the British cultural and creative industries have been impacted by the ‘value’ agenda. I find that even though South <b>Asian</b> <b>arts</b> forms {{play an important role in}} enabling audiences who may rarely engage with the cultural industries to participate in relevant <b>arts,</b> South <b>Asian</b> <b>arts</b> organisations continue to be required to articulate their value primarily as part of a commitment to ‘diversity’...|$|R

5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in <b>Asian</b> <b>art.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{the school}} {{received}} a donation of around 250 pieces of ancient, European, Middle Eastern, and <b>Asian</b> <b>art</b> from the Sponenburgh family. Alumnus Dan Schneider suggested {{to an art}} faculty member, Roger Hull, that the school should have a museum to display the university’s art collection in 1992. Then in 1994 Roger Hull made a presentation to the school’s trustees to push {{for the creation of}} an art museum. Over the next two years plans were developed and donations were made that led to the purchase of a building near campus for a museum. One large donation came from Hallie Ford and the Ford Family Foundation that allowed the purchase and remodel to move forward. The museum officially opened in 1998 with over 3,000 pieces of art, and was the second largest art museum in the state at that time.|$|E
5|$|Su {{continued}} {{his career as}} military general, and later commanded Tang forces in a war against Baekje in 660. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent following its conquest of the Khaganate. The inhabitants of the new territory did not become sinicized {{like many of the}} other kingdoms and tribes conquered by the Tang. Tang military activity in Central Asia brought in a wave of Turkic migrants serving in the Tang military as soldiers and generals, leading to the spread of Turkic language and culture. At the same time, the prevalence of Indo-European languages in the Western Regions was on the decline. Central Asia also absorbed cultural influences from Tang China. Central <b>Asian</b> <b>art</b> incorporated Tang stylistic features, like the sancai three color glaze used in pottery. Chinese coins remained in circulation in Xinjiang after the decline of the Tang. Cultural remnants of Tang architectural influence are still visible in the Buddhist architecture of Dunhuang, on the border between the Western Regions and the Hexi Corridor.|$|E

5|$|The city {{is home to}} the Victoria Art Gallery, the Museum of East <b>Asian</b> <b>Art,</b> and Holburne Museum, {{numerous}} {{commercial art}} galleries and antique shops, {{as well as a number}} of other museums, among them Bath Postal Museum, the Fashion Museum, the Jane Austen Centre, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy and the Roman Baths. The Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (BRLSI) in Queen Square was founded in 1824 from the Society for the encouragement of Agriculture, Planting, Manufactures, Commerce and the Fine Arts founded in 1777. In September 1864, BRLSI hosted the 34th annual meeting of the British Science Association, which was attended by explorers David Livingstone, Sir Richard Francis Burton, and John Hanning Speke. The history of the city is displayed at the Museum of Bath Architecture, which is housed in a building built in 1765 as the Trinity Presbyterian Church. It was also known as the Countess of Huntingdon's Chapel, as she lived in the attached house from 1707 to 1791.|$|E
5|$|The museum's National Mall {{building}} construction began in mid-1983. The project, which also included the Sackler Gallery for the Smithsonian's <b>Asian</b> <b>art,</b> created 368,000 {{square feet of}} exhibition space {{at a cost of}} $73.2 million, half of which from the federal government. Almost all of this room was created underground so as not to affect the quadrangle's landmark Smithsonian Institution Building (the Castle), its greenery, or its view. The Smithsonian Castle hides the museum and South Quadrangle from the National Mall, which has contributed to the museum's lower attendance compared with other Mall attractions. The quadrangle project's design architect was Jean-Paul Carlhian of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson & Abbott, based on a concept by Junzō Yoshimura. The two new museums had little involvement in the architectural designs, which were drawn in the 1970s prior to their arrival.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} notable for {{borrowing}} extensively from East <b>Asian</b> <b>art</b> and mythology for its universe, and employed cultural consultants Edwin Zane and calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee {{to help determine}} its art direction and settings. Its character designs are influenced by Chinese art and history, Hinduism, Taoism and Buddhism, and Yoga. The series' music and sound were composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who experimented {{with a wide range}} of different instruments, including the guzheng, pipa, and duduk, to create music and sounds that matched the Asiatic-influenced setting of the show. The art style of the various fictitious locations visited throughout the series are based on real locations in Asia. Notably, sites such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall of China in Beijing were inspirations for the Earth Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se in the show.|$|E

5|$|While Bhattacharyya's view {{is mostly}} undisputed, some {{scholars}} such as S. Shankaranarayanan – the author of The Ten Great Cosmic Powers – attribute Chhinnamasta to Vedic (ancient Hindu) antecedents. Sukumari Bhattacharji, the author of The Indian Theogony, says that the Vedic goddess Nirrti's functions were inherited by later Hindu goddesses Kali, Chamunda, Karali, and Chhinnamasta. Hindu literature first mentions Chhinnamasta in the upapurana Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana (c.950CE) and the Devi-Bhagavata Purana (9th–12th century). ElisabethA. Benard, the author of Chinnamastā: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu Tantric Goddess, says that whatever her origins may be, {{it is clear that}} Chhinnamasta/Chinnamunda was known in the 9th century and worshipped by Mahasiddhas. Though essentially agreeing with Bhattacharyya's view, Karel R. vanKooij, former Professor of South <b>Asian</b> <b>art</b> history at Leiden University, goes further and associates the iconography of Chhinnamasta with the Tantric goddesses Varahi and Chamunda.|$|E
