5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces <b>around</b> <b>Washington,</b> {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University {{has four}} campuses in Washington, D.C.: the {{undergraduate}} campus, the Medical Center, the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are {{together in the}} Georgetown neighborhood in the Northwest Quadrant of Washington and form the main campus. Other centers are located <b>around</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., including the Center for Continuing and Professional Education at Clarendon in Arlington, Virginia. Transit between these locations and the Washington Metro is supplied by a system of shuttles, known as GUTS buses. Georgetown also operates a facility in Doha, Qatar, and villas in Alanya, Turkey and Fiesole, Italy. In their campus layout, Georgetown's administrators consistently used the traditional quadrangle design.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere <b>around</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E

5|$|To fix the {{problems}} McClellan perceived in Washington's defenses, he directed Colonel Barnard {{to construct a}} continuous line from the Potomac north of Alexandria to a point west of the Aqueduct Bridge, {{one of the three}} bridges that crossed the Potomac River. By the time the Army of the Potomac was deployed for the Peninsula Campaign in March 1862, the line of defenses stretched completely <b>around</b> <b>Washington,</b> and extensions to the ring of defenses ensured the protection of the town of Alexandria and the Chain Bridge, the furthest west of the three bridges connecting Maryland and Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French {{lived and}} worked near the Square. By the 1920s, Washington Square Park was nationally {{recognized}} as {{a focal point for}} artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU. Famed residents of this time include Eugene O'Neill, John Sloan, and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios <b>around</b> <b>Washington</b> Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time {{was in the midst of}} an aggressive facilities expansion phase. In 1975, the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.|$|E
