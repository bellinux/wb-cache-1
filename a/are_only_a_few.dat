5|$|Several details {{contribute}} {{to the fact that}} there <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E

Coccomyces dentatus {{is one of only}} two species that are known to have both a spermatial and a non-spermatial state (the other is Ascodichaena rugosa).|$|E
5|$|Soon, Manne {{began to}} {{contribute}} to film music in a broader way, often combining jazz, pop, and classical music. Henry Mancini in particular found plenty of work for him; the two shared an interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on Manne to shape the percussive effects in his music. Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Hatari! (1962) and The Pink Panther (1963) <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of Mancini's films where Manne's drums and special percussive effects could be heard.|$|E

5|$|The final {{images were}} {{released}} {{at a meeting}} of the American Astronomical Society in January 1996, and revealed a plethora of distant, faint galaxies. About 3,000 distinct galaxies could be identified in the images, with both irregular and spiral galaxies clearly visible, although some galaxies in the field <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects in the field are distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 150 {{important}} fossil sites from the Jurassic, the majority in Eastern Europe and North Asia. Outstanding sites include Solnhofen in Upper Bavaria, Germany, Karatau in South Kazakhstan, the Yixian formation in Liaoning, North China, {{as well as the}} Jiulongshan formation and further fossil sites in Mongolia. In North America there <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> sites with fossil records of insects from the Jurassic, namely the shell limestone deposits in the Hartford basin, the Deerfield basin and the Newark basin.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{standing}} {{fresh water}} on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg lenses), and wells {{have been built}} to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral gravel and sand, with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich; {{but even in the}} oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll, soils <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> centimeters (one or two inches) thick.|$|E

5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} the {{breeding}} season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} so. Some birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young. As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is an {{endangered}} species and has recently become threatened with extinction. It is estimated that there <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand katipo left in about 50 areas in the North Island and eight in the South Island, making it rarer than some species of kiwi. A number of reasons have contributed to its decline; the major factors appear to be loss of habitat and declining quality of the remaining habitat. Human interference with their natural habitat has been occurring {{for over a century}} following European settlement. Coastal dune modification resulting from agriculture, forestry, or urban development along with recreational activities like the use of beach buggies, off-road vehicles, beach horse riding and driftwood collection have destroyed or changed areas where katipo lives. The introduction of many invasive exotic plants has also contributed to the decline of suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, even though they <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E

To the north there is a steep ridge that <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred feet wide, this ridge makes the river go an extra four miles (6 km) between the dam and the powerhouse.

5|$|The {{three main}} {{industries}} on Svalbard are coal mining, tourism, and research. In 2007, there were 484 {{people working in}} the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK142 million (16,098,404 USD) In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing {{is owned by the}} various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; there <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels {{to the east of}} the Polden Hills. It rises in hills near the {{southern}} border of the county, flows through Bruton, where it is joined by the River Pitt, and on through Baltonsborough. The lower reaches have been diverted into a channel that joins the Parrett at Burnham-on-Sea in Bridgwater Bay. There is a raised bog in the central Brue valley and the surrounding area is a mosaic of swamps, meres and alder woodland. The River Parrett rises in the hills around Chedington in Dorset and flows northwestwards past Aller, Somerset, and through the Somerset Levels to Bridgwater, after which it becomes an estuary with its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The river has a tidal bore, similar to that in the River Severn. The Somerset Levels <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> feet above sea level and liable to flooding. They are drained by ditches and channels that drain into the Parrett including the King's Sedgemoor Drain, just south of the Polden Hills.|$|E
