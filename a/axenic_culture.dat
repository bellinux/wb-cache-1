5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in <b>axenic</b> <b>culture</b> in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

Species such as Suillus variegatus and Paxillus involutus were able to mineralize 2,4-dichlorophenol both in <b>axenic</b> <b>culture</b> and in an EcM association with Pinus sylvestris. The intact rhizosphere of Pinus taeda also exhibited the capacity to mineralize tetrachloroethylene under natural conditions. The EcM fungi Radiigera atrogleba and Hysterangium garneri were capable of decomposing up to 80% of a particular PCB when tested.|$|E

The mushrooms are usually deformed, often lacking stalks so that the cap grows directly on the surface, and the caps are usually [...] in diameter. There are few Boletaceae species known to fruit in culture, as ectomycorrhizal fungi tend to not fruit when separated from their host plant.|$|E

40|$|Under axenic growth conditions, trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica contain {{heterogenous}} {{amounts of}} DNA {{due to the}} presence of both multiple nuclei and different amounts of DNA in individual nuclei. In order to establish if the DNA content and the observed heterogeneity is maintained during different growth conditions, we have compared E. histolytica cells growing in xenic and <b>axenic</b> <b>cultures.</b> Our results show that the nuclear DNA content of E. histolytica trophozoites growing in <b>axenic</b> <b>cultures</b> is at least 10 fold higher than in xenic <b>cultures.</b> Re-association of <b>axenic</b> <b>cultures</b> with their bacterial flora led to a reduction of DNA content to the original xenic values. Thus switching between xenic and axenic growth conditions was accompanied by significant changes in the nuclear DNA content of this parasite. Changes in DNA content during encystation-excystation were studied in the related reptilian parasite E. invadens. During excystation of E. invadens cysts, it was observed that the nuclear DNA content increased approximately 40 fold following emergence of trophozoites in <b>axenic</b> <b>cultures.</b> Based on the observed large changes in nuclear size and DNA content, and the minor differences in relative abundance of representative protein coding sequences, rDNA and tRNA sequences, it appears that gain or loss of whole genome copies may be occurring during changes in the growth conditions.

40|$|A {{new method}} using {{lysozyme}} {{for the production}} of <b>axenic</b> <b>cultures</b> of Anabaena flos-aquae De Brebisson and Aphanothece nidulans P. Richter was developed. Cyanobacterial growth was not inhibited at concentrations up to 1. 2 g·L- 1 of lysozyme, whereas the growth of heterotrophic bacteria was suppressed. At concentrations up to 0. 8 g·L- 1 of lysozyme, ampicillin caused a reduction of heterotrophic bacteria.
