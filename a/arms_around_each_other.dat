5|$|The next day's {{stage was}} preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a {{procession}} in Weylandt's memory. In keeping with convention, there was no competitive racing. Each of the 23 teams took {{to the front of}} the peloton for about 15 minutes, and the remaining Leopard Trek squad, along with Farrar, were allowed to finish first with their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Millar led the rest of the field across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the Leopard Trek team to lead another moment of silence. Subsequently, Farrar and the remaining Leopard Trek squad all decided to leave the race. Feillu did not want to leave the Giro, feeling that continuing to race would have been the best way to honor Weylandt, but he did not mind acquiescing to his teammates' will. For most of them, the decision was based on a desire to attend Weylandt's funeral, which took place nine days after his death. Members of the Giro squad served as pallbearers. Other teammates, as well as Farrar, members of Weylandt's former team , and Giro director Angelo Zomegnan were all in attendance, along with hundreds of cycling fans assembled outside the chapel.|$|E
25|$|Public touch {{can serve}} as a ‘tie sign’ that shows others that your partner is “taken”. When a couple is holding hands, putting their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> this is a ‘tie sign’ showing others that you are together. The use of ‘tie signs’ are used more often by couples in the dating and {{courtship}} stages than between their married counterparts according to Burgoon, Buller, and Woodall.|$|E
25|$|Angkor Wat, {{the largest}} Angkorian temple (built AD 1116–1150), {{features}} both apsaras and devata, however the devata type {{are the most}} numerous with more than 1,796 in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (30–40cm as seen at left) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately 95–110cm) more prominently {{at every level of}} the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewelry and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period. Some devatas appear with <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and seem to be greeting the viewer. “The devatas seem to epitomize all the elements of a refined elegance,” wrote Marchal.|$|E

500|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{said in a}} post-stage {{press conference}} that race officials would respect whatever decision the peloton made regarding the next day's stage. As usually occurs when a rider dies {{in the midst of}} a multi-day cycling event, the next day was not competitively raced. Instead, the stage was preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a procession in Weylandt's memory.

500|$|On January 26, 2014 {{the couple}} opened the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, {{performing}} the song live {{together for the}} first time. The performance opened with Beyoncé sporting wet-look hair in a leotard and a leather basque, sitting on a chair {{with her back to the}} audience. She conctinued seductively dancing cabaret-style, singing and gyrating on the dark stage surrounded by smoke. Jay-Z appeared to rap his verses dressed in a suit and bow tie. The sexually-charged performance ended with a kiss and the two walked off with their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Beyoncé's chair dance received comparisons with scenes from the movie Flashdance, the song's music video and the video for [...] "Partition"; VH1's Emily Exton felt that it was one of the best chair dances of all time. The duet was described as [...] "scorching" [...] and [...] "chill inducing" [...] with many critics considering the performance to be a show highlight; Lily Harrison of E! added that the pair [...] "set the bar impossibly high". A Rolling Stone editor felt it was [...] "near flawless". Nadeska Alexis writing for MTV News noted that when the singer started singing the first verses of the song, [...] "you could almost taste the aroma of sex appeal in the air". A negative review came from Beverly Beckham of The Boston Globe who felt that the pair failed to showcase love in the lyrics and performance.|$|E

60|$|Also, {{he had a}} cough, and {{he gasped}} and hacked and spluttered prodigiously.

60|$|They {{were very}} angry. There was an opening {{into the trunk}} close to the ground. They {{gathered}} wood and grass and built a fire. The Swift One and I, our <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> waited and watched in the thicket. Sometimes they threw upon the fire green branches with many leaves, whereupon the smoke became very thick.|$|E

Holding me by the hand he led me inside. It connected by a narrow crevice with another cave, and it was through this that we regained the open air.|$|E

60|$|We {{began the}} return without thought of haste or of danger, and were come midway between {{headquarters}} {{and the most}} southerly battery, when without warning we arrived {{face to face with}} a party of six Tories, who, with their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> necks, were reeling to and fro in the most convivial fashion on what was probably intended to be a pleasant stroll in the night air.|$|R
6000|$|In {{all there}} was an air of release, and the young people {{looked as if they}} were going to one of the social gatherings they would have called a frolic, in the backwoods phrase. Nancy heard a girl titter in {{response}} to her companion's daring whisper, [...] "Wonder if Mis' Hingston's going to pass round the apples and cider." [...] They walked in couples, openly or demurely glad of being together for the time; and as if the miracle before them were the wonder of coming home through the woods with their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> whether the miracle of the seamless raiment was wrought or not.|$|E
60|$|We {{looked at}} it with startled eyes. The heat of it drove us back. Another tree caught, and another, and then half a dozen. We were frightened. The monster had broken loose. We {{crouched}} down in fear, while the fire ate around the circle and hemmed us in. Into Lop-Ear's eyes came the plaintive look that always accompanied incomprehension, and I know that in my eyes {{must have been the}} same look. We huddled, with our <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> until the heat began to reach us and the odor of burning hair was in our nostrils. Then we made a dash of it, and fled away westward through the forest, looking back and laughing as we ran.|$|E
60|$|They threw their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and trembled {{at their}} own success; for, as the legends of this wondrous gem rushed thick upon their memory, they felt {{themselves}} marked out by fate and the consciousness was fearful.

They seemed changed to one another's eyes, in the red brilliancy that flamed upon their cheeks, while it lent the same fire to the lake, the rocks, and sky, and to the mists which had rolled back before its power. But, with their next glance, they beheld an object that drew their attention even from the mighty stone. At {{the base of the}} cliff, directly beneath the Great Carbuncle, appeared the figure of a man, with his arms extended in the act of climbing, and his face turned upward, as if to drink the full gush of splendor. But he stirred not, no more than if changed to marble.|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} dance move, the hands {{must be held}} open facing down and {{continuously}} waving them over another two times for six beats. The second involves tossing the thumb over the shoulder twice, right before spinning one's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> while raising from the waistline to face level.

6000|$|... 'Manda Grier took Statira's part pretty sharply. She {{said it was}} {{one thing}} to live out in a private family--that was a disgrace, if you could keep the breath of life in you any other way--and it was quite another to wait in an hotel; and she did not want to have any one hint round that she would let Statira demean herself. Lemuel was {{offended}} by her manner, and her assumption of owning Statira. She defended him, but he could not tell her how he had changed; the influences were perhaps too obscure for him to have traced them all himself; after the first time he had hardly mentioned the art- student girls to her. There were a great many things that Statira could not understand. She had been much longer in the city than Lemuel, but she did not seem to appreciate the difference between that and the country. She dressed very stylishly; no one went beyond her in that; but in many things he could see that she remained countrified. Once on a very mild April evening, when they were passing through the Public Garden, she wished him to sit on a vacant seat they came to. All the others were occupied by young couples who sat with their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
60|$|Thinking thus, Arthur {{made his}} way to bed. The {{excitement}} of the day had wearied him, and for a while he slept soundly, but, as the fatigue of the body wore off, the activity of his mind asserted itself, and he began to dream vague, happy dreams of Angela, that by degrees took shape and form, till they stood out clear before the vision of his mind. He dreamt that he and Angela were journeying, two such happy travellers, through the green fields in summer, till by-and-by they came to the dark entrance of a wood, into which they plunged, fearing nothing. Thicker grew the overshadowing branches, and darker grew the path, and now they journeyed lover-wise, with their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> But, as they passed along, they came to a place where the paths forked, and here he stooped to kiss her. Already he could feel the thrill of her embrace, when she was swept from him by an unseen force, and carried down the path before them, leaving him rooted where he was. But still he could trace her progress as she went, wringing her hands in sorrow; and presently he saw the form of Lady Bellamy, robed as an Egyptian sorceress, and holding a letter in her hand, which she offered to Angela, whispering in her ear. She took it, and then in a second the letter turned to a great snake, with George's head, that threw its coils around her and struck at her with its fangs. Next, the darkness of night rushed down upon the scene, and out of the darkness came wild cries and mocking laughter, and the choking sounds of death. And his senses left him.|$|E

In addition, the melody to most Tamzaras is very similar, though there are exceptions. Like most Anatolian folk dances, Tamzara is done as a [...] "line dance" [...] or [...] "circle dance", with a large group of people with {{interlocked}} pinkies.

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|R
60|$|As Cicely {{had never}} had any {{objection}} to Miss Bannister, excepting her frequent appearances in Ralph's conversation, she received Dora's felicitations with the same cordiality that she saw in her lovely eyes and on her lips. And Mrs. Drane thought that if this girl were {{a sample of the}} Haverleys' friends and neighbors, her daughter's lot would be even more pleasant than she had supposed it would be. As for Miriam, she and Dora walked together, their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> waists, {{up and down in the}} garden, and back and forward in the orchard, until the Bannister coachman went to sleep on his box.|$|R
60|$|Sir Nigel, meanwhile, {{had found}} a foeman worthy of his steel for his {{opponent}} {{was none other than}} Sebastian Gomez, the picked lance of the monkish Knights of Santiago, who had won fame in a hundred bloody combats with the Moors of Andalusia. So fierce was their meeting that their spears shivered up to the very grasp, and the horses reared backwards until it seemed that they must crash down upon their riders. Yet with consummate horsemanship they both swung round in a long curvet, and then plucking out their swords they lashed at each other like two lusty smiths hammering upon an anvil. The chargers spun round each other, biting and striking, while the two blades wheeled and whizzed and circled in gleams of dazzling light. Cut, parry, and thrust followed so swiftly upon each other that the eye could not follow them, until at last coming thigh to thigh, they cast their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and rolled off their saddles to the ground. The heavier Spaniard threw himself upon his enemy, and pinning him down beneath him raised his sword to slay him, while a shout of triumph rose from the ranks of his countrymen. But the fatal blow never fell, for even as his arm quivered before descending, the Spaniard gave a shudder, and stiffening himself rolled heavily over upon his side, with the blood gushing from his armpit and from the slit of his vizor. Sir Nigel sprang to his feet with his bloody dagger in his left hand and gazed down upon his adversary, but that fatal and sudden stab in the vital spot, which the Spaniard had exposed by raising his arm, had proved instantly mortal. The Englishman leaped upon his horse and made for the hill, at the very instant that a yell of rage from a thousand voices and the clang of a score of bugles announced the Spanish onset.|$|E

Davys mother has difficulty adjusting to the new living situation, and acts resentful and cold to her son. Davys father is more understanding, but also more distant, as he is remarried and sees Davy only sporadically. Davys only friend is his dog Fred, until he meets Douglas Altschuler, a classmate at his new school who is also an only child living with a single mother. Davy and Altschuler begin spending time together, and eventually kiss, sleep in the same bed with their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and engage in other erotic acts (described in the book as [...] "making out" [...] and [...] "doing it", without more details).
