5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure.</b> In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic linkages are phosphorothioate linkages, the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of nucleic acids, OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy nucleic acids by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester moiety. This property determines the use of OPS as antisense oligonucleotides in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of siRNA, at least one phosphorothioate linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and antisense strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to enzymatic degradation than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E

500|$|An iris {{is a thin}} {{metal plate}} across the {{waveguide}} {{with one or more}} holes in it. [...] It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity. [...] Some of the possible geometries of irises <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 5. [...] An iris which reduces the width of a rectangular waveguide has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductance, whereas one which restricts the height is equivalent to a shunt capacitance. [...] An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel LC resonant circuit. [...] A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide. [...] Narrowband filters frequently use irises with small holes. [...] These are always inductive regardless of the shape of the hole or its position on the iris. [...] Circular holes are simple to machine, but elongated holes, or holes {{in the shape of a}} cross, are advantageous in allowing the selection of a particular mode of coupling.|$|E

[...] Port 2 is the transmitted port where the power from port 1 is outputted, less the portion that went to port 3. [...] Directional couplers are frequently symmetrical so there also exists port 4, the isolated port. [...] A portion of the power applied to port 2 will be coupled to port 4. [...] However, the device is not normally used in this mode and port 4 is usually terminated with a matched load (typically 50 ohms). [...] This termination can be internal to the device and port 4 is not accessible to the user. [...] Effectively, this results in a 3-port device, hence the utility of the second symbol for directional couplers in figure 1.Naval Air Warfare Center, p.6-4.1 ...|$|E
