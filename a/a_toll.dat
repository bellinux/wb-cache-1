50|$|Many entrances {{and exits}} have tolls. In general, exits have tolls when they precede <b>a</b> barrier <b>toll,</b> and exits are free when they follow <b>a</b> barrier <b>toll.</b> Conversely, entrances that precede <b>a</b> barrier <b>toll</b> are free; and tolls are paid at entrances just beyond <b>a</b> barrier <b>toll.</b> This avoids double <b>tolling</b> (e.g., paying <b>a</b> barrier <b>toll</b> and then {{immediately}} paying again to exit) and under-tolling (e.g., driving {{a long distance}} and then exiting for free just before <b>a</b> barrier <b>toll).</b>|$|R

A further extension will push the highway further east to Highway 35 / Highway 115 in Clarington by 2020, {{with a second}} link to Highway 401 known as Highway 418.|$|R
5|$|All intersections found {{along the}} route are grade separated, except for a single {{at-grade}} intersection currently regulated by traffic lights; a new route is planned to bypass this intersection. As of June 2012, there were tenexits and twoservice areas {{along the route}}. The motorway is currently toll-free except for the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar-Rogovići section. However, most of the motorway is potentially <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> road using a ticket system, with each exit including <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> plaza except those of Veprinac, Opatija, and Matulji. The toll system of the A8/A9 Istrian Y is integrated: no ticket needs to be turned in, gotten, or exchanged when going from the A8 to the A9 or vice versa.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters had taken <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on the terra cotta statue, as had {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem {{the damage done}} by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing in {{the form}} of {{variable}} tolls by time-of-the-day have also been implemented in bridges and tunnels providing access to the central business districts of several major cities. In most cases there was <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> already in existence.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> few <b>toll</b> {{facilities}} cover <b>a</b> {{very wide}} area, making fixed toll gates impractical. The most notable {{of these is}} <b>a</b> truck <b>tolling</b> system in Germany. This system instead uses Global Positioning System location information to identify when a vehicle is located on <b>a</b> <b>tolled</b> Autobahn. Implementation of this system {{turned out to be}} far lengthier and more costly than expected.|$|R
5|$|In late 2016, the City of Toronto {{and mayor}} John Tory {{considered}} imposing <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> {{to use the}} highway, along with the Gardiner Expressway, to cover the maintenance costs of the highway and support public transit construction.|$|E
5|$|Milton and Houston Mann opened <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> road to Yosemite Valley in 1856, up the South Fork of the Merced River. They {{charged the}} then {{considerable}} sum of two dollars per person until {{the road was}} bought by Mariposa County, after which it became free.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to being}} under State control, the section between Sears Point and Vallejo {{was known as}} the Sears Point Toll Road, <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> road managed by Golden Gate Ferry that was built over an ancient Native American trail.

5|$|Route 413 {{begins at}} the state line, midway along the BurlingtonBristol Bridge, as a {{continuation}} of PA413. As the road descends from the bridge, <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> booth spans {{the width of the}} road though <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> is only collected for westbound traffic. The highway heads southward, heading along Keim Boulevard, and becomes maintained by Burlington County. For eastbound traffic, a right-in/right-out intersection with Veterans Drive is present while for westbound traffic, an exit for Reed Street is located before the toll booths. South of here, an oblong traffic circle, bisected by the River Line railroad, is found and has intersections with West Broad Street.|$|E
5|$|SR11 is {{proposed}} to be <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> facility {{that will serve}} a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa, the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry. It will connect SR 905 and SR 125 to the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 corridor that connects to Mexican Federal Highway 2D and Mexican Federal Highway 2 to Tecate, and Mexican Federal Highway 1D to Ensenada.|$|E
5|$|The Bolton to Leigh {{road was}} turnpiked in about 1770 and <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> gate was {{installed}} on the Atherton boundary on Bolton Road. Shakerley Lane toll road emerged near Green Hall on Bolton Road, and was built to get coal from the Shakerley pits to the turnpike road.|$|E
50|$|Drivers {{have the}} option of opening <b>a</b> <b>tolling</b> account. This {{includes}} <b>an</b> electronic <b>tolling</b> device, or transponder, to be mounted on the vehicle's windshield. It detects usage of the bridge, allowing toll charges to be automatically billed to the driver's account, streamlining the tolling process.|$|R

5|$|The A1 is <b>a</b> <b>tolled</b> {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using <b>a</b> closed <b>toll</b> system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming <b>a</b> unified <b>toll</b> system. Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – <b>an</b> electronic <b>toll</b> collection (ETC) which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at <b>toll</b> plazas and <b>a</b> discounted <b>toll</b> rates.|$|R
5|$|The bridge carries two {{lanes of}} European Route E39, {{also called the}} Coastal Highway, and one {{pedestrian}} and bicycle path, and connects the district of Nordhordland to Bergen. Plans for a bridge had existed since the 1960s, and after the decision to construct the bridge {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway in 1989, construction started in 1991. Total costs, including auxiliary roads, was NOK 910 million. Part of the contract payment was subject to a court case which the contractors lost. The bridge opened on 22 September 1994, and remained <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> road until 31 December 2005. In 2014, it had an average daily traffic of 16,580 vehicles. There are plans to reinstate <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> on the bridge from 2013 to finance other road projects. The bridge is the second-longest in Norway, and the second pontoon bridge in Norway.|$|E
5|$|The {{causeway}} {{was originally}} <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> road, and costs for crossing ranged from one penny (1d) {{for a person}} on foot to 6d for a horse-drawn cart. The tolls were subject to an additional levy of 50 per cent during the night hours. The tolls were later removed, and {{it appears to have}} been Perth's only toll road.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. All intersections of the A5 motorway are grade separated. There are four exits and four rest areas operating along the route. The motorway is tolled using a ticket system, integrated with the A3, and each exit includes <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> plaza.|$|E

5|$|The {{second issue}} was {{that both the}} Glasgow and Ayr {{stations}} were awkward. The Glasgow station, at Bridge Street, was on {{the south of the}} Clyde (and Glasgow Bridge carried <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> at the time). The Ayr station was north of the River Ayr, and although not inconvenient for passenger access to the town, the location prevented southward railway extension.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} route also {{follows the}} river {{along the edge}} of the Laramie Mountains to an area near the current towns of Casper and Glenrock. In 1847, during the first Mormon emigration, Brigham Young established a ferry near present-day Casper known as Mormon Ferry. The next year the ferry was moved a few miles downriver. The ferry was free for Latter Day Saints, but charged <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> for other users. The ferry was manned by groups of Mormons every summer from 1848 until 1852. In 1853 John Baptiste Richard built <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> bridge near the ferry site, which would eventually put all ferries on the North Platte out of business. In 1859, Louis Guinard built the Platte Bridge near the site of the original Mormon Ferry. Guinard also built a trading post at one end of the bridge which eventually became Fort Caspar.|$|E
5|$|The tolls are {{collected}} at <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> plaza located on Føyno. The plaza is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, {{so that any}} car passes through the plaza once. However, traffic only traveling between Føyno to Bømlo {{does not have to}} pay. Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo need to use the interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. The plaza has six lanes, of which two in each direction have <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount.|$|E
50|$|The {{highway is}} a four-to-six lane controlled-access, tolled {{motorway}} with grade-separated interchanges and intersections built according to modern international standards. Tolling {{of the highway}} is governed by <b>a</b> <b>Tolling</b> Policy.|$|R
