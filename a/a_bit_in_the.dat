25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{others argue that}} {{evidence}} of bit wear does not necessarily correlate to riding. Some theorists speculate that a horse could have been controlled from the ground by placing <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth, connected to a lead rope, and leading the animal while pulling a primitive wagon or plow. Since oxen were usually relegated to this duty in Mesopotamia, {{it is possible that}} early plows might have been attempted with the horse, and a bit may indeed have been significant as part of agrarian development rather than as warfare technology.|$|E

His form dipped <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the tournament, but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls. He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final, and 91 runs in the second final.|$|E

Allman's career slowed considerably after 1972, and her only television work that decade was the 1977 television film Halloween with the New Addams Family. Her career revived <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s with eleven television appearances, including two appearances on Murder She Wrote. Allman also worked as {{a real estate agent}} in addition to her acting in the 1970s and 1980s. In her autobiography, Mary Tyler Moore credits Allman with finding her house.|$|E
25|$|The U.S held {{strength}} in the Asian region from aggravating European imperialist encroachment. To Japan, this represented a developing threat to {{the autonomy of the}} region. U.S.-Japanese relations would recover <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century, but by the early 1920s, few in Japan believed that the United States meant anything positive for the future of Asia. By the 1930s, the U.S. presence in Asian affairs, along with the instability in China and the collapse of the Western economic order, Japan would act aggressively with respect to China, setting the precedent that would ultimately culminate in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Some scholars suggest that Japan's road to World War II had begun not upon winning the Russo–Japanese War, but when it lost the peace.|$|E
25|$|MIPS III {{removed the}} Coprocessor 3 (CP3) support instructions, and reused its opcodes {{for the new}} doubleword instructions. The {{remaining}} coprocessors gained instructions to move doublewords between coprocessor registers and the GPRs. The floating general registers (FGRs) were extended to 64 bits and the requirement for instructions to use even-numbered register only was removed. This is incompatible with earlier versions of the architecture; <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floating-point control/status register is used to operate the MIPS III floating-point unit (FPU) in a MIPS I- and II-compatible mode. The floating-point control registers were not extended for compatibility. The only new floating-point instructions added were those to copy doublewords between the CPU and FPU convert single- and double-precision floating-point numbers into doubleword integers and vice versa.|$|E

Of course Jim would stay true to his real soulmate." [...] Sepinwall noted Dwight's cartoonish behavior in the episode, although he called it a good addition to the Jim-Cathy story-line.

500|$|Astana {{turned in}} their strongest team time trial {{performance}} in the Vuelta, finishing fourth of the 22 teams. Kiserlovski commented after the ride that the team was well pleased with fourth place and the small time gap to the stage winners [...] Gasparotto had high placings in stages 2 and 3, but did not come especially close to winning either, taking seventh in a field sprint and then ninth over a minute down on the back-to-back days. In the Vuelta's first summit finish {{the next day in}} the Sierra Nevada, Kessiakoff finished in the 29-rider leading peloton 11 seconds back of the stage winner, which moved him up to seventh overall. Kashechkin, on the other hand, finished in the second-to-last large group, losing 18 minutes and any chance at serious overall contention. Kessiakoff moved up to sixth the next day by finishing tenth on the Valdepeñas de Jaén climb. After two more tenth places on difficult stages, Kessiakoff's position improved to fourth overall, gaining that position on stage 9. He occupied fifth after stage 11, having slipped <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stage 10 individual time trial, still leaving him to be described as the [...] "big surprise of the Vuelta a España." [...] After 11 stages, Kashechkin lay 107th, nearly {{an hour and a half}} behind the race leader. Team manager Martinelli stated that no pressure for a particular final placing would be put on Kessiakoff. Sporting director Aydar Mahmet expressed the team's dissatisfaction with Kashechkin publicly suggesting the expectation of a high placing when he obviously did not have the form to attain it.|$|E

500|$|On 1 December, Benfica played Porto in the Clássico. Ricardo Quaresma took {{advantage}} of a 42nd-minute counterattack to dribble past David Luiz and score the winning goal for Porto. It was Benfica's first league loss at Luz since 28 January 2006. Camacho said, [...] "We were inexperienced, failed to retain the ball and allowed counter-attacks." [...] Three days later, Benfica travelled to Donetsk to play Shakhtar in the final match of the Champions League group stage, and Cardozo scored twice in the first 25 minutes to give Benfica the win. The club overtook Shakhtar, finishing third and qualifying for the UEFA Cup, and Camacho {{was pleased with the}} result. On 9 December, Benfica began their Portuguese Cup run by hosting Académica. The club won with goals by Luisão and Cardozo; Académica scored a consolation goal after a mistake by Benfica's goalkeeper, Butt. According to Camacho, [...] "We suffered <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half. Académica's goal complicated things." [...] League play resumed on 15 December, with Benfica commuting to the Estádio do Restelo to face Belenenses. The club failed to stem their hosts' momentum, giving up a 71st-minute goal for their second-straight league loss. Camacho accepted the blame: [...] "When you lose it is always the manager's fault. I failed to pass the message to my players." [...] Benfica ended 2007 by hosting Estrela da Amadora on 20 December, winning 3–0 with all goals scored in the second half. The win placed Benfica seven points behind league leaders Porto, who had their first league loss to Nacional. On 21 December, Benfica participated in the UEFA Cup draw for the round of 32 and was paired with German team 1. FC Nürnberg.|$|E

2500|$|Jessica Grose of Spin viewed that Donnelly seems [...] "to be {{lobbying}} for goth poster girl {{of the new}} millennium", stating that the album successfully bordered on both metal and punk influences.

2500|$|The {{approach}} to preventing pest infestation has changed quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> methodology employed.

[...] These newer techniques, termed {{integrated pest management}} (IPM), {{can be just as}} effective with careful and thorough planning. [...] Different object materials are sensitive to different infestations, so a thorough material understanding of the artifacts to be protected and the pests resident to the area is required. [...] Risks involving the collection building, constructive and decorative materials, and staff activities should be assessed, and a program should then be put in place which reduces these risks.|$|E

He gave the prize money away (half of it to Harrison), saying [...] "prizes are for boys, and I'm all grown up". He himself was a great financial supporter of twentieth century music, often supporting works that were written by other composers.

2500|$|Gareth Batty {{increased}} his second innings tally to 5 for 87 to dismiss Derbyshire {{early on the}} fourth day, as Stubbings' innings ended with just 10 added to the previous day's score {{for a total of}} 58. By the time they were all out for 285, Derbyshire had set a target of just 71 in 68 overs. It took them only 14 as Peters and Moore won the match for them by 10 wickets. It was an easy victory for Worcestershire in the end, helped by Derbyshire dropping 6 catches along the way. Worcester coach Tom Moody said, [...] "We haven't got our overseas players here but this was {{a good example of the}} depth of our squad. To have a successful season, you need players who can come in and stand up and be counted and they've done that. The game proved that catches win matches with Derbyshire dropping six while Worcestershire hardly missed an opportunity. We were let off the hook <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first innings with some dropped chances but our catching was exceptional, particularly with the conditions being so cold. I think the cold weather was the hardest thing for Gareth [...] because it's difficult for a spinner to get his hands warm and grip the ball." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first single, [...] "Never Again", was {{released}} on April 13, 2007 in the U.S., and despite debuting in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 thanks to strong digital sales, it never achieved substantial airplay and was pulled from many stations {{only a couple of}} weeks following its release. Otherwise, the album opened successfully; its opening week sales comparable to those of Clarkson's first two albums. It was suggested that so much controversy would have hindered the sales of Clarkson's then-new album. M.

[...] In spite of the controversy surrounding My December, the album garnered fairly positive reviews from music professionals and critics. The album scored 64/100 on Metacritic, indicating generally positive reviews. Slant Magazine reviewed My December mostly positive, with the album receiving a 3.5/5 star review. An excerpt from the review, in response to the disappointing performance of [...] "Never Again", read: [...] "But who cares about hits—or appeasing the kids—when the songs are this good?" [...] The Times wrote: [...] "Clarkson has the moxie to rock without worrying about what anybody else thinks...
