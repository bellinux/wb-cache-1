5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the purpose of one's life and {{the relationship with the}} rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) {{and the relationship between}} the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E

5|$|Varner then {{considers}} {{a range of}} proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; factory farming, for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> {{the relationship between a}} Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The World Englishes initiative, in {{recognizing}} and describing the New Englishes of the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, has been partly motivated by <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the local linguistic factors and partly by <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the wider {{cultural and political}} contexts of language acquisition and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of pluralism and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties {{in this context is}} similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, just as Rabbinic Judaism was in {{part the}} Pharisaic {{response}} to their acknowledgment that the Temple would not be rebuilt in their lifetimes, Christianity reflected the acknowledgment of early Christians that the Second Coming of Christ {{and the establishment of}} God's kingdom on earth was not to happen in their lifetimes.

25|$|To better {{elucidate}} {{the findings of}} thought suppression, several studies have changed the target thought. Roemer and Borkovec found that participants who suppressed anxious or depressing thoughts showed a significant rebound effect. Furthermore, Wenzlaff, Wegner, & Roper demonstrated that anxious or depressed subjects {{were less likely to}} suppress negative, unwanted thoughts. Despite Rassin, Merkelbach and Muris reporting that this finding is moderately robust in the literature, some studies were unable to replicate results. However, this may be explained by <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> individual differences.|$|E

Continuing to base his arguments on <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> biological defence systems he says that it must operate in {{a whole range of}} specific circumstances, its agents must be able to go everywhere, the distribution of the agents must not upset the somatic status quo, and, in predisposed persons, the agents will attack the self.|$|E
25|$|The {{date and}} type of federal {{election}} {{is determined by the}} Prime Minister — after <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> constitutional requirements, legal requirements, as well as political considerations — who advises the Governor-General to set the process in motion by dissolving the lower or both houses and issuing writs for election. Some state elections are statutorily determined while others are determined by the respective state premiers. By federal law, state elections cannot take place on the same day as a federal election, which takes precedence if there is conflict. Federal elections have been held on a Saturday since the 1913 federal election. In Victoria elections have been held on a Saturday since the 1927 state election.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all other}} {{cultures}} of Mesoamerica, the Maya used a 260-day calendar, usually {{referred to as}} tzolkin. The length of this calendar coincides with the average duration of human gestation. Its basic purpose was (and still is) to provide guidance in life through <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the combined aspects of the 20 named days and 13 numbers, and to indicate the days on which sacrifice at specific 'number shrines' (recalling the number deities of Classic times) might lead to the desired results. The days were commonly deified and invoked as 'Lordships'. The crucial importance of divination {{is suggested by the}} fact that the general Yucatec word for 'priest' (ah k'in) referred more specifically to the counting of the days.|$|E
