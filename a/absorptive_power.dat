5000|$|Previous {{advocacy}} of an atmospheric hypothesis, — The general doctrine that the glacial periods {{may have been}} due to a change in the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide is not new. It was urged by Tyndall a half century ago and has been urged by others since. Recently it has been very effectively advocated by Dr. Arrhenius, who has taken a great step in advance of his predecessors in reducing his conclusions to definite quantitative terms deduced from observational data[...]. The functions of carbon dioxide. — By the investigations of Tyndall, Lecher and Pretner, Keller, Roentgen, and Arrhenius, {{it has been shown that}} the carbon dioxide and water vapor of the atmosphere have remarkable power of absorbing and temporarily retaining heat rays, while the oxygen, nitrogen, and argon of the atmosphere possess this power in a feeble degree only. It follows that the effect of the carbon dioxide and water vapor is to blanket the earth with a thermally absorbent envelope[...]. The general results assignable to a greatly increased or a greatly reduced quantity of atmospheric carbon dioxide and water may be summarized as follows:*a. An increase, by causing a larger absorption of the sun's radiant energy, raises the average temperature, while a reduction lowers it. The estimate of Dr. Arrhenius, based upon an elaborate mathematical discussion of the observations of Professor Langley, is that an increase of the carbon dioxide to the amount of two or three times the present content would elevate the average temperature 8° or 9° C. and would bring on a mild climate analogous to that which prevailed in the Middle Tertiary age. On the other hand, a reduction of the quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to an amount ranging from 55 to 62 per cent, of the present content, would reduce the average temperature 4 or 5 C, which would bring on a glaciation comparable to that of the Pleistocene period.*b. A second effect of increase and decrease in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide is the equalization, on the one hand, of surface temperatures, or their differentiation on the other. The temperature of the surface of the earth varies with latitude, altitude, the distribution of land and water, day and night, the seasons, and some other elements that may here be neglected. It is postulated that an increase in the thermal absorption of the atmosphere equalizes the temperature, and tends to eliminate the variations attendant on these contingencies. Conversely, a reduction of thermal atmospheric absorption tends to intensify all of these variations. A secondary effect of intensification of differences of temperature is an increase of atmospheric movements in the effort to restore equilibrium. Increased atmospheric movements, which are necessarily convectional, carry the warmer air to the surface of the atmosphere, and facilitate the discharge of the heat and thus intensify the primary effect[...].In the case of the outgoing rays, which are absorbed in much larger proportions than the incoming rays because they are more largely long-wave rays, the tables of Arrhenius show that the absorption is augmented by increase of carbonic acid in greater proportions in high latitudes than in low; for example, the increase of temperature for three times the present content of carbonic acid is 21.5 per cent, greater between 60° and 70° N. latitude than at the equator.It now becomes necessary to assign agencies capable of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a rate sufficiently above the normal rate of supply, at certain times, to produce glaciation; and on the other hand, capable of restoring it to the atmosphere at certain other times in sufficient amounts to produce mild climates.When the temperature is rising after a glacial episode, dissociation is promoted, and the ocean gives forth its carbon dioxide at an increased rate, and thereby assists in accelerating the amelioration of climate.A study of the life of the geological periods seems to indicate that there were very notable fluctuations in the total mass of living matter. To be sure there was a reciprocal relation between the life of the land and that of the sea, so that when the latter was extended upon the continental platforms and greatly augmented, the former was contracted, but notwithstanding this it seems clear that the sum of life activity fluctuated notably during the ages. It is believed that on the whole it was greatest at the periods of sea extension and mild climates, and least at the times of disruption and climatic intensification. This factor then acted antithetically to the carbonic acid freeing previously noted, and, so far as it went, tended to offset its effects.In periods of sea extension and of land reduction (base-level periods in particular), the habitat of shallow water lime-secreting life is concurrently extended, giving to the agencies that set carbon dioxide free accelerated activity, which is further aided by the consequent rising temperature which reduces the <b>absorptive</b> <b>power</b> of the ocean and increases dissociation. At the same time, the area of the land being diminished, a low consumption of carbon dioxide both in original decomposition of the silicates and in the solution of the limestones and dolomites obtains. Thus the reciprocating agencies again conjoin, but now to increase the carbon dioxide of the air. These are the great and essential factors. They are modified by several subordinate agencies already mentioned, but the quantitative effect of these is thought to be quite insufficient to prevent very notable fluctuations in the atmospheric constitution. As a result, it is postulated that geological history has been accentuated by an alternation of climatic episodes embracing, on the one hand, periods of mild, equable, moist climate nearly uniform for the whole globe; and on the other, periods when there were extremes of aridity and precipitation, and of heat and cold; these last denoted by deposits of salt and gypsum, of subaerial conglomerates, of red sandstones and shales, of arkose deposits, and occasionally by glaciation in low latitudes.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} to provide answers to the {{questions}} whether in Poland the advantages of employees' inventiveness are adequately exploited, what was the course of development of that activity in the post-war period and what is its position in the light of international comparisons. Between 1960 and 1986 inventive and innovative activity in Polish industry and economy was shaped unevenly. Its absolute level decreased twice. Low innovative <b>absorptive</b> <b>power</b> of industry and economy is proved by a small share of utilized proposals in the overall number of submitted proposals. In industry subject to implementation are mostly technical improvements bringing relatively poor economie effects. Besides, of little importance are innovations originating from the dissemination. The share of profits from the employees' inventiveness in the GNP is very small. It proves the insignificant role of that activity in increasing general efficiency of economy. In comparison with heavily industrialized capitalist countries the number of inventions submitted for patent application is in Poland several times, or — in the case of Japan — several dozen times smaller than abroad. The crisis in our inventive activity can also be illustrated by a decreasing share of Polish inventions in the overall number of inventions submitted for patent application in the CMEA countries. With respect to the number of inventions per 100. 000 professionally active people Poland occupies the last place among the CMEA European member- -States. The low level of inventive and innovative activity of our industry and economy proves the existence of vast potential developmental resources.

Comparison of the sodium and potassium {{bound by a}} resin, in equilibrium with presumably normal electrolytes as found in the terminal ileum, with the amounts of those ions in the feces, permits an over-all evaluation of two major factors operating in the gastrointestinal tract. These are a decreased sodium concentration in the terminal ileal contents when sodium intake is restricted and an <b>absorptive</b> <b>power</b> of the colon sufficient to detach sodium from the resin.

When subjects have been maintained on diets with unrestricted sodium intake, a carboxylic cation-exchange resin {{similar to the one}} used in this study has been found to retain in the feces 0. 5 to 2. 5 mEq. of sodium and 0. 4 to 2. 9 mEq. of po-tassium per gram of resin.

Anatomically, the epididymal duct of a camel consists of three parts head, body and tail. Histomorphologically, the epididymal duct is subdivided into initial, middle and terminal segments, of which the middle segment is further subdivided into proximal, intermediate and distal parts. There is a gradual decrease in the epithelial height of the epididymal duct from the initial to the terminal segments. This mechanically facilities passage of the sperms toward the terminal segment.

The spring months offer ideal circumstances for maximal reproductive activity in this species. The cellular components of the epididymal duct epithelium of the camel displays important morphological changes from season to another showing signs of increasing activity during spring in comparison to decreasing activity in other seasons.

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{performance}} of the reverberation chamber of the Integrated Acoustics Laboratory (IAL), equipped with experimental lightweight diffusers. Reverberation chambers are generally equipped with dense baffles, called diffusers, which are designed to reflect but not absorb sound, in an effort to create a sound field in the chamber with uniform energy density. Industry standards, such as ASTM C 423, ISO 354, and ISO 3741 for sound absorption and sound power testing in reverberation chambers, recommend the use of stationary and rotating diffusers, made of a material with high surface density and low absorption. Instead, lightweight fiberglass diffuser panels were installed in the IAL reverberation chamber because they are safer, less expensive and more flexible; their performance in the IAL chamber was evaluated. Preliminary testing of the IAL instrumentation chain and analysis techniques documented their acceptable performance. Qualification testing per the abovementioned standards proved that the IAL chamber, equipped with stationary lightweight diffusers, was fit for testing sound power but not sound absorption. However, when equipped with a combination of stationary and rotating lightweight diffusers, the chamber qualified for sound absorption tests. Optimization of absorption testing methodology showed that specimen area did not significantly affect the measured sound absorption coefficient unless the specimen was highly absorptive or the area was significantly less than the recommended 6. 69 m 2. Also, increasing the empty room absorption of the acoustically hard IAL chamber did not improve the reproducibility of absorption measurements. With regard to length of test, absorption tests in the IAL chamber should include the measurement of 225 decays to attain the representative repeatability values of ASTM C 423 for frequencies 315 Hz and higher. Comparative absorption testing showed that the chamber reproduced sound absorption results well; when round robin testing was replicated in the chamber, results were not statistically different from other laboratories. However, the reproducibility was worse for highly <b>absorptive</b> specimens. Sound <b>power</b> testing produced highly reproducible results, well within the limits of reproducibility of the standard. It can be concluded that a combination of stationary and rotating lightweight diffusers made the IAL chamber fit for sound absorption and sound power testing. M. S.
