500|$|Although Crane {{once wrote}} in a letter, [...] "You can tell nothing... unless you are in that {{condition}} yourself," [...] he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six {{years after the end}} of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: [...] "Of course, I have never been in a battle, but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".|$|E

Gittings read aloud letters from psychiatrists she had solicited who declined to appear for fear of professional ostracism. She described the event as [...] "transformative".|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Old Age", whose organ intro was {{featured}} on the band's cover of [...] "Credit In The Straight World" [...] from Live Through This, was revealed to have originally written by Kurt Cobain; Love stated in a 1997 interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] was [...] "partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit}} of and I said 'let me have the rest of it' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> this thing in it and tried to make it goth.

[...] It was later revealed that a version of the song was recorded by Nirvana during the Nevermind (1991) recording sessions, but Cobain threw the song out, later giving the melody to Love, who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote the lyrics. Two live cover versions were included on the album: [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] by Donovan, and [...] "He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)", which was written by Carole King and recorded by The Crystals in the 1960s.

500|$|Gaga's {{cover of}} [...] "White Christmas" [...] is a [...] "jazzy rendition" [...] and {{features}} an extra verse about a snowman. Halfway into the cover, before beginning the new verse, Gaga says, [...] "So {{as you can}} tell, I'm very outgoing {{and a little bit}} shy, but I've decided that this song is just too short. It's such a beautiful Christmas song but it's only one verse, so I added an extra one." [...] "You and I" [...] is devoid of the musical arrangements from the version in Born This Way, and features instrumentation from a piano and a trumpet, which is played halfway through the song. From time to time, Gaga shouts the word [...] "America" [...] while singing the song. Her acoustic version of [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] begins with a monologue, explaining her dedication of the song to her grandfather: [...] "It's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> this song about him, so here it is.

A recurring theme for the songs is Gaga stopping midway through singing to engage in conversation with the listeners.|$|E
500|$|The initial Columbia Records {{pressing}} of {{the single}} listed the title as [...] "Bolero" [...] and [...] "Jeff Beck" [...] as the composer.
