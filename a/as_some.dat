60|$|Rome {{was left}} to the enemy, except for the small {{garrison}} in the Capitol and for eighty of the senators, men too old to flee, who devoted themselves to the gods to save the rest, and, arraying themselves in their robes--some <b>as</b> former consuls, <b>some</b> <b>as</b> priests, <b>some</b> <b>as</b> generals--sat down with their ivory staves in their hands, in their chairs of state in the Forum, to await the enemy.|$|R

5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced.
