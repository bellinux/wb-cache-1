5|$|Most {{alkali metals}} have many {{different}} applications. One {{of the best-known}} applications of the pure elements {{is the use of}} rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks, of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> of the compounds of sodium is the sodium-vapour lamp, which emits light very efficiently. Table salt, or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also essential elements, having major biological roles as electrolytes, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> for {{polypropylene}} is as {{biaxially oriented}} polypropylene (BOPP). These BOPP sheets {{are used to}} make a wide variety of materials including clear bags. When polypropylene is biaxially oriented, it becomes crystal clear and serves as an excellent packaging material for artistic and retail products.|$|E

25|$|In color science, {{chromatic}} adaptation is {{the estimation of}} the representation of an object under a different light source from {{the one in which}} it was recorded. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> is to find a {{chromatic adaptation}} transform (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear neutral (color balance), while keeping other colors also looking realistic. For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between ICC profiles with different white points. Adobe Photoshop, for example, uses the Bradford CAT.|$|E
25|$|In {{homology}} modeling, <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> of fragment libraries is {{to model}} the loops of the structure. Typically, the alpha helices and beta sheets are threaded against a template structure, but the loops in between are not specified {{and need to be}} predicted. Finding the loop with the optimal configuration is NP-hard. To reduce the conformational space that needs to be explored, one can model the loop as a series of overlapping fragments. The space can then be sampled, or if the space is now small enough, exhaustively enumerated.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> of a {{torque motor}} {{would be the}} supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the {{characteristics}} of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension {{to be applied to}} the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.|$|E

40|$|Mobile robots that undergo {{significant}} field-testing {{often have}} to deal with hardware and software component failures. One approach to dealing with these failures is to have multiple redundant systems available for the robot to use. By creating <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>Applications</b> Programming Interface (API) for hardware components of similar but nonidentical functionality, we have applied this approach to the test-bed for the ERA Project (Extra-Vehicular Activity Robotic Assistant) at NASA/JSC (National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Johnson Space Center) ...|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> of a trie is storing a {{predictive}} text or autocomplete dictionary, such as {{found on a}} mobile telephone. Such applications {{take advantage of a}} trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries; however, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e., storage of information auxiliary to each word is not required), a minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) would use less space than a trie. This is because a DAFSA can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored.|$|E
25|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} is nucleus specific. Thus it {{can distinguish}} between hydrogen and deuterium. The amide protons in the protein exchange readily with the solvent, and, if the solvent contains a different isotope, typically deuterium, the reaction can be monitored by NMR spectroscopy. How rapidly a given amide exchanges reflects its solvent accessibility. Thus amide exchange rates can give information on which {{parts of the}} protein are buried, hydrogen bonded etc. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> is to compare the exchange of a free form versus a complex. The amides that become protected in the complex, {{are assumed to be}} in the interaction interface.|$|E
25|$|While many simpler {{operating}} systems support a {{limited range of}} options for accessing storage systems, {{operating systems}} like UNIX and Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS. An operating system such as UNIX supports {{a wide array of}} storage devices, regardless of their design or file systems, allowing them to be accessed through <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> programming interface (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them, through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers.|$|E

25|$|The oldest form of {{rechargeable}} battery is the lead–acid battery, which {{are widely used}} in automotive and boating applications. This technology contains liquid electrolyte in an unsealed container, requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the hydrogen gas it produces during overcharging. The lead–acid battery is relatively heavy {{for the amount of}} electrical energy it can supply. Its low manufacturing cost and its high surge current levels make it common where its capacity (over approximately 10 Ah) is more important than weight and handling issues. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> is the modern car battery, which can, in general, deliver a peak current of 450 amperes.|$|E
25|$|Boron {{has found}} many {{industrial}} applications in recent decades, and new ones {{are still being}} found. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> is in fiberglass. There has been rapid expansion {{in the market for}} borosilicate glass; most notable among its special qualities is a much greater resistance to thermal expansion than regular glass. Another commercially expanding use of boron and its derivatives is in ceramics. Several boron compounds, especially the oxides, have unique and valuable properties that have led to their substitution for other materials that are less useful. Boron may be found in pots, vases, plates, and ceramic pan-handles for its insulating properties. The compound borax is used in bleaches, for both clothes and teeth. The hardness of boron and some of its compounds give it a wide array of additional uses. A small part (5%) of the boron produced finds use in agriculture.|$|E
500|$|<b>A</b> <b>common</b> <b>application</b> of waffle-iron filters is {{to remove}} the {{harmonics}} of transmitters, such as high power radar, before applying to the antenna. [...] Legislation in most jurisdictions requires strict limits on out-of-band transmissions since these can cause serious interference with other stations. [...] This is an application that usually requires a very wide stopband, a characteristic of waffle-iron filters. [...] For instance, to remove all harmonics up to the fifth {{it is necessary for}} a low-pass filter to have a stopband greater than three times the passband.Levy, p.526Mendenhall, pp.805–806 ...|$|E
