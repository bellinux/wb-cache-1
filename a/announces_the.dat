5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser <b>announces</b> <b>the</b> coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E

Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story, while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going easy on Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man. The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides. Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him. When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs a blood test from him and his son, Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the night of the murder, but said he does not kill her. Later, a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated as a suspect, much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty. The detectives are interrupted by Wilson's attorney, who says the family will not submit to a blood and hair test without a court order.|$|E
