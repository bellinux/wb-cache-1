Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation.

This left students wondering why they were experiencing significant tuition increases when the Faculty had money for fancy lighting systems, pods, Belgian glass windows and famous architects.

All trust elements were influenced by e-service quality and recommendations from public administrations and interpersonal sources. The only exception was the nonsignificant relationship between interpersonal recommendations and trust in the e-service, which was moderated by citizens' time consciousness...|$|R

The land branches of Coast Guard Administration originate from the controversial Taiwan Garrison Command, which no longer exists, but the formations of land patrol forces were inherited from the ROC Army.

Later in 1957, the Cherthala, Ambalapuzha, Mavelikara, Karthikapalli, Chengannur and Thiruvalla taluks (formerly in Kollam district) were united to form the new district of Alappuzha.
