Hemolytic streptococci were recovered from 9 % of 799 lower respiratory cultures. All except one were non-group A, and other potential respiratory pathogens were also present in these specimens.

30|$|After an {{inspection}} of the final list of pairs, we noticed lexical variations that <b>were</b> <b>grouped.</b> For example, comparatives and superlatives, such as faster and fastest, <b>were</b> <b>grouped</b> together as fast.

This process implied assumptions in the audio content which may not hold true. For instance, the sound of one car is acoustically different {{from the sound of}} multiple cars. Nevertheless, grouping helped to reduce the impact of having multiple “repeated” pairs which could result in major acoustic ambiguities and low sound recognition performance.|$|R
