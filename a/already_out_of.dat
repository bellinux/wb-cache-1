5|$|King Joffrey confronts {{his mother}} with Stannis' letter. Immediately after, the City Watch murders all of King Robert's illegitimate {{children}} that they can find, {{though it is not}} clear who gave the order. Gendry, one of King Robert's bastards, is <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the city, but his former master smith reveals that he is in a caravan travelling to the Wall. Unknown to the Lannisters, Arya Stark is also travelling in that caravan.|$|E
5|$|Skopje {{has some}} remains of Prehistorical {{architecture}} {{which can be}} seen on the Tumba Madžari Neolithic site. On {{the other side of the}} city lie the remains of the ancient Scupi, with ruins of a theatre, thermae and a basilica. The Skopje Aqueduct, located between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown. It seems to have been built by the Byzantines or the Turks, but it was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use in the 16th century. It consists of 50 arches, worked in cloisonné masonry.|$|E
5|$|They were {{determined}} to thwart any similar tendencies in his son, and when the Great Fire threatened the City, they refused the offers that Charles made of soldiers and other resources. Even in such an emergency, {{the idea of having}} the unpopular Royal troops ordered into the City was political dynamite. By the time that Charles took over command from the ineffectual Lord Mayor, the fire was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control.|$|E

5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|In France, the {{government}} press misrepresented the battle. Le Moniteur Universel published a report purportedly written by Captain Raymond Cocault of the corvette Diligente. The report began by inaccurately {{claiming that the}} British squadron consisted of nine ships of the line. The report concluded with the information that two British ships had been destroyed on the San Domingo coast alongside three French and that two others had been dismasted and were badly damaged. The official French report, written by Leissègues but not published in France, contradicted this version of events. Leissègues stated that Cocault, with the other smaller warships, had made all sail to the westwards {{at the start of}} the engagement and that by the time the flagship drove ashore, Diligente was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight. Leissègues remained on Santo Domingo for some time, but had returned to Europe by the time the colony fell to a joint English and Spanish force in July 1809. He later received a regional command in the Ionian Sea and took part in the Adriatic campaign.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{when the}} Act became law on 23 December 1920 it was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> touch with realities in Ireland. The long-standing demand for home rule had been {{replaced}} among Nationalists by a demand for complete independence. The Republic's army was waging the Irish War of Independence against British rule, which had reached a nadir in late 1920.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic {{and film}} {{capacitors}} are <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies {{up to several}} 100nbsp&MHz. They also have significantly lower parasitic inductance, making them suitable for higher frequency applications, due to their construction with end-surface contacting of the electrodes. To increase the range of frequencies, often an electrolytic capacitor {{is connected in parallel}} with a ceramic or film capacitor.|$|E
25|$|The {{devaluation}} of the currency had an immediate effect. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets. The deficit spending proved to be most profound {{and went into the}} purchase of munitions for the armed forces. By 1933, Japan was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the depression. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions.|$|E

25|$|The {{successful}} and severely damaging American Linebacker efforts however were not sustained. By {{the time of}} the aerial offensives (a few weeks each), most US forces (over 500,000 troops) were <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Vietnam theater. Over 150,000 Northern soldiers however remained in the South after the 1972 Offensive, expanding the conquered zone, building up logistics capacity (including the construction and extension of pipelines) and biding their time, until the final Ho Chi Minh Campaign in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Ted was in {{his late}} twenties and thirties during the decade the Midwest Poetry Renaissance occurred. He {{published}} his first book through the University of Nebraska Press at age 30, titled “.” Ted’s first full-length book was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print by the early 1970s, at which time he became more of a small press poet like many other poets in the Midwest. Ted continued to receive publication of individual poems within anthologies, and published several more books on small presses. He also began to edit The New Salt Creek Reader, which had six anthologies by 1974.|$|E
25|$|En route home, {{with the}} {{decryption}} of the Japanese plan to invade Midway, Lent was reassigned {{to the second}} of three submarine patrol lines defending the island. His was one of eighteen boats around the island, which (except for Nautilus) accomplished nothing of consequence during the battle. Operating south of Nautilus, Lent picked up an 06.15 contact report of a force <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach. At 08.37, he surfaced and headed for Midway in hope of intercepting Japanese in retreat, but was forced to dive by American aircraft (still likely to attack, as Grayling learned), and quickly surfaced again to continue.|$|E

25|$|The Ilmatars {{original}} {{interior layout}} was {{a compromise between}} the traditional two-class passenger liner and the new ro-ro car/passenger ferry. In order to transport cars she was fitted with a gate on the port side, from where cars were driven inside the ship and then lifted mechanically to the actual car deck. This arrangement was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> date when the ship was delivered, as Finland SS Co.'s subsidiary Siljavarustamo had taken the delivery of the first ro-ro ferry with bow and rear gates on the North Baltic already in 1961. An extra cardeck was added on the ship coinciding with the 1973 lengthening, but that too was served by the side gate and a lift.|$|E
25|$|Coburn {{endorsed}} conservative {{activist and}} former diplomat Alan Keyes in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries. Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve {{no more than}} three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney Brad Carson defeated a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote Breach of Trust, with ghostwriter John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> office {{at the time of the}} book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker Dennis Hastert) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.|$|E
500|$|Pepys found Bloodworth {{trying to}} {{co-ordinate}} the fire-fighting efforts and near to collapse, [...] "like a fainting woman", crying out plaintively {{in response to}} the King's message that he was pulling down houses. [...] "But the fire overtakes us faster then we can do it." [...] Holding on to his civic dignity, he refused James's offer of soldiers and then went home to bed. King Charles II sailed down from Whitehall in the Royal barge to inspect the scene. He found that houses were still not being pulled down, in spite of Bloodworth's assurances to Pepys, and daringly overrode the authority of Bloodworth to order wholesale demolitions west of the fire zone. The delay rendered these measures largely futile, as the fire was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control.|$|E

500|$|USS Texas was a second-class {{battleship}} {{built by}} the United States in the early 1890s, the first American battleship commissioned and the first ship {{named in honor of}} the state of Texas to be {{built by the}} United States. Built in reaction to the acquisition of modern armored warships by several South American countries, Texas was meant to incorporate the latest developments in naval tactics and design. This includes the mounting of her main armament en echelon to allow maximum end-on fire and a heavily-armored redoubt amidships to ensure defensive strength. However, due to the state of U.S. industry at the time, Texas's building time was lengthy, and {{by the time she was}} commissioned, she was <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> date. Nevertheless, she and her near-sister [...] were considered advancements in American naval design.|$|E
500|$|Barrett missed {{almost half}} of the 2003 on account of three injuries. He {{suffered}} the first during a game against the Colorado Rockies, during which one of Steve Reed's pitches accidentally hit and bruised Barrett's index finger. Barrett was able to continue playing, but claimed the injury had hindered his playing performance. He eventually managed to overcome the injury in July. He recorded a batting average of [...]333 and fifteen RBI. During this period, Barrett began to complain about tightness in his right hip flexor. This ailment took its toll on Barrett during a game against the Atlanta Braves, when he strained the muscles while taking a checked swing. The Expos sent Barrett on a rehabilitation assignment to play with the Edmonton Trappers, a AAA team from the Pacific Coast League. He only managed to play two games with team before fracturing his index finger on August 9. Barrett returned to the major leagues on September 12, although the Expos were <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> playoff contention.|$|E
500|$|The site of Köllnischer Park {{was just}} outside Cölln in the Middle Ages. Until the mid-17th century, it was undeveloped low-lying, swampy land prone to {{flooding}} by the Spree. Following the decision by Frederick William, the 'Great Elector' to encircle Berlin with fortifications, this became the location of Bastion VII, which was known {{at the time as}} [...] "the bulwerk in the morass'. The work required the creation of large embankments and lasted until 1683; the swampland around the bastion was not fully drained until 1687. After such lengthy construction, the works were <b>already</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> date militarily, and after 1700 served only to control the comings and goings of visitors and residents, prevent desertion, and enable the collection of tolls on those entering the city. By 1700, Mulberry trees had been planted on the walls, but only 'persons of rank' were permitted to promenade along them. After Berlin had grown considerably and the Customs Wall had been built around it, King Frederick William I (16881740) ordered the defensive walls to be demolished. Civilian buildings had already grown up on the bastions; a windmill and a house for the miller were built on Bastion VII, and these caused the eastern portion to be left standing longer than other parts of the fortifications. Some of the rubble from the demolished fortifications was used to build up Wilhelmstraße; the rest was thrown into the defensive ditch outside the walls.|$|E
