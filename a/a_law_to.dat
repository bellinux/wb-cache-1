5|$|Congress passed <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> build a {{military}} wagon road on March 3, 1863 from Fort Wilkins to Houghton and then {{south to the}} state line. The road was laid out in 1864 following what is today M-26 between Copper Harbor and Phoenix, US41 south to Houghton, M-26 south to Winona and Federal Forest Highway 16 (FFH-16) to the state line. Wisconsin authorities ran the road along what is now Highway 29 between Green Bay and Shawano and Highway 55 north to the state line. Military Road would connect Fort Wilkins with Fort Howard near Green Bay.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 the Escheat Movement was born. Under {{the scheme}} {{proposed}} by the movement, land would be forfeited to the Crown should proprietors default on their quitrents, and tenants would be given the option of either purchasing part of the forfeited land or leasing it from the Crown. Members of the movement won a large majority in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island in 1802, and in 1803 <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> implement escheat {{was passed by the}} legislature. However, the government of the United Kingdom would not abandon its principle of supporting property rights and refused to grant the bill Royal Assent.|$|E

5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{independence}} in 1960, the Trust Territory of Somalia established a national army {{to defend the}} nascent Somali Republic's borders. <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> that effect was passed on 6 April 1960. Thus the Somali Police Force's Mobile Group (Darawishta Poliska or Darawishta) was formed. 12 April 1960 has since been marked as Armed Forces Day. British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, and the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later. On 1 July 1960, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic.|$|E
5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|Caesar became consul in 59 BC. His colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was {{an extreme}} aristocrat. Caesar {{submitted}} {{the laws that}} he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated {{the election of the}} former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.|$|E

5|$|Jatropha is {{native to}} Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha. The Yucat√°n Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn producing region, also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E
5|$|Mayor West passes <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> legalize the drug, and {{everyone}} starts smoking it; {{the town has}} improved as a result, with milestones such as an increase in productivity {{and a decrease in}} crime. However, Lois's father, Carter, begins to lose money in the timber industry since hemp is being used to manufacture many products, particularly paper, and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti-marijuana campaign. Lois, however, points out that their methods are uninspired, explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis. Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love. Brian resists at first, but Stewie suggests he at least perform a number about the health risks of cannabis, since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own. Brian reluctantly complies, and the drug becomes illegal once more.|$|E
5|$|The {{usage of}} the metric system varies around the world. According to the US Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook (2007), the International System of Units has been adopted as the {{official}} system of weights and measures by all {{nations in the world}} except for Myanmar (Burma), Liberia and the United States, while the NIST has identified the United States as the only industrialised country where the metric system is not the predominant system of units. However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{following}} an appeal for help by Norodom Sihanouk, Angkor Wat was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger (later removed in 2004) and World Heritage Site {{together with an}} appeal by UNESCO {{to the international community}} to save Angkor. Zoning of the area was set up to protect the Angkor site in 1994, APSARA was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. A number of countries such as France, Japan and China are currently involved in various Angkor Wat conservation projects. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. World Monuments Fund began conservation work on the Churning of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition. The project restored the traditional Khmer roofing system and removed cement used in earlier restoration attempts that had resulted in salts entering the structure behind the bas-relief, discoloring and damaging the sculpted surfaces. The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials {{on the roof of the}} gallery in 2013.|$|E
