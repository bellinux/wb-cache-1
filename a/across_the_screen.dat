5|$|Although Murphy was {{initially}} reluctant {{to appear as}} himself in To Hell and Back, {{the film version of}} his book, he eventually agreed to do so. Terry Murphy portrayed his brother Joseph Preston Murphy at age four. The film was directed by Jesse Hibbs with an on-screen introduction by General Walter Bedell Smith. Susan Kohner, daughter of Murphy's agent Paul Kohner, made her acting debut in the film. The finale shows Murphy being awarded the Medal of Honor while images of his unit's casualties pass <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> It became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display â€“ during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|E

40|$|Mesh screens {{composed}} of nylon fibers leave minimal residual ash and produce no significant spectral interference when ashed for spectrometric examination. These characteristics make nylon mesh screens attractive {{as a collection}} substrate for nanoparticles. A theoretical single-fiber efficiency expression developed for wire-mesh screens was evaluated for estimating the collection efficiency of submicrometer particles for nylon mesh <b>screens.</b> Pressure drop <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>the</b> effect of particle morphology (spherical and highly fractal) on collection efficiency and single-fiber efficiency were evaluated experimentally for three pore sizes (60, 100 and 180) at three flow rates (2. 5, 4 and 6 Lpm). <b>The</b> pressure drop <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> was found to increase linearly with superficial velocity.

5|$|Blek is a 2013 puzzle {{video game}} for iOS and Android by Kunabi Brother, {{a team of}} {{brothers}} Denis and Davor Mikan. The player draws a snakelike black line that recurs in pattern and velocity <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to remove colored dots and avoid black dots. It is minimalist in design, features excerpts of Erin Gee, and takes inspiration from Golan Levin, the Bauhaus, and Japanese calligraphy. The brothers designed the game as a touchscreen adaptation to classic game Snake and worked on the game for over six months. It was released in December 2013 for iPad, and was later released for other iOS devices and Android.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

5|$|MacPaint uses two offscreen memory buffers {{to avoid}} flicker when {{dragging}} shapes or images <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> One of these buffers contained the existing pixels of a document, {{and the other}} contained the pixels of its previous state. The second buffer {{was used as the}} basis of the software's undo feature. In April 1983, the software's name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint. The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. This was different from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed the users to move windows and resize them.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row at the top of the screen whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E

50|$|Tawaraya's {{new style}} of {{painting}} was seen mainly {{in his paintings}} on screens; examples of his tarashikomi works are Flowers and Grasses of the Four Seasons and Lotus and Waterfowl. His handscroll entitled Kitano Tenjin engi {{is known for its}} tarashikomi rendering of clouds and the puffs surrounding them.Tawaraya's school (1624-1644) painted many folded screens, which were functional as well as beautiful; they could be set up and put away easily, allowing people to enjoy them seasonally, separately or for a special occasion. Themes were common, inspired by tales or poems of other artists. <b>The</b> <b>screens</b> were not meant to remain in a corner, like wall art in modern Western houses. Sometimes a single object was repeated on <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> causing <b>the</b> images to apparently move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens.</b> <b>The</b> <b>screens</b> were arranged to fold in on each other; the motion of folding enhanced the movement of the panels, often giving images more dimension.|$|R
2500|$|For the 2008 season, a new {{graphics}} {{scheme was}} introduced {{that was built}} around a new display known as the [...] "dashboard"; the scoreboard, which now {{took the form of}} a horizontal bar, was mounted in a dedicated area spanning <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> All lower-third graphics were also displayed within the dashboard, replacing the scorebar when in use.|$|R
5|$|Shadowrun is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (RPG) that combines the statistical factor {{of the original}} tabletop game (with minor changes) with real-time gameplay. The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game's isometrically displayed world. A cursor system allows the player to scroll a pointer <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways, examining and picking up objects, engaging in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally {{across the bottom of}} the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliensâ€”some versions feature different numbersâ€”that move horizontally back and forth <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> as they advance toward {{the bottom of the screen}}. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{himself had}} {{high hopes for}} his new project. He lacked the {{technical}} skills to program it alone, so instead came up with concepts and consulted technicians {{to see if they}} were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different manners and react in various ways. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex, though he had some difficult suggestions himself, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> (eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept would appear in the aforementioned Popeye arcade game). Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} {{started in}} the 1950s with local television stations around the United States airing low-budget genre films as late-night programming, often with a host delivering sardonic asides. As a cinematic phenomenon, <b>the</b> midnight <b>screening</b> of offbeat movies {{began in the early}} 1970s in a few urban centers, particularly New York City, eventually spreading <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country. <b>The</b> <b>screening</b> of nonmainstream pictures at midnight was aimed at building a cult film audience, encouraging repeat viewing and social interaction in what was originally a countercultural setting.|$|R
5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E
5|$|The XrossMediaBar, {{originally}} {{used on the}} PSX, is a graphical {{user interface}} currently used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, {{as well as a}} variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by the up and down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can fit on the screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved {{version of that}} from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E

5|$|The protagonist wields four {{different}} styles of weapons throughout the game: sword, spear, axe, and bazooka. Almost all swords, axes, and spears have four versions, and repeated use of them can increase their skill levels {{to a maximum of}} three, unlocking a new charged attack with each level. The range and power of each type of weapon increased the more it is used; for instance, spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> while the swords and axes can cut swathes of destruction around the boy's vicinity. With the exception of the Bone Crusher, all swords, axes, and spears can cut through vegetation; some weapons are required to break rocks and other barriers.|$|E
