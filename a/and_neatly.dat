5|$|The {{song thrush}} (as {{represented}} by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5centimetres (8 to 9.25in) in length and weighs 50–107grammes (1.8 to 3.8oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks {{on the back and}} wing coverts.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly <b>and</b> <b>neatly,</b> carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E

GC troopers continued to wear aluminium badges of rank, which were worn on the right sleeve, 11.5 centimetres below the right shoulder strap. Constables wore aluminium bars at the outer edges of the shoulder straps.

25|$|Historically, many {{cultures}} in continental Africa developed hairstyles that defined status, or identity, {{in regards to}} age, ethnicity, wealth, social rank, marital status, religion, fertility, adulthood, and death. Hair was carefully groomed by those who understood the aesthetic standard, as the social implications of hair grooming were {{a significant part of}} community life. Dense, thick, clean, <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> groomed hair was something highly admired and sought after. Hair groomers possessed unique styling skills, allowing them to create a variety of designs that met the local cultural standards. Hair was usually dressed according to local culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the backpack led to new searches along the Culubre. Kremers' jeans shorts, zipped <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> folded, were found {{on top of a}} rock on the opposite bank of the tributary from where Froon's backpack had been discovered, and a few kilometers away. Two months later, closer to where the backpack was discovered, a pelvis and a boot with a foot inside were found. Soon at least 33 widely scattered bones were discovered along the same river bank; DNA testing confirmed they belonged to Froon and Kremers. Froon's bones still had some skin attached to them but Kremers's bones appeared to have been bleached.|$|E
25|$|On 28 July 1847, Whyte {{recorded}} {{the neglect of}} his fellow passengers, who 'within reach of help' 'were to be left enveloped in reeking pestilence, the sick without medicine, medical skill, nourishment, or {{so much as a}} drop of pure water'. However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the Ajax described the holds of other vessels where they had been 'up to their ankles in filth. The wretched emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> clad, clean and happy'. The Times also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans.|$|E
50|$|Hermann Dyck (10 April 1812 - 25 March 1874), a Bavarian painter, born at Würzburg in 1812, studied {{architectural}} and genre {{painting at}} Munich.

25|$|The {{month of}} May began with United playing their 5th game in 18 days {{and with a}} back line that had one healthy centerback, Brandon McDonald. The other centerbacks, Emiliano Dudar, Dejan Jakovic and Ethan White, were all out due to injuries. Playing the hottest team in the league, the San Jose Earthquakes, the defenseless United {{surrendered}} 5 goals in a 5-3 defeat. The game started well for United with a goal by Dwayne De Rosario in the eighth minute. However, the disorganized United defense gave up three goals in a flurry before halftime, on goals by Chris Wondolowski, Steven Lenhart and Justin Morrow. United drew close, when Daniel Woolard scored a diving header in the 64th minute. San Jose soon pulled away as Wondowlowski and Lenhart each scored their second goal of the game. Although the game was out of reach, United fans were buoyed with a late goal by substitute Hamdi Salihi, in the 88th minute. Salihi, United's much-hyped offseason signing, scored {{for the first time}} in league play, when he got on the end of a long pass by De Rosario, <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> chipped it over the diving San Jose goalie, Jon Busch.|$|E
25|$|On 2 January, the Battle of the Assunpink Creek {{began in}} earnest. Soon after Cornwallis' column resumed its advance, an American rifleman shot a British cavalryman dead and near Lawrenceville (then called Maidenhead), a mounted Hessian jäger {{suffered}} the same fate. The Americans deployed in woods behind Little Shabbakunk Creek, {{then known as}} Five Mile Run. At this point Fermoy, an alcoholic, galloped away to Trenton, leaving his troops to fend for themselves. Hand assumed command of the force <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> ambushed the British vanguard, forcing Cornwallis to deploy his column and pound the woods with his guns. An attempt to turn Hand's right flank was blocked when a large force of Americans appeared along Assunpink Creek to the east. When the British advanced they found that Hand's men slipped back to another position at Stockton Hollow. Hand's riflemen took position on the left, Scott's men on the right, and Forrest's guns in the center. The position of the German Battalion was not given. Just before 5:00 PM, heavy pressure forced Hand to order a retreat. As the Americans fell back through Trenton to the lower fords and the bridge across Assunpink Creek, the retreat became disorderly. The bulk of the troops successfully withdrew behind the creek where they subsequently repelled several British and Hessian attacks with heavy losses.|$|E

500|$|Over time, Roman {{architecture}} {{was modified}} as their urban requirements changed, {{and the civil}} engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capital city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> maintained.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the relative disorder of English eighteenth century cookery books such as Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife (1727) or Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper (1769), Mrs Rundell's text is strictly ordered <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> subdivided. Where those books consist almost wholly of recipes, Mrs Rundell begins by explaining techniques of economy ("A minute account of the annual income and the times of payment {{should be kept in}} writing"), how to carve, how to stew, how to season, to [...] "Look clean, be careful and nice in work, so that those who have to eat might look on", how to choose and use steam-kettles and the bain-marie, the meanings of foreign terms like pot-au-feu ("truly the foundation of all good cookery"), all the joints of meat, the [...] "basis of all well-made soups", so it is page 65 before actual recipes begin.|$|E
500|$|After Reading went {{four games}} without a win {{starting}} on 24 January 1976, a late goal from Friday ended this run on 25 February, {{in a home}} match against Hartlepool United; twelve minutes from time, he collected a pass from Stewart Henderson <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> placed the ball past the goalkeeper {{from the edge of}} the penalty area. [...] "One is increasingly under the impression", the Evening Post reported, [...] "that if Friday was out for some time through injury the Reading team would fall to pieces". Led by the free-scoring Friday, the side continued its push for promotion; fourth or higher would be enough to go up. A vital fixture on 31 March 1976 pitted fourth-placed Reading at home against Tranmere Rovers, who occupied third spot; internationally experienced referee Clive Thomas took charge of the game. Friday, who had already scored 18 goals that season, rose to the occasion with an effort that has been described by many sources as one of the greatest ever scored.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "cookiecutter shark" [...] {{refers to}} its feeding habit of gouging round plugs, as if cut {{out with a}} cookie cutter, out of larger animals. Marks made by cookiecutter sharks have been found {{on a wide variety}} of marine mammals and fishes, as well as on submarines, undersea cables, and even human bodies. It also consumes whole smaller prey such as squid. Cookiecutter sharks have adaptations for {{hovering}} in the water column and likely rely on stealth and subterfuge to capture more active prey. Its dark collar seems to mimic the silhouette of a small fish, while the rest of its body blends into the downwelling light via its ventral photophores. When a would-be predator approaches the lure, the shark attaches itself using its suctorial lips and specialized pharynx <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> excises a chunk of flesh using its bandsaw-like set of lower teeth. This species has been known to travel in schools.|$|E
500|$|Trees do {{not usually}} grow {{continuously}} {{throughout the year}} but mostly have spurts of active expansion followed by periods of rest. This pattern of growth is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive period, trees form buds to protect the meristem, the zone of active growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced {{at the tip of}} a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and enclose the growing point in a waterproof sheath. Inside this bud there is a rudimentary stalk <b>and</b> <b>neatly</b> folded miniature leaves, ready to expand when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the eucalyptus, have [...] "naked buds" [...] with no protective scales and some conifers, such as the Lawson's cypress, have no buds but instead have little pockets of meristem concealed among the scale-like leaves.|$|E
