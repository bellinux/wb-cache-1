40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis on the total load of cadmium, zinc and lead to agricultural soils during the period 1955 - 1994. Total heavy metal load will serve as input for the soil modeling part of the wider IIASA study on "Regional Material Balance Approaches to Long Term Environmental Planning. " The project area embraces the northwestern part of the Czech Republic (Bohemia and Morawia), southwestern Poland (Upper and Lower Silesia), and the south of the former G. D. R. (Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Brandenburg, Thueringen). Agricultural soils receive heavy metal via atmospheric deposition and via certain agricultural practices, the most important ones are: P-fertilizer application and manuring. Atmospheric deposition loads were derived from computations within the atmospheric modeling part of the IIASA IND Project. On the basis of a literature search focusing on the countries of the project area heavy metal concentration factors for P-fertilizer and manure were established. The fertilizer and manure application during the study period was derived from diverse statistical sources. The analysis shows the importance of regional differences and of the changes in time. This refers to both, the total load of heavy metals to the soils and the share of agricultural or <b>atmospheric</b> <b>load</b> in total load. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>load</b> is highest in the 60 s or 70 s and then shows a downward trend. The highest P-fertilizer and manure application rates are in the 70 s or 80 s (and consequently the heavy metal load due to these practices is high).

40|$|Joint {{implementation}} is a {{hotly debated}} {{issue in the}} context of the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). The main argument for joint implementation is that, since it does not matter where greenhouse gas emissions are reduced (as these gases mix uniformly in the atmosphere), it is better to do it where abatement is cheapest. Many objections to joint implementation exist. Here we add one that argues against the uniform mixing property. Although in the long run the global climate is insensitive to the place where abatement is undertaken, in the short run the regional climate changes with the induced changes in the albedo. Indeed, reduction of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>load</b> of sulphate aerosols and albedo changes associated with land cover change may well lead to accelerated warming in the region of abatement. This is undesirable as the rate of climatic change is a major determinant of the damage done. Hence, the discussion on joint implementation is further complicated...|$|E

A set of MATLAB-callable routines that implement the multiresolution scheme have been made available via anonymous FTP. The oceanographic signal is here modeled as a stationary 1 /k � process, where k is the horizontal wavenumber.

We analyzed the sensitivity of model-predicted global-scale organic aerosols (OA) to parameters that control primary emissions, photochemical aging, and the scavenging efficiency of organic vapors.

Model results are sensitive to the emission rates of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) and POA. Assuming enhanced reactivity of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and IVOCs with OH substantially improved the model performance for SOA. The use of a hybrid approach for the parameterization of the aging of IVOCs had a small effect on predicted SOA levels.
