Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children, with two exceptions: Good Omens (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which {{was nominated for}} both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and Nation (2008), <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> young adults.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Myron {{published}} , {{written with}} the help of Bret Witter, which reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list of nonfiction books. The book told the story of Dewey's life at the library, interspersed with the difficulties faced by the town and Myron in her personal life, and how Dewey helped ease those burdens. Based on their first book, Myron and Witter published two children's books: Dewey: There's a Cat in the Library!, a picture book for young children and Dewey: The Library Cat, <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> middle-grade readers. Later in 2008, Meryl Streep was cast to star in a film based on the book. By May 2012, a final script had not been approved, and the film option was due to expire in June 2012. Myron and Witter published a sequel, Dewey's Nine Lives, in 2010, detailing previously unreleased stories about Dewey, as well as tales Myron heard about other cats after Dewey's death. That same year, Myron and Witter published a children's book, Dewey's Christmas at the Library, intended for 3–6 year-olds.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} the {{succession}} marked Louis' reign. Elizabeth was long considered barren, and a succession crisis was expected after the childless king's death. Her brother-in-law Stephen was heir presumptive {{until his death in}} 1354, when his son John replaced him. However, John also died in 1360. A daughter was born to the King and Queen in 1365, but the child died the next year. For a few years, John's sister, Elizabeth, was treated as heir presumptive and a suitable marriage for her was being negotiated. Things suddenly took a different course after Elizabeth had three daughters in quick succession; Catherine was born in July 1370, Mary in 1371, and Hedwig in 1373 or 1374. Elizabeth is known to have written <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> the education of her daughters, a copy of which was sent to France in 1374. However, all copies have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Woodenlegs, {{unsure what}} to do with the material, passed them to Weist, who at the time was writing a Cheyenne history for use in {{reservation}} schools. The negatives were contained in a battered shoebox, and some were in poor condition. Weist involved photographer Jerry Mader to work on their restoration. Weist, Mader, and Woodenlegs began a project in the 1960s to make the images available in reservation schools. Without funds for publication, however, the project was abandoned in 1981 on the death of Woodenlegs. Weist died in 1994. The negatives were passed to anthropologist Margot Liberty in 1998 by a remaining project member, Elizabeth Wilson Clark, shortly before her death. Liberty had been a teacher at the Northern Cheyenne reservation in the 1950s, and she agreed to edit the material into <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> the University of Oklahoma Press. Finally, 142 of the images were published in 2006 as A Northern Cheyenne Album. The book includes a commentary from Woodenlegs recorded years before.|$|E
