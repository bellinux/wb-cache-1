60|$|Perhaps few {{narratives}} in History or Mythology {{are more}} significant than that Moslem one, of Moses and the Dwellers by the Dead Sea. A tribe of men dwelt {{on the shores of}} that same Asphaltic Lake; and having forgotten, as we are all too prone to do, the inner facts of Nature, and taken up with the falsities and outer semblances of it, were fallen into sad conditions,--verging indeed towards a certain far deeper Lake. Whereupon it pleased kind Heaven to send them the Prophet Moses, with an instructive word of warning, out of which might have sprung 'remedial measures' not a few. But no: the men of the Dead Sea discovered, as the valet-species always does in heroes or prophets, no comeliness in Moses; listened with real tedium to Moses, with light grinning, or with splenetic sniffs and sneers, affecting even to yawn; and signified, in short, that they found him a humbug, and even a bore. Such was the candid theory these men of the <b>Asphalt</b> <b>Lake</b> formed to themselves of Moses, That probably he was a humbug, that certainly he was a bore.|$|E

50|$|New sub-types of -philes are {{identified}} frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life {{lives in the}} liquid <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake,</b> Pitch Lake. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> in populations ranging between 106 to 107 cells/gram. Likewise, until recently boron tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria. With the recent isolation of Bacillus boroniphilus, borophiles came into discussion. Studying these borophiles may help illuminate the mechanisms of both boron toxicity and boron deficiency.|$|E

50|$|Bitumen {{was used}} by ancient Egyptians to embalm mummies. The Persian word for asphalt is moom, which {{is related to the}} English word mummy. The Egyptians' primary source of bitumen was the Dead Sea, which the Romans knew as Palus Asphaltites (<b>Asphalt</b> <b>Lake).</b>|$|E

50|$|The Asphalt {{industry}} in Trinidad {{is located at}} the Pitch Lake at the town of La Brea in southwestern Trinidad and it has gained a reputation for itself as the world's largest deposit.

50|$|A tar pit, or more {{accurately}} an asphalt pit or <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake,</b> {{is the result}} of a type of petroleum seep where subterranean bitumen leaks to the surface, creating a large area of natural asphalt. This happens because, after the material reaches the surface, its lighter components vaporize, leaving only the thick asphalt.|$|E
50|$|The Carpinteria Tar Pits {{are one of}} {{the five}} natural <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> areas in the world, the others being Tierra de Brea in Trinidad and Tobago, Lake Guanoco in Venezuela and the La Brea Tar Pits (Los Angeles) and McKittrick Tar Pits (McKittrick) both also located in the US state of California.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Asphalt</b> <b>lakes</b> are {{the largest}} {{examples}} of natural [...] oil seeps. They occur when oil migrating toward the surface {{as a result of}} buoyancy (oil is lighter than ground water) actually reaches the surface, instead of being trapped in deeper stratigraphic layers. The reason the petroleum becomes asphaltic, or tarry, is the action of oil-metabolizing bacteria. This process of biodegradation occurs close to the earth's surface, where temperatures are low enough for the bacteria to thrive, and where the oil is surrounded by fresh meteoric water.|$|R
50|$|The Limmer & Trinidad <b>Lake</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Company {{became the}} first {{contractor}} to use <b>asphalt</b> from the <b>Lake</b> for road surfacing. In the early 1970s the UK market switched to Coal tar, asphalt became a much less popular product and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago took ownership of the asphalt extraction business in 1978.|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} The Pitch Lake {{is related to}} deep faults in {{connection}} with subduction under the Caribbean Plate related to Barbados Arc. The lake has not been studied extensively, but {{it is believed that}} the lake is at the intersection of two faults, which allows oil from a deep deposit to be forced up. The lighter elements in the oil evaporate under the hot tropical sun, leaving behind the heavier asphalt. Bacterial action on the asphalt at low pressures creates petroleum in asphalt. The researchers indicated that extremophiles inhabited the <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> in populations ranging between 106 to 107 cells/gram. The Pitch Lake is one of several natural asphalt lakes in the world. The La Brea Tar Pits (Los Angeles), McKittrick Tar Pits (McKittrick) and Carpinteria Tar Pits (Carpinteria) are all in the U.S. state of California. Lake Guanoco is in the Republic of Venezuela.|$|E
5000|$|Humboldt {{visited the}} mission at Caripe and {{explored}} the Guácharo cavern, {{where he found}} the oilbird, which he was to make known to science as Steatornis caripensis. Also described the Guanoco <b>asphalt</b> <b>lake</b> as [...] "The spring of the good priest" [...] ("Quelle des guten Priesters"). Returning to Cumaná, Humboldt observed, {{on the night of}} 11-12 November, a remarkable meteor shower (the Leonids). He proceeded with Bonpland to Caracas where he climbed the Avila mount with the young poet Andrés Bello, the former tutor of Simón Bolívar, who later became the leader of independence in northern South America. Humboldt met the Venezuelan Bolívar himself in 1804 in Paris and spent time with him in Rome. The documentary record does not support the supposition that Humboldt inspired Bolívar to participate in the struggle for independence, but it does indicate Bolívar's admiration for Humboldt's production of new knowledge on Spanish America.|$|E

5000|$|Raleigh {{had planned}} to descend on the Spanish colony of Trinidad - in {{particular}} the principal settlement of San José de Oruña, founded by Berrio in 1592. First of all he landed and explored {{the south of the}} island Raleigh found that the Indians were cultivating good quality tobacco and sugar cane. While sailing across the Gulf of Paria he reputedly smelled tar, and put into shore at Terra de Brea. The Caribs led Raleigh to a pitch lake (the largest of the world's three natural <b>asphalt</b> <b>lakes)</b> and he realized that the substance was ideal for caulking his ships. He took several barrels with him, and has since been credited with [...] "discovering" [...] the lake. Raleigh's principal objective was to capture the Spanish governor who was also looking for the same fabled city, question him and gain as much information before he continued his expedition.|$|R
