40|$|Service-providers collect {{more and}} more privacy-sensitive {{information}}, {{even though it is}} hard to protect this information against hackers, abuse of weak privacy policies, negligence, and malicious database administrators. In this thesis, we take the position that endless retention of privacy-sensitive information will inevitably lead to unauthorized data disclosure. Limiting the retention of privacy-sensitive information limits the amount of stored data and therefore the impact of such a disclosure. Removing data from a database system is not a straightforward task; data degradation has an impact on the storage structure, indexing, transaction management, and logging mechanisms. To show the feasibility of data degradation, we provide several techniques to implement it; mainly, a combination of keeping data sorted on degradation time and using encryption techniques where possible. The techniques <b>are</b> <b>founded</b> <b>with</b> a prototype implementation and a theoretical analysis...|$|E

In order to get full and concise perspective of the significance of the Civil Rights movement, we must provide some information on the impact of the decision on other social movements.

A captive population initially thrived after its founding with seven snails, exceeding 600 captive individuals in 2009, but drastically declined in the last five years. Measures of fitness were examined from 2, 018 captive snails that died between 1998 and 2012, and compared with genotypic data for six microsatellite loci from a subset of these deceased snails (N 5335), as well as live captive snails (N 5198) and wild snails (N 592).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{development}} of new firms in Eastern Germany. Firm formations are regarded as a means to reduce the still high unemployment in Eastern Germany through the creation of new jobs. Primarily, the analyses concentrate on the employment growth of manufacturing firms founded between 1992 and 1996. Hypotheses on the influence of various potential growth factors are derived by the combination of theoretical approaches. The validity of these growth hypothesis is tested for by multivariate analyses, based on data of the ZEW-Foundation Panel (East). The results of the multivariate analyses regarding employment dynamics and growth potential of young (innovative) firms show that innovative firms achieve significantly higher growth rates compared to non-innovative firms. The results also indicate that innovative as well as non-innovative firms start with a suboptimal size and realize high growth rates {{in the first years of}} existence. In addition, effects on growth result from the legal form. Firms, that <b>are</b> <b>founded</b> <b>with</b> a liabilitylimited legal form, achieve higher growth rates compared to formations where th...|$|E

These conceptsare religion, apocalypse, miracle, fate, predestiny and destiny, love, unity of being and death.

According to them, it cannot be mentioned with the Godand universe dualism. However, we can call Mevlana as being unique universe but we can callhegel as being spritualist panteist. Both of them accepted the belief that the death is not the endof life and being nonexistence, but new life and reaching the God. Although the twophilosophers have same ideas they have different ideas on these issues as well.

40|$|Any Civil Engineering Structure must {{rest on a}} Structures <b>are</b> <b>founded</b> <b>with</b> {{concrete}} and steel materials mainly. Traditionally, concrete is mixture of cement, sand and aggregate. The most commonly used fine aggregate is natural river sand and coarse aggregate is stone quarry. Scarcity of good quality Natural River sand due to depletion of resources and restriction due to environmental consideration has made concrete manufactures to look for suitable alternative. One such alternative is “Artificial sand” namely if graded by means may also be called as manufactured sand. In this dissertation, attempt {{has been made to}} determine and verify experimentally the effect of artificially graded sand and demolished concrete structural aggregates on compressive strength and workability of concrete. Artificial sand is manufactured from crushing of local chury, stone chips and demolished concrete fines while the artificial aggregates are prepared from demolished structures. In {{the first phase of the}} study, the specimen of standard cube of (150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm) was used to determine the compressive strength of concrete with natural sand and stone aggregates. The specimens were tested for each nominal mix and definite water cement ratio. Three cubes were prepared for obtaining average of 7, 14 and 28 days strength of concrete. In the second phase of the study, another specimen of standard cube same size was used to determine the compressive strength of concrete with artificial sand with full replacement and demolished concrete structure aggregates. The specimens were tested again for obtaining average of 7, 14 and 28 days strength. Results were obtained to compare the nominal mix strength of traditional concrete with artificial concrete analytically as well as graphically. The conclusions were made for the understanding the effect of artificial concrete in terms of strength and workability over traditional concrete...|$|E
40|$|Arche {{which in}} Ancient Greek means {{beginning}} or principle shows the common lineage between {{the study of}} principles {{and the beginning of}} a study: the enquiry into the nature of things starts, and should start, from the deciphering of the principles, be they of things or of law. This is also true for the general principles of law regarding the study of any legal order, and particularly of the EU legal order. Specifically, I shall demonstrate in this essay that the social influence those principles may have is to coherently formalise the EU judicial reasoning by the promotion of a notion of economic desirability when these principles are invoked. In other words, I shall argue that the principle of economic efficiency underpins each of the general principles of EU law analysed in this essay. For, the general principles of EU law as construed and interpreted by the EU judges are imbued with consequentialism rather moralism, with an analogical and practical reasoning rather than abstract reasoning, with an inductive rather than an deductive approach – in short, these principles <b>are</b> <b>founded</b> <b>with</b> pragmatism rather than with legalism. Indeed, the analysis of the general principles of EU law understood in their legal abstraction is neither relevant nor conclusive for {{a better understanding of the}} EU judicial reasoning. These principles are a mere conceptualisation of the EU judicial review in order to trim down the legal outcomes preferred in terms of the social consequences they (are supposed to) generate. This conceptualisation allows for an a posteriori legal justification to a legal outcome decided a priori. In sharp contrast to Wechsler’s argument that general principles of law encapsulate “what surely are the main qualities of law, its generality and its neutrality”, one can agree with Holmes who said, regarding the Common law judge, that judges “decide the case first and determines the principles afterwards”. Accordingly, after having delved into the plea that vouches for a more principled economic analysis of EU law (but also more generally of any legal orders) thatwould take place beyond the Dworkin-Posner dichotomy (1) and (2), I shall empirically scrutinize, through a casuistic analysis of the ECJ jurisprudence, the validity of the proposed approach of efficiency analysis of three general principles of EU law (3).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{systematically}} evaluate all available treatment options in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane libraries up to 1 March 2016 for peer-reviewed publications on randomised clinical trials (RCTs). RCTs were included if progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life (QoL), or adverse events (AEs) were quantitatively evaluated. We assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and graded the evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group's approach. We included 25 articles, reporting on 10 unique RCTs describing seven different comparisons. In one RCT, a prolonged OS and PFS (high quality) <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> abiraterone and prednisone compared to placebo plus prednisone. In one RCT, a prolonged OS and PFS (high quality) <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> enzalutamide compared to placebo.

In three RCTs, a prolonged OS (moderate quality) <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> sipuleucel-T compared to placebo, but no prolonged PFS (low quality). In one RCT a prolonged PFS (high quality) <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> orteronel compared to placebo, but no prolonged OS (moderate quality).
