The most commonly used dose descriptor is CT dose index, which represents the dose to a location (e. g., depth) in a scanned volume from a complete series of slices. A weighted average of the CT dose index measured at the center and periphery of dose phantoms provides a convenient single-number estimate of patient dose for a procedure, and this value (or a related indicator that includes the scanned length) is often displayed on the operator’s console. CT image quality, as in most imaging, is {{described in terms of}} contrast, spatial resolution, image noise, and artifacts. A strength of CT is its ability to visualize structures of low contrast in a subject, a task that is limited primarily by noise and is therefore closely associated with radiation dose: The higher the dose contributing to the image, the less apparent is image noise and the easier it is to perceive low-contrast structures. Spatial resolution is ultimately limited by sampling, but both image noise and resolution are strongly affected by the reconstruction filter.

The test specimens used in the investigation were carbon vanes taken from a fuel pump and flat 21 -inch-diameter 2 metal disks (440 -C stainless steel) representing the pump housing. During each experiment a vane was loaded against a disk with a 0. 5 -pound force, and the disk was rotated to give a surface speed of 3140 feet per minute.

40|$|At the Forschungszentrum Juelich a coil {{system for}} {{magnetic}} ergodisation of the plasma edge {{is to be}} built in TEXTOR- 94 : the dynamic ergodic divertor (DED). The helical coils will be installed at the high field side inside the vacuum vessel. They are aligned in parallel to the magnetic field lines in the plasma at the q= 3 surface. The system will be fed by multiphase current to distribute the expected heat load on the divertor target plates over a wider area and e. g. to influence plasma rotation at higher frequencies. The aims of this thesis are to analyse different possible concepts for such a coil arrangement and to lay out selected DED components and thereby to contribute essentially to the final technical solution. The layout development is accompanied by field calculations of the different possible system designs. The path of the coils is calculated by means of the field line helix. A four phase current system with sixteen coils proves to be the most favourable; by connecting pairs of coils carrying opposite currents in series less power supplies (IGBT based) are needed. A coil design of complete turns has the advantage of a higher flexibility regarding the operation mode selection and needs less space than a module system. The coil outlets will be bundled {{to reduce the number of}} required flanges; additional coils above and below the ergodisation coils compensate the resulting asymmetry in the poloidal current distribution. The TEXTOR- 94 liner has to be modified in order that the perturbation coils can be installed.

[...] 911 had been called by Todd Halpen, who has also testified to the surviving victim's mother. [...] Todd did not reside at that address though he called 911 from his own cell phone outside. [...] Todd advised he had delivered pizza with mushrooms to his friend there four days earlier. [...] Todd identified himself as captain of a U.Vic. men's varsity team, who was also a part-time pizza-delivery business employee. [...] Todd had delivered the pizza there to his friend Micheal Leon (also 22 years old) who had arrived from Brampton, Ontario, and gathered several friends together, as he was in process of moving out to other housing. [...] Todd said they would be waiting outside with his cell phone as they wanted to talk to paramedics about some possible toxicology remaining from eating mushrooms. [...] Todd had already told the paramedics answering his call that he had eaten the same mushrooms [...] "at least 20 times" [...] suffering no adverse effects, but believed he had developed a [...] "tolerance" [...] yet [...] "his friend" [...] was worried about a possible allergic reaction remaining from mushrooms or possibly contaminated mushrooms. [...] Arriving there, unable to identify which one of the two [...] "22 year old males" [...] was reporting the anxiety about mushroom [...] "toxicology" [...] - which they failed to specify as to species, or whether processed or cooked adequately for food-safety, a paramedic called the Saanich Police from inside the ambulance. [...] A voice from the Ambulance stated police assistance was needed to get [...] "a 22 year old male who was still acting out, who took mushrooms there at that address on Saturday". [...] Constables Shane Coughlan and Paul Luhowy, arrived while the paramedics both waited inside the ambulance, evidently further confused by the paramedic's brief and misleading request for assistance. [...] The paramedics have testified the constables did not speak further to them - and ignored both Todd and Micheal though they saw two young men outside. [...] The police proceeded then going inside the residence where no traces of pizza or mushrooms could be found, and no one was home who had actually eaten the suspect pizza. [...] Todd had advised the paramedics he did not think the person at home there had a phone inside - he thought the landlord had not provided a landline contact number, and he only had returned with one of his friends who had eaten the mushrooms the previous Saturday. [...] The 6 separate student room-units inside were all rented other University of Victoria students - none of whom were [...] "22 years old". [...] None renting the property had eaten the suspect pizza or suffered any illness or reported any possible poisoning because of what Todd had delivered there the previous Saturday. [...] Only one 20-year-old student was home in his room - he had just undressed to take a shower when two constables burst into his bedroom. [...] Arriving thus confused by mis-communication of the paramedics, and their own over-zealous assumptions - Cst. Shane Couglan and Paul Luhowy began questioning that 20-year-old student insisting he had to take the ambulance to a hospital, while the student waited on his bed, aware that he had no personal need to do so. [...] Receiving no explanation, fully aware that police are required to provide an allegation of crime, when making an arrest, the student waited on his bed to be told where he was being taken - desiring to call his parents or a lawyer or at least his landlord - he was restricted by the four offices so he could not reach his prescription glasses or his cell phone. [...] He was subsequently accused informally of [...] "resisting an arrest under the BC Mental Health Act" [...] by the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner in 2006, in relation to his own complaint of Torture filed upon the direction his parents received while caring for him as directed by the Governor General's office of Canada in 2005. [...] At the time, in January 2005 - [...] Cst. Shane Coughlan and Cst. Paul Luhowy felt bothered by what they regarded as [...] "resistance" [...] to taking an non-emergency called ambulance to an emergency hospital department, evident only to them in 20-year-old student who knew ER departments are needed for patients who really are at risk of dying - and that he did not need laboratory testing, and was fully insured and assessed as [...] "very healthy" [...] under Alberta Health Care and privately insured to live there peacefully - while the police failed to advise any reason for insisting the residence be evacuted by him so suddenly without any reason given, nor warning, Cst. Luhowy called for further assistance from Cst. Douglas Cripps and Paul Douglas. [...] Immediately when the 4 constables were all gathered around the 20-year-old student sitting on his bed - in that student's bedroom - where the student had nothing more than a pillow to throw - all four constables attacked and assaulted him several times, dragging him onto the floor [...] "hog-tied" [...] while Douglas Cripps applied his TASER in a [...] "touch-stun" [...] capacity shooting <b>amperage</b> full-force into the 20 year old's leg and lower back five times in rapid succession. [...] Only then were the paramedics called inside, who took the nearly murdered student in restraints to a hospital from out of his bedroom naked. [...] All the authorities involving themselves, to interfere with the innocent student, then abandoned any duty to return ex-post facto to required legal process to identify themselves or the student. [...] They left all the student's property all abandoned incluscive of his Canadian Passport and ID leaving his bedroom and the entire home open to further theft and fraudulent use and vandalism. [...] The 20-year old's computer and cell phone were thereafter found with his passport on his desk by his parents who were called by a by-stander neighbour who reported their son had evidently been kidnapped. [...] While the cell phone found, was indeed the one the student and his mother had contracted with Telus.ca to use - it had certainly not been used to call 911 - his computer was found to have suffered hacking and virus contamination, but it remained undetermined whether anyone had taken their credit-card information. [...] His mother's credit card was also found in the student's wallet on the desk - which by mutual agreement she had given her son for pre-authorized use if he'd needed new contact lenses or any other medical services or groceries or books for his studies at U.Vic. [...] And some time later, that credit card number was also found to have suffered a fraudulent attempt to reserve a hotel room and UBER car rental in Europe - by neither of them. [...] As of May 2017, all this unwarranted, illegal, private-property invading use of a TASER to commit Torture and fraudulent extortion by kidnapping, has been testified of by the student who states he barely survived it - escaping BC with his mother's help and recovering in care of their family doctor H.Duvel MD, who disagnosed [...] "Post Taser Attack PTSD" [...] together with Dr. Philip Klemks, MD who also testified for the surviving student's mother. [...] The diagnosis of [...] "post-Taser Attack PTSD" [...] was reported to Revenue Canada, as being disabling after the televised view of the homocide of Robert Dziekanski was so ruled by a British Columbia coroner in 2007.

40|$|High {{voltage circuit}} {{breakers}} are important {{elements in the}} transfer of energy between the power plant and the consumer. Circuit breakers of the third generation, so-called SF 6 -selfblast-circuit-breakers, use the energy set free by the switching arc {{in case of a}} fault to build up the pressure necessary for extinguishing the electric arc. Advancing the development and the optimization of circuit breakers requires state-of-the-art simulation tools which grasp the complex interactions between the switching arc, radiation, ablation and gas flow. In the present thesis a model is presented which – due to its physics-based modeling – can be used to answer a wider range of different questions about SF 6 -arcs in comparison with preceding papers, in which the experiment-based two-zone-model for ablation-controlled electric arcs and selfblast-circuit-breakers was deduced and used. The electric arc is modelled by Ohmic heat, convection, heat conduction and radiation included in the energy balance equation and represents a control circuit which controls its temperature profile by specifying only the current. The development of this model is based on a comparison of different radiation models and on the simulation of a SF 6 -model circuit breaker with experimental data. The choice of a suitable radiation model is the essential goal of this thesis. For the simulation of ablation controlled electric arcs both the radiation losses in the arc as well as the radiation flow {{on the surface of the}} nozzle, which is necessary for the PTFE ablation, must be established. It turns out that within the given framework the P 1 model, which requires solving additional differential equations, is clearly better suited for a CFD simulation than the method of the partial characteristics or the Monte Carlo model, which require a beam-pursuing process in the solution space, or the net emissions coefficient, which requires the use of correction factors. The electric arc model was validated with the simulation of wall-stabilized electric arcs, for which the core temperatures can be calculated in good agreement with the experiment. Experimental data for electric arcs in a PTFE nozzle are used to investigate ablation-controlled arcs. Here, not only the pressure build-up is compared, but also the structure of the arc. A suitable turbulence model is chosen with the help of an axially blasted arc for different <b>amperages</b> and by comparing temperature profiles. It turns out that the measured temperature profiles can only be calculated with a reasonable degree of exactness with the help of the SST model. The entire model is validated by virtue of measurements at a model circuit breaker, and the limits of the model are shown...|$|R
40|$|Low-frequency {{electromagnetic}} fields, as {{they are}} emitted by facilities of electrical energy supply, can cause so-called non-adequate stimuli in the human organism, if they reach sufficient strength. These non-adequate stimuli can feign or mask adequate stimuli, which are caused by signals from the environment like sound, pressure, or light. Stronger electromagnetic fields can even provoke unpleasant or painful perceptions {{and can lead to}} life-threatening situations by irritating nerves and muscles. For this reason, the perception of weak low-frequency fields can be a warning signal. Besides, the sudden occurrence of such a low (actually harmless) perception can further lead to a so-called secondary accident due to a shock reaction and therefore has to be avoided. Therefore, the excitation thresholds of non-adequate stimuli are considered when safety regulations have to be established. However, the questions about mechanisms and places of action of the non-adequate stimulations still remained unanswered; the phenomenological descriptions were always based on external measures such as field strengths or <b>amperages.</b> In this work, the threshold is determined as the current density threshold at the point of origin of the non-adequate irritation. So, the threshold is no longer depending on external parameters like field configuration or individual anatomy. The current density threshold is not accessible by direct measurement, but must be investigated by combining measurements with volunteers and numerical calculations of the intracorporeal field distribution. The kinaesthetical channel (the sense of skin) and the visual channel (the sense of sight) are up to now referred to be the most sensitive sense channels regarding an excitability by low-frequency electromagnetic fields. Earlier estimations, which also form the basis of current discussions about a determination of base limits, resulted in very low values of about 2 mA/m². In this work, the mechanism and origin of non-adequate stimuli as well as the external threshold values are determined through examinations with volunteers. In combination with finite element calculations, the current density thresholds are evaluated. For this purpose, anatomically correct, electrical volume conductor models of the index finger have been developed for the kinaesthetical channel, and a worst case estimation is given, which also considers the grade of skin moisture. In the case of the visual channel, the eye, the periphery of the eye ball, and the head are replicated in a model, which represents structures down to sub-millimetre range. The new, calculated current density thresholds are up to two orders of magnitude higher than the estimated values known before: the sensitivity of the kinaesthetical and the visual channel regarding low-frequency electromagnetic fields were overestimated. As numerical calculations and experimental verifications show, field characteristics and individual anatomy of the body strongly influence the resulting current density distribution inside the body. Since receptors react only on the current density in their close vicinity, the current density thresholds {{in the area of the}} irritated receptors can be given independent from these factors...|$|R

Individual utilities normally apply different ratings due to using varying assumptions (which {{may be a}} result in higher or lower <b>amperage</b> ratings than those the manufacturers provide). Significant variables include wind speed and direction relative to the conductor, sun intensity, emissivity, ambient temperature, and maximum conductor temperature.|$|E
50|$|FMC {{may be used}} as an {{equipment}} grounding conductor if specific provisions are met regarding the trade size and length of FMC used, depending on the <b>amperage</b> of the circuits contained in the conduit. In general, {{an equipment}} grounding conductor must be pulled through the FMC with an ampacity suitable to carry the fault current likely imposed on the largest circuit contained within the FMC.|$|E
50|$|With the Pentium 4 and newer {{computer}} generations, {{the voltage}} for the CPU cores went below 2 V. Voltage drop on connectors forced the designers to place such buck converters {{next to the}} device. Higher maximum power consumption required the buck converters no longer fed from the 5 V and changed to a 12 V input, to decrease the <b>amperage</b> required from the power supply.|$|E
