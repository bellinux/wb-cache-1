40|$|ABSTRACT In genetic {{improvement}} of the soybean crop, the selection process is complex and greatly influenced by the environment.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare different selection indices in segregating populations of soybean, indicating methods which are superior in various situations, and proposing economic weightings in order to obtain higher gains. Direct and indirect selection criteria were used, together with the classic Smith-Hazel index, an index based on the sum ranks of Mulamba and Mock, a Williams base index, an index based on the desired gains of Pesek and Baker, and a genotype-ideotype distance index. The genetic material consisted of seven F 5 generation soybean populations, giving a total of 386 progeny, conducted in a Federer augmented-block design, with the following characteristics being evaluated: number of days to maturity, plant height at maturity, insertion height of the first pod, lodging, <b>agronomic</b> <b>value,</b> number of pods per plant, oil content and grain yield. According to the results, the classic index and base index showed the smallest variations in gains in the different situations and economic weightings under study.

40|$|Background: Barley yellow dwarf in wheat is an {{important}} viral disease among wheat cultivating areas of the world. It is gradually progressing as {{a major threat to}} wheat crop in Pakistan due to availability of favorable environmental conditions. The use of resistant cultivar is environmentally safest method for disease control so, it is necessary to develop resistant cultivars before epidemic outbreaks. Methods: The most commonly used wheat variety Inqilab 91 was crossed with BYDV / CYDV resistant variety TC 14. F 1 generation obtained from the P 1 cross was then allowed to self-cross. 61 plants were selected from F 2 generation on the basis of disease tolerance or susceptibility and only tolerant plants were included for further experiments in the study. The presence of BDV 2 among F 2 generation was confirmed by sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers in 6 (91, 96, 110, 119, 121 and 131) out of 61 genotypes which were then backcrossed with recurrent parent. Advance analysis regarding the presence of resistance source among the selected F 2 generation was carried out using ELISA. Moreover, appearance of symptoms, <b>agronomic</b> <b>values</b> for different parameters, green house and field responses were also kept under consideration to characterize and confirm the presence of BDV 2 among plants. Results: Results indicated that majority of F 2 segregating population showed less yellowing, low viral titer and good <b>agronomic</b> <b>values.</b> ELISA value, glasshouse and field analysis showed that seven genotypes (30, 81, 89, 91, 101, 110 and 121) were resistant, and twenty-four genotypes were found moderately resistant.

Biochars from wood (eucalyptus sawdust, pine bark), sugarcane bagasse, and substances rich in nutrients (coffee husk, chicken manure) produced at 350, 450 and 750 °C were characterized to identify agronomic and environmental benefits, which may enhance soil quality. Biochars derived from wood and sugarcane have greater potential for improving C storage in tropical soils due to a higher aromatic character, high C concentration, low H/C ratio, and FTIR spectra features as compared to nutrient-rich biochars. The high ash content associated with alkaline chemical species such as KHCO 3 and CaCO 3, verified by XRD analysis, made chicken manure and coffee husk biochars potential liming agents for remediating acidic soils. High Ca and K contents in chicken manure and coffee husk biomass can significantly replace conventional sources of K (mostly imported in Brazil) and Ca, suggesting a high <b>agronomic</b> <b>value</b> for these biochars. High-ash biochars, such as chicken manure and coffee husk, produced at low-temperatures (350 and 450 °C) exhibited high CEC values, which can be considered as a potential applicable material to increase nutrient retention in soil. Therefore, the <b>agronomic</b> <b>value</b> of the biochars in this study is predominantly regulated by the nutrient richness of the biomass, but an increase in pyrolysis temperature to 750 °C can strongly decrease the adsorptive capacities of chicken manure and coffee husk biochars.

The Mantel's test of correlation revealed the best correlation between ISSR and cumulative data with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 84. Assessment of population diversity indicated that the maximum intra population genetic diversity was recorded among high FeZn lines (HFL) having maximum values of Nei's genetic diversity (h) (0. 244), Shannon information index (I) (0. 368) and the percentage of polymorphic loci (Pp) (72. 65 %) while the corresponding lowest values of 0. 074, 0. 109 and 17. 95 % respectively were observed among the members of MDT subpopulation.

The reduction of bioavailable Cd (ammonium nitrate extractable) and its phytoavailability for lettuce were used as assessment criteria {{in the evaluation of}} stabilization performance of each treatment. Moreover, the <b>agronomic</b> <b>values</b> of the treatments were also investigated. Ammonium nitrate extraction results indicated that faecal matter biochar, cow manure biochar and lime significantly reduced bioavailable Cd by 84 – 87, 65 – 68 and 82 – 91  %, respectively, as compared to the spiked controls. Unpredictably, coffee husk biochar induced significant increment of Cd in NH 4 NO 3 extracts. The immobilization potential of faecal matter biochar and lime were superior than the other treatments. However, lime and egg shell promoted statistically lower yield and P, K and Zn concentrations response of lettuce plants compared to the biochar treatments. The lowest Cd and highest P tissue concentrations of lettuce plants were induced by faecal matter and cow manure biochar treatments in both soils. Additionally, the greatest Cd phytoavailability reduction for lettuce was induced by poultry litter and cow manure biochars in the silty loam soil. Our results indicate that faecal matter and animal manure biochars have shown great potential to promote Cd immobilization and lettuce growth response in heavily contaminated agricultural fields.|$|R

Urban wastes in developing countries are rich in recyclable organic matter and they increase as urbanization increases. A recent project carried out in Dakar analyzed the potential contribution of urban organic waste (OW) to urban horticultural production. A research project was conducted in order to 1) carry out farm surveys to understand local fertilization practices; 2) identify and characterize locally available organic wastes chemically; and 3) carry out experiments with these wastes in greenhouses and farms to evaluate their agronomic potentialities and their implementation in local farmers' practices. Horse and poultry manure are the main OW used by farmers around Dakar; however, these may become less available and/or more expensive in the future. The OW obtained after sifting through other sources of urban wastes (i. e., compost) could provide an alternative and unlimited source of organic matter. However, chemical analyses of this compost show that organic matter and nitrogen levels are weak compared to manure. Experiments were therefore conducted in greenhouses with the two representative soils of the region, a sandy-clay soil (Deck) and a sandy soil (Dior) : these showed no significant effect of compost on the early growth of tomatoes compared to treatment without compost, but rather a light-positive effect {{at the end of}} the tomato-growth cycle, consistent with the analytical properties of the product.
