25|$|Along the African coast {{you will}} hear that dirge-like strain in all their songs, as at work or {{paddling}} their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations {{you will hear}} it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It seems like the dirge of national degradation, the wail of a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor… <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to which my attention was specially directed by an incident I witnessed or rather heard.|$|E

Here sociobiology has had {{and will continue to}} have success. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply." ...|$|E

Acting alongside Heath Ledger (who died before filming had finished), Cole, in an interview for the Daily Telegraph admitted that, at times, she felt out of her depth in the role- saying [...] "I'd only done a couple of films <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> was surrounded by amazing actors like Christopher Plummer and Heath Ledger, and it was intimidating at times," [...] also describing the role as [...] "the biggest role I've ever done".|$|E

[...] Lorde explained that the line [...] "We live in cities you'll never see on screen" [...] was [...] "to be speaking for the minority" [...] from small cities. She also expresses distaste in common contemporary popular music lyrics telling listeners to [...] "put your hands in the air" [...] through the verse [...] "I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air". Writer Lily Rothman for the magazine Time commented that the lyrics [...] "we sure know how to run things" [...] in [...] "Team" [...] were a response to the lyrics [...] "we run things, things don’t run we" [...] in Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013).|$|E

2500|$|Managed by Newt Joseph, {{the team}} also {{included}} Byron [...] "Mex" [...] Johnson, but otherwise it mostly functioned as a minor-league team staffed by marginal, aging, or young players. Playing throughout Kansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Illinois, and even Utah, large crowds turned out to see Paige throw an inning or two, relying on junkballs. Paige recalled, [...] "Everybody'd heard I was a fastballer <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> was throwing Alley Oops and bloopers and underhand and sidearm and any way I could {{to get the ball}} {{up to the plate and}} get it over, maybe even for a strike.

When they landed, his producer suggested a game of tennis to clear his head. Watson {{could not see the}} ball at all. After a visit to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and an MRI scan, he was advised that he had a developing pituitary adenoma, which was the size of two golf balls. According to Watson, [...] "Since an early age I've had an in-built premonition, a vision that I wouldn't make 40. For the previous seven years I'd have a recurring nightmare in which my head exploded. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> was with a brain tumour on the eve of my 40th birthday; I thought, 'This is it, I was right, I knew it'." [...] Watson recalled that the tumours were [...] "like a figure of eight, one filling the frontal cavity of my skull, the other forced through into the top of my nose." [...] He stayed in Los Angeles for two days and continued recording his album while tests confirmed whether the tumour was malignant or not – {{it turned out to be}} benign.|$|E
