40|$|SummaryBackgroundClostridium difficile-associated {{diarrhea}} (CDAD) {{has shown}} increasing incidence, morbidity, and mortality in recent years. We assessed {{the number of}} CDAD tests requested, CDAD positivity rates, the use of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubs,</b> and antimicrobial utilization. MethodsWe collected information on every adult patient (> 18 years) who developed diarrhea and had a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin from June 2005 to December 2009 at a tertiary care hospital. A time-series analysis was performed using monthly data on the incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) (i. e., cases of infection per 1000 patient-days), {{as well as the}} consumption of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubs</b> (in liters/ 1000 -patient days) and antibiotics (in defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days). ResultsThe mean number of annual requests for C. difficile tests was 1031, and the rates per 1000 patient-days for each year from 2005 to 2009 were 0. 30, 0. 46, 0. 39, 0. 31, and 0. 40 overall in the hospital, and 0. 18, 0. 10, 0. 53, 0. 38, and 0. 37 {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU). The use of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubs</b> per 1000 patient-days increased from 37. 4 to 73. 0, and from 41. 5 to 129. 4 in the hospital and in the ICU, respectively.

40|$|BackgroundHand hygiene is the {{cornerstone}} of aseptic techniques to reduce surgical site infection. Conventional surgical scrub is effective for disinfecting a surgeon's hands. However, the compliance of conventional scrub may be hindered by skin damage, allergy, and time. <b>Alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> has a satisfactory antimicrobial effect, but mostly in laboratory settings. Our aim was to compare a conventional surgical scrub with an <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> to evaluate antimicrobial efficacy. MethodsFrom June 1, 2010 to July 31, 2011, 128 healthcare workers were enrolled in the study. They used an <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> or a conventional surgical scrub as preoperative hand antisepsis during their routine practice. Hand sampling for cultures were performed before and after operations. Positive culture plates were further processed for pathogen identification. ResultsThe culture positive rate of the <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> was 6. 2 % before operations and 10. 8 % after operations. Both rates were lower than the conventional surgical scrub [47. 6 % before operations (p <  0. 001) and 25. 4 % after operations (p =  0. 03) ]. The most identified pathogens were Gram-positive with coagulase-negative staphylococci being the major pathogen. Multivariate analysis showed that prior hand condition (p =  0. 21) and type of surgery such as cardiovascular surgery (p =  0. 12) were less relevant, but the <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> was a significant protective factor for positive hand cultures. ConclusionThe <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> was more efficacious for surgical antisepsis and had sustained efficacy, compared to conventional surgical scrub.

40|$|Background The {{introduction}} of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> dispensers {{has had a}} positive influence on compliance of healthcare workers with the recommended guidelines for hand hygiene. However, establishing the best location for <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> dispensers remains a problem, and no method is currently available to optimize the location of these devices. In this paper we describe a method to determine the optimal location for <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> dispensers in patient rooms. Methods We composed a method that consists of a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Firstly, different arrangements of dispensers were determined {{based on the results of}} two types of assessment: workflow observations and interviews with nurses and physicians. Each arrangement was then evaluated using two types of assessment: interviews with nurses and physicians and electronic measurements of the user frequency of the dispensers. This procedure was applied in a single-bed patient room on a thoracic surgery intensive care unit. Results The workflow observations revealed that the activities of patient care were most often at the entrance and near the computer at the right side of the test room. Healthcare workers stated that the location of the dispenser should meet several requirements. Measurements of the frequency of use showed that the dispenser located near the computer, at the back of the room, was used less frequently than the dispenser located near the sink and the dispenser located at the entrance to the room. Conclusion The applied method has potential for determining the optimal location for <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> dispensers in a patient room. Workflow observations and the expressed preferences of healthcare workers guide the choice for the location of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> dispensers.

40|$|Background A {{procedure}} for including activity against enveloped viruses in the post-contamination treatment of hands has been recommended, {{but so far}} no European standard is available to implement it. In 2004, the German Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the German Association for the Control of Virus Disease (DVV) suggested that vaccinia virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) should be used as test viruses in a quantitative suspension test to determine the activity of a disinfectant against all enveloped viruses. Methods We have studied the activities of three commonly-used <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubs</b> (<b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> A, based on 45 % propan- 2 -ol, 30 % propan- 1 -ol and 0. 2 % mecetronium etilsulfate; <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> B, based on 80 % ethanol; <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> C, based on 95 % ethanol) against vaccinia virus and BVDV, and in addition against four other clinically relevant enveloped viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, and human and avian influenza A virus. The <b>hand</b> <b>rubs</b> were challenged with different organic loads at exposure time of 15, 30 and 60 s. According to the guidelines of both BGA/RKI and DVV, and EN 14476 : 2005, the reduction of infectivity of each test virus was measured on appropriate cell lines using a quantitative suspension test. Results All three <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubs</b> reduced the infectivity of vaccinia virus and BVDV by >= 4 log 10 -steps within 15 s, irrespective {{of the type of}} organic load. Similar reductions of infectivity were seen against the other four enveloped viruses within 15 s in the presence of different types of organic load.

40|$|Background: The {{emergence}} {{and spread}} of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) {{has become a}} serious public health threat. Rational antibacterial policy, combined with enforcement of infection control practices are key strategies to combat AMR in the hospital setting. Loss of antibacterial activity {{as a direct result}} of antibacterial consumption can be modelled via the economic approach of a negative externality. Objective: To determine the externalities of antibacterial consumption and <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> use for hand disinfection. Methods: A simple model was built, combining the results of a recently conducted cost-of-illness study with the results of a multivariate time-series analysis, which determined the impact of antibacterial consumption and <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> use on the incidence of hospital-acquired infections caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Results: Consumption of a single defined daily dose of second-generation cephalosporins, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and lincosamides is associated with a negative externality of about &U 20 AC; 5, &U 20 AC; 15, &U 20 AC; 11 and &U 20 AC; 12, respectively. In contrast, use of 1 litre of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> solution for hand disinfection is associated with a positive externality of about &U 20 AC; 61. In other words, a single disinfection of the hands (use of 3 [*]mL <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> solution) saves an average &U 20 AC; 0. 18 of the potential cost incurred by MRSA-related infections. Conclusions: Quantifying the externalities of antibacterial use and <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> use may lead to changes in prescribing behaviour and increase compliance with hand disinfection. Furthermore, the presented methodology of relating the cost of resistance to specific factors such as antibacterial use and hand disinfection provides information that may be useful for prioritizing prevention methods.

DESIGN: Prospective crossover trial in which each surgeon served as his or her own control, with individual randomization to the 1. 5 - or the 3 -minute group during the first part of the trial. SETTING: Basel University Hospital, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two surgeons with different levels of postdoctoral training. METHODS: We measured the bactericidal effectiveness of 1. 5 minutes and 3 minutes of surgical hand antisepsis with <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> by assessing the mean (+/-SD) log 10 number of colony-forming units before the application of hand rub (baseline), after the application of hand rub (immediate effect), and after surgery (sustained effect) so as to follow European Norm 12791 as closely as possible. RESULTS: The immediate mean (+/-SD) log 10 reduction in colony-forming units (cfu) was 2. 26 +/- 1. 13 log 10 cfu for the 1. 5 -minute group and 3. 01 +/- 1. 06 log 10 cfu for the 3 -minute group (P =. 204). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to the sustained effect; the mean (+/-SD) log 10 increase in bacterial density during surgery was 1. 08 +/- 1. 13 log 10 cfu for the 1. 5 -minute group and 0. 95 +/- 1. 27 log 10 cfu for the 3 -minute group (P =. 708). No adverse effects were recorded.

40|$|Background : Controlled {{studies on}} the effect of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> before and after each patient contact on {{surgical}} site infection (SSI) among neurosurgical patients are scarce. Aim : To evaluate the effect of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> before and after each patient contact on SSI after elective neurosurgical procedures. Setting and Design : Department of Neurosurgery, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum, Kerala. An intervention study using a &#x 2032;before-after&#x 2032; design. Material and Methods : Two 9 -month study periods were compared; between these periods, an infection-control protocol incorporating an <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> was implemented for a period of 3 months and continued thereafter. Consecutive patients who underwent neurosurgery between January and September 2006 (control group, before protocol) and between January and September 2007 (intervention group, after protocol) were included. Outcome measures included SSI rates, profile of microorganisms and patient survival. Statistical Analysis : SPSS statistics version 17. 0. Results : A total of 1, 899 operated cases were reviewed. The patients in the control and intervention groups were similar with regard to sex, age and type of neurosurgery. The surgical site infection rates were 22 (2. 3 &#x 0025;) out of 974 in the control group and 14 (1. 5 &#x 0025;) out of 925 in the intervention group (P = 0. 2). Patient survival rates were 97. 6 &#x 0025; (control) and 98. 3 &#x 0025; (intervention).

40|$|Introduction: Healthcare-acquired {{infections are}} {{a major source of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality in people living in residential aged care facilities. Compliance with hand hygiene by healthcare workers can reduce the risk of infection to residents, yet compliance rates are generally low. Infection-control advocates within the aged care sector are looking to conduct programs to improve rates among their staff. This review was conducted to identify a reproducible intervention to improve staff hand hygiene compliance within an Australian residential aged care facility. Method: Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched for combinations of 'hand hygiene', 'hand washing', 'residential aged care facility', 'aged care', 'nursing home' and 'long-term care facility' from 2000 to current. Articles were excluded if the information was not clearly stated as pertaining to a residential aged care facility or if the data investigated staff knowledge or perceptions of hand hygiene. Results: Most of the five articles included in the review reported an improvement in compliance rates. Studies were multimodal, had an education or training component, and included the promotion of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubs.</b> Several used aspects of the World Health Organization's hand hygiene initiatives. Compliance audit tools across the studies were not consistent; thus, results may not be comparable.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{healthcare}} workers' skin {{tolerance for}} {{and acceptance of}} 3 <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> formulations. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, crossover clinical trial. SETTING: Intensive care unit in a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight healthcare workers (HCWs). INTERVENTION: A total of 3 <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> formulations (hereafter, formulations A, B, and C) were used in random order for 3 - 5 consecutive working days during regular nursing shifts. Formulations A and B contained the same emollient, and formulations B and C contained the same alcohol at the same concentration. Use of each test formulation was separated by a "washout" period of at least 2 days. A visual assessment of skin integrity by a blinded observer using a standard 6 -item scale was conducted {{before and after the}} use of each formulation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used for the assessment of risk factors for skin alteration, and product acceptability was assessed by use of a customized questionnaire after the use of each formulation. RESULTS: Thirty-eight HCWs used each of 3 formulations for a median of 3 days (range, 3 - 5 days). The mean amount of product used daily (+/-SD) was 54. 9 +/- 23. 5 mL (median, 50. 9 mL). Both subjective and objective evaluation of skin conditions after use showed lower HCW tolerance for product C. Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3. 17 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 1. 1 - 8. 8]), fair or very fair skin (OR, 3. 01 [95 % CI, 1. 1 - 7. 9]), skin alteration before hand rub use (OR, 3. 73 [95 % CI, 1. 7 - 8. 1]), and use of formulation C (OR, 8. 79 [95 % CI, 2. 7 - 28. 4]) were independently associated with skin alteration. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol permits a fast-track comparison of HCWs' skin tolerance for different <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> formulations that are used in healthcare settings. The emollient in formulation C may account for its inferior performance...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} impact of a {{multimodal}} infection control program on the rate of nosocomial infections at a 550 -bed tertiary care center. Methods. Before and after the implementation of an infection control program, the rate of nosocomial infection was recorded in time-interval prevalence studies. Hand hygiene compliance was studied before and after the intervention. As a surrogate marker of compliance, the amount of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub</b> consumed before the intervention was compared with the amount consumed after the intervention. The intervention included additional staff for infection control, repeated instructions for hand hygiene, new guidelines for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, and isolation of patients infected or colonized with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Results. The rate of nosocomial infection decreased from approximately 11. 7 % to 6. 8 % in 2 years. The rate of hand hygiene compliance increased by 20. 0 %; it was 59. 0 % before the intervention and increased to 79. 0 % afterward. These results correlate with data on the consumption of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rub,</b> but not with data on the use of antibiotics. Conclusion. Within 2 years, a multimodal infection control program intervention such as this one may reduce the rate of nosocomial infection at a tertiary care center by more than one-third and improve both the quality of care and patient outcomes. It may also generate considerable savings. Therefore, such programs should be promoted not only by hospital epidemiologists but also by hospital administrator...|$|E
25|$|For {{control of}} staphylococcal infections in hospitals, {{it has been}} found that the {{greatest}} benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%. Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand-rubbing with <b>alcohol-based</b> solution with <b>hand</b> washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap. But soap and water is more effective than <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubs</b> for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Optimizing user {{satisfaction}} with <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubs</b> (ABHR) may be vital to enhance hand hygiene performance. This study tested the tolerability and acceptability {{of a new}} ABHR (EVO 9; Ecolab) in healthcare workers under daily working conditions and evaluated the practicability of the corresponding WHO protocol. METHODS: We strictly applied the WHO single product ABHR evaluation protocol. A trained observer assessed hand skin conditions of healthy volunteers using at least 30  ml ABHR per day during their clinical work at baseline, day 3 - 5 and one month (visit 1 - 3). Participants rated ABHR tolerability and acceptability at visit 2 and 3. Additionally, we registered study time for participants and study team. RESULTS: Among 46 volunteers, 76...|$|R

Successful promotion requires a multimodal strategy. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposes an approach including at least five components: system change, in particular the recourse to <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rubbing</b> as the new standard of care, staff education using newly developed tools, monitoring and feedback of staff performance, reminders in the workplace, and promotion of an institutional safety climate.
