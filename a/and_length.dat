5|$|The {{concept of}} {{coherence}} was only {{introduced into the}} metric system {{in the third quarter}} of the 19th century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherentâ€”in particular the litre was 0.001m3 and the are (from which the hectare derives) was 100m2. However the units of mass <b>and</b> <b>length</b> were related to each other through the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point.|$|E
5|$|The derived {{units in}} the SI are formed by powers, {{products}} or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number.

40|$|Beak lengths (lower rostral <b>length</b> <b>and</b> upper rostral <b>length)</b> {{were taken}} for a sample of Moroteuthis ingens which were {{captured}} on the Chatham Rise, New Zealand. Beak lengths were plotted against both mantle <b>length</b> <b>and</b> wet weight to determine {{the relationship between these}} parameters for future use in biomass estimates in predator analysis. Although M. ingens is markedly sexually dimorphic, with females reaching 5 times the weight of males, there was no obvious sexual dimorphism in either lower or upper rostral length. This resulted in sex-specific relationships between both LRL <b>and</b> mantle <b>length,</b> LRL <b>and</b> weight; and URL <b>and</b> mantle <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> URL and weight. Males appeared to have a curvilinear relationship between beak <b>length</b> <b>and</b> mantle <b>length</b> <b>and</b> beak <b>length</b> <b>and</b> weight (even for log-transformed data). There was also considerable spread in the data in the plot between beak <b>length</b> <b>and</b> weight for females of similar weight. These characteristics of the data makes biomass estimates based on rostral length measurements for this species difficult. Other beak parameters may prove more useful for estimating biomass of M. ingens...|$|R

5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions <b>and</b> <b>length</b> of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number <b>and</b> <b>length</b> of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E

5|$|Castles {{continued}} to grow in military sophistication and comfort during the 12th century, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the complexity <b>and</b> <b>length</b> of sieges in England. While in Ireland and Wales castle architecture {{continued to}} follow that of England, after the death of Alexander III the trend in Scotland moved away from the construction of larger castles towards the use of smaller tower houses. The tower house style would also be adopted in the north of England and Ireland in later years. In North Wales Edward I built a sequence of militarily powerful castles after the destruction of the last Welsh polities in the 1270s. By the 14th century castles were combining defences with luxurious, sophisticated living arrangements and heavily landscaped gardens and parks.|$|E

These features may also have been related to the increased mass <b>and</b> <b>length</b> of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E

40|$|Advisor: David S. SenchinaBackground: When {{performing}} a second task, normal gait parameters are altered {{as compared to}} normal walking. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effects of {{performing a}} task on gait parameters including number of steps, step width, step <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> stride <b>length.</b> Hypotheses: It was predicted that walking at a fast-pace would decrease number of steps and step width while increasing stride <b>length</b> <b>and</b> step <b>length.</b> Carrying 15 % of the subjects body weight would increase number of steps and step width while decreasing stride <b>length</b> <b>and</b> step <b>length.</b> Performing mental math would increase number of steps, step width would deviate from normal, <b>and</b> step <b>length</b> <b>and</b> stride <b>length</b> would decrease. Methods: Nine male and female students ages 19 - 26 participated in the study. Six conditions during walking were performed by each subject for a total of 18 7 -m trials. Measurements were taken including number of steps, step width, step <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> stride <b>length.</b> Ttests were performed to statistically analyze the data. Results: There was a statistically significant difference found between normal walking and fast-paced walking in number of steps, step <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> stride <b>length,</b> but not step width. No other statistically significant data was found. Conclusions: Gait is not significantly altered when performing a second task, with the exception of fast-paced walking. Further studies should be done with an increased sample size. Drake University, Department of Biology, Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Department of Chemistr...|$|R
