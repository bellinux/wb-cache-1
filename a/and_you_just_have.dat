2500|$|In {{the prime}} of his career, Johnson's fastball was {{sometimes}} clocked over , even as high as [...] with a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm). His signature pitch was a slider that broke down and away from left-handed hitters and down and in to right-handed hitters. The effectiveness of the pitch is marked by its velocity being in the low 90s along with tight late break; hitters often believe they were thrown a fastball until the ball breaks just before it crosses home plate. Right-handed hitters have swung through and missed sliders that nearly hit their back foot. [...] Johnson dubbed his slider [...] "Mr. Snappy". [...] In later years, his fastball declined to the [...] range and his slider clocked at around [...] Johnson also threw a split-finger fastball that behaved like a change-up and a sinker to induce ground-ball outs. In a June 27, 2012, appearance on The Dan Patrick Show, Adam Dunn (a left-handed batter) was asked who the best pitcher he faced was. [...] "Honestly, Randy Johnson when he was good. It's hopeless. It's like a hopeless feeling. The first time you face him you feel like he's going to hit you right {{in the back of}} the neck when he throws it, like every pitch is going to hit you {{in the back of the}} neck. And it ends up down and away for a strike <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to trust it's going to be a strike, and heaven forbid he doesn't lose one out there and heaven forbid, there goes your cheek." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, the Lakers won {{the title}} again; however, O'Neal and Bryant began feuding during the season. O'Neal came into {{training}} camp out of shape, which disappointed Jackson and also Bryant, who worked hard over the offseason {{to improve his}} game. Bryant was leading the league in scoring as 2001 began, and Jackson said Bryant was playing the best ball of his career. O'Neal was shooting below 50 percent during stretches, and his free throw shooting was in the 20 percent range. O'Neal said of the Lakers in January, [...] "When {{it was clear that}} everything went through me, the outcome of it was (a record of) 67–15, playing with enthusiasm, the city jumping up and down and a parade. And now we're 23–11. You figure it out ... I don't know why anybody else would want to change – other than selfish reasons." [...] Bryant responded that it was a different year and the roster had undergone some changes and [...] "things change, things evolve, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to grow with that change." [...] Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka said a key factor was the team's defense after losing Fisher for most of the season. O'Neal requested a trade after a blowout win against the Phoenix Suns where Bryant scored 38 and O'Neal scored 18. Jackson commented that their actions were [...] "juvenile" [...] and they should appreciate each other and play as a team. Bryant would be criticized for forcing his offense and not involving his teammates enough. Even O'Neal's stepfather was overheard yelling at Bryant to pass the ball during a game. Bryant told Jackson that the [...] "(triangle) offense is so simple. It doesn't display my talent ... it doesn't give me what I have to have for my game." [...] According to Bryant, the team's defense was the issue and not his increased role in the offense. [...] Bryant said that [...] "scoring shouldn't affect (O'Neal's) defense", while O'Neal maintained that [...] "if the big dog ain't me, then the house won't get guarded – period." [...] Due to O'Neal's sensitivity toward criticism, Jackson overlooked O'Neal's shortcomings while maintaining his criticism of Bryant. West told O'Neal that he also had personal rivalries when he played with all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor, but O'Neal needed to [...] "stop being a baby ... put the team's success first." ...|$|E
