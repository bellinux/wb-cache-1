40|$|In the {{preliminary}} design phase of an aircraft development trade studies are conducted {{to find an}} optimized design for an aircraft fuselage which calls for fast and efficient model generation. Based on the standardized <b>aircraft</b> <b>description</b> format CPACS, a fully parameterized fuselage modelling tool was developed to generate global aircraft FE models for static sizing using shell elements for the skin and elastic beam elements for reinforcements and the floor structures.

Likewise some other regions may be modelled using a fine shell element mesh, e. g. the door surround structure which must not deform plastically in survivable crash load cases to assure its function as an emergency exit.

40|$|The NDARC code {{performs}} {{design and}} analysis tasks. The design task involves sizing the rotorcraft to satisfy specified design conditions and missions. The analysis tasks can include off-design mission performance analysis, flight performance calculation for point operating conditions, and generation of subsystem or component performance maps. The principal tasks (sizing, mission analysis, flight performance analysis) {{are shown in}} the figure as boxes with heavy borders. Heavy arrows show control of subordinate tasks. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>description</b> consists of all the information, input and derived, that denes the aircraft. The aircraft consists {{of a set of}} components, including fuselage, rotors, wings, tails, and propulsion. This information can be the result of the sizing task; can come entirely from input, for a fixed model; or can come from the sizing task in a previous case or previous job. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>description</b> information is available to all tasks and all solutions. The sizing task determines the dimensions, power, and weight of a rotorcraft that can perform a specified set of design conditions and missions. The aircraft size is characterized by parameters such as design gross weight, weight empty, rotor radius, and engine power available. The relations between dimensions, power, and weight generally require an iterative solution. From the design flight conditions and missions, the task can determine the total engine power or the rotor radius (or both power and radius can be fixed), as well as the design gross weight, maximum takeoff weight, drive system torque limit, and fuel tank capacity. For each propulsion group, the engine power or the rotor radius can be sized. Missions are defined for the sizing task, and for the mission performance analysis. A mission consists of a number of mission segments, for which time, distance, and fuel burn are evaluated. For the sizing task, certain missions are designated to be used for design gross weight calculations; for transmission sizing; and for fuel tank sizing. The mission parameters include mission takeoff gross weight and useful load. For specified takeoff fuel weight with adjustable segments, the mission time or distance is adjusted so the fuel required for the mission equals the takeoff fuel weight. The mission iteration is on fuel weight or energy. Flight conditions are specified for the sizing task, and for the flight performance analysis. For the sizing task, certain flight conditions are designated to be used for design gross weight calculations; for transmission sizing; for maximum takeoff weight calculations; and for anti-torque or auxiliary thrust rotor sizing. The flight condition parameters include gross weight and useful load. For flight conditions and mission takeoff, the gross weight can be maximized, such that the power required equals the power available. A flight state is defined for each mission segment and each flight condition. The aircraft performance can be analyzed for the specified state, or a maximum effort performance can be identified. The maximum effort is specified in terms of a quantity such as best endurance or best range, and a variable such as speed, rate of climb, or altitude...|$|E

40|$|The NASA Design and Analysis of Rotorcraft (NDARC) {{software}} is an aircraft system analysis tool intended to support both conceptual design efforts and technology impact assessments. The principal tasks are to design (or size) a rotorcraft to meet specified requirements, including vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operation, and then analyze {{the performance of}} the aircraft for a set of conditions. For broad and lasting utility, {{it is important that the}} code have the capability to model general rotorcraft configurations, and estimate the performance and weights of advanced rotor concepts. The architecture of the NDARC code accommodates configuration flexibility; a hierarchy of models; and ultimately multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization. Initially the {{software is}} implemented with lowfidelity models, typically appropriate for the conceptual design environment. An NDARC job consists of one or more cases, each case optionally performing design and analysis tasks. The design task involves sizing the rotorcraft to satisfy specified design conditions and missions. The analysis tasks can include off-design mission performance calculation, flight performance calculation for point operating conditions, and generation of subsystem or component performance maps. For analysis tasks, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>description</b> can come from the sizing task, from a previous case or a previous NDARC job, or be independently generated (typically the description of an existing aircraft). The aircraft consists of a set of components, including fuselage, rotors, wings, tails, and propulsion.

Description and analysis of conventional rotorcraft configurations is facilitated, while retaining the capability to model novel and advanced concepts. Specific rotorcraft configurations considered are single main-rotor and tailrotor helicopter; tandem helicopter; coaxial helicopter; and tiltrotors.

40|$|The {{aircraft}} design process can generally be classified into three major phases. In the conceptual design phase {{the viability of}} different designs is investigated with respect to market and customer requirements. It usually ends with the identification of suitable {{aircraft design}}s. Subsequently, in the preliminary design phase, trade studies are conducted. The aim of this phase is the generation of a loft and to find a basic design which will then be optimized in the concluding detailed design phase. The investigations in the preliminary design phase comprise the generation of numerous different analytical and Finite Element (FE) models including their corresponding boundary conditions. Though computational power has increased significantly {{over the past few}} years the model generation process still is a time-consuming task. Due to the high number of analyses it is also a source of possible errors which eventually may lead to time- and cost intensive redesign during the detailed design stage. Therefore, the preliminary design phase is of high importance in the overall design process. As different disciplines influence each other, the use of Multi Disciplinary Optimisations (MDO) is becoming more and more state-of-the-art as it combines various disciplines aiming to find an optimal aircraft configuration for the requested missions. This approach requires coupling in- and output of the different tools in different disciplines which in turn calls for a common data format serving as an interface. The increased detail level of computational models and the amount of parameters to be evaluated for each configuration call for the composition of automated processes. Based on the parametrised DLR <b>aircraft</b> <b>description</b> CPACS (Common Parametrised Aircraft Configuration Scheme), several different tools for structural sizing and crashworthiness proof of air- and rotorcraft have been developed at the Institute of Structures and Design (DLR-BT) : For modelling purposes the tools TRAFUMO (TRansport Aircraft FUselage MOdel) and ROFUMA (ROtorcraft FUselage Mass Assessment) have been established. Static sizing against strength and stability is conducted using S-BOT+ (Sizing roBOT+) tool while crashworthiness is investigated using AC-CRASH (AirCraft CRASH). In this paper an overview of the tools developed and used at DLR-BT will be given. Exemplary models and applications will be presented to illustrate the positive impact on efficiency in aircraft design. Concluding, future development steps and possible applications will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel global {{parameterization}} scheme for points on a CAD geometry. The main {{use of this}} algorithm is to compute mesh deformations for changes of the underlying geometry. The creation of structured meshes is a time-consuming trial and error process, which is not suitable for e. g. automatic optimization. Particularly gradient based optimization often performs only small changes of the design variables, which should result in only slightly different meshes. Therefore, methods are required that deform an initial mesh based on the change of the initial geometry. Here, we present a projection method that computes a bijective mapping between a point in space and its global parameterization {{with respect to the}} trimmed NURBS based CAD geometry. After a geometry change, the parameterized points can be back-projected into 3 D space which eventually yields the deformed mesh. Providing support for trimmed NURBS geometries is particularly challenging, as their surface parameters u, v mighty be valid only in a non-rectangular trimming region. This region however varies on geometry changes, which would lead to a loss of mesh points, if this is not properly handled. To overcome this issue, we reparametrize the trimming region such that the domain of some new parameters u', v' is rectangular. Our projection algorithm is separated into three different problems: first [...] finding the face a mesh point belongs; second [...] reparametrize the face to get a bijective mapping; third [...] project the point onto the reparametrized surface. The first and third problems are comparable simple and can be performed using standard CAD algorithms. For the reparameterization problem, we provide a method that converts the 2 d trimming domain of the NURBS into a series of two-dimensional untrimmed patches. This is done by first subdividing the original NURBS face into multiple faces. Then, we identify or create four boundary curves for each of these sub-faces. The four boundary curves are finally used to create a reparameterization patch e. g. using the Coons method. The projection of a point leads only to a unique solution, if the reparameterization patch is invertible. We check invertibility of the patch, by separating the patch into rational Bezier spline surfaces and check that their Jacobian determinant is larger than 0. This strategy allows a large range of different face types, including faces with holes and faces with more or less than four boundary curves. The back-projection method is analogous, and also requires the creation of the reparameterization surfaces. This algorithm is implemented in a C++ based library, which utilizes the CAD functionality of the Open CASCADE framework. The library is designed to be used on computing clusters by providing functions for the serialization and deserialization of the geometry. This enables the parallelized projection and back-projection of large computation meshes with millions of points to reduce the computational runtime. Since this algorithm only works for small geometry changes - i. e. for geometries with the same topology - we also added functions to compare and store the topology of two CAD objects. Our method is currently used within a DLR-internal project to enable a large scale gradient based optimization of an aircraft.
