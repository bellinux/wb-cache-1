25|$|Pasteur {{publicly}} {{claimed his}} success in developing the <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccine</b> in 1881. However, his admirer-turned-rival Toussaint {{was the one who}} developed the first vaccine. Toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named Pasteurella in honour of Pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works. On July 12, 1880, Toussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep. Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881. Pasteur gave a misleading account of the preparation of the <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccine</b> used in the experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort. He used potassium dichromate to prepare the vaccine. The promotional experiment was a success and helped Pasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.|$|E

25|$|The anthrax attacks, {{as well as}} the September 11, 2001 attacks, have spurred {{significant}} increases in U.S. government funding for biological warfare research and preparedness. For example, biowarfare-related funding at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) increased by $1.5billion in 2003. In 2004, Congress passed the Project Bioshield Act, which provides $5.6billion over ten years for the purchase of new vaccines and drugs. These vaccines included the monoclonal antibody Raxibacumab, which treats anthrax as well as an <b>Anthrax</b> <b>Vaccine</b> Adsorbed, both of which are stockpiled by the US government.|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{asserted}} that Ivins stood {{to profit from}} the attacks because he was a co-inventor on two patents for a genetically-engineered <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccine.</b> San Francisco-area biotechnology company VaxGen licensed the vaccine and won a federal contract valued at $877.5 million to provide the vaccine under the Project Bioshield Act. However, biological warfare and <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccine</b> expert Dr. Meryl Nass has expressed skepticism of this purported motive, pointing out that [...] "Historically, government employees do not receive these royalties: the government does." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 6, 2008, US Attorney Jeffrey A. Taylor, officially made a {{statement}} that Ivins was the [...] "sole culprit" [...] in the 2001 anthrax attacks. Taylor stated that Ivins had submitted false anthrax evidence to throw investigators off of his trail, was unable to adequately explain his late laboratory working hours {{around the time of}} the attacks, tried to frame his co-workers, had immunized himself against anthrax in early September 2001, was one of more than 100 people with access to the same strain of anthrax used in the killings, and had used similar language in an email to that in one of the anthrax mailings. Ivins was also reportedly upset that the <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccine</b> that he had spent years helping develop was being pulled from the market.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} the 1800s that humans began to {{recognize}} the existence and role of germs and microbes in relation to disease. [...] Although many thinkers had ideas about germs, it {{was not until}} Louis Pasteur spread his theory about germs, and the need for washing hands and maintaining sanitation (particularly in medical practice), that anyone listened. [...] Many people were quite skeptical, but on May 22, 1881 Pasteur persuasively demonstrated the validity of his germ theory of disease with an early example of vaccination. The <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccine</b> was administered to 25 sheep while another 25 were used as a control. On May 31, 1881 all of the sheep were exposed to anthrax. [...] While every sheep in the control group died, each of the vaccinated sheep survived. Pasteur’s experiment would become a milestone in disease prevention. [...] His findings, in conjunction with other vaccines that followed, changed the way globalization affected the world.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anthrax</b> <b>vaccines</b> were {{developed}} in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and available for use in humans by 1940. A live attenuated, unencapsulated spore vaccine became widely used for humans. It was given either by scarification or subcutaneously and its developers claimed that it was reasonably well tolerated and showed some degree of protective efficacy against cutaneous anthrax in clinical field trials. The efficacy of the live Russian vaccine {{was reported to have}} been greater than that of either of the killed British or US <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccines</b> (AVP and AVA, respectively) during the 1970s and '80s. Today both Russia and China use live attenuated strains for their human vaccines. These vaccines may be given by aerosol, scarification, or subcutaneous injection. A Georgian/Russian live <b>anthrax</b> spore <b>vaccine</b> (called STI) was based on spores from the Sterne strain of B. anthracis. It was given in a two-dose schedule, but serious side-effects restricted its use to healthy adults. It was reportedly manufactured at the George Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology in Tbilisi, Georgia, until 1991.|$|R

40|$|The {{intentional}} use of Bacillus anthracis, the etiological {{agent of}} anthrax, as a bioterrorist weapon in late 2001 made our society {{acutely aware of}} the importance of developing, testing, and stockpiling adequate countermeasures against biological attacks. Biodefense vaccines are an important component of our arsenal to be used during a biological attack. However, most of the agents considered significant threats either have been eradicated or rarely infect humans alive today. As such, vaccine efficacy cannot be determined in human clinical trials but must be extrapolated from experimental animal models. This article reviews the efficacy and immunogenicity of human <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccines</b> in well-defined animal models and the progress toward developing a rugged immunologic correlate of protection.

50|$|<b>Vaccines</b> against <b>anthrax</b> {{for use in}} {{livestock}} and humans have had a prominent place {{in the history of}} medicine. The French scientist Louis Pasteur developed the first effective vaccine in 1881.

40|$|Different {{types of}} anthrax toxin {{neutralization}} assays have been utilized {{to measure the}} antibody levels elicited by <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccines</b> in both nonclinical and clinical studies. In the present study, we sought to determine whether three commonly used toxin neutralization assays—J 774 A. 1 cell-, RAW 264. 7 cell-, and CHO cell-based assays—yield comparable estimates of neutralization activities for sera obtained after vaccination with <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccines</b> composed of recombinant protective antigen (rPA). In order to compare the assays, sera were assayed alongside a common reference serum sample and the neutralization titers were expressed relative to the titer for the reference sample in each assay. Analysis of sera from rabbits immunized with multiple doses of the rPA vaccine showed that for later bleeds, the quantitative agreement between the assays was good; however, for early bleeds, some heterogeneity in relative neutralization estimates was observed. Analysis of serum samples from rabbits, nonhuman primates, and humans immunized with the rPA vaccine showed that the relative neutralization estimates obtained in the different assays agreed to various extents, depending on the species of origin of the sera examined. We identified differences in the magnitudes of the Fc receptor-mediated neutralization associated with the J 774 A. 1 cell- and RAW 264. 7 cell-based assays, which may account {{for some of the}} species dependence of the assays. The differences in the relative neutralization estimates among the assays were relatively small and were always less than 2. 5 -fold. However, because toxin neutralization assays will likely be used to establish the efficacies of new <b>anthrax</b> <b>vaccines,</b> our findings should be considered when assay outputs are interpreted...|$|R
