40|$|Graduation date: 1979 <b>Allowable</b> <b>stresses</b> in {{compression}} {{perpendicular to the}} grain (C-perp) have been too conservative for most structural uses.

Specimens with ring angle of about 45 degrees were the weakest. Stresses for large specimens and small specimens with 45 -degree ring angle were remarkably similar.
