40|$|AbstractIn recent years, the U. S. {{has been}} {{experiencing}} {{a shift in}} technical and professional education. Industry, education and government stakeholders are redefining their partnerships and working together to create competency-based, industry-driven education at the local, state, and national levels. These form the fundamental principles of a paradigm shift in education needed to combine and enhance innovative educational approaches from different research fields, as well as best-practice models from other countries. This paradigm shift presents a challenge, as education and public sectors are typically not familiar with matured (project) management principles, and often follow the “Garbage Can- Model”(Cohen, 1964), while, simultaneously, industry experts lack experience and knowledge about the academic and public world. But both have to answer questions like: How can PM measure progress in an educational project? Which PM methods are most/least helpful? Using a case study approach to the research, this paper will analyze several highly visible and innovative stakeholder partnerships that are breaking traditional curriculum and assessment models. Using industry subject matter experts, both the Michigan <b>Advanced</b> <b>Technician</b> Training (MAT 2) program have developed a competency- based curriculum that incorporates a sophisticated methodology of assessments using the industry-driven DACUM approach as the foundation. The new model requires a sophisticated methodology for tracking learning analytics including performance, completion rates, and learning gaps. This paper will propose a solution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcross the United States, industry, {{education}} and government stakeholders are redefining their partnerships {{in order to}} address and reduce critical skill gaps in the current workforce. This represents a paradigm shift in technical and professional education, as well as the collaborative processes utilized in creating and maintaining complex multi-stakeholder talent development systems. In doing so, however, this paradigm shift also presents a huge challenge: {{education and}} public sectors are typically not familiar with matured product development and (project) management principles and often do not apply proven industry practices to the definition, design, delivery and improvement of their educational products. The evaluation, acceptance and ultimate implementation of those principles departs from the traditional (United States) culture of education, as it applies new instructional design processes, change implementation processes, and feedback/assessment models. Therefore, critical review of such methods, innovative development of transfer options and human factors management in successfully achieving the required systems change were identified, and include explanation, understanding, acceptance, personal development, and trust. Using a case study approach, this paper will analyze several highly visible and innovative adaptations of industry and educational standards which were accepted and released by all relevant stakeholders. By leveraging subject matter experts from both the industry and academic settings, Michigan <b>Advanced</b> <b>Technician</b> Training (MAT 2) formed organizational and working teams comprised of the primary government, industry, and academic stakeholder groups and established a workable context for a knowledge transfer of best practice industry standards. Said standards were applied bi-directionally by academic providers and partnering manufacturing enterprises, and now serve as best practice examples for post-secondary systems of apprenticeship education...|$|E

Here we present the design of a domain-independent training system based on simulation environments, capable to be reused in different domains and especially in the industrial ones, saving costs considerably. The main idea behind the system design is the separation between the domain logic and the trainer role. This distinction is achieved by the adoption of a modular and flexible agent-based system approach.

40|$|International audienceThe French {{education}} system remains highly centralized and only allows limited local adaptations for overseas territories. For example, if some laws (the last in 2013) allow {{the use of}} regional languages (e. g. Creole in the French West Indies) when they constitute a relevant contribution to the teaching, many official texts remain mainly based on the geographical, economical, historical, environment of the French mainland. We focus on some French BTS (Brevet de Technicien Supérieur / <b>Advanced</b> <b>Technician</b> Certificate), namely tourism and assistant manager, which are two important diplomas for the local development and in which microeconomic and management sciences plays a great part. The French BTS is a professional diploma prepared in {{two years after the}} “baccalauréat”, with national programs and evaluation criteria. The successful candidates are supposed to be immediately employable, especially in their local geographical environment. Thus, there exists a paradox between the national definition of the diploma and the local contexts of teaching. We discuss how teachers concretely deal with this situation on a day-to-day basis. Our hypothesis is that they act pragmatically, using their practical pedagogical content knowledge, without theoretical support for their action. In order to verify this hypothesis, we have conducted semi-structured interview with Guadeloupian teachers of the two aforementioned BTS. The main results shows that teachers adapt the national framework of the diploma, essentially by using local examples. This can be called a weak contextualization of the national texts. Indeed, these adaptations remain limited by fear of disadvantaging the students for the national exam. In addition, many context effects are shown, for example linked with local rules (concerning VAT, custom duties [...] .) which are only partially taken into account by teachers. This demonstrates that the French educative system has not yet completely solved the opposition between national guideline and decentralization of the educational action...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{focus on}} some French BTS (Brevet de Technicien Supérieur / <b>Advanced</b> <b>Technician</b> Certificate), namely tourism and {{assistant}} manager, which are two important diplomas {{for the local}} development and in which microeconomic and management sciences plays a great part. The French BTS is a short Vocational Diploma prepared in {{two years after the}} “baccalauréat”, with national programs and evaluation criteria. The successful candidates are supposed to be immediately employable, especially in their local geographical environment. Thus, there exists a paradox between the national definition of the diploma and the local contexts of teaching and (supposed) professional integration. However, the professional traineeship plays a great part in this diploma. For this reason, it seems interesting to investigate how the conception of students evolve, with respect to the aforementioned paradox, during and after professional traineeship. For this purpose, questionnaire surveys have been carried out at various moment of the scholar during two years (two cohorts). The main results can be summarized as follows. The professional traineeship is positively perceived by the students {{at the beginning of the}} training. They consider it as very important for the development of professional skills. Over time, this positive representation progresses homogeneously. The students are convinced ofthe efficiency of professional traineeship: their professional project strengthened but, they also realize that their professional future will not necessarily be in Guadeloupe. This is probably linked with a better representation of the economic situation of Guadeloupe and shows, as excepted, that the context of the professional traineeship modifies the representation of students. For the BTS assistant manager, we specially note a degradation of the representation of the profession of assistant manager, whereas this training’s choice was realized with conviction...|$|E

5000|$|Since the 1950s the UK high {{technology}} industry (Aerospace, Nuclear, Oil & Gas, Automotive, Telecommunications, Power Generation and Distribution etc.) trained its higher technicians and professional engineers via the traditional indentured apprenticeship system of learning - usually a 4 - 6-year process from age 16-21. There were 4 types of traditional apprenticeship; craft, technician, higher technician, and graduate. Craft, technician and higher technician apprenticeships usually took 4 to 5 years while a graduate apprenticeship was a short 2-year experience usually while at university or post graduate experience. Non graduate technician apprenticeships were {{often referred to as}} technical apprenticeships. The traditional Apprenticeship Framework in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was designed to allow young people (16 years old) an alternative path to GCE A Levels to achieve both an academic qualification at level 4 or 5 NVQ along with competency based skills for knowledge work. Often referred to as the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of work and employment for bright young people, the traditional technical apprenticeship framework was open to young people who had a minimum of 4 GCE [...] "O" [...] Levels to enroll in an Ordinary National Certificate or Diploma or a City & Guilds engineering technician course. Apprentices could progress to the Higher National Certificate, Higher National Diploma or advanced City and Guilds course such as Full Technological Certification. Apprenticeship positions at elite companies often had hundreds of applications for a placement. Academic learning during an apprenticeship was achieved either via block release or day release at a local technical institute. An OND or HND were usually obtained via the block release approach whereby an apprentice would be released for periods of up to 3 months to study academic courses full-time and then return to the employer for applied work experience.For entrance into the higher technical engineering apprenticeships [...] "O"Levels had to include Mathematics, Physics, and English language. The academic level of subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry on ONC / OND and some City & Guilds <b>advanced</b> <b>technicians</b> courses was equivalent to A level mathematics, physics and chemistry. The academic science subjects were based on applied science in subjects such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, mechanics of machines, dynamics and statics, electrical science and electronics. These are {{often referred to as the}} engineering sciences. HNC and HND were broadly equivalent to subjects in the first year of a bachelor's degree in engineering but not studied to the same intensity or mathematical depth. HNC was accepted as entrance into the first year of an engineering degree and high performance on an HND course could allow a student direct entry into the second year of a degree. Few apprentices followed this path since it would have meant 10 -12 years in further and higher education. For the few that did follow this path they accomplished a solid foundation of competency-based work training via apprenticeship and attained a higher academic qualification at a university or Polytechnic combining both forms of education; vocational plus academic. During the 1970s City and Guilds assumed responsibility for the administration of HNC and HND courses.|$|R
50|$|Intermediate Life Support (ILS) is a {{level of}} {{training}} undertaken {{in order to provide}} emergency medical care outside medical facilities. ILS is classed as mid-level emergency medical care provided by trained first responders who receive more training then Basic First Responders and First-aid providers. ILS contains skills and protocols from Advanced Life Support. In the US, the level of training is comparable with Emergency medical technician - intermediate (EMT-I) or <b>Advance</b> Emergency Medical <b>Technicians.</b> Intermediate Life Support was first used in the USA in 1985, and is now used around the world. It can be run as a separate course for non-professionals, or as part of Advanced Life Support for people in the medical field. ILS is mostly used by non-professional first responders, but the training is suitable for doctors, medical students, nurses, nursing students, midwives, healthcare providers such as physiotherapists, dentist and ambulance technicians.
