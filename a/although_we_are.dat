5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E

25|$|This is {{especially}} noticeable {{in the temple}} reliefs in Medinat Habu that show the great attempted invasion of Egypt by the Sea Peoples. This relief shows us the Egyptian small yet maneuverable ships fighting against the larger yet slower ships of the Sea People. It portrays the ships as platforms from which archers and slingers can pepper down the enemy from. Having such fast and maneuverable ships enabled the Egyptians to constantly harass the enemy at a range {{while at the same}} time withdraw to safety and attack from a different side. At this stage, this purpose existed mostly in the New Kingdom era, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> led to believe that it was used during the Second Intermediate Period during the siege of Avaris by Ahmose.|$|E

[...] The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles. However the Prince of Wales has no constitutional role in modern Wales.

2500|$|<b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{faced with}} a very {{convoluted}} narrative, García Márquez is able to define clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as third-person narrators, specific point of view narrators, and streams of consciousness. [...] Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, {{with the idea of}} the montage and the close-up, which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic. Furthermore, political and historical realities are combined with the mythical and magical Latin American world. Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled. [...] This is all presented through García Márquez's unique form of narration, which causes the novel to never cease being at its most interesting point.|$|E

On this basis, Stout states that there are 45,119 ringforts in Ireland of which 41% have been positively identified as of March 1995. [...] The mean density for Ireland as a whole is 0.55 per square kilometre. The density goes from below 0.20 per square kilometre in Donegal, Kildare and Dublin to above 1.0 per square kilometre in Roscommon, Limerick and Sligo. The regions of highest density are north Munster, east Connaught/ northwest Leinster and east Ulster. Areas of low density are in northwest Ulster and most of Leinster.|$|E

However, at the same time, they were also keen to try out new things; [...] "There's a lot left to explore in the Myth franchise even before we go in a somewhat different route. <b>Although,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> taking a [...] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now."

2500|$|On 13 May 1938, {{while riding}} his {{motorcycle}} {{down the streets}} of Tokyo, a very intoxicated Sorge clashed into a wall and was badly injured. As Sorge was carrying around notes {{given to him by}} Ozaki at the time, had the police discovered the documents his cover would have been blown, but a member of his spy ring was able to get the hospital to remove the documents before the police arrived. In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan was due to over-zealous officers in the Kwantung Army and there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war with the Soviet Union. Unaware that Berzin had been shot as a [...] "Trotskyite" [...] in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938 reading: [...] "Dear Comrade!

2500|$|In {{regards to}} {{religious}} freedom, Luciani {{wrote about the}} council's declaration, [...] "Dignitatis humanae". In his writings, {{he said that there}} is only one true religion that must be followed and no other, affirming that Jesus Christ is the Truth, and that the truth will set one truly free. Though, he said that those that will not accept the one true Catholic Faith, for whatever reason, are indeed free to profess their own religion for various reasons. He makes a clear understanding of true and false liberty. He says that true freedom comes from God, that God makes man free. However, he does continue in repeating the teaching that error does not come from God, and <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> capable or err and sin, and that one who rejects truth cannot be forced to believe it, it is not a God given right to do error. He continues to say that religious freedom must be freely exercised by the individual. He writes that the choice of religion must be a free choice or else one's faith is not real or because they really believe. So he makes clear that for the purposes of keeping peace and order in a diverse society and accepting the free will of man, the freedom of an individual to profess their religion, within certain bounds, is indeed necessary.|$|E

2500|$|However, Vertov's two credos, {{often used}} interchangeably, {{are in fact}} distinct, as Yuri Tsivian points out in the {{commentary}} track on the DVD for Man with the Movie Camera: for Vertov, [...] "life as it is" [...] means to record life {{as it would be}} without the camera present. [...] "Life caught unawares" [...] means to record life when surprised, and perhaps provoked, by the presence of a camera. This explanation contradicts the common assumption that for Vertov [...] "life caught unawares" [...] meant [...] "life caught unaware of the camera." [...] All of these shots might conform to Vertov's credo [...] "caught unawares." [...] His slow motion, fast motion, and other camera techniques were a way to dissect the image, Mikhail Kaufman stated in an interview. It was to be the honest truth of perception. For example, in Man with a Movie Camera, two trains are shown almost melting into each other, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> taught to see trains as not riding that close, Vertov tried to portray the actual sight of two passing trains. Mikhail spoke about Eisenstein's films as being different from his and his brother's in that Eisenstein, [...] "came from the theatre, in the theatre one directs dramas, one strings beads." [...] "We all felt...that through documentary film we could develop a new kind of art. Not only documentary art, or the art of chronicle, but rather an art based on images, the creation of an image-oriented journalism" [...] Mikhail explained. More than even film truth, Man with a Movie Camera, {{was supposed to be a}} way to make those in the Soviet Union more efficient in their actions. He slowed down his actions, such as the decision whether to jump or not, you can see the decision in his face, a psychological dissection for the audience. He wanted a peace between the actions of man and the actions of a machine, for them to be, in a sense, one.|$|E
