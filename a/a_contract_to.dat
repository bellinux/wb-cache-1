5|$|This decree allowed {{someone who}} {{purchased}} <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> void {{the contract with}} a payment of only 3.5 percent of the contract price (or about 1/30 the contract).

If the price rose above 100 guilders, the speculator would pocket the difference as profit. If the price remained low, the speculator could void the contract for only 3½ guilders. Thus, a contract nominally for 100 guilders, would actually cost an investor no more than 3½ guilders.
