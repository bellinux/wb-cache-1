500|$|Stone Temple Pilots {{stressed}} {{that a new}} album would be recorded as long as both parties in the lawsuit acted in good faith, but in November 2008, Weiland would comment, [...] "I was told, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> for years, that we were free from Atlantic.... I {{have no interest in}} making a record for a major label." [...] Weiland expressed interest in exploring distribution options after the band's reformation. Commenting on his idea, he said, [...] "ther bands, they make more money doing things in an unconventional fashion as opposed to doing it... with the major labels." [...] Dean was curious about Weiland's idea but was aware that the band was contractually obligated to release two more albums. Increasing the uncertainty in the future of a new album, Weiland added, [...] "I'm proud of everything we've written. But to make another record would mean another couple of years of my life dedicated to that, and I just don't know if that's where I see myself going." ...|$|E
500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was {{a knock at the door}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E

2500|$|David Attenborough, who {{attended}} {{university in the}} second half of the 1940s, recounted an incident illustrating its lack of acceptance then: [...] "I once asked one of my lecturers why he was not talking to us about continental drift <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told,</b> sneeringly, that if I could prove there was a force that could move continents, then he might think about it. The idea was moonshine, I was informed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antwon Tanner portrays Antwon [...] "Skills" [...] Taylor, one of Lucas' oldest {{friends and}} another of those who played at the Rivercourt as children. Tanner said that at first he had thought Skills would become an {{important}} character, but later had come to doubt it. [...] "My character was originally on the thing as recurring, possible series regular, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that once we got picked up my character would become a series regular", he said. [...] "Then when I didn't and the show went in a different direction, I was kind of like, 'Uh-oh.' I didn't think the fans took to him at first, so I thought maybe that's why the studio did it like that. But now he's doing his thing, so I ain't mad at it. They need to write me in more!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2002, a {{representative}} of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former Central Intelligence Agency Counterterrorism Department head Vincent Cannistraro stating that Saddam [...] "knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he {{had weapons of mass destruction}} (WMDs)." [...] Cannistraro further added that [...] "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to stand aside and they would handle it." [...] Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all [...] "killed" [...] by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Saddam to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, 2007, Plame {{testified before}} the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's {{reference}} to her in his column. Plame told the committee [...] "I found out {{very early in the}} morning when my husband came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'.... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told,</b> don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E
2500|$|King {{received}} {{encouragement to}} pursue a career in music from his music teacher at middle school, but was asked to leave Cowes High School at the age of 17, when he turned up at school wearing denim jeans. King recalls in a magazine interview [...] "It didn't go down very well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> my schooling had run its course." [...] King then left home and stayed at a friend's house for two weeks, sleeping on the floor, before getting a job on a production line at a Ronson lighter factory. After quitting this job, King became a milkman, but he was still determined to [...] "prove he was not a failure". So, at the age of 19, King moved to London, along with his milk van, in hope of finding a career in music. He played drums for the band Re-Flex in their early years, before starting his later career as a bass player.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{members of}} the cast {{described}} Hustle's filming schedule as incredibly hectic. Vaughn said that [...] " [...] was offered to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> {{to get on a}} plane an hour after I got the phone call and start shooting the following day." [...] Speaking in 2009 after filming four series of the show, Lester explained that [...] "when we start shooting Hustle we film two episodes concurrently, with the scenes out of sequence. Knowing where you are in the intricate plots at any one moment is... challenging". Murray, by contrast, claimed that the hardest scene to film was from the fourth episode, when Danny loses spectacularly to Stacie in strip poker and ends up entirely naked. [...] "It was the toughest scene for me of the entire six months we spent filming the series... Stacie is supposed to be calm, cool and collected... she looks down, checks him out and casually and suavely makes a comment. I kept looking down, dissolving into fits of laughter and was almost unable to deliver my line. So all you'll see is me laughing".|$|E

2500|$|And in {{the same}} year, Gibb was seen around town with a Hungarian singer Sarolta Zalatnay, but he later insisted: [...] "I'm not a Casanova and it's all most unfortunate. I've never been publicised to be available. Because of the stories of my affairs with Lulu and Sarolta, the fans feel, 'Oh, we won't bother about Maurice because he's always got a steady girl'. Gibb {{recalled}} the first meeting with his future-in-laws, [...] "I went up to Glasgow to meet Lu's parents, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that Billy, who is younger than Lu, {{would be at the}} station to meet me. I got off the train and was walking along the platform when I saw him. I didn't need to speak, I knew it was Billy and I went up to him and said, 'You're Billy, aren't you?', he said, 'You must be Maurice' and we had met". The couple married on 18 February 1969 and divorced in 1973. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced, childless, in 1973. [...] Gibb later stated they both drank: [...] "We didn't have any responsibilities, we'd just party." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{is believed to}} have initiated a phenomenon referred to as [...] "The Scully Effect"; as the medical doctor and the FBI Special Agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine and law enforcement, and as a result brought a perceptible {{increase in the number of}} women in those fields. At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Anderson noted that she has long been aware of [...] "The Scully Effect" [...] and stated: [...] "We got a lot of letters all the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> quite frequently by girls who were going into the medical world or the science world or the FBI world or other worlds that I reigned, that they were pursuing those pursuits because of the character of Scully. And I said, 'Yay!'" [...] Anne Simon, a biology professor and a science adviser for the series recalls: [...] "I asked my Intro Bio class back then how many of them were influenced by the character of Scully on The X-Files to go into science and half of the hands in the room went up. That's huge! That was saying that the show was really having an effect." [...] "The Scully Effect" [...] remains a subject of academic inquiry.|$|E
