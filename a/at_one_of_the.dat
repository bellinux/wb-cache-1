5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks.

Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E
