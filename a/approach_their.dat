5|$|Silver half dimes {{had been}} struck {{from the early days}} of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, the Mint successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. When the Mint proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be heavier than the Mint had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI {{replaced}} the 3rd Battalion in April as CANBAT 1. The {{commander of the}} 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Calvin, instructed his troops to <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> tasks differently than the 3rd Battalion had. Calvin (unlike his predecessor) {{did not want the}} RSK forces or the HV to be aware of CANBAT 1 operations, ordering the battalion to observe radio silence. According to Canadian journalist Carol Off, Calvin was eager to fight and instructed his troops to return fire if necessary. The situation in Sector West deteriorated when Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March. A major contribution to the deterioration was Shabshough's minimal involvement with local authorities, in contrast to Zabala's cooperative approach.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Yanshi (偃師之戰) {{was fought}} on 5–6 October 618 between {{the armies of}} Wang Shichong and Li Mi, rival contenders for the {{succession}} of the Sui Dynasty. Wang, who was still ostensibly a Sui loyalist and had been blockaded in Luoyang for months by Li Mi, gambled on a decisive battle and led his troops out to attack the besieging army. Li assembled his forces on a naturally defensible position north of Yanshi town, but Wang managed to surprise Li's forces and <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> camp before they could react. Aided by a secondary cavalry attack from the rear, Wang secured a decisive victory over Li's forces. Although Li managed to escape with part of his army, his authority was shattered, and his followers joined Wang. While Li Mi sought refuge in the rival Tang court, Wang consolidated his control over Henan and eventually deposed the Sui puppet ruler Yang Tong and declared himself as Emperor of the new Zheng dynasty. Wang's power lasted until his surrender to the Tang prince Li Shimin in 621.|$|E

5|$|To {{insulate}} {{the sacred}} {{power in the}} sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels near {{the back of the}} temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine, the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> gods.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{has shown}} that jurors {{typically}} take their roles very seriously. According to Simon (1980), jurors <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> responsibilities as decision makers much {{in the same way}} as a court judge – with great seriousness, a lawful mind, and a concern for consistency that is evidence-based. By actively processing evidence, making inferences, using common sense and personal experiences to inform their decision-making, research has indicated that jurors are effective decision makers that seek thorough understanding, rather than passive, apathetic participants unfit to serve on a jury.|$|E
25|$|Some copepods have {{extremely}} fast escape responses when {{a predator}} is sensed, and can jump with high speed {{over a few}} millimetres. Many species have neurons surrounded by myelin (for increased conduction speed), which is very rare among invertebrates (other examples are some annelids and malacostracan crustaceans like palaemonid shrimp and penaeids). Even rarer, the myelin is highly organized, resembling the well-organized wrapping found in vertebrates (Gnathostomata). Despite their fast escape response, copepods are successfully hunted by slow-swimming seahorses, which <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> prey so gradually, it senses no turbulence, then suck the copepod into their snout too suddenly for the copepod to escape.|$|E

25|$|Ethene, however, has no {{permanent}} dipole. The attractive forces between polyethylene chains arise from weak van der Waals forces. Molecules {{can be thought}} of as being surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons. As two polymer chains <b>approach,</b> <b>their</b> electron clouds repel one another. This has the effect of lowering the electron density on one side of a polymer chain, creating a slight positive dipole on this side. This charge is enough to attract the second polymer chain. Van der Waals forces are quite weak, however, so polyethylene can have a lower melting temperature compared to other polymers.|$|E
25|$|As these spiders live in {{constant}} proximity to humans, {{they are not}} usually aggressive and will even let a human hand <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> web. Like any other spider, however, {{they are afraid of}} bigger foes, and, in most cases, will retreat behind an obstacle (such as a dried leaf or prey remains) upon perceiving more than usual disturbance to their web. Further disturbance may lead to the spider dropping down on a thread, then running away from the web. If the distance is not considerable, it will usually return to its web within a couple of days. Otherwise, it will start a new one.|$|E
25|$|In Fleming's novels, many Bond {{girls have}} some sort of {{independent}} job or even career, often one that was considered inappropriate for women in the 1950s. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, and Mary Goodnight are in intelligence or law-enforcement work. Those who are criminals, such as Tiffany Case and Pussy Galore, tend to be similarly independent-minded in how they <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> work—the latter even running her own syndicate. Even those Bond girls who have more conventional or glamorous jobs show themselves to be invested in having an independent outlook on life. While the Bond girls are clearly intended as sex objects, they are nevertheless portrayed in the novels as having a high degree of independence; this is also frequently (but not always) the case in the films, especially from 1981 onward.|$|E

25|$|Females usually {{give birth}} to a single infant, {{although}} twins do occur. Most births occur during the night. Infants are born with thin, dark brown or black hair and pale skin. Infants spend their first week attach themselves to their mothers' chests and mostly just suckle or sleep. They do not move much in terms of locomotion for {{the first two weeks of}} their life. As they <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> sixth week of life, infants vocalize more. They use squeaks and shrieks to communicate stress. In the following months, the infants are capable of quadrupedal locomotion and can walk, run and jump by the second and third months. Alloparenting occurs among langurs, starting when the infants reach two years of age. The infant will be given to the other females of the group. However, if the mother dies, the infant usually follows. Langurs are weaned by 13 months.|$|E
500|$|Described {{as one of}} Australia's most {{accomplished}} songbirds, the Australian magpie has an array of complex vocalisations. It is omnivorous, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of invertebrates. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and New Guinea. This species is commonly fed by households around the country, but in spring {{a small minority of}} breeding magpies (almost always males) become aggressive and swoop and attack those who <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> nests.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most French {{armies of}} the Revolutionary period, Moreau's troops in late 1800 enjoyed a well-organized supply service. Though {{the onset of}} winter {{lengthened}} the army sick list, the months-long truce allowed many units to <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> full strength. Many French officers were confident of success. [...] Moreau planned a broad-front advance eastward to the Inn, fighting any enemies as he found them. He would lead with his left to allow Lecourbe's Right Wing to advance unmolested, since it had a greater distance to cover. Once the French wings closed up to the Inn River, his troops would look for crossing sites.|$|E

500|$|Anderson {{praised the}} book for [...] " [...] young adult readers to imaginatively <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> own {{encounters}} with religious difference." [...] According to her, Voices {{is part of a}} trend within children's writing of drawing on a variety of religious traditions, and of emphasizing reconciliation, rather than defeat and victory. She compared the story to Guardian of the Dead by Karen Healey, Uprooted by Naomi Novik, and the Daughter of Smoke and Bone trilogy by Laini Taylor, and asserted that Voices separated children's literature from specifically Christian imagery, in contrast to Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, which critiqued Christianity, or J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, which included conservative Christian notions of heroic sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|... "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] {{was written}} by Katie Dippold and {{directed}} by Michael Trim. It is referred to simply as [...] "Fancy Party" [...] in some publications. During a break between {{the development of the}} first six episodes of the season and the remaining episodes, the writing staff was contemplating what direction they should take with the romantic relationship between Andy and April. Parks co-creator Michael Schur said they wanted to avoid the [...] "standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on". They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: [...] "We just thought about who they were [...] two impulsive goofballs who don’t <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> lives in a responsible, adult manner [...] and decided, what the hell? What if they just make a rash decision and get hitched?" ...|$|E
500|$|Voices {{examines}} {{the cultural and}} religious strife between the monotheistic beliefs of the Alds and the polytheistic practices {{of the citizens of}} Ansul. Described as a [...] "plea for cultural relativity", the novel also juxtaposes violent and non-violent means of ending a conflict. As with the other stories of Annals of the Western Shore, Voices examines enslavement and the treatment of women, and the theme of justice. The story traces Memer's coming of age, and the power of words, stories, and writing is a recurring theme. The book received acclaim from critics, who praised its nuanced portrayal of religion and cultural conflict, the characterization of Memer, and Le Guin's writing and detailed world building. Multiple reviewers compared it to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, also prominently featuring the destruction of books. Voices was a finalist for a Locus Award in 2007. Scholar Elizabeth Anderson wrote that the book [...] " [...] young adult readers to imaginatively <b>approach</b> <b>their</b> own encounters with religious difference." ...|$|E
