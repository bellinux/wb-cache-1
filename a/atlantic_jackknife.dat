When a Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula) is laid {{on the surface of}} the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds [...] and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>jackknife</b> clam, Ensis directus, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the flapping valves in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>jackknife</b> clam is {{now also}} found in northwestern Europe, where it is {{regarded}} as a harmful exotic species. It was first recorded in Europe in 1978/79, in the Elbe estuary.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>jackknife</b> clam has {{inspired}} {{a kind of}} biomimetic anchor in development by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, adapting the clam's digging method for use in keeping undersea cables and potentially watercraft anchored securely.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>{{jackknife}}</b> clam, Ensis directus, {{also known}} as the bamboo clam, American jackknife clam or razor clam (but note that [...] "razor clam" [...] sometimes refers to different species), is a large species of edible marine bivalve mollusc, found on the North American Atlantic coast, from Canada to South Carolina. It has also been introduced to Europe.|$|E
50|$|Ensis species live {{in clean}} sand on exposed beaches. They {{are capable of}} digging very rapidly; see the {{description}} under the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>jackknife</b> clam. Some clammers catch jackknives by pouring salt on the characteristic keyhole-shaped breathing holes. The clam then tries to escape the salt by coming up out of its hole, {{and at this point}} it is possible to gently grab the shell and pull it out of the ground.|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} an {{elongated}} oblong narrow shell, which ranges from 3 to 6 in in length {{in the southern}} portion of its range, with individuals up to 11 in found in Alaska. It {{is similar to the}} smaller Atlantic razor clam, Siliqua costata, which is found on the East Coast of the United States. Another eastern species in the same family is sometimes also called a razor clam: Ensis directus, but this is in a different genus, is not very similar, and is also known as the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>jackknife</b> clam.|$|E

50|$|At {{low tide}} the {{position}} of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>jackknife</b> clam is revealed by a keyhole-shaped opening in the sand; when the clam is disturbed, a small jet of water squirts from this opening as the clam starts to dig. This species' remarkable speed in digging can easily outstrip a human digger, making the clam difficult to catch. Thus the species is not often commercially fished, even though it is widely regarded as a delicacy: in coastal Massachusetts, they are sought after in the summer by locals to make home cooked clam strips and most towns insist upon regulations dictating how many can be taken at a time. The easiest way to catch jackknives is to pour salt on the characteristic breathing holes. The clam will try to escape the salt by coming up out of its hole, at which point you can gently grab the shell and pull it out of the ground.|$|E
50|$|Leptasterias polaris {{is a major}} {{predator}} in {{the cold}} waters in which it lives. Young individuals are mostly found on rocks less than 10 m deep and feed on such bivalve molluscs as the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and Hiatella arctica. Older individuals move to deeper waters where the seabed is sand or mud and feed on clams such as the Greenland cockle (Serripes groenlandicus), Spisula polynyma, the blunt gaper (Mya truncata) and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>jackknife</b> clam (Ensis directus) which they dig up with their tube feet. They also eat gastropod molluscs such as the common whelk (Buccinum undatum) and the American pelicanfoot (Arrhoges occidentalis). In a laboratory study {{it was found that}} the starfish detected their prey by odours in the water. Hungry starfish which had not fed for two months, worked their way across the current until their olfactory tube feet, located near the tips of their arms, smelt an edible prey item after which they begin to travel up-current towards the source of the odour. Moving upstream in this way had the advantage that the prey was less likely to detect the approach of the starfish. Well fed starfish wandered in a more random fashion.|$|E
