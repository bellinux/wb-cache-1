40|$|This book {{provides}} an overview of current research on a variety of topics related to both large-scale and classroom <b>assessment.</b> First, the purposes, traditions and principles of <b>assessment</b> are considered, with particular attention to those common to all levels of <b>assessment</b> and those more connected with either classroom or large-scale <b>assessment.</b> <b>Assessment</b> design based on sound <b>assessment</b> principles is discussed, differentiating between large-scale and classroom <b>assessment,</b> but also examining how the design principles overlap. The focus then shifts to classroom <b>assessment</b> and provides specific examples of <b>assessment</b> strategies, before examining the impact of large-scale <b>assessment</b> on curriculum, policy, instruction, and classroom <b>assessment.</b> The book concludes by discussing the challenges that teachers currently face, as well as ways to support them. The book offers a common language for researchers in <b>assessment,</b> as well as a primer for those interested in understanding current work in the area of <b>assessment.</b> In summary, it provides the opportunity to discuss large-scale and classroom <b>assessment</b> by addressing the following main themes:·Purposes, Traditions and Principles of Assessment·Design of <b>Assessment</b> Tasks·Classroom <b>Assessment</b> in Action·Interactions of Large-Scale and Classroom Assessment·Enhancing Sound <b>Assessment</b> Knowledge and PracticesIt also suggests areas for future research in <b>assessment</b> in mathematics education...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} extent to which accreditation-mandated <b>assessment</b> capacity contributes to <b>assessment</b> use in tertiary foreign language (FL) programs. Four research questions were posed to pursue this concern: What is {{the nature and extent of}} <b>assessment</b> capacity in college FL programs? Which <b>assessment</b> uses are occurring in college FL programs? What is the relationship between <b>assessment</b> capacity and <b>assessment</b> use in college FL programs? What is the relationship between accreditation-mandated <b>assessment</b> capacity and <b>assessment</b> use in college FL programs? Information on <b>assessment</b> activity was collected from 100 FL programs using an online questionnaire. FL educator informants supplied information on how <b>assessment</b> has been used in the program (both <b>assessment</b> findings and processes), as well as information on <b>assessment</b> capacity, including existing institutional <b>assessment</b> support, policies/governance patterns, <b>assessment</b> infrastructures, program-level resources, assessment-related leadership, program ethos, assessment-related collaboration and communication, and additional high-quality assessment-related activities and conditions. Findings suggest that (a) <b>assessment</b> capacity is highly variable in FL education programs, tending toward being more absent than present, though a number of programs have robust capacity; (b) most programs use <b>assessment</b> for meeting accreditation and institutional requirements, though some use <b>assessment</b> toward increased educational understanding, development, and improvement; (c) the types of <b>assessment</b> capacity most likely to result in improvement-oriented <b>assessment</b> uses are <b>assessment</b> communication and collaboration, program ethos, and other high-quality <b>assessment</b> activities/conditions; and (d) capacity types strongly defined by accreditation <b>assessment</b> mandates (i. e., institutional <b>assessment</b> support and policies/governance patterns) do not have a strong relationship with formative <b>assessment</b> use. The study makes three main contributions to research knowledge on outcomes <b>assessment</b> washback in college FL programs. First, there is a better understanding of the general <b>assessment</b> capacity elements (an overall <b>assessment</b> capacity framework) needed for productive <b>assessment</b> uses in FL education. Second, the study sheds light on specific capacity elements ostensibly most able to induce <b>assessment</b> use: namely, those elements associated with internally-driven desires for inquiry and change originating within FL programs. Finally, the study shows that institutionally-driven <b>assessment</b> capacity [...] by itself [...] is largely unable to create the needed conditions and dispositions for transformative <b>assessment</b> use in FL programs...|$|R
40|$|Authentic <b>assessment</b> {{has long}} been an {{interest}} to the researcher. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the practice of authentic <b>assessment</b> and peer <b>assessment</b> in the classroom by comparing project based <b>assessment</b> with traditional <b>assessment</b> models. Quantitative methods were used to collect data. Specifically one class at a middle school was given a project based test and participated in peer <b>assessment</b> reading groups to evaluate the project based test. The same period was then given a traditional test. The students participated in a pre-test survey and a post-test survey. The findings were presented by analyzing the quantitative data generated from the test and the survey. Data analysis showed student preference to authentic <b>assessment,</b> more students believed they retained knowledge following authentic <b>assessment</b> with a peer <b>assessment</b> component, and students performed better using the project based <b>assessment</b> model. Future long term studies tracking student performance utilizing authentic <b>assessment</b> would benefit the research base.

An approach was chosen in which peer <b>assessment</b> was operationalised in <b>assessment</b> assignments and <b>assessment</b> tools that were embedded in the course material. The course concerned a higher education case-based virtual seminar, in which students were asked to conduct research and write a report in small multidisciplinary teams. The <b>assessment</b> assignments contained the discussion of <b>assessment</b> criteria, the <b>assessment</b> of a group report of a fellow group, and writing an <b>assessment</b> report.
