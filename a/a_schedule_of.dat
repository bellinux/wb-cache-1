While at Galveston on 7 November, Texas Governor Oscar Colquitt presented the ship's silver service to Captain Grant. The Young Men's Business League of Waco, Texas, raised the $10,000 to purchase the silver.|$|E

5|$|All the inhabitants, {{including}} {{the young and}} elderly, were subject to <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> alternating work, religious practice, and rest. According to d'Orbigny, {{the inhabitants of the}} Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably more freedom than those in the Mojos missions. There was also less time spent practicing religion. The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans. Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and artisans emerged. This group {{and the rest of the}} population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two alcaldes. Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather. Later, artisans exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> year-to-year model revisions, {{much like}} US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up {{and the whole}} range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E

5|$|From 13 December 1909 to 27 March 1910, Yorktown {{operated}} off Corinto, Nicaragua, {{with the}} Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron. She then pursued <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> exercises and maneuvers, operating between California and British Columbia through June and July. She {{returned to a}} posture of readiness off Corinto and San Juan del Sur between 13 August and 7 September. She then operated off Ecuadorian, Colombian, and Peruvian ports, with the United States Consul General at Large embarked, between 19 September and 16 October before putting into Panama for coal and stores. She subsequently patrolled at Amapala, Honduras, and the familiar Corinto for most of November and December. She spent Christmas at Corinto before shifting to Amapala, en route to San Francisco and Mare Island. From March to July 1911, Yorktown cruised off the west coasts of Mexico, Nicaragua, and Honduras. On 29 May, she rescued the survivors from the foundered Panamanian steamer , which had sunk {{with the loss of}} 60 of its 100 passengers and crew. Another period of repairs and upkeep in the late summer of 1911 proceeded the ship's duties off the Pacific coasts of South and Central America. She returned to Mare Island in May 1912, and was decommissioned there for alterations on 15 July.|$|E

40|$|Staddon and Simmelhag's {{proposal}} that behavior {{is produced by}} “principles of behavioral variation” instead of contingencies of reinforcement was tested in two experiments. In the first experiment pigeons were exposed to either <b>a</b> fixed-interval <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> response-contingent reinforcement, <b>an</b> autoshaping <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> stimulus-contingent reinforcement, or <b>a</b> fixed-time <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> noncontingent reinforcement. Pigeons exposed to contingent reinforcement came to peck more rapidly than those exposed to noncontingent reinforcement. Staddon and Simmelhag's “principles of behavioral variation” included the {{proposal that}} patterns (interim and terminal) were a function of momentary probability of reinforcement. In the second experiment pigeons were exposed to either a fixed-time or <b>a</b> random-time <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> noncontingent reinforcement. Pecking showed a constant frequency of occurrence over postfood time on the random-time schedule. Most behavior showed patterns on the fixed-time schedule that differed in overall shape (i. e., interim versus terminal) from those shown on the random-time schedule. It was concluded that both the momentary probability of reinforcement and postfood time can affect patterning...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSince the Shea, J.

Supposedly, this is the case because <b>a</b> random <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> practice necessitates more elaborate cognitive activities than <b>a</b> blocked <b>schedule</b> before each acquisition trial can be initiated. Our main objective was to determine whether the advantage for learning found for random practice increases {{as a function of the}} number of acquisition trials. During acquisition, the results indicated a general tendency for smaller movement reproduction errors under a blocked rather than <b>a</b> random <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> practice. However, this effect disappeared with larger amount of acquisition trials. In retention, larger errors were observed when acquisition occurred under a blocked rather than <b>a</b> random <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> practice. Finally, the disadvantage for learning observed for the blocked <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> practice disappeared under a block-repeated condition in which each movement pattern was first practiced under <b>a</b> blocked <b>schedule</b> which was then repeated a second time. The results are discussed in terms of the so-called contextual interference effect and indicates some of its limitations...|$|R
