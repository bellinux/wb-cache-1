40|$|Knowing cutting {{forces is}} {{important}} for choosing cutting parameters for milling. Traditionally, cutting forces are calculated by equation which includes empirically measured specific cutting forces. In the article modelling of cutting forces with genetic programming is proposed, which imitates principles of living beings. Measurements have been made for two materials (aluminium alloy AlMgSi 1 and steel 1. 2343) and two different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> (conventional milling and STEP milling). For each material and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> parameters, tensile strength and hardness of workpiece, tool diameter, cutting depth, spindle speed, feeding and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> were monitored, and for each combination <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> parameters cutting forces were measured. On {{the basis of the}} experimental data, different models for cutting forces prediction were obtained by genetic programming. Research shows that genetically developed models fit the experimental data...|$|R

40|$|We analyze how Costa Rican coffee farmer's {{behavior}} in an experimental public good game {{depends on the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mill</b> where the farmers sell their coffee (Cooperative vs. privately owned mills), and on the background of their game partners (partners selling to same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mill</b> or not). We find that cooperative farmers do not display more public good orientation than private market farmers when playing with partners from the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>mill.</b> However, while farmers selling to private mills make no difference {{with respect to the}} background of partners, farmers selling to cooperatives significantly decrease contributions when paired with non-cooperative members. Finally, we study how self-selection into a mechanism that punishes the lowest contributors affects contributions both inside the group and with partners of the opposite background, and show that this increases contributions in the games played with farmers selling to different mill type...|$|R
