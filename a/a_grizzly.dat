5|$|In {{creating}} the half dollar, Mora used motifs evoking California {{at the time}} of statehood in 1850. The obverse depicts a Gold Rush-era prospector, kneeling. He washes material with his pan, seeking bits of placer gold. The reverse adapts the Flag of California, known as the Bear Flag, showing <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear. Mora left the fields, or background, of the coin unpolished, giving the piece a textured look.|$|E

5|$|Larger {{animals are}} not as common, but are still present. <b>A</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear was photographed near Cascade pass in October2010, {{and as many as}} twenty grizzlies may be living in the Cascades, south of the Canada–US border. Wolves, pine martens lynx, wolverines, cougars, weasels, and black bears are also present, and are usually {{detected}} by camera traps. During the summer, bears consume up to 30,000 calories a day in preparation for hibernation, in a dietary phase known as hyperphagia. There have also been attempts to re-introduce fishers to the region. Cougars are mainly nocturnal and solitary, and are so secretive that they are seldom seen. Wolves were eradicated from the Cascades by the 1930s, but began re-establishing resident packs at least as early as 1990.|$|E
5|$|Gasol {{missed the}} first 23 games of the 2006–07 NBA season due to a broken foot {{suffered}} {{near the end of}} Spain's semifinal win over Argentina in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. He would go on to be named Most Valuable Player of the tournament, which Spain won. He had a season-high 34 points (most by <b>a</b> <b>Grizzly</b> that season), and eight rebounds and tied a career-high and franchise record with eight blocks on January 29 against the Sacramento Kings, and surpassed Shareef Abdur-Rahim as the franchise's all-time leader in free throw attempts on January 31 against the Dallas Mavericks. He became the all-time franchise leader in field goals made on February 6 against the Houston Rockets, and became the all-time franchise leader in minutes played on February 7 at Dallas. He surpassed Shareef Abdur-Rahim (7,801 points) as the Grizzlies' all-time leading scorer on March 7, 2007, against the Toronto Raptors (7,809 points at the time). On January 24, 2007, Gasol recorded his second career triple-double against the hosting Utah Jazz, garnering 17 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists. He also registered 2 blocks and one steal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter {{is the first}} white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E

25|$|Black bears {{generally}} {{stay out}} of grizzly territory, but grizzlies may occasionally enter black bear terrain to obtain food sources both bears enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When a black bear sees <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey {{because they have a}} more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself. There is at least one confirmed observation of <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear digging out, killing and eating a black bear when the latter was in hibernation.|$|E

25|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} Fremont area began on June 6, 1795, when Mission San José was founded by the Spaniard Father Fermin de Lasuen. The Mission was established {{at the site of}} the Ohlone village of Oroysom. On their second day in the area, the Mission party killed <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear in Niles Canyon. The first English-speaking visitor to Fremont was the renowned trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith in 1827. The Mission prospered, eventually reaching a population of 1,887 inhabitants in 1831. The influence of the missionaries declined after 1834, when the Mexican government enacted secularization.|$|E
25|$|Mounting a hill near Black Eagle Falls (probably {{where the}} town of Black Eagle is today), Lewis saw that the {{cataracts}} ended and that another large river joined the Missouri {{about two and a}} half miles further upstream. Although it was very late in the afternoon, Lewis rushed forward to see this river and was attacked by <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear. He ran more than 80 yards and launched himself into the Missouri River, and luckily the bear did not follow. The Lewis and Clark Expedition was forced to portage around the Great Falls, an arduous task that took nearly a month.|$|E
25|$|A 1959-1970 bear study {{suggested}} <b>a</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear {{population size}} of about 176, later revised to about 229. Later estimates have ranged {{as low as}} 136 and as high as 540; the most recent is a minimum estimate of 236, but biologists {{think there may be}} as many as 1,000 bears in the ecosystem. Although the Greater Yellowstone population is relatively close to recovery goals, the plan's definition of recovery is controversial. Thus, even though the population may be stable or possibly increasing in the short term, in the longer term, continued habitat loss, climate change, and increasing human activities may well reverse the trend.|$|E
