5|$|In 1804, {{a dispute}} arose over {{the custody of}} Princess Charlotte, which led to her being placed {{in the care of}} the King, George III. It also led to a Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry into Princess Caroline's conduct after the Prince of Wales <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> having an illegitimate son. The {{investigation}} cleared Caroline of the charge but still revealed her behaviour to have been extraordinarily indiscreet.|$|E
5|$|Joachim Gutkeled {{departed}} for Székesfehérvár {{as soon as}} he was informed of Stephen V's death, because he wanted to arrange the boy–king's coronation. Ladislaus's mother joined him, infuriating Stephen V's partisans who <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> having conspired against her husband. Stephen V's master of the treasury, Egyed Monoszló, laid siege to her palace in Székesfehérvár, but Gutkeled's supporters routed him. Monoszló fled to Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia); he captured the town and ceded it to Ottokar II of Bohemia.|$|E
5|$|Capitalising on anti-French sentiment, {{the paper}} {{went on to}} discuss Bảo Đại's {{upbringing}} in France, claiming that he was already womanising as a teenager because of his European upbringing. Bảo Đại later married an ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress Nam Phương, who had been raised Catholic. The editorials <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> being a French agent and claimed she had treated the queen mother badly, a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials were successfully using sex to turn {{the head of state}} into a puppet of France.|$|E

5|$|In {{pursuing}} the Clinton administration's energy objectives through {{construction of the}} $4.5 billion Afghanistan Oil Pipeline, Raphel created ill will with Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, then {{under the command of}} Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud-controlled militias blocked the pipeline's northern access route due to the longstanding civil war with Taliban forces. After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> collaborating with the Taliban to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Later, some of {{the workers}} complained to a cleric that Noreen insulted Muhammad. What they <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> saying, which would be stated in the later court verdict, differs from her version. A mob came to her house, beating her and {{members of her family}} before she was rescued by the police. The police {{initiated}} an investigation about her remarks, resulting in her arrest under Section 295 C of the Pakistan Penal Code. She subsequently was imprisoned for over a year before being formally charged.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} his first wife was murdered, Andrew married Yolanda de Courtenay, who was born around 1198. Their only child, Yolanda, was born around 1219 and married James I of Aragon. Andrew's third wife, Beatrice D'Este, was about twenty-three when they married in 1234. She {{gave birth to a}} son, Stephen, after Andrew's death. However, Andrew's two older sons, Béla and Coloman, <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> {{adultery}} and considered her child to be a bastard. Her grandson, Andrew, became the last monarch of the House of Árpád.|$|E

5|$|Charles' illness {{created a}} power vacuum that {{eventually}} led to the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War between supporters of his brother, Louis of Orléans and the royal dukes of Burgundy. Isabeau shifted allegiances as she chose the most favorable paths for the heir to the throne. When she followed the Armagnacs, the Burgundians <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> adultery with Louis of Orléans; when she sided with the Burgundians the Armagnacs removed her from Paris and she was imprisoned. In 1407 John the Fearless assassinated Orléans, sparking hostilities between the factions. The war ended soon after Isabeau's eldest son, Charles, had John the Fearless assassinated in 1419—an act that saw him disinherited. Isabeau attended the 1420 signing of the Treaty of Troyes, which decided that the English king should inherit the French crown after the death of her husband, Charles VI. She lived in English-occupied Paris until her death in 1435.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not to go against the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude the Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of Defense Minister and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, {{for the good of the}} nation, she was willing to compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E

5|$|Kagame's {{first term}} expired and new {{elections}} {{were held in}} 2010. Having served one term as elected president, Kagame was entitled to serve for one further term. The election campaign began publicly in January 2010 when Victoire Ingabire, a Hutu who had been living abroad for some years, returned to Rwanda and announced her candidacy for the presidency. This failed as she was arrested and accused of threatening state security. Ingabire caused some controversy in the country following her arrival, with comments relating to the genocide. The government <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> breaking the country's strict laws regarding genocide denial, and she was arrested in April 2010. She was released on bail, but was prohibited from running in the election. In October 2012 she was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment by the High Court of Kigali, which is heavily criticized by Amnesty International.|$|E
5|$|Later {{claiming}} {{that she was}} acting under instruction from the Ascended Masters, Fortune and Loveday joined the Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society, which was run by Daisy M. Grove. Fortune soon became its president, and under her leadership the group's membership expanded and the readership of its published Transactions also grew. Throughout this period, she foregrounded {{the need for a}} Christian perspective within the Theosophical movement, emphasising the centrality and importance of the 'Master Jesus' in her various articles. She publicly criticised another Theosophical group, the Liberal Catholic Church founded by J. I. Wedgwood and Charles Webster Leadbeater, alleging that it was not concerned with the Master Jesus and was instead preoccupied with the Master Maitreya. One of the prominent figures in the Church, Bishop Piggott, <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> attributing false claims to him in The Occult Review.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{found the}} short skirt {{convenient}} during her travels and defended it {{against those who}} {{said it was a}} distraction that hurt the women’s rights cause. Nevertheless, she disliked the instant attention it drew whenever she arrived in a new place. In the fall of 1854, she added a dress a few inches longer, for occasional use. In 1855, she abandoned the dress altogether and was not involved in the formation of a National Dress Reform Association in February, 1856. Her resumption of long skirts drew the condemnation of such dress-reform leaders as Gerrit Smith and Lydia Sayer Hasbrouk, who <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> sacrificing principle for the sake of pleasing a husband.|$|E
5000|$|A {{meeting is}} held between Portia, Una, and the Cry, who regard Portia as a [...] "dupe." [...] Portia {{describes}} Nicanor's family—a gloomy {{father and the}} twins Ferdinand and Cordelia—and the Cry <b>accuses</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> being in love with Ferdinand, which prompts her to discuss various [...] "romantic" [...] subjects. This leads to Portia telling a story <b>of</b> <b>her</b> courtship with Ferdinand, but the Cry <b>accuse</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> being too fond of him. Then, the Cry start abusing Portia for her feelings and for later discussing logic.|$|R

Massachusetts regulators also <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> withdrawing $15 million from company-related accounts {{shortly before he}} confessed.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} during these later regencies that Desiderius, Bishop of Vienne (later Saint Didier) {{publicly}} <b>accused</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> incest and cruelty.
