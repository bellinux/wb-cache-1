40|$|Cochlear implant {{recipients}} {{perceive a}} rise in pitch when the site of stimulation is moved from the apex toward the base. The place <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is typically measured using the stimulation of single channels. However, all current cochlear implant devices stimulate multiple channels simultaneously or with pulses temporally interleaved. The primary goal {{of the present study}} is to test whether the sensitivity of a cochlear implant recipient to changes in perceived pitch associated with changes of place of excitation improves or deteriorates when the number of active channels is increased, compared with stimulation with only one active channel. Place <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was recorded in four Nucleus CI 24 subjects as a function of number of active channels (from 1 to 8). Just noticeable differences were estimated from a constant stimuli 2 AFC pitch-ranking experiment with roving loudness. Reference and comparison stimuli contained the same number of active channels but were shifted one or two electrodes toward the base or toward the apex. The place <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was measured using monopolar stimulation at two locations along the electrode array. To minimize cues related to loudness, the multichannel stimuli were loudness balanced relative to the single-channel stimuli presented at C-level. The number of active channels did not affect place <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> This is consistent with a model that compares the edges of the excitation pattern irrespective of the overlap between excitation patterns.

The third experiment assesses the effect of spectral mismatch in an FO-discrimination task with two different vocoders. The fourth experiment investigates the effect of amplitude compression on modulation rate discrimination. For each experiment, the results obtained from normal-hearing subjects presented with vocoded stimuli are compared to results obtained directly from CI recipients. The results show that place <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> drops with increased spectral smearing and that place pitch cues for multi-channel stimuli can adequately be mimicked when the discriminability of adjacent channels is adjusted by varying the spectral slopes to match that of CI subjects.

40|$|Sensitivity to static {{changes in}} pitch {{has been shown}} to be poorer in school-aged {{children}} wearing cochlear implants (CIs) than children with normal hearing (NH), but it is unclear whether this is also the case for dynamic changes in pitch. Yet, dynamically changing pitch has considerable ecological relevance in terms of natural speech, particularly aspects such as intonation, emotion, or lexical tone information. Twenty one children with NH and twenty-three children wearing a CI participated in this study, along with eighteen NH adults and six CI adults for comparison. Listeners with CIs used their clinically assigned settings with envelope-based coding strategies. Percent correct was measured in one- or three-interval two-alternative forced choice tasks, for the direction or discrimination of harmonic complexes based on a linearly rising or falling fundamental frequency. Sweep rates were adjusted per subject, in a logarithmic scale, so as to cover the full extent of the psychometric function. Data for up- and down-sweeps were fitted separately, using a maximum-likelihood technique. Fits were similar for up- and down-sweeps in the discrimination task, but diverged in the direction task because psychometric functions for down-sweeps were very shallow. Hits and false alarms were then converted into d’ and beta values, from which a threshold was extracted at a d’ of 0. 77. Thresholds were very consistent between the two tasks and considerably higher (worse) for CI listeners than for their NH peers. Thresholds were also higher for children than adults. Factors such as age at implantation, age at profound hearing loss, and duration of CI experience did not play any major role in this sensitivity.

40|$|The role {{of harmony}} in the {{definition}} of tonality provides theoretical framework for the hypothesis that harmonic context affects pitch perception. In tonal music, the stability of individual notes depends on the harmonic setting. It seems then reasonable to expect harmonically guided variations in the cognitive representation of tones. With the purpose of enhancing current models of pitch perception, this thesis proposes an empirical investigation of the effects of harmony on <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> In two experiments, nonmusicians performed a same/different discrimination task on two pitches (a reference tone RT and a comparison tone CT) that were embedded in a melody with a clearly implied harmony. Visual cues facilitated the identification of the tones. The main experiment included only stimuli with different harmonic contexts for RT and CT. It consisted of a repeated-measures design with two bi-level factors, pitch (RT=CT and RT≠CT) and harmonic stability (equal and unequal stability for CT with respect to RT). By considering only changing-harmony stimuli, this study greatly minimized effects of potential confounds, allowing a comparative examination of the perception of equal versus different pitches. An ANOVA with percent correct as dependent variable and c (response-bias measure) as covariate revealed greater disruption in discrimination of different than identical notes; better <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in unequal than equal harmonic-stability situations; and increased perception abilities for unequally, with respect to equally, stable notes that differed in pitch, but the opposite effect for equal tones. The second experiment consisted of a between-subjects design with two factors, harmony (changing and nonchanging) and pitch (as above). An ANOVA showed better pitch discrimination abilities (d 2 ̆ 7) under nonchanging than changing harmonic contexts in common musical situations. Altogether, the findings suggest that changing harmonic settings tend to bring together the percepts of pitches that are introduced in adjacent chordal functions, particularly when the tones are stable members of their contextual harmony. This thesis contributes to the field of music cognition by illuminating our understanding of the perceptual mechanisms involved in the interaction of pitch and harmony, proposing an alternative methodological approach, and emphasizing the problems that underlie the study of contextual aspects of music...|$|R

In this limit, the model is amenable to analytical treatment within Onsager theory and a closed expression for the pitch versus concentration and helical shape can be derived. Within the same framework we also briefly review the possibility of alternative types of chiral order, such as twist-bend or screw-like nematic phases, finding that cholesteric order dominates for weakly helical distortions. While long-ranged or `soft' chiral forces usually lead to a pitch decreasing linearly with concentration, steric chirality leads to a much steeper decrease of quadratic nature. This reveals a subtle link between the range of chiral intermolecular interaction and the <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with concentration.

The behaviour of the macroscopic cholesteric pitch is studied from microscopic principles by invoking a simple density functional theory generalised to accommodate weakly twisted director fields. Upon changing {{the degree of}} alignment along the local helicoidal director we find that cholesteric phases exhibit a sudden sense inversion whereby the cholesteric phase changes from left- to right-handed and vice versa.

Summary and conclusion. Cochlear Implant (CI) recipients are on par with their normal hearing counterparts in speech perception tasks in quiet, but their performance is at chance level for pitch perception tasks. Pitch in CI can be conveyed by either place cues or temporal cues. Although researchers have studied place and temporal pitch, there is scant evidence that reports the individual contribution of place and temporal pitch as a function of musical pitch. This thesis aims to investigate the role of place pitch and temporal pitch perception in CI recipients. It comprises three major experiments using four experimental procedures. The four experimental procedures were: 4 AFC Discrimination, 2 AFC Ranking, and 2 AFC Modified Melodies Test – Backward, and 2 AFC Modified Melodies Test – Warp modification. Experiment I investigated temporal <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> as a function of different stimulation patterns, base pulse rate, and electrode location. The four stimulation patterns were: single electrode stimulation (apical (Electrode E 22) or middle (E 12)), dual-electrode stimulation (E 22 & E 12), and multiple electrode stimulation (E 22 to E 12). Six post-lingually deafened CI subjects were tested using three of the four experimental procedures (i. e., excluding the discrimination task). The stimuli were presented as pulses at a base rate of 131 pulses per second (pps) (musical note C 3 range) and 262 pps (C 4 range). The temporal <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was not influenced by different stimulation patterns and the results showed no significant difference among the stimulation patterns across the three procedures. The results suggest that the CI recipients are unable to combine cues from different places in the cochlea to give a “stronger” cue. Experiment II aimed to investigate the individual contribution of place pitch and temporal pitch in various pitch perception tasks. The performance of CI subjects was tested using four experimental procedures and three stimulus types. The three stimulus types were: (1) Pure tones with base frequency of C 5 (523 Hz), providing place cues only; (2) Harmonic tones with base frequency of C 3 (131 Hz), providing temporal cues only; (3) Harmonic tones with base frequency of C 4 (262 Hz), providing both place and temporal cues. The stimuli were presented via loudspeaker at a comfortable loudness level. The recipients used their own speech processor. The overall scores for discrimination and ranking were high for all three stimulus types, however, three subjects showed pitch reversals in ranking the C 4 harmonic tones. In the Modified Melodies test, scores were similar for C 5 pure tones and C 3 harmonic tones, while scores using C 4 harmonic tones were worse and mostly near chance. These results suggest that CI place pitch may convey melodic pitch information, but the contribution of brightness cannot be completely ruled out. Experiment III sought to investigate the role of brightness in various pitch perception tasks in normal hearing individuals. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate whether CI subjects in the previous experiment perceived place pitch as pitch rather than as a pattern of brightness changes. Eighteen normal-hearing adults participated in four experimental procedures using three stimulus types: brightness sequences (harmonic tones varying in brightness, with constant pitch), and noise sequences (Low-pass noise bands, varying in cut-off frequency) were compared with pitch sequences (harmonic tones varying in pitch, with constant brightness). Results showed that the subjects were able to discriminate and rank brightness, and were able to detect brightness contour changes, but were unable to make judgements of musical intervals for brightness. These results suggest that the cochlear implant recipients in the previous experiment may have perceived place cues as brightness rather than pitch. In conclusion, a similar performance trend was seen between CI place pitch and NH brightness indicating that CI place pitch is akin to brightness and not to pitch. Conversely, CI performance was similar between temporal pitch and place pitch suggesting that CI place pitch can convey melodic pitch. However, the overall performance reveals that CI place pitch is more akin to brightness aspect of timbre than to pitch and additional studies need to affirm these findings. Unfortunately, the CI pitch performance was still significantly below NH performance. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (xvi, 208 pages) illustrations (some coloured...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} automatic {{flight control}} system was developed which integrates all longitudinal flight path and speed control functions previously provided by a <b>pitch</b> <b>autopilot</b> and autothrottle. In this design, a net thrust command is computed based on total energy demand arising from both flight path and speed targets. The elevator command is computed based on the energy distribution error between flight path and speed. The engine control is configured to produce the commanded net thrust. The design incorporates control strategies and hierarchy to deal systematically and effectively with all aircraft operational requirements, control nonlinearities, and performance limits. Consistent decoupled maneuver control is achieved for all modes and flight conditions without outer loop gain schedules, control law submodes, or control function duplication...|$|R
40|$|The Total Energy Control System was {{developed}} and tested in September 1985 during five flights on the NASA Langley Transport System Research Vehicle, a modified Boeing B 737. In the system, the total kinetic and potential energy of the aircraft {{is controlled by the}} throttles, and the energy distribution is controlled by the elevator. A common inner loop is used for each mode of the autopilot, and all the control functions of a conventional <b>pitch</b> <b>autopilot</b> and autothrottle are integrated into a single generalized control concept, providing decoupled flightpath and maneuver control, and a coordinated throttle response for all maneuvers. No instabilities or design problems requiring gain adjustment in flight were found, and comparison with simulation results showed excellent path tracking...|$|R
40|$|The {{physics of}} wound and unwound strings on the {{electric}} guitar are presented here, and the pitch intervals {{produced by the}} movements of a Fender Stratocaster tremolo unit are explained. Predicted changes in <b>pitch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of different strings are given, and experimentally verified, for changes in saddle height, the distance of string free to move behind the nut and ratio of diameters/masses of the core and windings of wound strings. Also, it is shown that changes to the gauge of strings (assuming the string tension is sufficient for linear behaviour and in absence of changes to other construction details) don’t alter the pitch intervals produced by a given angle of tremolo arm use assuming the instrument is set {{up with the same}} sounding pitches and starting bridge angle. It is demonstrated that it not possible to equalise the relative sensitivity of unwound steel stings on a Fender Stratocaster type tremolo unit through string construction techniques. The ratio of core to winding mass in the string, on the other hand, was found to be a very powerful design parameter for choosing the sensitivity of the string to tremolo arm use and standard pitch bends. For instance, the pitch intervals produced by operation of tremolo arm for wound strings may be made to approximately match that for one of the unwound strings if they share very similar core gauges (assuming the winding masses are chosen to give approximately the same tension at their sounding pitches). Such a design, only available currently by custom order, also delivers the optimum equalisation in sensitivity of strings for standard string bends (due to these also being produced by altering the length of the string to generate changes in tension and therefore pitch).
