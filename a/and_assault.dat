5|$|Archival {{data of the}} II SS-Panzer Corps {{shows that}} the corps had 294 {{operable}} tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns {{on the evening of}} 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July. Allowing for the possibility that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns became inoperable during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to Totenkopf and one belonging to Leibstandarte. An estimated total of 60–80 tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns, almost the same number it had {{at the beginning of the}} battle on 12 July. On 12 July, Schlachtgeschwader 1 of the 8th Air Corps and its attached squadron of Stukas reported 11 aircraft damaged, all by Soviet anti-aircraft artillery, of which 6 were total write-offs.|$|E
5|$|The German forces {{involved}} in the Battle of Prokhorovka were from the three Waffen-SS divisions of the II SS-Panzer Corps: Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf. On the evening of 11 July, the serviceable armour strength of the II SS-Panzer Corps was 294 tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns, which included 15 Tigers. The armoured strength of Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf were 77, 95, and 122 tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns respectively. Ten of the Tigers were {{to the north of}} the Psel River with Totenkopf, four were with Leibstandarte, and Das Reich had just one.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da and his {{organization}} were sued by Beverly O'Mahoney, then {{wife of the}} Adidam president, for fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> and battery (among other things); the suit sought $5 million in damages.|$|E
40|$|Marriage {{may reduce}} the risk of {{accidents}} <b>and</b> <b>assaults</b> by promoting social control of health behavior. This study examines the impact of marital status on non-fatal accidents <b>and</b> <b>assaults</b> in young British women. Data is drawn from a large cohort study of the people born in 1958. Rate ratios of overall and specific incidence of non-fatal accidents <b>and</b> <b>assaults</b> are determined by negative binomial regression, with adjustment for socio-economic and behavioral confounders. The null hypothesis of no association between marital status and incidence of non-fatal accidents <b>and</b> <b>assaults</b> is rejected. It is suggested that, independent of parental status, more exposure to marriage and less exposure to marital dissolution may reduce accidents <b>and</b> <b>assaults.</b> accidents assaults social control marital status Britain...|$|R

5|$|In early 1945, Bagramyan's army, {{under the}} overall command of Vasilievsky, {{took part in}} the advance into East Prussia. In Operation Samland, Bagramyan's First Baltic Front, now known as the Samland Group, {{captured}} Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) in April. On 9 May 1945, he accepted the surrender of the German forces penned up in Latvia, capturing a total of 158 aircraft, 18,000 vehicles, 500 tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns among other weaponry.|$|E

5|$|Another riot {{occurred}} in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, during a co-headlining tour with Metallica. Prior to Guns N' Roses' appearance, Metallica's set {{was cut short}} after singer-guitarist James Hetfield suffered second-degree burns in a pyrotechnics accident. However, Guns N' Roses was unable to go on stage early, because Rose once again was late arriving at the venue. Nearly an hour into their show, Rose complained of voice problems before walking off stage, following which a riot erupted in downtown Montreal, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in damages. In November of that year, Rose was convicted of property damage <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> {{in relation to the}} Riverport riot; he was fined $50,000 and received two years' probation.|$|E
5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German forces being {{driven out of}} Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns to Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, {{more than two-thirds of}} their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in danger of being encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|Five North Korean Army (KPA) {{divisions}} massed {{around the}} city preparing to cross the Naktong River <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> it {{from the north and}} west. Defending the city were the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK II Corps. In a series of engagements, each of the North Korean divisions attempted to cross the Naktong and attack the defending forces. The success of these attacks varied by region, but attacks in the 1st Cavalry Division sector were repulsed and the attacks in the South Korean sector were more successful.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite the}} general superiority of its armored vehicles, by 29 August 1944, {{as the last}} {{surviving}} German troops of Fifth Panzer Army and Seventh Army began retreating towards Germany, the twin cataclysms of the Falaise Pocket and the Seine crossing had cost the Wehrmacht dearly. Of the 2,300 tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns it had committed to Normandy (including around 750 Panzer IVs), over 2,200 had been lost. Field Marshal Walter Model reported to Hitler that his panzer divisions had remaining, on average, five or six tanks each.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 09:00 that the 1st RUR were in {{position}} {{to carry out a}} left flanking attack on Longuerval. The village was clear of Germans so they pressed on towards Sainte-Honorine. When between the two villages, the battalion was engaged by German mortar, artillery <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> gun fire, and suffered several casualties. Two companies managed to reach Sainte-Honorine, but with no artillery fire support of their own, and out of radio contact with their battalion headquarters, they were forced to withdraw back to Longueval.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the town}} of Bazeilles, the Engineers <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> {{infantry}} had gathered to prepare the boats for the crossing of the Meuse at Wadelincourt when an artillery barrage from the French positions destroyed 81 out of 96 rubber boats. The plan of attack had included an assault by both the 69th and 89th Infantry Regiments, but the loss of so many boats meant that only the 86th Infantry Regiment was able to conduct the crossing. The 69th Infantry Regiment was kept in reserve to follow the 86th as reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), <b>and</b> <b>Assault</b> (aggressive play).|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Taegu was an {{engagement}} between UN and North Korean forces {{early in the}} Korean War, with fighting continuing from August 5–20, 1950 around the city of Taegu, South Korea. It {{was a part of}} the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after their forces were able to drive off an offensive by North Korean divisions attempting to cross the Naktong River <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle has}} been widely {{described}} as the largest tank engagement or battle in military history, involving 1,200–1,500 tanks and sometimes up to 2,000, but this is incorrect as the battle did not involve that many tanks. The exaggerated figures originated from erroneous Soviet intelligence estimates of German armour reported {{during and after the}} battle, and subsequent postwar accounts that furthered this erroneous narrative. Some of these Soviet estimates reported figures as high as 800 German tanks <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns attacking Prokhorovka on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} was discovered at about 00:30 on June 3, and Zur's force lost {{the element of}} surprise. The Egyptian position that engaged the Israelis had two companies, but Harpaz, the 51st's 3rd Company's commander, underestimated the force and reported that it contained only one platoon. Zur decided to regroup in the wadi and ordered Aryeh Kotzer's 1st Company to stay and engage the Egyptians {{at the spot where}} they were originally discovered <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> the pillbox there, {{while the rest of the}} forces would try a turning movement.|$|E
5|$|The panzergrenadier {{regiment}} of Großdeutschland, advancing on {{the right}} wing, pushed through {{to the village of}} Butovo. The tanks were deployed in an arrow formation to minimise the effects of the Soviet Pakfront defence, with the Tigers leading and the Panzer IIIs, IVs <b>and</b> <b>assault</b> guns fanning out to the flanks and rear. They were followed by infantry and combat engineers. Attempts by the VVS to impede the advance were repulsed by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
