In Rapture Under Attack he wrote:I myself have been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order. Having read at least fifty books on the Illuminati, I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> it exists and can be blamed for many of man's inhumane actions against his fellow man {{during the past two}} hundred years.|$|E
25|$|President Klaus Iohannis is a {{supporter}} of the fight against corruption in Romania. Since coming to power in November 2014, has sent several messages of support to prosecutors investigating sensitive cases against politicians accused of corruption. Making one of its important position was in February 25, 2016 {{at the annual meeting of}} the National Anticorruption Directorate: “From year to year the work of the National Anticorruption Directorate has become more effective as the number of cases investigated and complexity, as well as final decisions on confiscation and recovery of property from crime. You are a model of functional institution and created a performance standard. Through the work and achievements, you've earned the appreciation of the Romanian citizens who want to live in a just society, in a country without corruption, the institutions, elect to represent them and those who perform public functions are actually serving the people. The results obtained by you in fighting corruption, appreciated and beyond Romania's borders are a guarantee that the process of strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Romania are on track. I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> we will be increasingly more powerful in applying the constitutional principle that nobody is above the law and to align our established practice in countries with democracies that put the citizen at the center of any policy”, stated Klaus Iohannis.|$|E

500|$|Darwin {{thought of}} natural {{selection}} by analogy to how farmers select crops or livestock for breeding, which he called [...] "artificial selection"; in his early manuscripts he referred to a [...] "Nature" [...] which would do the selection. At the time, other mechanisms of evolution such as evolution by genetic drift were not yet explicitly formulated, and Darwin believed that selection was likely {{only part of the}} story: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification." [...] In a letter to Charles Lyell in September 1860, Darwin regretted {{the use of the term}} [...] "Natural Selection", preferring the term [...] "Natural Preservation".|$|E
500|$|La Poype de Vertrieu {{wrote his}} report and {{recommendations}} for the refitting of Marseillois on 24 December 1779; he found her a passable ship, but her high poop hindered her sailing when running, and he recommended improvements to the gun ports of the castles, which were obstructed and allowed only two guns on the quarterdeck {{and one on the}} forecastle to be used. Furthermore, substantial repairs on the rigging were needed, and she needed her hull heated to kill worms. La Poype de Vertrieu wrote [...] "it appears that Marseillois shall never be an exceptional sailor, but I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> she will give satisfaction".|$|E

I simply cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this. If you had seen her, I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> you would recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar." [...] Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.|$|E

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed concern over a new government saying: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the forces that want to bring change and democratization in Egypt will also enhance peace between Israel and the Arab world.

A subsequent tweet sent by Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana offered further comment on Erdely's story: [...] "e made a judgement—the kind of judgement reporters and editors make every day. And in this case, our judgement was wrong." [...] On December 6, Rolling Stone updated the apology to say the mistakes in the article were the fault of Rolling Stone and not of its source, while noting that [...] "there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account".|$|E

500|$|Positive {{comments}} {{came from}} functionalist architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1938, who wrote to Holden {{that he was}} [...] "very much taken and <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> there is no finer building in London." [...] Architectural historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a [...] "static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years", but thought [...] "the interior is more pleasing than the exterior. There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity, serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece." [...] Nikolaus Pevsner was less enthusiastic. He described its style as [...] "strangely semi-traditional, undecided modernism" [...] and summarised the result: [...] "The design certainly does not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden's smaller Underground stations." [...] Others have described it as Stalinist or as totalitarian due to its great scale.|$|E
500|$|In Germany, Lody's {{home town}} of Nordhausen planted an oak tree in his memory. Newspaper {{commentary}} was limited; the first article about the case that The Times noted was only published around 19 November, in the Frankfurter Zeitung, in which a pseudonymous columnist suggested that the British might have been tempted to show Lody mercy: [...] "I myself <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the noble manliness with which this strong German composure bore itself before the Court touched {{the heart of the}} Judge, that the Judge said [...] "If only we English had many such Hans Lodys!" [...] and that Hans Lody lives... We shall not forget him, for he staked his country more than his life – his name and his honour." [...] A death notice was published in early December in the Stuttgarter Neues Tagblatt, stating that he had [...] "died the hero's death for the Fatherland in England, November 6".|$|E

500|$|The Duke and Duchess {{settled in}} France. In May 1939, the Duke was {{commissioned}} by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) {{during a visit to}} the battlefields of Verdun. In it he appealed for peace, saying [...] "I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what I am about to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war." [...] The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America. It was widely seen as supporting appeasement, and the BBC refused to broadcast it. It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.|$|E
500|$|As the {{new century}} began, Shaw became {{increasingly}} disillusioned by the limited impact of the Fabians on national politics. Thus, although a nominated Fabian delegate, he {{did not attend the}} London conference at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street in February 1900, that created the Labour Representation Committee—precursor of the modern Labour Party. By 1903, when his term as borough councillor expired, he had lost his earlier enthusiasm, writing: [...] "After six years of Borough Councilling I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the borough councils should be abolished". Nevertheless, in 1904 he stood in the London County Council elections. After an eccentric campaign, which Holroyd characterises as [...] " [...] absolutely certain of not getting in", he was duly defeated. It was Shaw's final foray into electoral politics. Nationally, the 1906 general election produced a huge Liberal majority and an intake of 29 Labour members. Shaw viewed this outcome with scepticism; he had a low opinion of the new prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and saw the Labour members as inconsequential: [...] "I apologise to the Universe for my connection with such a body".|$|E
500|$|Longstreet soon {{clashed with}} Bragg and became {{leader of the}} group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have him removed. Bragg's {{subordinates}} had long been dissatisfied with his leadership and abrasive personality; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, added credibility to the earlier claims, and was a catalyst toward action. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us {{as long as we have}} our present commander." [...] The situation became so grave that President Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed was one of the most bizarre scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg [...] "was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight" [...] and that he [...] "knew nothing of the business." [...] Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict.|$|E

500|$|With {{decreasing}} album {{sales and}} a lack of commercially successful singles, Cher decided to further develop her acting career. While she had previously aspired to venture into film, she had only the critically and commercially unsuccessful movies Good Times and Chastity to her credit, and the Hollywood establishment did not take her seriously as an actress. She moved to New York in 1982 to take acting lessons with Lee Strasberg, founder of the Actors Studio, but never enrolled after her plans changed. She auditioned for and was signed by director Robert Altman for the Broadway stage production Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, playing a member of a James Dean fan club holding a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the film adaptation of the same title. Cher credits Altman for launching her acting career: [...] "Without Bob [...] I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me... I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Bob {{was the only one who}} was brave enough to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The toll of {{international}} celebrity on Wong's personal life {{manifested itself in}} bouts of depression and sudden anger, as well as excessive smoking and drinking. Feeling irritable when she disembarked in Hong Kong, Wong was uncharacteristically rude to the awaiting crowd, which then quickly turned hostile. One person shouted: [...] "Down with Huang Liu Tsong– the stooge that disgraces China. Don't let her go ashore." [...] Wong began crying and a stampede ensued. After she left for a short trip to the Philippines, the situation cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her father and her siblings, Wong visited {{his family and his}} first wife at the family's ancestral home near Taishan. Conflicting reports claim that she was either warmly welcomed or met with hostility by the villagers. She spent over 10days in the family's village and some time in neighboring villages before continuing her tour of China. After returning to Hollywood, Wong reflected on her year in China and her career in Hollywood: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> I could never play in the Chinese Theatre. I have no feeling for it. It's a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I'm 'too American' and by American producers because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts." [...] Wong's father returned to Los Angeles in 1938.|$|E
500|$|Patton's [...] "big break" [...] came in 2002, when he {{was cast}} to replace Steve Burns as Joe, the second host of the Nickelodeon children's {{television}} program Blue's Clues.

[...] Patton became a [...] "household name" [...] and has been called [...] "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents". [...] He was subjected to [...] "the same kind of scrutiny" [...] as Burns, {{who was involved in}} Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role. [...] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions. [...] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences. [...] He said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> I got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do. [...] There's a tape out there, somewhere, with both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken, which we did at the screen test. I haven't seen the tape, but I know somewhere it still exists". [...] Beginning in September 2000, Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to [...] "think of [...] as children's TV", but rather as [...] "acting and telling the truth".|$|E
