40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the efforts of}} the NASA/USRA Advanced Design Program during the 1988 - 89 scholastic year. The primary goal was to address specific needs in the design of an integrated system to grow higher order plants in space. The initial phase of the design effort concentrated on studying such a system and identifying its needs. Once these needs were defined, emphasis was placed on the design and fabrication of devices to meet them. Specific attention was placed on a hand-held harvester, a nutrient concentration sensor, an <b>air-water</b> <b>separator,</b> and a closed-loop biological system simulation...|$|E
40|$|Water flow rate, gas-phase holdup, and {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) profiles are measured in a full-scale airlift aerator {{as a function}} of applied air flow rate. A model that predicts oxygen transfer based on discrete-bubble principles is applied. The riser DO profiles are used to calculate the initial bubble size. The range of calculated bubble diameters obtained using the model is 2. 3 – 3. 1 mm. The Sauter-mean diameter of bubbles measured in the laboratory ranged from 2. 7 to 3. 9 mm. The riser and downcomer DO profiles and gas holdups predicted by the model are in close agreement with the experimental results. A model that predicts water flow rate based on an energy balance is used to calculate Kt, the frictional loss coefficient for the <b>air–water</b> <b>separator.</b> Excluding the data at the very lowest air flow rate, the range of calculated values for Kt (3 – 8) is close to a literature value of 5. 5 proposed for hydrodynamically similar external airlift bioreactors. The models should prove useful in the design and optimization of airlift aerators...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modelling a laboratory scale gas-liquid separator designed for high gas content. The separator consists of two concentric pipes with swirl tube in the annular space between the pipes. The gas-liquid mixture comes tangentially from the side inlet and the system works {{with a combination of}} gravity and centrifugal forces to achieve a high-efficient gas-liquid separation. Three dimensional transient multi-phase fluid flows were solved to predict the velocity and volume fraction of each phase. The standard k-E turbulence model was used for turbulence closure. The performance of the gas-liquid separator was visually established for a range of gas flow rates (271 - 495 L/min), with volume fraction (VF) = 0. 874 - 0. 985 by observing the liquid carry over (LCO) regime where liquid was carried out in the gas stream. The liquid and gas flow rates at which the LCO was observed defines the upper operational range of the <b>separator.</b> <b>Air-water</b> mixture was used in the numerical simulations to keep consistent with the experiments. The pressure between the inlet and exit was validated against the experiments for different air-water flow rate combinations. The values were matched reasonably well for high air flow rate (495 L/min, VF= 0. 985) but were under-predicted for low air flow rate (271 L/min, VF- 0. 874). The air and water were mixed upstream of the inlet in the experiments and the pressure was measured {{at the start of the}} inlet. In case of numerical simulation the air and water were mixed at the inlet. This might cause the deviation of pressure when the air flow rate was low...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the total}} energy {{required}} for U. S. manufacturing processes, a signi®cant portion {{is used for}} industrial drying processes, estimated at 12 %. Often these industrial dryers operate without any provisions for heat recovery. This means that almost all the energy consumed by the dryer is essentially thrown away. Without the ability to recover the latent heat of the water vapor in the air, signi®cant reductions in dryer energy usage cannot be made. In an attempt to recover the latent heat of the water vapor, a closed drying cycle is proposed, which uses a nozzle as the means to recover this energy from moist-saturated air. This nozzle condensation drying cycle (NCDC) is composed of the following components: dryer, nozzle, di€user, <b>air-water</b> <b>separator,</b> heat exchanger and compressor. Analysis of this drying cycle shows that ideally this cycle requires {{a third of the}} energy compared with an ideal open cycle heated dryer or a heat pump dehumidi®cation cycle. However, when equipment isentropic e�ciencies are included, the energy costs are of the same order as that for the other two non-ideal cycles, but with as much as six times less heat exchange requirements. The cycle can be operated at varying conditions, allowing for a single design to be utilized for various applications. Other than the advantage of lower heat exchanger equipment costs, other advantages are in applications that requir...|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} of suspended droplets from gases {{has been one}} of the basic scientific and technical problems of the industrial era and this interest continues. Various industrial applications, such as refrigeration and HVAC systems, require control of fine droplets concentrations in moving gaseous mediums to maintain system functionality and efficiency. Separating of such fine droplets can be achieved using electrostatic charging as implemented in electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). They use electrostatic force to charge and collect solid particles. The objective of the present work was to study the feasibility of using wiretube electrostatic separator on the removal of fine water and oil droplets from air stream based on corona discharge ionization process. A parametric study was conducted to find key parameters affecting the separation process. This goal was approached by simulating the charging and separation phenomena numerically, and then verifying the modeling findings through experiments. The numerical methodology simulated the highly complex interaction between droplets suspended in the flow and electrical field. Two test rigs were constructed, one for air-water separation and the other for air-oil separation. A wiretube electrostatic separator was used as the test section for both test rigs. The separation performance was evaluated under different electric field and flow conditions. Finally, based on the results, a novel <b>air-water</b> <b>separator</b> prototype was designed, fabricated and tested. The numerical modeling results qualitatively showed acceptable agreement with the experimental data in terms of the trend of grade efficiency based on droplets size. Both numerical modeling results and experimental data showed that with a proper separator design, high separation efficiency is achievable for water and oil droplets. Based on the experimental data, at flow velocity of 5 m/s and applied voltage of 7. 0 kV, the maximum separation efficiency for water and oil was 99. 999 % and 96. 267 %, respectively. The pressure drop was as low as 100 Pa and maximum power consumption was 12. 0 W...|$|E
