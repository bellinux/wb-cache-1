This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical military leadership.|$|E

5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} iodine <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> among the halogens, {{conforming}} {{to the increasing}} trend down the group, since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them {{that is the most}} easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der Waals interactions among the halogens.

Because it has the largest atomic radius among the halogens, iodine has the lowest first ionisation energy, lowest electron affinity, lowest electronegativity and lowest reactivity of the halogens.|$|E
