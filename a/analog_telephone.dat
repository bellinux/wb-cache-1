40|$|In todays {{multimedia}} society {{more and}} more communication is becoming digitized. However under a temporary period, digital and analog techniques must coexist. So that every one can communicate with everyone else. For the deaf community, among other things, this means connecting <b>analog</b> text <b>telephones</b> to new internetbased technology. To enable this coexistance the Telecommunication Access Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center of the University of Wisconsin, Trace Center joint with Gallaudet University, and Omnitor AB have presented a idea of how this can be achieved. This report describes a project, which shows how a gateway can be designed and implemented. A gateway that has the features of enabling communication between <b>analog</b> text <b>telephones</b> and internet based clients. Enabling the users to communicate with both voice and text regardless if the users are using analog or digital media. The implementations in this project are done in Java. So the resulting gateway is as operating system independent as it can be. The result of this work was a gateway that can separate vice and <b>analog</b> text <b>telephone</b> signals in a in coming sound stream. The separation is good enough {{so as not to}} influence a conversation through the gateway. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
