In some instances data might be pulled into the staging area at different times to be held and processed all at once.

In other cases data might be brought into the staging area to be processed at drent times; or the staging area may be used to push data to multiple target systems. As an example, daily operational data might be pushed to an operational data store (ODS) while the same data may be sent in a monthly <b>aggregated</b> <b>form</b> to a data warehouse.|$|E
5000|$|In most, {{if not all}} proteopathies, {{a change}} in 3-dimensional folding (conformation) {{increases}} the tendency of a specific protein to bind to itself. [...] In this <b>aggregated</b> <b>form,</b> the protein is resistant to clearance and can interfere with the normal capacity of the affected organs. In some cases, misfolding of the protein results {{in a loss of}} its usual function. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis / frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), certain gene-regulating proteins inappropriately aggregate in the cytoplasm, and thus are unable to perform their normal tasks within the nucleus. Because proteins share a common structural feature known as the polypeptide backbone, all proteins have the potential to misfold under some circumstances. [...] However, only {{a relatively small number of}} proteins are linked to proteopathic disorders, possibly due to structural idiosyncrasies of the vulnerable proteins. For example, proteins that are normally unfolded or relatively unstable as monomers (that is, as single, unbound protein molecules) are more likely to misfold into an abnormal conformation. [...] In nearly all instances, the disease-causing molecular configuration involves an increase in beta-sheet secondary structure of the protein. [...] The abnormal proteins in some proteopathies have been shown to fold into multiple 3-dimensional shapes; these variant, proteinaceous structures are defined by their different pathogenic, biochemical, and conformational properties. [...] They have been most thoroughly studied with regard to prion disease, and are referred to as protein strains.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bias toward}} threat {{perception}} evaluation of black people, caused by stereotypes, can be lessened {{with access to}} diagnostic cues (ex: {{presence or absence of}} a weapon) and motivation. Lay people are more racially biased, on average, than trained police officers. Target prototypicality is shown to moderate racial bias. Police officers show a reduced racial bias in comparison to members of the community, however police officers were no better than community members in their sensitivity to prototypic targets. Exposing people to stimuli where race is unrelated to the stereotype may eliminate racial bias. Initial responses were racially biased but research shows that extensive practice with race being unrelated to the task at hand worked to eliminate racial bias. [...] As counter-stereotypical information is <b>aggregated</b> <b>form</b> multiple sources, it may force a change in the stereotype decreasing its strength or negating it entirely. Exposure to counter stereotypic stimuli can reduce racial bias, making race non-diagnostic and unhelpful for the decision process; the characteristic (violence) is unrelated to the group (race). Critical characteristics (weapon possession) is statistically unrelated to race therefore paying attention to race may hinder your judgment because it is non-diagnostic (unessential) to the task at hand. It may be beneficial to expose individuals to counter stereotypic information and stereotypic stimuli to change the nature of category based responses. Racial bias appeared to be significantly reduced (for the parameters of the study) with training indicating that change can be made. A stereotype can be a gatekeeper, perpetuating itself by directing attention toward expected information, or as an efficient information-processing device that facilitates the extraction of novel information with the potential to undermine itself.|$|E
