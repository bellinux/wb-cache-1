5|$|A later {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} during the moment Dr. Brooks took the picture of Hurley and Dave, <b>another</b> <b>patient</b> was staring at Hurley from across the room, Libby (Cynthia Watros), which explains why Hurley has had this faint recognition of Libby while on the island.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. <b>Another</b> <b>patient</b> was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. <b>Another</b> <b>patient</b> who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E

50|$|Hospitals in {{some major}} Canadian cities, such as London, Ontario, have {{restructured}} their emergency services to share emergency treatment among several hospitals. One hospital may provide full emergency room care, while <b>another</b> sees <b>patients</b> who have broken limbs, minor injuries and yet <b>another</b> sees <b>patients</b> suffering cold, flu, etc.|$|R
5|$|After {{seeing a}} vision of Stoller being stabbed in her car, Black warns her that she may be in danger, which she rebukes. However, she is {{approached}} by <b>another</b> <b>patient,</b> Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, but will not steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, but she has already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out-paces him before pulling into a filling station. However, the attendant alerts Stoller that someone is hiding {{in the back seat}} of her car, and manages to bring her to the safety of his office. Black arrives and finds the car empty. He drives Stoller back to the hospital while the attendant attempts to call the police. However, he is killed before making the call.|$|E
5|$|Worried by the events, the {{hospital}} coordinator, Dr. Theresa Shannon, tells Mulder and Scully about a similar series of deaths that {{occurred at the}} same hospital ten years prior. They suspect Rebecca Waite (O-Lan Jones), a nurse who {{is the only person}} present at all the death scenes. The agents visit Waite's house, discovering evidence that she practices witchcraft; however, the audience learns that the evidence was planted there by a staff member of {{the hospital}}. Elsewhere, Dr. Jack Franklin (Richard Beymer) is non-fatally assaulted by Waite at his house. There, Waite is arrested and approached by the agents, who attempt to question Waite but are prevented when she starts to vomit pins, dying shortly thereafter. After the incident, Mulder visits Dr. Jack Franklin, hoping to learn more about Waite's possible motivation. Although Franklin is seemingly innocent, when Mulder leaves the room, he begins to levitate and devilishly smile. Later that night, Mulder deduces that the birthdays of all the victims match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath and that Waite was actually trying to protect the victims from Dr. Jack Franklin (she had placed the pentagramsactually protective symbolson and around the victims in the hopes of protecting them from dark magic). This also explains why Waite tried to kill Franklin. Unfortunately, Mulder also realizes that because Waite was not the murderer, the spree of murders will continue. And as he suspected, <b>another</b> <b>patient</b> is murdered with acid back at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to <b>another</b> <b>patient</b> of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E

In the sickbay, Polly and Jamie are attacked by a Cyberman, which stuns them with electricity from his hand and leaves with <b>another</b> <b>patient's</b> body.|$|R
50|$|Electroencephalography (EEG) in {{one patient}} showed epileptiformic {{activities}} in the frontal and frontotemporal areas as well as increased spike waves while the <b>patient</b> was sleeping. <b>Another</b> <b>patient's</b> EEG showed occipital rhythms in background activity that was abnormal, focal discharges over the temporal lobe, and multifocial epileptiform activity. Several patients showed a loss of normal background activity.|$|R
50|$|On 24 June 1989, Glover {{visited the}} Caroline Chisholm Nursing Home in Lane Cove where {{he lifted the}} dress of an elderly patient and fondled her buttocks. In a {{neighbouring}} room, he slid his hand {{down the front of}} <b>another</b> <b>patient's</b> nightdress and stroked her breasts. The woman cried out for help and Glover was briefly questioned by staff at the hospital before leaving.|$|R

25|$|On 20 May 1851, Semmelweis {{took the}} {{relatively}} insignificant, unpaid, honorary head-physician {{position of the}} obstetric ward of Pest's small Szent RÃ³kus Hospital. He held that position for six years, until June 1857. Childbed fever was rampant at the clinic; at a visit in 1850, just after returning to Pest, Semmelweis found one fresh corpse, <b>another</b> <b>patient</b> in severe agony, and four others seriously ill with the disease. After taking over in 1851, Semmelweis virtually eliminated the disease. During 1851â€“1855, only eight patients died from childbed fever out of 933 births (0.85%).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Sassoon's conflict, the opening {{chapters of the}} novel describe the suffering of other soldiers in the hospital. Anderson, a former surgeon, now cannot stand the sight of blood. Haunted by terrible hallucinations after being thrown into the air by an explosion and landing head first in the ruptured stomach of a rotting dead soldier, Burns experiences a revulsion to eating. <b>Another</b> <b>patient,</b> Billy Prior, suffers from mutism and will only write communications with Rivers on a notepad. Prior eventually regains his voice, but remains a difficult patient for Rivers avoiding any discussion of his war memories.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April 1952, Straffen {{went with}} an {{attendant}} and <b>another</b> <b>patient</b> to clean some outbuildings that {{were close to}} the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8Â½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E

30|$|We have {{observed}} considerable {{fluctuations in the}} RSS, as discussed in Section 3. This fluctuation may produce a few metres of inaccuracy, which normally creates a weak degree of distinguishability of the closely lying nodes. However, our scheme can still be used in various application domains. For example, in VANETs where nodes are vehicles occupying few metres of space, they can easily be distinguished from other nearby vehicles in the signal space. Similarly, in the e-healthcare scenario where each patientâ€™s mobile phone can be considered in a single room, it can easily be distinguished from <b>another</b> <b>patientâ€™s</b> mobile phone in another room in the hospital.|$|R
25|$|Patient J.P., who {{suffered}} a stroke in the left medial/temporal gyrus, resulting in auditory verbal agnosiaâ€“ the inability to comprehend spoken words, but maintaining {{the ability to read}} and write, and with no effects to hearing ability. J.P. showed normal perceptual priming, but his conceptual priming ability for spoken words was, expectedly, impaired. <b>Another</b> <b>patient,</b> N.G., {{who suffered}} from prosopanomia (the inability to retrieve proper names) following damage to his left temporal lobe, was unable to spontaneously provide names of persons or cities, but was able to successfully complete a word-fragment completion exercise following priming with these names. This demonstrated intact perceptual priming abilities.|$|E
25|$|His {{intimate}} knowledge of Shakespeare's circle makes him especially attractive to literary historians. Modern scholarsA. L. Rowse is one prominent example, and others have followed his leadhave exploited Forman's manuscripts for the manifold lights they throw on the less-exposed private lives of Elizabethan and Jacobean men and women. One of Forman's patients was the poet Emilia Lanier, Rowse's candidate to have been Shakespeare's Dark Lady; <b>another</b> <b>patient</b> was Mrs Mountjoy, Shakespeare's landlady. Sixty-four volumes of his manuscripts were collected by Elias Ashmole in the seventeenth century, and are now held in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Others {{can be found in}} the Plymouth Library. A Brief Description of the Forman MSS. in the Public Library, Plymouth, was published in 1853.|$|E
25|$|In February 1998, Cullen {{was hired}} by the Liberty Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he staffed a ward of respirator-dependent {{patients}}. While at Liberty Hospital, Cullen was accused of giving patients drugs at unscheduled times, and was eventually fired after he was seen entering a patient's room with syringes in his hand. The patient ended up with a broken arm, but apparently received no injections. Cullen caused a patient's death at Liberty which was blamed on another nurse. After leaving Liberty Nursing and Rehab Center, Cullen was employed at Easton Hospital in Easton, Pennsylvania, from November 1998 to March 1999. On December 30, 1998, he murdered yet <b>another</b> <b>patient</b> with digoxin. A coroner's blood test showed lethal amounts of digoxin in the patient's blood, but an internal investigation within Easton Hospital was inconclusive; nothing pointed definitively to Cullen as the murderer.|$|E
40|$|Incentive {{contracts}} for gatekeepers who control patient access to specialist medical services provide too weak incentives to investigate cost further when expected cost of treatment {{is greater than}} benefit. Making gatekeepers residual claimants with a fixed fee from which treat-ment costs must be met (as with full insurers who are themselves gatekeepers) provides too strong incentives when expected cost is less than benefit. Giving patients the choice between a gatekeeper with an incentive contract and one without is unstable. With one scenario, pa- tients always prefer the latter. With <b>another,</b> <b>patients</b> have incentives to acquire information that makes incentive contracts ineffective. gatekeepers, patient referrals, general practitioners, fundholding, medical insurance, incentive contracts...|$|R

40|$|Seventeen {{patient with}} sinoatrial block and 16 healthy volunteers were {{investigated}} with recently developed autonomic tests of atrial pacemaker function. Only one patients {{was found to}} be entirely normal in comparison with normal subjects, while <b>another</b> <b>patients</b> had supernormal responses. Fifteen patients had reduced responses relative to the controls implying impaired atrial pacemaker function or sinoatrial disease. It is suggested that while in some cases sinoatrial block may be of physiological origin, it is more often due to sinoatrial disease. The latter group are liable to Adams-Stokes syncope and may have additional atricventricular conduction abnormalities. The possible mechanisms and treatment of sinoatrial block are discussed relative to the autonomic and pacemaker function abnormalities described...|$|R
