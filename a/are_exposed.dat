5|$|Noise as {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras to rock groups as they <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some {{studies have shown that}} the risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.|$|E

This means that the oldest strata <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> along the Virgin River in the Zion Canyon part of the park, and the youngest <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> in the Kolob Canyons section. The plateau is bounded on the east by the Sevier Fault Zone, and on the west by the Hurricane Fault Zone. Weathering and erosion along north-trending faults and fractures influence the formation of landscape features, such as canyons, in this region.|$|E

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
