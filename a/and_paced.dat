5|$|During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten {{changed the}} side's {{formation}} to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle {{for a position}} with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. He dragged {{the ball out of}} reach of a defender near the half-way line <b>and</b> <b>paced</b> his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder and he ran at the France goal and was forced into an acute angle, but despite the angle, he shot the ball into the net past Coupet.|$|E
5|$|Much as {{they had}} in {{previous}} stages, race leader Denis Menchov {{and the man in}} second place Danilo Di Luca stayed right with one another all through the climb, as Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov with attacks, but was unable to. Pellizotti, who had also been holding their wheels, took the opportunity with the two of them taking energy out of each other, to come clear and move into third position on the road. Basso, who was up the road, dutifully sat up and waited for his better-placed teammate <b>and</b> <b>paced</b> him to a small gap over Menchov and Di Luca before cracking. It was enough to ensure Pellizotti second on the stage, to keep him third in the overall classification. Di Luca managed to outsprint Menchov to the line and claim 8 bonus seconds to narrow his deficit to 18 seconds, but with only a flat stage and an individual time trial remaining the superior time trialist Menchov had the advantage.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{construction}} delay disputes {{often end}} up on the arbitration route where the delay experts appointed by the parties advise the tribunal on the extension of times entitlements of the parties. For this purpose, the identification and quantification of concurrent <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays are integral aspects of resolving these disputes using a proper delay analysis methodology. The aim of the study is therefore, threefold. Firstly, the available literature on the concurrent <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays are analyzed in detail to establish the principles for the evaluation of the concurrency <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays. Secondly, a robust delay analysis methodology called ‘windows impact/update method’ is explained often used by the experts for the effective quantification of concurrent <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays. This methodology is an improved version of time impact analysis and normal windows analysis. For better demonstration, the explanation of the methodology is facilitated {{with the help of a}} typical case study analysis. Finally, the principles of concurrency <b>and</b> <b>pacing,</b> as explained in the literature review, are promptly applied to the case study results to show the applicability of the analysis method on any types of delay disputes. The study shows the effectiveness of the windows impact/update method for the quantification of the concurrent <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays...|$|R
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June 1966, Lamb {{appeared}} without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was [...] "hyperactive and agitated"; {{he was unable to}} sit still and periodically rose from his seat <b>and</b> <b>paced</b> around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.|$|E
500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage commented overall {{that the}} episode was [...] "about as deliciously old-fashioned as new Who gets," [...] {{stating that the}} script was [...] "a deftly simple premise that makes you wonder why you didn't think of it yourself", and that Tate's {{character}} {{moved away from the}} caricature in [...] "The Runaway Bride". Wright also praised Agyeman for [...] "effortlessly" [...] portraying Martha and her evil cloned counterpart. A fan of the Sontarans, Wright reacted positively to their return and redesign. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy rated the episode four stars out of five. Rawson-Jones felt the narrative was well plotted <b>and</b> <b>paced,</b> and felt Helen Raynor's writing had improved from [...] "Daleks in Manhattan". Rawson-Jones also praised the reintroductions of UNIT, Martha, Donna's family and the Sontarans, the interaction between Donna and Martha, and Christopher Ryan's portrayal of Staal, but felt Skorr's voice was [...] "distinctly lacklustre." [...] The episode's direction by Douglas Mackinnon also received criticism, particularly the scenes in the clone room. In the end, Rawson-Jones felt that the first part's effectiveness lies on how much the viewers wish to tune in to see [...] "The Poison Sky".|$|E

Roth pondered if McMahon listened to Vanessa Carlton, since he pushed the songs [...] "one step further into an adorable trip of melodic euphoria." [...] The Phoenix writer Sean Richardson wrote that with North, the band [...] "continue to prove themselves {{one of the most}} tuneful outfits in modern rock." [...] Richardson noted that halfway into the album, when the songs' [...] "middling tempos start to bleed together," [...] the group sounds [...] "as if they were striving for a level of maturity that’s not quite within reach." [...] Punknews.org reviewer Adam White called it [...] "a more solemn <b>and</b> <b>paced</b> record," [...] compared to their debut. White noted that it featured [...] "lots of contemplative ballads," [...] all of which [...] "showcas Andrew MacMahon's characteristic piano and smooth vocals." [...] Kristin Roth of Rolling Stone wrote that album [...] "delves into an entirely different world" [...] with its lyrics [...] "explor a darker place, but just what that place is, it's hard to say." ...|$|E

40|$|The Ablate <b>and</b> <b>Pace</b> Trial (APT) was a {{prospective}} registry study of clinical outcomes and survival following ablation <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> therapy for medically refractory atrial fibril-lation. One hundred and fifty-six patients were enrolled at 16 centres in North America. The mean patient age was 66 & 11 years, with mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 48 %& 18 %. Seventy-eight {{percent of the}} patients had structural heart disease. During one year of follow up, multiple measures of quality-of-life showed significant and sustained improvement fol-lowing ablation <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> therapy. Also, left ventricular ejection increased significantly for patients with baseline left ventricular ejection fraction < 45 %. Metabolic exercise testing showed trends toward improved exercise tolerance; however, these did not achieve statistical significance. The one year overall survival was 85 %, with 3 % of patients experiencing sudden death. In summary, this large, non-randomized, trial showed significant improvement in quality of life and left ventricu-lar function following ablation <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> therapy. Abla-tion <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> therapy is a viable strategy for palliative management of patients with medically refractory, highly symptomatic atrial fibrillation...|$|R

2500|$|Concurrent with drawing Iron Man, Heck succeeded Jack Kirby as penciler on the superhero team series The Avengers with issue #9 (Oct. 1964), the {{introduction}} of Wonder Man. The Count Nefaria character was introduced by Lee and Heck four issues later. Heck, who inked his own pencils for many years, transitioned to the [...] "Marvel method" [...] of doing comics [...] in which the penciler plotted <b>and</b> <b>paced</b> {{the details of a}} story based on a synopsis or plot outline from the writer, who would afterward add dialog [...] and was assigned the help of an inker for the first time. He successfully made this adjustment, and went on to make The Avengers, which he drew through issue #40 (May 1967), plus the 1967 annual, one of his signature series.

He was voted onto his fourth consecutive All-Star team in , but needed to be pulled in the second inning after pulling his thigh. The Reds lost Foster for a month, and had been decimated by injuries, but managed to stay in the NL West race during Foster's absence. Shortly after his return, the Reds went on an eight-game winning streak that saw them jump into first place by 1.5 games over the Houston Astros. The Reds held off the Astros to win their first division crown since 1976, but were swept by the Pirates in the 1979 National League Championship Series. Foster's highlight was a game tying home run in game one of the NLCS.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Voigt was {{the oldest}} rider of the World Tour teams at 40 years old when the season started. That did not stop him from going into a long {{breakaway}} on the sixth stage of Paris-Nice. After every rider had been dropped but one, Voigt was beaten in a sprint by Luis Leon Sanchez of the [...] team. In April, Voigt participated to the Tour of the Basque Country, where a peculiar incident occurred. Voigt signed in late for a stage start, then {{had a bit of}} a verbal match against an official who complained about his lateness. He was fined sign: Fr. or SFr. or FS 1,000 Swiss francs for what was described as “comportamiento incorrecto” (bad behavior) in a report. He later had a good showing at the Tour of California, where he came in second of the fifth stage, an individual time trial contested in Bakersfield, 23 seconds behind David Zabriskie. He was also part of breakaways <b>and</b> <b>paced</b> the bunch often. On the Tour de France, he finished in third position of the tenth stage. He was dropped on the slopes of the Col du Grand Colombier, but came back on the four escapees before competing in the final sprint. In August, during a press conference prior to the Tour of Utah, he announced that he would continue racing through the 2013 season. In the same month, Voigt took the fourth stage of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge finishing in Beaver Creek. He attacked his breakaway companions on Independence Pass, which was situated in the first third of the race, and then soloed on to victory with almost three minutes of an advantage over the chasers. He raced more than [...] alone, taking one of the most epic victory of his career.|$|E
