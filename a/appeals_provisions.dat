40|$|In {{the realm}} of {{administrative}} law {{there is a wide}} range of appeal mechanisms available; from the fully judicial, through the quasi-judicial to the non-judicial. Whatever the nature of the appeal mechanism, the principal objective imposed upon it is to provide a means whereby poor decisions made by those charged with the administration of legislation can be remedied. The types of appeals and the composition of appeals bodies varies from State to State and statute to statute. In this article the authors describe the <b>appeals</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Environmental Protection Act 1986 (W.

40|$|This Article {{provides}} an overview of the types of factors that may lead to the decertification of organic products, and the current regulatory scheme to evaluate and adjudicate potential violations. The underlying rationale for the enforcement of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 may lie in protection of the integrity of the product, as well as protection of the environmental system that is integral to its production. However, the risk factors for transitioning the U. S. food economy to a larger market share in order for organic food to reach a broader population could be an unintended disincentive. Part II of this Article discusses the origins of the organic movement. It also delineates the legal framework governing organic production in the United States—the Organic Foods Production Act and National Organic Program regulations. Part II also discusses the requirements and procedures governing the organic certification process, as well as who does and does not need to obtain certification. Lastly, Part II discusses the enforcement and <b>appeals</b> <b>provisions</b> set forth under the Organic Foods Production Act and National Organic Program regulations. Part III of this Article analyzes appeals to the National Organic Program, the majority of which involve the failure to comply with procedural requirements of the Organic Foods Production Act and implementing regulations and the use of prohibited materials in production. Part IV concludes with projections of the continued growth of the organic industry and the impact that various risk factors have on such growth...|$|E

Drawing on the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) case-law, Ofcom's Initial Obligations Code (the Code), and the DEA judicial review decision, namely, BT PLC and Talk Talk PLC v Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills and others, this paper focuses on the three Strasbourg Court principles of equality of arms, admissibility of evidence, and presumption of innocence, {{in an effort to}} determine whether Section 13 of the DEA infringes them, and whether this constitutes a breach of a subscriber's right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR. The paper examines these three ECtHR principles. It contrasts such principles with the Code's provisions, and considers the compatibility of Section 13 of the DEA with Article 6 of the ECHR. It concludes that the DEA subscriber <b>appeal</b> process <b>provisions</b> do indeed infringe these principles, thus constituting a violation of subscribers' right to a fair trial.

40|$|There is {{currently}} no uniform social security dispute resolution system in South Africa {{due to the}} piecemeal fashion in which schemes were established or protection against individual risks regulated. The result is that each statute provides for its own dispute resolution institution(s) and processes. There are also various gaps and challenges in the current social security dispute resolution systems, some of these relating to the uncoordinated and fragmented nature of the system; inaccessibility of some social security institutions; inappropriateness of some current appeal institutions; {{the lack of a}} systematic approach in establishing appeal institutions; a limited scope of jurisdiction and powers of adjudication institutions; inconsistencies in review and/or <b>appeal</b> <b>provisions</b> in various laws; an unavailability of alternative dispute resolution procedures; and an absence of institutional independence of adjudication institutions or forums. The system is therefore in need of reform. In developing an appropriate system, much can be learned from innovative experiences in comparative South African non-social security jurisdictions on the establishment of effective and efficient dispute resolution frameworks. Dispute resolution systems in the labour relations, business competition regulation and consumer protection jurisdictions have been established to realise the constitutional rights of their users (especially the rights of access to justice, to a fair trial and to just administrative action). They thus provide a benchmark {{for the development of the}} South African social security dispute resolution system...|$|R
40|$|In {{its recent}} Wilderness Society v. Rey decision, the Ninth Circuit {{addressed}} the difficult {{question of when}} a statute may establish a right to informational standing. The decision interpreted the Supreme Court’s decision in Summers v. Earth Island Institute, and concluded that general notice and <b>appeal</b> <b>provisions</b> in a statute that do not establish an explicit public right to information from the government are insufficient to establish informational standing. The Wilderness Society decision indirectly raised the broader question of when Congress may modify common law injury requirements or even Article III constitutional standing requirements. Although the Wilderness Society decision relied on the implications of Summers, the Ninth Circuit {{would have been better}} advised to examine Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinions in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife and Summers. His opinions suggest that Congress has significant authority to expand citizen suit standing as long as it carefully defines the statutory injuries it seeks to remedy. Wilderness Society is important because it is the first court of appeals decision that attempts to reconcile Summers and FEC v. Akins, the crucial informational standing case. Although the result in Wilderness Society may be correct, the Ninth Circuit failed to grasp the full complexities of the Supreme Court’s standing jurisprudence. This Article argues how to best interpret Lujan, Summers, and Akins in determining how much authority Congress has to establish informational standing and other standing rights that have divided lower federal courts...|$|R

50|$|The {{argument}} is fallacious.

We reverse {{the judgment of the}} District Court {{on the issue of the}} standing of the Democratic Party and the DNC, but affirm its judgment as to the constitutional validity of § 9012(f)."The majority concluded that the expenditure limit, regardless of how much the limit is set to, under the Federal Election Campaign Act is an infringement on the First Amendment and freedom of association. The court asserted that: [...] “Allowing the presentation of political views while forbidding the expenditure of more than $1,000 to present them is much like allowing a speaker in a public hall to express his views while denying him the use of an amplifying system.”The majority also concluded that claims made by those who were in support of the FECA's limitation of expenditures regarding the motive to avoid corruption within elections did not hold, the Court concluded: “Section 9012(f)'s limitation on independent expenditures by political committees is constitutionally infirm, absent any indication that such expenditures have a tendency to corrupt or to give the appearance of corruption."The court noted that Section 9012(f) shall not restrict these groups from participation in political debates or campaigns, despite Congress' opinion. The court found that these groups were simply expressing the First Amendment, asserting that these groups: [...] "Are quite different from the traditional organizations organized for economic gain corporations and labor organizations that may properly be prohibited from making contributions to political candidates.”The court held that the limitation of expenditures in excess of $1,000, or in any amount, violated the First Amendment. The majority ruled that the Federal Election Campaign Act was unconstitutional, and any individual is free to express participation in a Presidential campaign or election. Congress previously asserted it necessary for these political action groups to be withheld, but the court finalized the decision that this is unconstitutional in the majority opinion.|$|R
40|$|At a quite {{fundamental}} level, {{the very}} {{way in which}} Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) may envisage its future usually captured in the semantic shift from PSB to Public Service Media (PSM) is at stake when considering {{the recent history of}} public value discourse and the public value test. The core Reithian PSB idea assumed that public value would be created through the application of core principles of universality of availability and <b>appeal,</b> <b>provision</b> for minorities, education of the public, distance from vested interests, quality programming standards, program maker independence, and fostering of national culture and the public sphere. On the other hand, the philosophical import of the public value test is that potentially any excursion into the provision of new media services needs to be justified ex ante. In this era of New Public Management, greater transparency and accountability, and the proposition that resources for public value deliverables be contestable and not sequestered in public sector institutions, what might be the new Archimedean point around which a contemporised normativity for PSM be built? This paper will argue for the innovation imperative as an organising principle for contemporary PSM. This may appear counterintuitive, as it is precisely PSB’s predilection for innovating in new media services (in online, mobile, and social media) that has produced the constraining apparatus of the ex ante/public value/Drei-Stufen-Test in Europe, based on principles of competitive neutrality and transparency in the application of public funds for defined and limited public benefit. However, I argue that a commitment to innovation can define as complementary to, rather than as competitive ‘crowding out’, the new products and services that PSM can, and should, be delivering into a post-scarcity, superabundant all-media marketplace. The evidence presented in this paper for this argument is derived mostly from analysis of PSM in the Australian media ecology. While no PSB outside Europe is subject to a formal public value test, the crowding out arguments are certainly run in Australia, particularly by powerful commercial interests for whom free news is a threat to monetising quality news journalism. Take right wing opinion leader, herself a former ABC Board member, Judith Sloan: ‘… the recent expansive nature of the ABC – all those television stations, radio stations and online offerings – is actually squeezing activity that would otherwise be undertaken by the private sector. From partly correcting market failure, the ABC is now causing it. We are now dealing with a case of unfair competition and wasted taxpayer funds’ (The Drum, 1 August [URL] But I argue that the crowding out argument is difficult to sustain in Australia because of the PSB’s non-dominant position and the fact that much of innovation generated by the two PSBs, the ABC and the SBS, has not been imitated by or competed for by the commercials. The paper will bring cases forward, such as SBS’ Go Back to Where you Came From (2011) as an example of product innovation, and a case study of process and organisational innovation which also has resulted in specific product and service innovation – the ABC’s Innovation Unit. In summary, {{at least some of the}} old Reithian dicta, along with spectrum scarcity and market failure arguments, have faded or are fading. Contemporary PSM need to justify their role in the system, and to society, in terms of innovation...|$|R
40|$|I {{argue that}} nature {{ought to be}} {{preserved}} because its existence is required for a particularly significant constituent of human well-being, a constituent so significant that the means to it [...] provision of and ready access to indigenous and ecologically sound nature [...] are worthy of being secured by legal right. The constituent is a complex cognitively-grounded and perceptually-induced emotive experience best characterized as an aesthetic one. In the current policy and social climate this characterization will to most policymakers and concerned citizens hardly convey its significance for either well-being or the preservationist cause. Hence the need for its presentation and defense. This view of the justification of environmental preservation is different from those common in the environmental ethics literature and in environmental policy. It includes neither an appeal to nature's purported intrinsic value nor an <b>appeal</b> to <b>provisioning,</b> regulating, or supporting ecosystem services such as clean air and water, climate control, and biomass production, though these are secured secondarily if indigenous and ecologically sound nature is primarily secured {{as a means to}} the experience. 	 The dissertation consists of eight self-contained but interrelated chapters in which I argue for the following: interest/instrumental theory of rights; neo-sentimentalist buck-passing account of nature's value; merging of the scientific-cognitivist conception of the appropriate aesthetic experience of nature with a wonder-based account; the consistency of J. S. Mill's harm principle with the principle of utility in the context of Mill's qualitative hedonism; expansion of the philosophical aesthetician's self-understanding of his task to include the public policy-relevant aspects of his discipline in terms of the contribution that appropriate, merited aesthetic experience can make to well-being; neo-sentimentalist buck-passing account of aesthetic experience and aesthetic value...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of learning Chinese for SA (South Asian) {{students in their}} integration into Hong Kong society has widely been recognized in government documents and academic research, and the great difficulties they encounter when learning Chinese has also drawn increasing attention in recent years. Nevertheless, how to overcome these difficulties and best help them with Chinese language study still remains a problem. This paper draws on a study in a project that comprises a questionnaire survey among 387 SA students in a Hong Kong secondary school and some in-depth interviews with two principals, eight teachers and a few students. Findings indicate the following underlying reasons for South Asian students’ low achievements in learning Chinese: lack of motivation in learning Chinese; absence of achievement targets like CSL curriculum and public examination; lack of appropriate teaching resources; lack of effective government support; and shortage of well-trained CSL teachers. As {{a response to the}} participants’ <b>appeal</b> for <b>provision</b> of appropriate learning targets and CSL textbooks, we create a framework of study and a systematic series of theme-based learning units and these materials are put into trial use for several months. A common emphasis in their views is that the CSL learning materials for SA students should aim to develop their Chinese language proficiency according to their actual needs, and hence be able to engage the learner in an active role in using and learning of the language. It is hoped that through this research and development we can better motivate the SA students to learn Chinese, fully engage them in learning activities and ultimately enhance their Chinese learning outcomes...|$|R
40|$|In {{its recent}} The Wilderness Society v. Rey decision, the Ninth Circuit {{addressed}} the difficult {{question of when}} a statute may establish a right to informational standing. The D. C. Circuit and the Sixth Circuit had previously reached different conclusions about whether environmental statutes promoting public participation or requiring environmental assessments in certain circumstances create a right to informational standing. The Ninth Circuit in its The Wilderness Society decision interpreted the Supreme Court’s 2009 decision in Summers v. Earth Island Institute, which explicitly narrowed procedural rights standing, as implicitly narrowing standing rights in general and concluded that general notice and <b>appeal</b> <b>provisions</b> in a statute {{that are designed to}} promote public participation, but do not establish an explicit public right to information from the government are insufficient to establish informational standing. The Wilderness Society decision indirectly raised the broader question of when may Congress modify common law injury requirements or even Article III constitutional standing requirements for a concrete injury. That question in turn raises broader separation of powers questions. While The Wilderness Society decision relied on the implications of Summers to limit informational standing, the Ninth Circuit would have been better advised to examine Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinions in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife [hereinafter Defenders] and Summers as a guide to the Supreme Court’s approach to when Congress may confer standing rights. Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinions in Defenders and Summers suggest that Congress has significant authority to expand citizen suit standing as long as it carefully defines the statutory injuries it seeks to remedy through such suits. In FEC v. Akins, the Supreme Court in an opinion by Justice Breyer, joined by five other justices including Justice Kennedy, endorsed informational injuries as potentially sufficient for standing. Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by two other justices, arguing that the plaintiffs did not have standing because their injury was common to the public at large and did not cause them a particularized injury essential for standing. Lower court decisions have divided when plaintiffs in environmental cases have sought standing based on an alleged informational injury resulting from the government or a private defendant’s failure to provide information about their environmental impacts. In Lyng, the D. C. Circuit questioned but did not decide, whether informational injury alone can meet the Article III injury in fact requirement, although the case was decided before Akins.

The Wilderness Society is important because it is the first court of appeals decision that attempts to reconcile Summers and Akins. The result in The Wilderness Society that Congress must explicitly establish informational standing rights may be correct, but the Ninth Circuit failed to grasp the full complexities of the Supreme Court’s standing jurisprudence by focusing only at how Summers might limit Akins without examining Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinions in Defenders and in Summers in understanding how far Congress may go in conferring standing rights for the public. Because he was the key swing vote in Defenders and Summers and {{was a member of the}} Akins majority, Justice Kennedy’s analysis of standing issues is crucial in understanding the Supreme Court’s standing jurisprudence and how the Court might address the informational standing issues that have divided the lower courts. This Article argues how to best interpret Defenders, Summers and Akins in determining how much authority Congress has to establish informational standing and other standing rights that have divided lower federal courts...|$|R
