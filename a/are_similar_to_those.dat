5|$|Dopaminergic {{medications}} {{that are used}} to treat Parkinson's disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like gambling and sexual activity.

These teeth <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of Afrotarsius and Eosimiidae, and differ only in details of the chewing surface.

5|$|In 2014, a {{team from}} the University of Cambridge began {{conducting}} a study in a short, double track section of unused tunnel near the platforms where a newly built tunnel for Crossrail is situated almost two metres beneath.
