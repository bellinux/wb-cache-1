5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} full command as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> getaway, and the boat was quickly {{out of sight of the}} land.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years later}} public attitudes had changed little. When Ian Harvey, a junior Foreign Office {{minister}} in Harold Macmillan's government, {{was found guilty}} of indecent behaviour with a Coldstream Guardsman in November 1958, he lost both his ministerial job and his parliamentary seat at Harrow East. He was ostracised by the Conservative Party and by most of his former friends, and never again held a position in public life. Thus, anyone entering politics at that time knew that revelations of homosexual activity would likely bring such a career to <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> end.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} arrival in Australia, it was {{reported}} in the British media that Fowler would be making <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> return to his homeland and sign for League One side Tranmere Rovers, who had just appointed Fowler's former Liverpool teammate John Barnes as manager. However, Fowler was quick to dismiss talk of a quick return to England. When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it was reported that Tranmere had approached Fowler about becoming player-manager, but these reports too were dismissed.|$|E

Because the Taser used {{gunpowder}} to launch the darts, the federal government considered it a firearm, a classification that ruled out a civilian market and also discouraged police and military sales.|$|R

5|$|Since their {{election}} to the Football League in 1894, Leicester have spent much of their history within the top two tiers of English football. Leicester have played outside the top two tiers only once in their history to date; during the 2008–09 season they played in League One, the third tier of English football, after relegation from the Championship the season prior. However, they made <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> return to the second tier, as they were promoted as champions in the 2008–09 season. The club have never played lower than England's third tier.|$|E
5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> victory.|$|E
5|$|The uprising's {{timing was}} fixed at 17 July, at 5:00p.m.; this was {{agreed to by}} {{the leader of the}} Carlists, Manuel Fal Condé. However, the timing was changed: the men in Spanish Morocco were to rise up at 5:00a.m. and those in Spain itself {{starting}} exactly a day later, so control of Spanish Morocco could be achieved and forces sent to Iberia from Morocco to coincide with the risings there. The rising was intended to be <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> coup d'état, but the government retained control of most of the country.|$|E

5|$|The willie wagtail {{is almost}} always on the move and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments during {{daylight}} hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E
5|$|To Flores, Brazil's {{military}} operations against the Blanco government represented a priceless opportunity, {{since he had}} been unable to achieve any lasting results during the rebellion. He entered talks with Saraiva, winning the Brazilian government over, after promising to settle their claims refused by the Blanco government. The Brazilian plenipotentiary minister gave instructions to Tamandaré to form a joint offensive with the Colorado leader and overthrow the Blancos. On 20 October, after <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> exchange of letters, Flores and the Brazilian vice-admiral formed a secret alliance.|$|E
5|$|Abantiades latipennis, {{known as}} the Pindi moth, is a species of moth in the Hepialidae family. It may also be {{referred}} to as <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> moth or a ghost moth, as this is a common name associated with Hepialidae. Endemic to Australia and identified in 1932, it is most populous in temperate rainforest where eucalypti are prevalent, as the larvae feed primarily on the roots of these trees. Females lay eggs during flight in a scattering fashion. The larvae live for over eighteen months underground, while adult moths survive for approximately one week, as they have no mouthparts with which to feed. The moths are preyed upon by a number of predators, including bats and owls. Brown in colour overall, males are paler and the identifying silver bars of the male's wings are more prominent than those of the female's, with dark margins. Male adults are generally smaller.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 15 May a German {{messenger}} reached The Hague, inviting Winkelman to Rijsoord for {{a meeting}} with von Küchler to negotiate the articles of a written capitulation document. Both quickly agreed on most conditions, Winkelman declaring to have surrendered army, naval and air forces. When von Küchler demanded that pilots still fighting for the allies should be treated as francs-tireurs—seen by the Germans as guerilla fighters outside the laws of war—Winkelman's refusal made it clear to the Germans that only the armed forces in the homeland, with the exception of Zealand, would capitulate, not the country itself. On other points <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> agreement was reached and the document was signed at 10:15.|$|E
5|$|Felipe Massa {{tried to}} make up places after his pit lane-start, but was caught in midfield battles. He went into the pit lane {{simultaneously}} with Felipe Nasr in front and Pastor Maldonado behind him. <b>A</b> <b>swift</b> stop by the Lotus pit crew meant that Maldonado {{was able to get}} out ahead and gain two positions. Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson was running eighth when he came into the pit lane on lap 26. A 27-second pit stop due to problems with the front left tyre meant that he fell out of reach for a points finish. Carlos Sainz Jr. retired from the race right after exiting pit lane on lap 30, due to an issue with his front left wheel. His Toro Rosso teammate Max Verstappen joined him on the sidelines on lap 34 due to an electrical failure.|$|E
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E

5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was fully}} bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} likely <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus were {{less than half the}} length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Forbes was {{accepted}} as a medical student at the University of Aberdeen, graduating in 1944 and taking up the post of Junior Casualty Officer at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. After <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> progression to Senior Casualty Officer, he began {{to work as a}} general practitioner in Alford, Aberdeenshire in 1945. In addition to the normal work of a rural doctor, he was called upon to act as a medical officer for a large number of German prisoners of war who were held in the area in 1946, due to his command of the language.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{after losing}} and then regaining the title from rival Leilani Kai at the inaugural WrestleMania, Richter was {{scheduled}} to defend her title at Madison Square Garden on November 25 of that same year against a mysterious masked opponent known only as The Spider. During the match, The Spider broke from the pre-scripted events and pinned Richter's shoulders to the mat. The referee—who was in on the plan—delivered <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> three count, despite Richter kicking out after a count of one. Richter ignored the bell and continued to attack the Spider, unmasking the new champion to reveal that it was The Fabulous Moolah in disguise.|$|E

5|$|Leicester {{were viewed}} {{as one of the}} favourites for {{promotion}} in the 2011–12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent. Three weeks later, Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Eriksson's successor. Pearson would go on to lead the Foxes to a sixth-place finish in the 2012–13 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. However, Leicester lost the playoff semi-final 3–2 on aggregate to Watford after Anthony Knockaert missed a late penalty and Troy Deeney scored right at the end after <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> counterattack from a Manuel Almunia double save.|$|E
5|$|Lenin {{expected}} Russia's aristocracy and bourgeoisie {{to oppose}} his government, but {{he believed that}} the numerical superiority of the lower classes, coupled with the Bolsheviks' ability to effectively organise them, guaranteed <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> victory in any conflict. In this, he failed to anticipate the intensity of the violent opposition to Bolshevik rule in Russia. The ensuing Russian Civil War pitted the pro-Bolshevik Reds against the anti-Bolshevik Whites, but also encompassed ethnic conflicts on Russia's borders and conflict between both Red and White armies and local peasant groups, the Green armies, throughout the former Empire. Accordingly, various historians have seen the civil war as representing two distinct conflicts: one between the revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, by late June Riel {{was back}} in Manitoba and was soon persuaded to run {{as a member of}} {{parliament}} for the electoral district of Provencher. However, following the early September defeat of George-Étienne Cartier in his home riding in Quebec, Riel stood aside so that Cartier—on record as being in favour of amnesty for Riel—might secure a seat in Provencher. Cartier won by acclamation, but Riel's hopes for <b>a</b> <b>swift</b> resolution to the amnesty question were dashed following Cartier's death on 20 May 1873. In the ensuing by-election in October 1873, Riel ran unopposed as an Independent, although he had again fled, a warrant having been issued for his arrest in September. Lépine was not so lucky; he was captured and faced trial.|$|E
