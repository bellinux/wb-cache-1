40|$|Piping is an {{important}} failure mechanism of flood defense structures. <b>A</b> <b>dike</b> <b>fails</b> due to piping when a head difference causes first the uplift of an inland blanket layer, and subsequently soil erosion due to a ground water flow. Spatial variability of subsoil parameters causes the probability of piping failure to increase, often to unacceptable levels. The general research question is: How can we incorporate spatial variability in a flood defense system design dealing with the piping failure mechanism? The question in solved in three steps: first by quantifying the spatial variability in subsoil parameters, second by assessing the influence of this spatial variability on the piping mechanism and third by analyzing optimal decisions to deal with unacceptable situations. There are two new models presented in this thesis. The first model, is a simple design model that uses historical failures to assess the piping safety. The second model describes the formation of piping erosion paths in spatial variable soils. Especially the second model might potentially lead to improvements in piping modeling and potentially in cost reductions. The main conclusions from this thesis is that the piping mechanism and influence of spatial variability in the subsoil are a very significant threat to flood defenses. However, performing local soil measurements in combination with local dike improvements can be a cost-effective method to deal with unacceptable piping failure probabilities.

30|$|The {{severity}} of economic loss {{is the end}} consequence that results {{from a combination of}} different conditions. The starting point for assigning uncertainty to economic loss estimates is to get better estimates of the upper and lower confidence bounds on the distribution of extreme events and their likely impacts. An analysis on the vulnerability of physical infrastructure systems will then provide some evidence on the likely impacts that may occur from an extreme event. Uncertainty analysis at this stage must also allow for non-linear discrete events, where a sudden change in conditions may result in sudden catastrophic failure. An example of this type of failure is the failure of <b>a</b> <b>dike.</b> Everything is fine and no damage occurs until the point when the <b>dike</b> <b>fails.</b> The final step to incorporating uncertainty into economic loss estimates is to understand the uncertainty of the recovery process. This will involve a good understanding of ‘hard’ factors such as access to physical capital, working and reliable infrastructure systems and an ability to raise finance. It will also involve understanding soft factors such as social support systems, political will and social cohesion. The more uncertainty there is surrounding these factors, the more imprecise and the larger will be the confidence bounds around final economic loss estimates. Once uncertainty and risk are appropriately accounted for informed choices can be made about reducing risk and assessing different mitigation or adaptation strategies.|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>dike</b> is <b>an</b> {{intrusion}} into pre-existing rock by an igneous body. Since the magnetism of the pre-existing rock is usually {{significantly different from}} that of the intrusion magnetometers can be used to detect the presence of <b>a</b> <b>dike.</b> The aim of this project was to detect the presence of dikes at two locations in Ontario near the French River. The first location was along Highway 11 near Trout Creek where <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> is visible in the recent rock-cut. This location was chosen to act as a control for the second location on Highway 69 near Nobel. Identifying <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> here would allow for the westward extension of <b>a</b> known <b>dike</b> system. <b>A</b> Proton Precession Magnetometer (PPM) was used. It measures the total strength of the Earth’s magnetic field at a single point. The Earth’s magnetic field is affected by magnetic bodies in the subsurface. Therefore, a disturbance of the magnetic field strength allows us to infer the presence of a magnetic body at various depths. Size and other properties of the magnetic body can be obtained by fitting the measurements to computational models. The Trout Creek dike appeared to be a clear magnetic anomaly, 90 m wide with an amplitude of 1. 7 x 103 nT. This fits a model of <b>a</b> thin <b>dike</b> 75 m wide extending 85 m deep. At Nobel we did not confirm the existence of <b>a</b> <b>dike,</b> only finding small anomalies of less than 1. 3 x 103 nT, likely caused by artifacts such as water pipes.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>dike</b> is {{designed}} for an extreme event which greatly exceed the situation under daily circumstances. The expected loading during such an event is, however, difficult to estimate. Inherent uncertainties in nature and epistemic uncertainties in models and statistical data impede a clear verdict about the exact loading on <b>a</b> <b>dike.</b> Consequently, incorporating uncertainties in <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> design can have a great impact. One of the aims, following the Delta Decisions of 2015, {{is to improve the}} way uncertainties are incorporated in future dike assessment and design models. Conventionally, models become more computationally intensive with the incorporation of each additional uncertainties. Therefore, it is useful to only account for most influential uncertainties. Until new models are established, the Ontwerpinstrumentarium (OI 2014) is released for the transitional period. The guideline explains for which extreme event <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> needs to be designed. Looking in more detail to the OI 2104, questions can be asked about the underlying assumptions. In this thesis, a modified method of the OI 2014 is exhibited by looking into <b>a</b> <b>dike’s</b> location specific dominant failure mechanisms. In so, <b>a</b> better cost-optimal <b>dike</b> design can be realized. Also, a sensitivity is carried out in which currently recognized uncertainties are investigated using the PC-Ring model. In addition, a new statistical wind uncertainty model is built, wherein uncertainty is integrated a priori under the assumption that correlations between random variables do not play a significant role. The model’s implications are evaluated using the Hydra-Zoet model. From this research three main findings can be deduced. Firstly, the proposed methods of the OI 2014 do not lead to <b>a</b> cost-optimal <b>dike</b> design. Secondly, addition of statistical wind uncertainty leads to a significant increase of hydraulic boundary conditions for lake systems. Lastly, the prior integration of any random variable has many computational benefits. Hydraulic EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
