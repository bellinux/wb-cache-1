40|$|Recently, {{exposure}} to formaldehyde has {{appeared as a}} major concern since it has been listed as a human carcinogen. Conventional methods for its long-term monitoring are not feasible due to their high operational cost, long analysis time and the requirement of specialized equipment and staff. In this paper, we develop an electronic nose, containing an array of commercially available low cost Figaro gas sensors, to support autonomous and long-term monitoring of formaldehyde. Hardware friendly gas quantification without requiring any manual tuning of parameters is the major challenge with the electronic nose. We handle this challenge by treating it as a classification problem because data acquisition at continuously varying concentrations may incur large expense {{and a great deal}} of time. Instead, twenty different concentrations of formaldehyde with 0. 25 ppm increment step in the target range between 0. 25 to 5 ppm, spanning commonly found formaldehyde levels in indoor and outdoor environments, are input to obtain its signatures in order to quantify/classify its levels within this target range. A computationally efficient bio-inspired spike latency coding scheme, in which spike latencies corresponding to sensitivity patterns of the sensors in the <b>array</b> <b>shift</b> with the change in concentration, is targeted for this purpose. However, stochastic variability in the spike latency patterns, corresponding to repeated {{exposure to}} the same formaldehyde concentration level, is observed. We target two Bayesian inference methods, namely multivariate Bayesian and naive Bayes, to express the uncertainty about the spike latency patterns in terms of a probability encoding framework. These methods do not require any manual tuning of parameters, in contrast to other state of the art methods. A best performance of 95. 75 % is achieved with the naive Bayes method on the experimentally obtained data set of formaldehyde...|$|E

The numerical simulation shows that the result of the wave-plate phase shifting method is consistent with that of the traditional four-step phase shifting method.

In order to accommodate for these changes, equalizers are used to track the Impulse Responses (IRs) and compensate the intersymbol interference (ISI).

Using formulas recently published and their implementation in the Flexible Atomic Code for M 1 -transition <b>array</b> <b>shifts</b> and widths, absorption and emission spectra arising from transitions inside the 3 *n complex of highly-charged tungsten ions are analyzed. A comparison of magnetic-dipole transitions with electric-dipole (E 1) transitions shows that, while the latter are better described by transition array formulas, M 1 absorption and emission structures reveal some insufficiency of these formulas. It is demonstrated that the detailed spectra account for significantly richer structures than those predicted by the transition array formalism. This is due to the fact that M 1 transitions may occur between levels inside the same relativistic configuration, while such inner configuration transitions are not accounted for by the currently available averaging expression. In addition, because of configuration interaction, transition processes involving more than one electron jump, such as 3 p 1 / 23 d 5 / 2 → 3 p 3 / 23 d 3 / 2, are possible but not accounted for in the transition array formulas.
