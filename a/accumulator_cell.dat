30|$|The {{basic form}} of the Hough Transform, {{also known as the}} Standard Hough Transform (SHT) [13], has been {{established}} as the main technique for straight line detection [14 – 16]. The line detection problem is transformed by the SHT into a peak detection problem.

The basic building block of an accumulator unit is the adder cell and data storage registers e. g. Flip-Flop (FF). The operational speed of FF determines the correctness and accuracy of the functionality of 12 BDA. The high-speed full adders that use low power consumption is a fundamental arithmetic operation {{that can never be}} neglected in accumulator unit, and {{it is one of the}} speed-limiting elements. The efficiency of the accumulator unit is determined by the adder cell taken in to account. In this paper, a 12 -Bit pipelined <b>accumulator</b> <b>cell</b> optimized for low power and high speed operation are proposed. Update rates of 150 MHz are achieved by careful choice of architecture. The static, D-type flip flops used in the pipeline architecture are the dominant source of power dissipation. Hence the refresh-every-cycle operation of accumulators is exploited by using dynamic delay elements to reduce power consumption The accumulator unit is simulated with mentor graphics using the 130 nm CMOS technology at different supply voltages ranges.

40|$|The Hough {{transform}} is {{a robust}} method for detecting discontinuous patterns in noisy images. When it {{is applied to}} the detection of a straight line, represented by the normal parameters, the transform provides only the length of the normal and the angle it makes with the axis.
