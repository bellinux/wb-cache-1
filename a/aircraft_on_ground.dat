25|$|During {{the course}} of the conflict, the PAF enjoyed {{qualitative}} superiority over the IAF because most of the jets in IAF's fleet were of World War II-vintage. Despite this, the IAF was able to prevent the PAF from gaining air superiority over conflict zones. By the time the conflict had ended, Both sides claimed victory in the air war; Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate. More than 60% of IAF's air combat losses took place during the disastrous battles over Kalaikunda and Pathankot. However, the IAF lost most of its <b>aircraft</b> <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> and the attrition rate (losses per 100 sorties) of the IAF stood at 1.49 while PAF's attrition rate was 2.16, because the IAF has larger number of aircraft with higher number of take off and landing sorties.|$|E
25|$|The Mikoyan MiG-29K {{program was}} revived by Russia in {{response}} to the decision of the Indian Navy to acquire the Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov. As reported by MiG Bureau, the Indian Navy's association with the MiG-29K began in Apr 2002 when a team led by Commander Gupta reached Moscow to evaluate the MiG-29K prototype for possible induction into the Indian Navy. The Team evaluated the <b>aircraft</b> <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> {{as well as in the}} air (the flight evaluation was conducted by a Navy Test Pilot Commander Ahuja). Some other aircraft were also evaluated but the MiG-29K was chosen. On 20 January 2004, the Indian Navy signed a contract for 12 single-seat MiG-29K and 4 two-seat MiG-29KUB. The first MIG-29K for the Indian Navy took flight on 22 January 2007. The MIG-29 KUB (two-seat trainer) is similar to the MIG-29K but with reduced operational range. The aircraft will be fielded on the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya.|$|E

On the morning of 8 November, Furiouss Seafires strafed the Vichy French airfield at Tafraoui, destroying three <b>aircraft</b> <b>on</b> the <b>ground</b> and shooting down one Dewoitine D.520 fighter, the first air-to-air kill by a Seafire. Eight Albacores, escorted by Sea Hurricanes from two escort carriers, attacked the field at La Senia.

50|$|Beginning in 1955, SAC {{also moved}} {{a portion of}} its bomber and aerial {{refueling}} aircraft to a 24-hour alert status, either {{on the ground or}} airborne. By 1960, fully one third of SAC's bombers and aerial refueling aircraft were on 24-hour alert, with those crews and aircraft not already airborne ready to take off from designated alert sites at their respective bases within fifteen minutes. Bomber <b>aircraft</b> <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> alert were armed with nuclear weapons while aerial tanker aircraft were sufficiently fueled to provide maximum combat fuel offload to the bombers.|$|E
50|$|Another area of {{collaboration}} between Boeing and Lamborghini researched at the ACSL focused on composite repair technologies. For the 787 aircraft, Boeing utilizes specialized technicians and engineers, called <b>Aircraft</b> <b>on</b> <b>Ground</b> crews, {{to fly out}} to a damaged aircraft and perform structural repairs on the composite airframe. The ACSL adopted, modified, and transferred these technologies, processes, and equipment to Lamborghini for use on the Aventador supercar. Lamborghini trained a similar team of specialized technicians, called the Flying Doctors, {{and became the first}} automaker to be certified for structural repair of composites by the German TÜV and insurance companies worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>on</b> <b>Ground</b> or AOG {{is a term}} in {{aviation}} maintenance indicating that a problem is serious enough to prevent an aircraft from flying. Generally there is a rush to acquire the parts to put the aircraft (A/C) back into service, and prevent further delays or cancellations of the planned itinerary. AOG applies to any aviation materials or spare parts that are needed immediately for an aircraft to return to service. AOG suppliers refer qualified personnel and dispatch the parts required to repair the aircraft for an immediate return to service. AOG also is used to describe critical shipments for parts or materials for aircraft [...] "out of service" [...] or OTS at a location.|$|E
