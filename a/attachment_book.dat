50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{target of}} child rearing is, according to Sears, happiness. Similar to the German catholic Albert Wunsch, Sears therefore ranks among those parenting advisors whose philosophies reflect stray {{aspects of their}} religious beliefs, but result in a purely worldly target. In {{the year of the}} publication of the <b>Attachment</b> Parenting <b>Book,</b> Wendy Mogel, by contrast, suggested her own very influential concept of character education that was straightforwardly based on her Jewish faith (The Blessings of a Skinned Knee, 2001).|$|R

40|$|E-readers, or devices {{designed}} {{primarily for}} reading e-books, {{are taking the}} world by storm. Several papers in library studies and education have examined e-book consumption for academic reading. However, no previous marketing study has investigated consumers’ adoption of e-readers for pleasure reading. We address this gap by testing an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with emotional attachment (TAME) in this context. Consumers’ <b>attachment</b> to paper <b>books</b> is proposed {{as a barrier to}} their adoption of e-readers. This speaks to a key deficiency of the TAM, being its focus on cognition at the expense of consumer emotion. A three-phase study finds support for the TAME, with 64 % of the variance explained in consumers’ intentions to adopt e-readers. Emotional <b>attachment</b> to paper <b>books</b> is found to be weakly and negatively associated with consumers’ attitude toward using e-readers. The qualitative findings suggest that e-reader adoption may not involve a binary choice between paper and e-formats. <br /...|$|R

50|$|William Smith Shaw {{was born}} to John and Elizabeth Shaw in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on August 12, 1788. He had two siblings, Elizabeth (1780-1798) and Abigail (1790-1859). “He very early {{discovered}} a strong <b>attachment</b> for <b>books.</b> Able to read before he could distinctly articulate the name of them, nothing afforded him greater pleasure, than some little volume, suited to his comprehension.”Shaw matriculated in Harvard College in July 1794 and graduated with the Class of 1798. Immediately after his graduation he moved to Philadelphia to become private secretary to his uncle, President John Adams. He returned to Boston after Adams' defeat by Thomas Jefferson and in April 1801 began the study of law {{in the offices of}} William Sullivan. He was admitted an attorney at the Court of Common Pleas in Suffolk County in April 1804 and in the spring of 1806 became a Clerk of the District Court of Massachusetts.|$|R

5000|$|In 1993, William Sears and Martha Sears {{published}} The Baby Book {{which became}} the first comprehensive manual for AP-parents and which was occasionally dubbed [...] "the attachment parenting bible". The first attachment parenting organization, Attachment Parenting International, formed in 1994 in Alpharetta, Georgia and was founded by Lysa Parker and Barbara Nicholson. The first book that carried the term attachment parenting in the title was written by Tammy Frissell-Deppe, a mother who gave an account of her personal experiences and of those of her friends and acquaintances. In 1999, blogger Katie Allison Granju followed with another book, to which William Sears contributed a foreword, before he, together with Martha Sears, published his own work, The <b>Attachment</b> Parenting <b>Book</b> in 2001. All three books stood - with their opposition against a crude behavioristic infant anthropology - {{in the tradition of}} Spock, but radicalized the concept of a contingency-oriented parenting on the one hand, and incorporated Liedloff’s idea of an instinct-guided resp. [...] "natural" [...] childrearing on the other hand.|$|R

In the following years, Professor Sanz Fuentes has published also four other documents with regard to Buron Hospital. Finally, Alvárez Castrillón, edited, in 2008, 605 more parchments as <b>attachments</b> to the <b>book</b> «La Comarca de los Oscos en la Edad Media, poblamiento, economía y poder», and in 2011, he edited 293 more documents from 1139 to 1300, Colección Diplomática del Monasterio de Santa María de Villanueva de Oscos, (1139-1300).|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} in the 1940s, psychologists such als Abraham Maslow shaped {{detailed}} models of the human needs; ever since, scientists have made {{a clear distinction between}} needs {{on the one hand and}} desires on the other hand. In 2000, T. Berry Brazelton, a pioneer in the field of newborn psychology, and child psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan published their book The Irreducible Needs of Children, in which they re-assessed the term for pediatrics. When the Sears published their <b>Attachment</b> Parenting <b>Book</b> one year later, they responded neither to Maslow nor to Brazelton and Greenspan, but used the word need merely in a colloquial sense. Although they stressed that parents must distinguish between needs and desires of children, in particular of older children, they denied their readers a guideline of how to tell needs and desires apart. With a view to infants, they believe that needs and desires are plainly identical. In general, they use both terms synonymously. With a view to toddlers, they often phrase it: a child is not ready yet (to do without breastfeeding, without co-sleeping, etc.); but even in contexts like these, they speak of needs, too.|$|R
40|$|The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) aims to {{understand}} consumers’ adoption of new technologies. Some 30 years after TAM was first proposed, {{it is still}} widely used today. This paper proposes an extended version of the TAM, with the primary addition to it being the construct of consumers’ emotional attachment to an existing product. The expanded TAM, Technology Acceptance Model with Emotional Attachment (TAME), {{is applied to the}} understudied area of e-book reader technology and its adoption by consumers who read for pleasure versus for academic purposes, as {{has been the focus of}} past research on e-book readers. The extended model considers consumers’ emotional <b>attachment</b> to paper <b>books</b> (pbooks) as a likely barrier to the take up of e-book reader technology. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Contents: Preface and acknowledgements; 1. Introduction - {{belonging}} and local attachment; 2. The culture of local xenophobia; 3. Settlement, parochial {{belonging and}} entitlement; 4. Rural societies and their marriage patterns; 5. 'A cruel kindness': parish out-door relief, {{and the new}} poor law; 6. Nailed to the church door? Parish overseers and the new poor law; 7. Three centuries of new parishes; 8. 'Of this parish': gravestones, belonging and local attachment; 9. Conclusion - belonging, parish and community; Select bibliography. Summary: What role did the parish play in people's lives in England and Wales between 1700 and the mid-twentieth century? By comparison with globalisation and its dislocating effects, the book stresses how important parochial belonging once was. Professor Snell discusses themes such as settlement law and practice, marriage patterns, cultures of local xenophobia, the continuance of out-door relief in people's own parishes under the new poor law, the many new parishes of the period and their effects upon people's local <b>attachments.</b> The <b>book</b> highlights the continuing vitality of the parish as a unit in people's lives, and the administration associated with it. It employs a variety of historical methods, and makes important contributions {{to the history of}} welfare, community identity and belonging. It is highly relevant to the modern themes of globalisation, de-localisation, and the decline of community, helping to set such changes and their consequences into local historical perspective.

40|$|Most library studies thematically {{related to}} {{electronic}} books don't consider readers of electronic books. Only {{in recent years}} librarians conduct studies in which they {{want to find out}} readers' opinions about the possibilities, advantages and disadvantages of reading using e-readers, as well as their possible application in the libraries. User studies of e-readers have shown that their opinion is generally positive, but great <b>attachment</b> to traditional <b>books</b> is still present, e-readers are still seen only as an additional tool for reading.

40|$|Innovation {{diffusion}} theory (IDT) has consistently {{been used to}} investigate users' technology adoption. However, it neglects the influence of emotions on technology adoption. The study objectives address the integration of emotional attachment and two-dimensional self-efficacy that provides a fresh insight into the investigation of key predictors of eBook reader adoption intention. Quantitative methodology was used and questionnaire {{data were collected from}} university students. Probability proportional stratified sampling technique was used to obtain the proportionate sample. The results indicated that the relative advantage, trialability, observability, human-assisted self-efficacy, and individual self-efficacy significantly influence the adoption of eBook readers. However, emotional <b>attachment</b> to paper <b>books</b> negatively influences the relationship between user attitude towards eBook readers and adoption of eBook readers. The results indicate a good measurement model fit and confirmed the validity and reliability of the framework. The integrated framework will be useful in understanding the behavioural and emotional factors associated with the adoption of eBook readers. Moreover, {{a better understanding of the}} contributions of assisted and individual self-efficacy for the adoption of any new product or technology will be obtained. The proposed integration will help the managers before introducing a new product in the target market by considering the users' emotional attachment to prior products...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine and}} explore the concept of maternal-infant {{attachment}} and {{to raise awareness of}} maternal-infant attachment through reading. Study Design and Methods: This study was a program evaluation composed of five activities: a community assessment using a windshield survey, weekly post-partum-newborn home visits, key informant interviews, a survey with new mothers, and a campaign to acquire age-appropriate books for newborns. Results: Home visits were made to 17 mothers on 4 separate days between September 23, 2014 and October 13, 2014. Home visits included information about early reading and maternal-infant <b>attachment.</b> Thirty-two (32) <b>books</b> were collected from identified donors and a maternal-infant reading program was reestablished. Clinical Implications: The majority of new mothers were unaware of the importance of reading to enhance maternal-infant attachment. Few knew the benefit of early reading. These mothers were very receptive to this nursing intervention and eager to practice reading to their newborn, following demonstration. This health teaching and demonstration is recommended as part of home visits. The outcome of this project suggests that mothers and infants gain considerably from the practice of early reading. This information should contribute to the on-going community book campaign to provide infant books, in Spanish and English, to the most vulnerable new mothers and newborns.

40|$|The book {{is written}} for the {{students}} of higher technical schools and universities as well as practicing navigation and inertial technology engineers. Basic concepts of testing theory are viewed in the first section. Here is studied a time-place and aims of testing, the types of external impacts and conditions of exploitation are examined, classification of testing is given, such normative documents as program of testing and method of testing are described. It is described the basic types of the special testing equipment: rate tables, centrifuges, vibration and shock equipment and etc. The second section is devoted for the testing of accelerometers. The mathematical models of output signals are developed for axial and pendulum accelerometers. It is considered a determination of basic parameters of accelerometers such as scale factors, biases and cross factors scales. Except a static testing, the dynamic testing of accelerometers on a centrifuge and on a vibrator is considered. The third section is devoted for the testing of gyroscopes. Here is got the model of rate angular drift of mechanical gyroscope. The testing of gyroscopes is described {{in the mode of}} gyrostabilized platform and in the mode of feed-back on a moment. Also except static tests, the dynamic tests of gyroscopes are considered on a centrifuge and on a vibrator. The features of testing of optical-electronic gyroscopes are described. Calibration of the inertial measurement modules is described in a fourth section. Except the traditional methods, it is shown a description of scalar method of calibration. The <b>book</b> contains four <b>attachments.</b> Hope the <b>book</b> also will be useful for students and engineers of electronics, radio and IT-industry. ??????? ??????? ????????????? ????????? ??????????????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????. ? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?????? ????????? ????????. ????? ????????? ????? ? ???? ????????? ? ????????? ????? ???????, ??????????????? ???? ??????? ??????????? ? ??????? ????????????, ?????? ????????????? ?????????, ??????? ????? ??????????? ????????? ??? ????????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????. ?????????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????????: ?????????? ??????????, ???????????, ???????????? ? ?. ?. ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????????. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????????? ?????????????? ? ??????? ??????????. ??????????? ????? ??????? ?????????????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????, ??????? ???????? ? ????????????? ???????????? ?????. ????? ??????????? ?????????, ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????????? ?? ?????????? ? ?? ???????????. ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????. ???????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????????. ??????? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????????????? ? ? ?????? ???????? ????? ?? ???????. ????? ????? ??????????? ?????????, ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ?? ?????????? ? ?? ???????????. ??????? ??????????? ????????? ??????-??????????? ??????????. ? ????????? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????-????????????? ???????. ????? ???????????? ???????, ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ??????????. ??????? ???????? ?????? ??????????. ? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ????????????. ?????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????????. ? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ??????. ????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ????? ??????? ????????? ? ???????????? ?? ???????? ???????????, ????????????, ??????????? ? ???????????? ???????...|$|R
40|$|Producción CientíficaWe analyse the {{adoption}} process of e-book readers and {{examine how the}} perception about the advantages of this technology and its incompatibility with consumer values determine the pleasure felt and its effective use. We also propose that consumer involvement with ICTs moderates these effects. Design/methodology/approach –Hierarchical moderated regression analysis is {{used to test the}} proposed model with survey data from a sample of e-book reader owners. Findings –Appraisal of the device’s reading features and the possibility for free downloading increases the pleasure found with its use {{and the extent to which}} it is actually used, whereas <b>attachment</b> to paper <b>books</b> decreases the emotional feeling, some of these effects being moderated by the individual’s involvement with new ICTs. Pleasure mediates the influence of perceived advantages and attachment to the older technology on the use of the e-book reader device. Practical implications –Two challenges to practitioners are suggested: to overcome the rejection of users less eager to experience pleasure and to use the e-reader, and to find the product’s objective or sensory characteristics that provide pleasure and promote long-lasting use. Originality/value –The study extends previous studies on e-book readers by emphasizing the need to go beyond adoption intention. It analyses effective use as a crucial measure of the true adoption of this technology and incorporates the perspective offered by the appraisal theory of emotion, which explains the key role of pleasure in this process.

40|$|This study {{describes}} how literacy is mentally represented as cultural knowledge, {{referred to by}} educational and cognitive anthropologists as "cultural models. " These models, widely shared among specific social and cultural groups, depict prototypical events in a simplified world. Despite enormous research attention identifying 'multiple literacies,' particularly emphasizing the literacies of those who live at the 'margins,' the one most closely associated with a literary literacy remains prototypical or 'normal' while terms such as "functional" reading are viewed pejoratively. This common sense reasoning is produced by the White, middle class who largely control the society, whose ideological stances of the way literacy 'ought to be' escape serious scrutiny. My research integrates sociocognitive, sociocultural, and sociolinguistic analyses by reconstructing the cultural models of literacy held by 15, White, urban, middle-class parents of kindergarten children. This reconstruction required the use of numerous interviews and interpretation of those interviews. My goal in the analysis was to search for patterns across interviewees and interview passages that would be indicative of shared understandings. I focused on two features of parents' discourse: their use of metaphors and their reasoning. The metaphor analysis identifies three schemas that parents have about literacy. The reasoning analysis provides the underlying story of the cultural model that links the three schemas. This study concludes that when middle-class parents of young children talk about reading, they conceptualize a literary literacy. Through indirect indexicality, expressing this literacy as a prototype sends a covert message which emphasizes moral worth. Such a moral <b>attachment</b> to reading <b>books</b> marks and morally elevates one's social-class membership, which is itself implicitly linked to racial and cultural status. This moral identity distances these middle-class parents from the lower and working classes {{as well as from}} the upper class. Furthermore, institutions designed to facilitate the literacy of children and families construct a similar discourse, where the goal of learning to read is secondary to the primary goal of reshaping the moral character of the families, particularly non-mainstream and minority families. This discourse hegemonically constructs as 'immoral' the kinds of literacies which do not match a 'moral literacy. ...|$|R
