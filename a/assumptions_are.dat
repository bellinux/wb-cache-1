5|$|After {{a two-month}} stay in Bucharest, Vasil Levski {{returned}} to Bulgaria {{for a second}} tour, lasting from 1 May to 26 August 1869. On this tour he carried proclamations printed in Romania by the political figure Ivan Kasabov. They legitimised Levski as the representative of a Bulgarian provisional government. Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol, Pleven, Karlovo, Plovdiv, Pazardzhik, Perushtitsa, Stara Zagora, Chirpan, Sliven, Lovech, Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Sevlievo and Tryavna. According to some researchers, Levski established the earliest of his secret committees during this tour, but those <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> based on uncertain data.|$|E
5|$|The family {{learns that}} Peter has been {{diagnosed}} with Kidney failure due to the damage done and he {{is in need of}} a transplant. However, since they must wait a few months before they can get donors, Peter must undergo dialysis at regular intervals. Three weeks later, after undergoing constant dialysis procedures, Peter gets angry that the dialysis treatments have stolen him from the world. After being convinced by Joe and Quagmire that one skipping would not hurt him, Peter eventually decides to skip an appointment but his <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> false and him skipping it causes him to become jaundiced and vomit blood.|$|E
30|$|The first <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> a {{well-known}} <b>assumption</b> and <b>is</b> also true in real practice. The second <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> true for linear seperable systems but not true for nonlinear and inseparable systems. However, we can employ this assumption {{to make the}} analysis tractable. Moreover, this <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> valid {{in most of the}} practical scenarios. The third <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> also well-known in literature and often used in the analysis of adaptive filters [2].|$|R
50|$|The Decision Linear (DLIN) <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> a {{computational}} hardness assumption used in {{elliptic curve}} cryptography. In particular, the DLIN <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> useful in settings where the decisional Diffie - Hellman assumption {{does not hold}} (as {{is often the case}} in pairing-based cryptography).

5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

[...] The third <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> raw materials are fixed at certain locations, and the market is also a known fixed location. [...] The fourth <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> labor is fixed geographically but is available in unlimited quantities at any production site selected. [...] The final <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> that transport costs are a direct function of weight of the item and the distance shipped.|$|R

25|$|Optimistic <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> made by {{proponents of}} {{ideologies}} such as transhumanism and singularitarianism, which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects {{for the society}} and the human condition.

25|$|Since {{the product}} {{development}} (i.e., architectural artifact) in each cell or the problem solution embodied by the cell {{is the answer}} to a question from a perspective, typically, the models or descriptions are higher-level depictions or the surface answers of the cell. The refined models or designs supporting that answer are the detailed descriptions within the cell. Decomposition (i.e., drill down to greater levels of detail) takes place within each cell. If a cell is not made explicit (defined), it is implicit (undefined). If it is implicit, the risk of making assumptions about these cells exists. If the <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> valid, then time and money are saved. If, however, the <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> invalid, it is likely to increase costs and exceed the schedule for implementation.|$|E
25|$|Hedge funds {{performance}} {{is measured by}} comparing their returns to an estimate of their risk. Common measures are the Sharpe ratio, Treynor measure and Jensen's alpha. These measures work best when returns follow normal distributions without autocorrelation, and these <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> often not met in practice.|$|E
25|$|The smaller {{effective}} {{population size}} of the NRY and mtDNA enhances the consequences of drift and founder effect, relative to the autosomes, making NRY and mtDNA variation a potentially sensitive index of population composition.

For short time series, stationarity <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> common. However, for longer time series, this <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> often unrealistic. Besides, many naturally occurring phenomena cannot be modelled as stationary processes. Therefore modelling stochastic time series under nonstationary <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> often appealing, and finnds its application in many areas, such as speech processing, biomedical signal processing, and seismology to name a few...|$|R

25|$|Ilan Eshel {{suggested}} that sex prevents rapid evolution. He suggests that recombination breaks up favourable gene combinations {{more often than}} it creates them, and sex is maintained because it ensures selection is longer-term than in asexual populations - so the population is less affected by short-term changes. This explanation is not widely accepted, as its <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> very restrictive.|$|E
25|$|More modern {{developments}} relax {{these assumptions}} and {{are based on}} the Boltzmann equation. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> the absence of quantum effects, molecular chaos and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as virial expansions.|$|E
25|$|Combinatorial group theory studies {{groups from}} the {{perspective}} of generators and relations. It is particularly useful where finiteness <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> satisfied, for example finitely generated groups, or finitely presented groups (i.e. in addition the relations are finite). The area makes use of the connection of graphs via their fundamental groups. For example, one can show that every subgroup of a free group is free.|$|E
50|$|The minimality of {{security}} <b>assumptions</b> <b>is</b> another characteristic of hash-based signature schemes. Generally, these schemes only require a secure (for instance {{in the sense}} of second preimage resistance) cryptographic hash function to guarantee the overall security of the scheme.

30|$|When {{modeling}} a Cox proportional hazard model (and {{some other}} parametric models), an important <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> the proportional hazards: the hazard ratio is proportional {{over the entire}} baseline. Actually, the specifications above fail the Schoenfeld Residual test globally. But Hancock and Mueller (2010) mention that if this <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> violated, it simply means that the coefficients represent a kind of “average” effect over the period of observation, so the concerns about the violation of this <b>assumption</b> <b>are</b> often unwarranted. 24 However, this <b>assumption</b> may not <b>be</b> a problem.
