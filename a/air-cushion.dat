25|$|A hovercraft, {{also known}} as an <b>air-cushion</b> vehicle or ACV, is a craft capable of {{travelling}} over land, water, mud, ice, and other surfaces. Hovercraft are hybrid vessels operated by a pilot as an aircraft rather than a captain as a marine vessel.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1963 {{a letter}} written by Owen Maddock {{appeared}} in Flight International's <b>Air-Cushion</b> Vehicles (ACV) supplement, wherein he stated that he was [...] "extremely interested in <b>air-cushion</b> vehicles and would welcome an opportunity {{to work on the}} design and development of such a craft intended for racing ... Anyone interested?" [...] Someone was indeed interested, and as early as January the next year Maddock and fellow ACV racing evangelist David Stevens had contacted Stirling Moss to solicit his opinion as to whether racing ACVs would be a popular proposition. Following a positive response, later in 1964 Maddock {{and a number of other}} amateur enthusiasts set up the Isle of Wight Hover Club, and then early in 1966 the national umbrella group the Hover Club of Great Britain that would become the Hovercraft Club of Great Britain. Maddock acted as technical secretary for the clubs for many years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} TGV {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1960s, after Japan had begun construction of the Shinkansen (the bullet train) in 1959. At the time the French government favoured new technology, exploring the production of hovercraft and the Aérotrain <b>air-cushion</b> vehicle. Simultaneously, SNCF began researching high-speed trains on conventional tracks. In 1976, the government agreed to fund the first line. By the mid-1990s, the trains were so popular that SNCF president Louis Gallois declared TGV [...] "The train that saved French railways".|$|E

2500|$|However, the DOT {{was more}} {{interested}} in really high speed trains, and had been funding several developments along these lines for some time. In order to expedite these developments, they had recently selected a parcel of land outside Pueblo, Colorado as a test site that would become the Transportation Technology Center (TTC). They planned on using the TTC to lower the cost of all-up testing of advanced designs, as well as guaranteeing that all the participants would have a level playing field. Several U.S. companies {{were in the process of}} building hovertrain systems based on technology licensed from the French Aérotrain project, known under the U.S. term [...] "Tracked <b>Air-Cushion</b> Vehicle", or [...] "TACV", and these were in the process of being set up at the TTC.|$|E
2500|$|Originally the Clydesdales were {{transport}}ed by train. Cross-country truck transport {{was introduced in}} 1940. Today, the traveling hitches {{are on the road}} at least 10 months every year, based out of St. Louis, Missouri, Merrimack, New Hampshire and Fort Collins, Colorado. At St. Louis, there are several tours that provide a visit to the Budweiser Clydesdale Paddock and Stables, The first Clydesdale hitch was based in Merrimack, New Hampshire, [...] and tours there today allow visitors to visit the Budweiser Clydesdales up close at the Clydesdale Hamlet. And Fort Collins is the home to the Clydesdales West Coast Team. When the horses are not touring, they can be seen as part of a tour and visitors can have a picture taken with them. There are ten horses that travel on each team. [...] Eight are in harness when performing at any one time and the other two horses provide alternates for the hitch as needed. Several professional handlers accompany each team. Often, one handler has night duty to provide round-the-clock care for the horses. Transportation for each hitch requires three 50-foot semis. Two carry the horses, the third transports a red, white and gold beer wagon and other equipment. The horses' comfort is enhanced with <b>air-cushion</b> suspension and thick rubber flooring, and cameras in the trailers enable the drivers to watch the horses during transport. The team stops each night at local stables.|$|E

60|$|A man, {{reading a}} newspaper, {{had just started}} up {{at the sight of}} the {{returning}} pigeon, when he heard the burr of Winn's engine and saw the huge monoplane, with all surfaces set, drop down upon him, stop suddenly on an <b>air-cushion</b> manufactured on the spur of the moment by a shift of the horizontal rudders, glide a few yards, strike ground, and come to rest not a score of feet away from him. But when he saw a young man, calmly sitting in the machine and leveling a pistol at him, the man turned to run. Before he could make the corner of the cabin, a bullet through the leg brought him down in a sprawling fall.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Minot {{liked to}} have him with her sons, because they also were to paddle their own canoes by and by, and she {{believed}} that, rich or poor, boys make better men for learning to use the talents they possess, not merely as ornaments, but tools with which to carve their own fortunes; and the best help toward this end {{is an example of}} faithful work, high aims, and honest living. So Ralph came often, and in times of trouble was a real rainy-day friend. Jack grew very fond of him during his imprisonment, for the good youth ran in every evening to get commissions, amuse the boy with droll accounts of the day's adventures, or invent lifts, bed-tables, and foot-rests for the impatient invalid. Frank found him a sure guide through the mechanical mysteries which he loved, and spent many a useful half-hour discussing cylinders, pistons, valves, and balance-wheels. Jill also came in for her share of care and comfort; the poor little back lay all the easier for the <b>air-cushion</b> Ralph got her, and the weary headaches found relief from the spray atomizer, which softly distilled its scented dew on the hot forehead till she fell asleep.|$|E

30|$|There {{are very}} few data on the {{relationship}} between IAP and PDRICG. So far, Michelet et al. studied this subject prospectively in detail [13]. In 20 ARDS patients, they looked at the influence of prone positioning on IAP, PDRICG, and extravascular lung water compared to the supine position, lying on a conventional foam mattress vs. an <b>air-cushioned</b> mattress. They observed an increase in IAP and a decrease in PDRICG in the prone compared with the supine position on a conventional foam mattress. The effect of proning on IAP was the topic of a recent review [19]. The use of an <b>air-cushioned</b> mattress had beneficial effects on IAP and PDRICG during the prone position. Analyzing our data, we found that PDRICG correlated significantly with IAP and even more so with APP. Similar to the data of Michelet et al. [13], changes in IAP were associated with significant concomitant but opposite changes in PDRICG, suggesting that an increase in IAP may compromise hepatosplanchnic perfusion. Hering et al., however, did not observe a decrease in PDRICG when patients were proned despite the small increase in IAP from 10 to 13 mmHg [15].|$|R
40|$|Air {{cushioning}} of {{a high-speed}} liquid droplet impact with a finite-depth liquid layer sitting upon a rigid impermeable base is investigated. The {{evolution of the}} droplet and liquid-layer free-surfaces is studied alongside the pressure in the gas film dividing the two. The model predicts gas bubbles are trapped between the liquid free-surfaces as the droplet approaches impact. The key balance in the model occurs when {{the depth of the}} liquid layer equals the horizontal extent of interactions between the droplet and the gas film. For liquid layer depths significantly less than this a shallow liquid limit is investigated, which ultimately tends towards the <b>air-cushioning</b> behavior seen in droplet impact with a solid surface. Conversely, for liquid layer depths much deeper than this, the rigid base does not affect the <b>air-cushioning</b> of the droplet. The influence of compressibility is discussed and the relevant parameter regime for an incompressible model is identified. The size of the trapped gas bubble {{as a function of the}} liquid layer depth is investigated. The deep water model is extended to consider binary droplet collisions. Again, the model predicts gas bubbles will be trapped as the result of air cushioning in high-speed binary droplet impacts...|$|R
