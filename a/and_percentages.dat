Readability was measured by algetra student's responses to two forms of cloze tests. Linear and currilinear correlations were calc:lated between each structural variatle and the cloze test. The results indicated that explanatory material, sentence length, percentage of mathematical symbols <b>and</b> <b>percentage</b> of difficult words had significant linear correlaticns with readability. In illustrative material, percentage of mathematical symbols <b>and</b> <b>percentage</b> of mathematics vocabulary had significant linear correlations with readability.

Among these are sizeable Ukrainian, Tatar, Chechen, Armenian, Jewish, and Greek populations, among many others.
