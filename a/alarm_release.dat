40|$|Abstract—Combustion of fuels in {{industrial}} and transport sector has {{lead to an}} <b>alarming</b> <b>release</b> of polluting gases to the atmosphere. Carbon monoxide is one such pollutant, which {{is formed as a}} result of incomplete oxidation of the fuel. In order to analyze the effect of catalyst on the reduction of CO emissions to the atmosphere, two catalysts Mn 2 O 3 and Hopcalite are considered. A model was formed based on mass and energy balance equations. Results show that Hopcalite catalyst as compared to Mn 2 O 3 catalyst helped in faster conversion of the polluting gas as the operating temperature of the hopcalite catalyst is much lower as compared to the operating temperature of Mn 2 O 3 catalyst. Keywords—Carbon monoxide, modeling, hopcalite, manganese oxide...|$|R

40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that <b>alarm</b> pheromone <b>released</b> from the perianal region of male rats aggravated stress-induced hyperthermia and increased Fos {{expression in the}} vomeronasal pathway and stress-related nuclei in pheromone-recipient rats. However, the alarm property of this pheromone in terms of behavior modification is still unclear. We recently found that this alarm pheromone could be trapped in water. Based on this finding, we developed an experimental paradigm to assess the effect of alarm pheromone on recipient behavior. Male Wistar rats were acclimatized for 5 min to an open field, where two pieces of filter paper soaked with 750 ul of either pheromone-containing water or vehicle water were attached to the wall. Then, a small "hiding box" was placed {{in one corner of}} the field, and the behavioral responses of the subject rat were recorded for 10 subsequent minutes. Exposure to alarm pheromone significantly increased defensive and risk assessment behaviors and decreased exploratory and grooming behaviors compared to the vehicle control group, indicating the alarm property of the pheromone. In addition, the comparison with previous results suggests that the <b>alarm</b> pheromone <b>released</b> from the perianal region of the male rat increases anxiety in recipients, rather than evoking a stereotyped autonomic response...|$|R

"So Here We Are"/"Positive Tension" [...] is {{a double}} A-side single by Bloc Party from their debut album Silent <b>Alarm.</b> It was <b>released</b> in the UK by Wichita Recordings, and peaked at number five in the UK Singles Chart, their second highest {{charting}} single to date.|$|R
5000|$|Sound The Alarm {{was formed}} in 1999 by Cody Jancovic, Brian Chiusano, Colin Ellis, Rick Stephans in their {{hometown}} of Bangor in Upper Mount Bethel Township, Pennsylvania. At that time, the band members were only 12 years old. The four played covers of favorite bands under the name Sleepwell. After Joe Brule joined the band, Sleepwell began writing original material and won local acclaim. Working with Rob Freeman, then of Hidden In Plain View, Sleepwell recorded a demo and word spread quickly about the band. In 2004, they were courted by producer Howard Benson while still students at Bangor Area High School. The band {{changed its name to}} Sound The Alarm because of a threatened lawsuit by a mattress company alleging that the name [...] "Sleepwell" [...] infringed on their copyright. The group graduated early from high school in 2005, newly christened as Sound The <b>Alarm,</b> <b>released</b> an EP on Rock Ridge Music later that year. They then signed with Geffen Records and moved to Los Angeles to record with Howard Benson, releasing their debut full-length, Stay Inside, in July 2007 to mixed reviews. The group has toured with Finch, The Starting Line, Oh, Sleeper, Tokyo Rose, and Bedlight For Blue Eyes, among others. The song [...] "Suffocating" [...] has been covered by Orianthi on her debut album Believe.|$|R
5000|$|Wake Up...It's Tomorrow is {{the second}} album by the American {{psychedelic}} rock band Strawberry <b>Alarm</b> Clock, <b>released</b> on Uni Records, in 1968 (see 1968 in music). It came as the group was challenged with continuing {{the success of their}} debut single, the psychedelic classic and number one hit, [...] "Incense and Peppermints" [...] and the LP that followed. Their second effort would expand upon the arrangements of its predecessor's unique blend of vocal harmonies, psychedelia, and pop music. In addition, the band's atypical lineup, which featured two bassists, would be altered to address studio and performing issues.|$|R
5000|$|Maintenance workers accidentally {{activated}} {{fire alarms}} in the dam on 15 December 2008.

5000|$|Smoke is the beekeeper's third line of defense. Most beekeepers use a [...] "smoker"—a device {{designed}} to generate {{smoke from the}} incomplete combustion of various fuels. Smoke calms bees; it initiates a feeding response in anticipation of possible hive abandonment due to fire. Smoke also masks <b>alarm</b> pheromones <b>released</b> by guard bees or when bees are squashed in an inspection. The ensuing confusion creates {{an opportunity for the}} beekeeper to open the hive and work without triggering a defensive reaction. In addition, when a bee consumes honey the bee's abdomen distends, supposedly making it difficult to make the necessary flexes to sting, though this has not been tested scientifically.|$|R
