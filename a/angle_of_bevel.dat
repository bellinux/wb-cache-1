50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{sharpening}} jig is to hold the blade or tool at the desired angle while grinding or honing the bevel.

50|$|The axes of {{all gears}} are usually parallel, but for special cases like pencil {{sharpeners}} and differentials, {{they can be}} placed at an <b>angle,</b> introducing elements <b>of</b> <b>bevel</b> gear (see below). Further, the sun, planet carrier and ring axes are usually coaxial.|$|R

50|$|The most {{familiar}} kinds <b>of</b> <b>bevel</b> gears have pitch <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> less than 90 degrees and therefore are cone-shaped. This type <b>of</b> <b>bevel</b> gear is called external because the gear teeth point outward.

5000|$|Mirrors, {{which were}} very rare in Elizabeth's time, became {{more common in}} that of the Charleses, the Duke of Buckingham, {{during the reign of}} the second Charles, {{bringing}} a colony of Venetian glassmakers to Lambeth. One Elizabethan mirror is some three and a half by four and a half feet in size — five feet was the largest made till {{the latter part of the}} eighteenth century — the frame is carved in oak and partially gilt, and the glass is set flatly. In one mirror of the time of Charles II the glass is beveled, and in the glasses of the Merry Monarch's predecessor the frames were so made as to throw the glass forward and give it projection. Quicksilvered glass itself, unset, became a novelty, so that sometimes whole rooms, and even the ceilings, were lined with it. The mirrors made by the duke's colony were of superior excellence; they had an inch-wide bevel all along their outer extremity, whether they were rectangular or curved. [...] "This," [...] says Mr. Pollen, [...] "gives preciousness and prismatic light to the whole glass. It is of great difficulty in execution, the plate being held by the workman over his head, and the edge cut by grinding. The feats of skill in this kind, in the form of interrupted curves and short lines and angles, are rarely accomplished by modern workmen, and the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bevel</b> itself is generally too acute, whereby the prismatic light produced by this portion of the mirror is in violent and too showy contrast to the remainder." ...|$|R

The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape <b>of</b> a spiral <b>bevel</b> gear is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the pinion is usually larger {{than that of the}} gear.
