40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the impact of instruments of the common agricultural policy (CAP) on the sustainable development of agriculture in <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> different resource conditions in the Wielkopolska region. The article hypothesizes that farmers from <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> favourable agricultural resource conditions more often obtained EU funds for pro-effective actions between 2004 and 2012 than farmers from <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> worse agricultural resource conditions. However, farmers from <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> worse agricultural resource conditions obtained more funds from the EU for environmental actions than farmers from <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> favourable agricultural resource conditions. The study has shown that between 2004 and 2012, farms in <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> favourable agricultural resource conditions in Wielkopolska obtained more funds for pro-effective actions than farmers from districts with worse agricultural resource conditions in Wielkopolska. Differences between the amounts of financial resources obtained by individual farmers in <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> different agricultural resource conditions for environmental activities were insignificant. Therefore, only the first part of the hypothesis set forth in this article is accepted...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the first case-control study to {{investigate}} the role of wider environmental and socioeconomic factors upon human cryptosporidiosis. Using GIS the detailed locations of 3368 laboratory-confirmed cases were compared to the locations of {{an equal number of}} controls. All cases were genotyped enabling Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum to be examined separately. When all cryptosporidiosis cases were analyzed, several location variables were strongly associated <b>with</b> illness: <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> many higher socioeconomic status individuals, many individuals aged less than 4  years, <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> a high estimate of Cryptosporidium applied to land from manure, and <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> poorer water treatment. For C.  hominis cases, the strongly significant risk factors were <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> many higher socioeconomic status individuals, <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> many young children and urban areas. Socioeconomic status and <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> many individuals aged less then 4  years had a greater impact for infection with C.  hominis than for C.  parvum.
