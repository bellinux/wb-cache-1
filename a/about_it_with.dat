5|$|The {{convention}} for naming Plutonian moons {{is to use}} names {{associated with}} the god Pluto in classical mythology. To decide on names for P4 and P5, Mark Showalter and the SETI Institute, {{on behalf of the}} discovery team, conducted a non-binding internet poll in 2013, in which the general public was invited to vote for their favorite names. The public could choose from a selection of Greek mythological names related to the god Pluto, or could propose their own names. After the initial announcement, William Shatner, the actor who plays Captain James T. Kirk in the Star Trek franchise, proposed the names Vulcan and Romulus, ostensibly referring to the fire god Vulcan (a nephew of Pluto), and to Romulus the founder of Rome, but also alluding to the fictional planets of Vulcan and Romulus in the Star Trek universe. The 'Romulus' suggestion was discounted, as there is already an asteroid moon of that name, but Vulcan won the poll after Shatner tweeted <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> Cerberus (the dog that guards Pluto's underworld) coming second and Styx (the goddess of the river of the same name in the underworld) coming third. The winning names were submitted to the International Astronomical Union.|$|E

25|$|The first publicized {{discovery}} of a partial fossil mosasaur skull in 1764 by quarry workers in a subterranean gallery of a limestone quarry in Mount Saint Peter, near the Dutch city of Maastricht, preceded any major dinosaur fossil discoveries, but remained little known. However, a second find of a partial skull drew the Age of Enlightenment's attention {{to the existence of}} fossilized animals that were different from any known living creatures. When the specimen was discovered between 1770 and 1774, Johann Leonard Hoffmann, a surgeon and fossil collector, corresponded <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the most influential scientists of his day, making the fossil famous. The original owner, though, was Godding, a canon of Maastricht cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The {{quarterback and}} leader of the 1975 team was Joe Roth. Because of that {{outstanding}} season {{he was one of the}} Heisman Trophy candidates at the beginning of 1976. He had a great start, however halfway through it his performance started to drop. Unknown to almost everyone, Roth was diagnosed with melanoma the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Only coach White and his closest friends knew <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>With</b> Roth continuing to play he still had a strong season and was named an All-American. His last game was in January 1977 at an all-star game in Japan and he died several weeks later in Berkeley. In respect of his perseverance, and dedication to others his former locker is dedicated in his honor and the annual home game against that year's opponent UCLA or USC is known as the Joe Roth Memorial Game. Coach Mike White left after a 1977 season when the Bears finished 8–3 but a disappointing 5th in the division with a 4–3 record. White was succeeded by Roger Theder, who was one of his assistant coaches during the previous six years. Theder led the Bears to three winning seasons, but each was less successful than its predecessor. In 1979, California played in the Garden State Bowl, losing to Temple 28–17 after a 6–5 regular season.|$|E

Disney agreed and Peet created an original treatment, with little supervision, as he had done with One Hundred and One Dalmatians and The Sword in the Stone. However, after the disappointing reaction to The Sword in the Stone, Walt Disney decided to become more involved in the story than he had been with the past two films, with his nephew Roy E. Disney saying that [...] " [...] certainly influenced everything <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> (...) <b>With</b> Jungle Book, he obviously got hooked on the jungle and the characters that lived there." ...|$|E

His {{relationship}} with actress Shoba ended in 1980 after she committed suicide following their marriage. Upon her death, the media speculated that Mahendra was responsible for her death. Following that, Mahendra wrote a series of [...] "sentimental musings" [...] in the Tamil magazine Kumudam under the title Shobavum Naanum (lit. Shoba and me). Their relationship was explored by K. G. George (Mahendra's junior at the FTII) in his 1983 Malayalam film Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback. When the film was released, Mahendra said that the film {{had nothing to do with}} him and has not discussed <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> George. In 1998, he married another actress Mounika and declared their marriage publicly in 2004.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn.

During an interview with MTV News while on the set of the video, Hilson explained that in the video she does nine outfit changes because it will show [...] "10 different eras", starting from 1920 and up until 2010, in which she portrays herself. She also said, [...] " [...] way of paying homage to groundbreaking women, strong women who were fearless and so bold and so confident that they made women feel that way...And I hope to do the same." [...] Kahn wanted Hilson to pay homage to some female singers in the video. He discussed <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Hilson, who chose the singers she loved and was inspired by as a youth to appear in the video. The completed video premiered on 106 & Park on November 11, 2010.|$|E

At that time, the producers were prepping [...] "if-come" [...] orders, [...] "deals with writers that will come into effect in the event a pilot is picked [...] to series". On May 12, 2016, the pilot was passed on by ABC, with Lee's successor Channing Dungey explaining that Most Wanted [...] "did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. We talked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want {{to figure out what the}} next show is that we do together, is something that we all feel is as creatively strong as it can be." [...] However, Dungey said that ABC was open to the series being shopped to another network if Marvel found [...] "another home" [...] for it. Loeb also acknowledged this possibility, but said that the series was designed [...] "to do a very specific thing" [...] alongside S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Spice Up Your Life" [...] was {{directed}} on 6 September 1997, by Marcus Nispel in a two-day shoot located in New York City. The video features {{the group in}} a futuristic setting, inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner, and the music video for Janet Jackson's 1989 single Rhythm Nation controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic post apocalyptic cityscape. Nispel {{came up with the}} concept based on a sketch that was faxed to him signed [...] "Ginger Spice". He recalls: [...] "I looked at what Disney did to Times Square in NYC and tried to imagine how the Spice Girls would transform it, as their career seemed to have no limits—at the time." [...] The group was not consulted about the concept. According to Brown's autobiography, they wanted a carnival party theme, but were too tired to fight <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the label, and ended up with a concept linked to the theme of world domination. Brown commented: [...] "It wasn't right. I don't think any of us liked it much, even though we enjoyed making it. I still can't understand what's going on in it half the time." [...] The video exclusively premiered on MTV in September 1997.|$|E
500|$|A New York Times story {{reporting}} on Disston's progress in 1883 stated that before Disston's purchase {{and the subsequent}} development, the only places worth seeing in Florida were Jacksonville and St. Augustine, with perhaps an overnight trip on the St. Johns River to Palatka; by 1883 tourist attractions had extended [...] south. More {{attention was paid to}} the St. Johns with the increasing population. Florida was portrayed as an exotic wonderland able to cure failing health with its water and citrus, and the region began to be highlighted in travel writings. To relieve his bronchitis, Ralph Waldo Emerson stayed briefly in St. Augustine, calling north Florida [...] "a grotesque region" [...] that was being swarmed by land speculators. Emerson poignantly disliked the public sale of slaves, adding to his overall distaste. Following the Civil War, however, famed author Harriet Beecher Stowe lived near Jacksonville and traveled up the St. Johns, writing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> affection: [...] "The entrance of the St. Johns from the ocean {{is one of the most}} singular and impressive passages of scenery that we ever passed through: in fine weather the sight is magnificent." [...] Her memoir Palmetto Leaves, published in 1873 as a series of her letters home, was very influential in luring northern residents to the state.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E

When David came up with using the idea for an episode of Seinfeld, he did not talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. The original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as clean as the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word [...] "Masturbate". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode would never go ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided {{it would be better to}} remove any references to what George actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about [...] "The Contest" [...] was the [...] "Dovetailing" [...] of the stories. He claimed that it probably would have been possible to have used the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the episode (it is notable that in [...] "The Ticket"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says [...] "you must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny.
