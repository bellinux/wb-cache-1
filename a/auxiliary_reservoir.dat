40|$|Purpose. In {{this paper}} it is {{necessary}} to conduct: 1) research and analyse the influence of throttle element pneumatic resistance on elastic and damping parameters of air spring; 2) to obtain the dependence of air spring parameters on throttle element pneumatic resistance value. Methodology. The work presents the elaborated model of the air spring as a dynamic system with three phase coordinates (cylinder pressure, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>reservoir</b> pressure, cylinder air mass). Stiffness and viscosity coefficients were determined on the basis of system response to harmonic kinematic disturbance. The data for the analysis are obtained by changing the capacity of the connecting element and the law of pressure variation between the reservoir and the cylinder. The viscosity coefficient is regarded as the viscosity ratio of the hydraulic damper, which for one oscillation cycle consumes the same energy as the air spring. The process of air condition change inside the cylinder (reservoir) is considered to be adiabatic; the mass air flow through the connecting element depends on the pressure difference. Findings. We obtained the curves for spring viscosity and stiffness coefficients dependence on the throttle resistance at three different laws, linking airflow through the cylinder with the pressure difference in cylinder and reservoir. At both maximum and minimum limiting resistance values the spring viscosity tends to zero, reaching its peak in the mean resistance values. Stiffness increases monotonically with increasing resistance, tends to the limit corresponding to the absence of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>reservoir</b> (at high resistance) and the increase in cylinder volume by the reservoir volume (at low resistance). Originality. The designed scheme allows determining the optimal parameters of elastic and damping properties of the pneumatic system as function of the throttle element air resistance. Practical value. The ability to predict the parameters of elastic and damping properties of the pneumatic system as function of the throttle element air resistance will improve the running performance of carriages, the comfort of passenger transportation and reduce the wear of the rolling stock and the track caused by interaction of carriage and rails. ...|$|E
40|$|Diese Arbeit fokussiert sich auf die Entwicklung und Charakterisierung elektroosmotischer Mikropumpen für Lab-on-Mikrochip-Anwendungen. Mikropumpen gehören zu den wichtigsten Komponenten des Labchips. Dabei sind mechanische Pumpen mit beweglichen Teilen aufgrund ihrer großen Abmessungen und komplizierten Konstruktionen nur mit großem Aufwand in Planartechnik integrierbar. Von den nichtmechanischen Mikropumpen mit elektrischer Ansteuerung sind elektroosmotische Pumpen von Bedeutung, da nach diesem Funktionsprinzip wässrige Lösungen mit sehr unterschiedlichen Leitfähigkeiten und pH-Werten gepumpt werden können. AC elektrokinetische Mikropumpen, bestehend aus auf dem Kanalboden angeordneten asymmetrischen Elektroden, ist einfach herzustellen, hat aber einen wesentlichen Nachteil: sie kann kaum einen Arbeitsdruck erzeugen und ist deswegen für den Einsatz in Labchips ungeeignet. Aus diesem Grunde konzentrierte sich die Entwicklung auf DC elektroosmotischen Mikropumpen. Die Konstruktion der DC elektroosmotischen Mikropumpe mit mehreren vertikal angeordneten schmalen Mikrokanälen aus dem Polymer SU- 8 reduziert die Pumpenabmessungen, ermöglicht einen hohen Arbeitsdruck bei einer niedrigen Arbeitsspannung und ist kompatibel mit der Post-CMOS-Bearbeitung. Ein einfaches analytisches Modell zur Bestimmung der Pumpgeschwindigkeit im feldfreien Lastkanal wurde entwickelt und dargestellt. Ein wesentliches Problem elektroosmotischer Mikropumpen ist die Wasserelektrolyse an den Metallelektroden. Die nachteilige Gasblasenbildung kann durch die Verwendung von gasdurchlässigen Deckeln aus Polydimethylsiloxan (PDMS) reduziert werden. Diese Lösung hat aber folgende Nachteile: die Arbeitsspannung wird auf einen schmalen Bereich von 4 - 5 V begrenzt und die hydrophobe Oberfläche von PDMS verhindert die Selbstbefüllung der Kanäle. Eine optimale Lösung des Gasblasenproblems bietet die Positionierung der Metallelektroden in offenen Hilfsreservoiren außerhalb des Hauptkanals. Der Ionenstromfluss von Elektroden in den Hilfsreservoiren zum Pumpenbereich erfolgt durch die Gelelektroden. Mikropumpen mit den Gelelektroden aus dem fotopolymerisierten Polyacrylamid wurden gefertigt und untersucht. Die Pumprate ist bidirektional linear und beträgt etwa 10 nl/min in einem 1 cm langen Lastkanal bei der angelegten Spannung von 40 V, was einem maximalen Arbeitsdruck von 65 Pa entspricht. Zur weiteren Steigerung der Pumpleistungen muss das Aspektverhältnis von den Pumpenmikrokanälen durch die Reduzierung des Rippenabstandes erhöht werden. Zur Messung der Pumprate und damit zur Steuerung der Mikropumpe wurde ein monolithisch integrierter Massenflusssensor entworfen, realisiert und untersucht. Eine programmierbare Pumpe als Kombination der elektroosmotischen Mikropumpe, des Massenflusssensors und einer externen Steuerelektronik wurde erfolgreich getestet. Hierbei konnten Pumpraten bis zu ± 30 nl/min eingestellt werden. Die programmierbare Mikropumpe kann auch als aktives Ventil in Labchips eingesetzt werden. This work {{focuses on}} the {{development}} and characterization of electroosmotic micropumps for lab-on-chip applications. Micropumps {{are the most important}} components of labchips. Mechanical pumps with moving parts are not suitable for planar technology, especially with regard to integration into a simple standardized technology platform. The reason is their large size and complex construction. The electroosmotic effect is the most common one used for nonmechanical pumping of aqueous solutions {{of a wide range of}} conductivities and pH-values. Pumps based on this effect are easy to manufacture and offer good potential for integration into cost effective technology platforms. AC electrokinetic micropumps, a simple version of electroosmotic pumps as known from the literature, consist of an array of asymmetric interdigitated electrodes. They are very easy to fabricate, however, they suffer from a very low working pressure and are therefore not suited for integration on labchips. For this reason this work concentrates on the development of DC electroosmotic micropumps. The design of DC electroosmotic micropumps with a vertical arrangement of multiple narrow microchannels made of the polymer SU- 8 reduces the pump dimensions, makes possible high working pressures at moderate operation voltages and is compatible with post-CMOS processing. A simple analytical model has been developed to estimate the flow velocity in the field free section of the pumping channel. A significant problem of DC electroosmotic micropumps is water electrolysis at the metal electrodes. The drawback of bubble generation can be reduced by use of gas permeable covers, e. g. covers made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This design, however, decreases the range of operation voltages to about (4 … 5) V, and the hydrophobic surface of PDMS constrains the desired self priming of the fluidic channels. A good solution to cope with bubble generation is the positioning of the metal electrodes outside the main channel in open <b>auxiliary</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> A conductive ionic path between the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and the active pumping region can be established using a gel bridge. Therefore, micropumps using photopolymerized polyacrylamide gel electrodes have been fabricated and tested. The pumping rate of these pumps is bidirectionally linear and reaches 10 nl/min in a 1 cm long pressure-driven channel at an applied voltage of 40 V. This corresponds to a zero-flow pressure of 65 Pa. The working pressure can be further increased by reducing the distance between the vertical ribs of the pumping array. For the measure of the pump rate a monolithically integrated mass flow sensor based on the thermal anemometric principle has been developed, fabricated and tested. For the first time, a planar programmable on-chip micropump, combining the new electroosmotic narrow channel micropump, the mass flow sensor, and external control circuitry has been operated successfully in a closed control loop for flow rates in the range from zero to up to ± 30 nl/min. The programmable micropump may also be used as an active closing valve on labchips...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{environmental}} and global crude oil supplies concerns are stimulating research on new vehicle technologies. Hybrid-electric vehicles {{appear to be}} one of the most promising technologies for reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Dierent types of hybrid-electric powertrains exist: from the mild-hybrid vehicle, equipped with a small electric motor, to the combined hybrid like the Toyota prius. This paper presents a parametric study focused on variations of the size of the powertrain compo-nents, and optimization of the power split between the engine and electric motor with respect to fuel consumption. To perform this optimization on a prescribed driving cycle (for instance, the New European Driving Cycle), a dynamic programming algorithm based on a reduced model is implemented. This simplied model allows a fast optimization with a ne parameterization of the controller: it furnishes the optimal power repartition at each time step regarding fuel consumption under constraints on the battery state of charge. The obtained results may be used to determine the best components of a given powertrain, for a prescribed vehicle cycle. The optimal split obtained thanks to dynamic programming algorithm can not be used directly on a vehicle as a real time control law, as the future can not be known in advance in normal driving con-ditions. To overcome this diculty, we implement, as a real-time strategy, the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) : the battery being considered as an <b>auxiliary</b> reversible fuel <b>reservoir,</b> an instantaneous minimization of ECMS is performed. This control law is inferred from Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, where the Lagrange multiplier can be deduced from previous optimization results on given driving cycles.

40|$|In {{the period}} November 1, 1985 to January 31, 1986, 703 cases of {{giardiasis}} {{were reported in}} Pittsfield, Massachusetts (population 50, 265).

A case-control study showed that persons with giardiasis {{were more likely to be}} older and to have drunk more municipal water than household controls.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{investigation}} is to integrate an electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake model with efficient longitudinal train force algorithms based on the trajectory coordinate formulations. The ECP brake model, developed in this investigation consists of the train line (cable), locomotive automatic brake valve, air brake pipe, and ECP manifold. The train line, which covers {{the entire length of}} the train, allows the brake commands to be received by the car simultaneously. While pneumatic pressure is used to generate the braking forces, the brake pipe is no longer used to provide the brake level commands. Instead, the brake pipes are used to provide a continuous supply of compressed air stored in a reservoir mounted on each railcar. Using the ECP system to apply the brakes uniformly and instantaneously gives better train control, shortens the stopping distances, and leads to a lower risk of derailment. In this investigation, the fluid continuity and momentum equations are used to develop the governing air pressure flow equations. These partial differential equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations using the finite element method leading to an air brake force model that accounts for the effect of the air flow in long train pipes as well as the effect of leakage and branch pipe flows. The car brake forces are applied to the wheels using the ECP manifold located in each car. The ECP manifold used in this investigation has four valves: cut-off valve, vent valve, auxiliary valve, and emergency valve. The ECP manifold is connected to three main pneumatic components: the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>reservoir,</b> the emergency reservoir, and the brake cylinder. The reservoirs serve as the main storage of the pressurized air, while the brake cylinder and other mechanical components such as the rigging and the brake shoes transmit the brake force to the wheels. In this investigation, a mathematical model of the ECP manifold and its components is developed. The relationship between the main components of the ECP brake system and the train dynamics is discussed, and the final set of differential equations that integrates the ECP brake and train dynamics is presented. Different simulation scenarios are considered in this study in order to investigate the effect of the brake forces on the train longitudinal dynamics in the case of different braking scenarios. The performance of the developed ECP brake system is compared with the Association of American Railroads safety and operation standards, and with experimental results published in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{infrared}} (IR) sensing {{provides a}} valuable {{method for detection}} and identification of materials associated with nuclear proliferation. Current challenges for remote sensors include minimizing the size, mass, and power requirements for cheaper, smaller, and more deployable instruments without affecting the measurement performance. One area that is often overlooked is sensor calibration design that is optimized to minimize the cost, size, weight, {{and power of the}} payload. Yet, an on-board calibration system is essential to account for changes in the detector response once the instrument has been removed from the laboratory. The Calibration Systems project at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is aimed towards developing and demonstrating compact quantum cascade (QC) laser-based calibration systems for infrared sensor systems in order to provide both a spectral and radiometric calibration while minimizing the impact on the instrument payload. In FY 05, PNNL demonstrated a multi-level radiance scheme that provides six radiance levels for an enhanced linearity check compared to the currently accepted two-point scheme. PNNL began testing the repeatability of this scheme using a cryogenically cooled, single-mode quantum cascade laser (QCL). A cyclic variation in the power was observed that was attributed to the thermal cycling of the laser's dewar. In FY 06, PNNL continued testing this scheme and installed an <b>auxiliary</b> liquid nitrogen <b>reservoir</b> to limit the thermal cycling effects. Although better repeatability was achieved over a longer time period, power fluctuations were still observed due to the thermal cycling. Due to the limitations with the cryogenic system, PNNL began testing Fabry-Perot QCLs that operate continuous-wave (cw) or quasi-cw at room temperature (RT) in FY 06. PNNL demonstrated a multi-level scheme that provides five radiance levels in 105 seconds with excellent repeatability. We have continued testing this repeatability in FY 07. A burn-in effect appears in which the power increases over a certain time period. Repeatability better than 1 %, however, is demonstrated for most of the radiance levels after this initial burn-in. In FY 06, PNNL also began investigating a fiber-coupled RT QCL for a compact IR calibration source. PNNL demonstrated a uniform beam profile by measuring a time-averaged response and modulating the fiber optic with a motor to minimize the effects of speckle. In FY 07, PNNL examined the power stability of fiber-coupled QCLs. Feedback appears to degrade the stability so that anti-reflective coatings for fibers may be essential. In FY 07, PNNL continued to investigate the stability of room temperature QCLs as well as the measurement technique to provide a quantitative estimate for the measurement uncertainty. We designed and built a custom environmental enclosure to reduce the measurement uncertainty. After an initial burn-in, we have achieved uncertainties better than 0. 1 % for data collected over almost 100 hours of operation. We also built a bench-top system to demonstrate how the QC laser can be used to calibrate a microbolometer array and illustrated the importance of a multi-point calibration...|$|R
