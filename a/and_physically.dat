40|$|AbstractSeveral {{neurodegenerative}} disorders {{are characterized by}} the accumulation of proteinaceous inclusions in the central nervous system. These inclusions are frequently composed of a mixture of aggregation-prone proteins. Here, we used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay to study the initial steps of the co-aggregation of huntingtin (Htt) and α-synuclein (α-syn), two aggregation-prone proteins involved in Huntington’s disease (HD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), respectively. We found that Htt (exon 1) oligomerized with α-syn and sequestered it in the cytosol. In turn, α-syn {{increased the number of}} cells displaying aggregates, decreased the number of aggregates per cell and increased the average size of the aggregates. Our results support the idea that co-aggregation of aggregation-prone proteins can contribute to the histopathology of {{neurodegenerative disorders}}.

She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.|$|E
