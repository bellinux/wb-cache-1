5|$|Historians then <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> {{been divided}} over Wilfrid. His {{followers}} commissioned Stephen of Ripon {{to write a}} Vita Sancti Wilfrithi (or Life of Wilfrid) shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled {{a large number of}} monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the Rule of Saint Benedict into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as a champion of Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry I's successor, King Stephen, Nigel {{remained as}} treasurer only briefly before {{his family was}} ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival Matilda, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained high office under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, Henry II. Nigel's second tenure as treasurer saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as treasurer by his son, Richard fitzNeal, whom he had trained in {{the operations of the}} Exchequer, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>have</b> felt that Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been more talented as an administrator than as a religious figure.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began the}} {{following}} April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, {{not the least}} of which was the firing of the original lead actor, Shintaro Katsu—creator of the very popular Zatoichi character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his own performance. (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival in May, though some critics, then <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>have</b> faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting Kagemusha, collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.|$|E

25|$|Sanford Stadium's hedges have encircled {{the field}} since the stadium's first game against Yale in 1929. The idea to put hedges {{around the field}} came from the Business Manager of the UGA Athletic Department, Charlie Martin. Martin claimed to have {{received}} inspiration for the idea {{during a visit to}} the Rose Bowl, where he saw the hedge of roses in that stadium. Roses were not a suitable choice for the climate in Athens, so privet hedges were used instead. Six other SEC stadiums have copied UGA <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> hedges, making this feature no longer unique to UGA, but Georgia has the only one that completely surrounds the playing field.|$|E

The Hells Angels' activities in Australia have traditionally included drug trafficking, prostitution, armed robbery, arms trafficking, fencing and murder-for-hire, but have more recently moved into legitimate businesses such as gyms, tattoo parlours, haulage companies, and the security industry. Police allege they use mainstream industries to launder existing funds and to exploit new income streams, using the strategies they developed during a series of gang wars to intimidate business competitors. The Australian Hells Angels {{have been involved in}} conflicts with the Bandidos, Comancheros, Finks, Lones Wolves, Nomads and Notorious, while they have allied themselves with the Coffin Cheaters, Immortals, Red Devils, Satans Soldiers, Vikings and the Prisoners of War, a prison gang operating inside HMP Barwon.|$|E

25|$|The Aquaman & Friends Action Hour {{aired on}} Cartoon Network Latin America in 2003 and was {{produced}} by Wild Hare Studios of Atlanta, GA. The show, which lasted 7 episodes, was a parody of Aquaman's appearances on the Super Friends animated series. In this series, Aquaman is now {{the host of a}} children's television series. He is being pursued by the Legion of Doom, who had spent their entire operating budget on attempts to conquer the world <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> to rent out parts of the Hall of Doom as apartments to generate income. Aquaman was chosen as the lead character in this parody series because the producers were not allowed to use the full cast of the Super Friends due to Justice League airing in the United States. The series is separate from the Cartoon Network commercials that aired in the United States that featured Aquaman and Wonder Woman being saved from the Legion of Doom by The Powerpuff Girls and the Aquaman Dance Party commercials that aired during Adult Swim.|$|E
25|$|The Swans {{currently}} field a reserves {{team in the}} North East Australian Football League. Previously a reserves {{team was}} first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued {{to compete in the}} Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the Sydney AFL competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001–2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the Port Melbourne Football Club in the VFL while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the AFL Canberra competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005–2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League {{with the rest of the}} AFL Canberra competition <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the Brisbane Lions, Gold Coast Suns and GWS Giants. The team plays home games at the Sydney Cricket Ground and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.|$|E
