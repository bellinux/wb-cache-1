The proposed method considers the known chlorine input injection signals, and uses multiple Monte-Carlo simulations which {{run in parallel}} to the real system, in order to compute at each time step, bounds of the expected chlorine concentration at the different chlorine sensing locations. The sensor measurements are then compared with the estimated bounds and according to a certain event logic, an event <b>alarm</b> <b>flag</b> is raised when these bounds are exceeded. The methodology is applied on a realistic benchmark network, taking into account uncertainties in the hydraulic dynamics...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we have {{developed}} a new orthogonal cryptographic system for database security that has used both Cellular automata and Hash Algorithm. Our Algorithm consists of two different parts; Encryption/Decryption of database tables {{as well as the}} generation of the Authentication Tag for the activation of the attack alarm for the database tables while it is unlocked and in protected mode but it has been accessed by the illegal users. Our proposed orthogonal cryptosystem is considered to be symmetric algorithm and uses a common key for both encryption and decryption processes as oppose to the asymmetric one that requires two keys, private and public keys. Since our transformation matrix is orthogonal, we have used the property of orthogonal matrix to calculate its inverse based on its matrix transpose rather than direct matrix inversion to save the calculation time during the decryption process. We also have generated secret keys by applying the internal rules of cellular automata on the Malakooti Transform (M-T) to obtain the secret key matrix {{that can be used to}} be multiplied with the matrix of ASCII code obtained from the records of the database. To apply another level of security on the resulting encrypted code, the Hash values obtained from each record are multiplied by the elements of the secret key matrix and the XOR operation is performed on the resulting values and the elements of the encrypted codes. In addition, we also proposed a robust and fast algorithm for the database security and authentication that automatically and accurately will generate the Hash values for the entire rows of the database tables to obtain a unique Hash value for each table. This unique hash value can be used to check the validity of the data inside the database and guarantee the authentication of all information in each database. Our proposed method is capable of detecting any slight change that might be occurs on the database while it is in the protected mode. The generated Hash value will be calculated from the records elements of the database periodically to be compared with the value of the Hash value stored outside database for the authentication. Should the generated Hash value be different from the stored Hash value, the <b>alarm</b> <b>flag</b> would be activated to inform the administrator about unauthorized change of database while in protected mode via SMS or Email...|$|E
30|$|The Nexus 32 ^TM QEEG {{system and}} a cap were used, with 19 electrodes, two {{references}} (an electrode under each earlobe close to retrahens Auricular), and 1 ground (an electrode positioned at AFz) following the 10 – 20 standard. The sampling rate was 2, 048  Hz. The high sampling rate was used to allow flexibility when analyzing event-related potentials. Subjects were prepared by first cleaning the electrode positions on the scalp using alcohol pads. The cap was then mounted, adjusted, and the electrodes were filled with appropriate amount of skin prepping gel. After ensuring that all signals are of high quality (electrode offset is between ± 50, 000), the session starts. During the session, a screen indicating {{the quality of the}} signal for each electrode was used to monitor signal quality during data collection. A green color was used to indicate high quality signals, while a red color was used as an alarm for possible problems. No <b>alarm</b> was <b>flagged</b> during any of the experiments reported in this paper. EEG analysis was done on a second-by-second basis then averaged over 30  s for each IVA-CPT block.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a framework to process and analyze {{data from a}} pulse oximeter which measures pulse rate and blood oxygen saturation from a set of individuals remotely. Using case-based reasoning (CBR) as the backbone to the framework, records are analyzed and categorized according to how well they are similar. Record collection has been performed using a personalized health profiling approach where participants wore a pulse oximeter sensor for a fixed {{period of time and}} performed specific activities for pre-determined intervals. Using a variety of feature extraction in time, frequency and time-frequency domains, and data processing techniques, the data is fed into a CBR system which retrieves most similar cases and generates <b>alarm</b> and <b>flag</b> according to the case outcomes. The system has been compared with an expert's classification and 90 % match is achieved between the expert's and CBR classification. Again, considering the clustered measurements the CBR approach classifies 93 % correctly both for the pulse rate and oxygen saturation. Along with the proposed methodology, this paper provides a basis for which the system can be used in analysis of continuous health monitoring and be used as a suitable method as in home/remote monitoring systems.

5000|$|The {{fault in}} the ADF system made it {{impossible}} to be used as an approach aid. The VOR <b>flag</b> <b>alarm</b> was set too high and the glide-slope deflection sensitivity indication was set 50% more than its usual operational setting. It didn't prevent the system, but was rather [...] "exacting for the pilots". The faulty settings of the glide-slope alarm circuit prevented the flag appearing until the two signals were unusable or not received. If the faulty unit received an [...] "unsatisfactory signal", the pointer could move to the mid-position. The pilot on the left seat could not notice this failure. This is dangerous. If the pointer moved to the mid-position, the crew would have thought that they were on the correct glide path. Investigators then questioned the airworthiness of the aircraft due to these faults.|$|R
40|$|With over ﬁfty eruptive episodes (Strombolian activity, lava fountains, and lava ﬂows) between 2006 and 2013, Mt Etna, Italy, underscored {{its role}} as the most active volcano in Europe. Seven {{paroxysmal}} lava fountains at the South East Crater occurred in 2007 - 2008 and 46 at the New South East Crater between 2011 and 2013. Month-lasting lava emissions affected the upper eastern ﬂank of the volcano in 2006 and 2008 - 2009. On this background, effective monitoring and forecast of volcanic phenomena are a ﬁrst order issue for their potential socio-economic impact in a densely populated region like the town of Catania and its surroundings. For example, explosive activity has often formed thick ash clouds with widespread tephra fall able to disrupt the air trafﬁc, {{as well as to}} cause severe problems at infrastructures, such as highways and roads. For timely information on changes {{in the state of the}} volcano and possible onset of dangerous eruptive phenomena, the analysis of the continuous background seismic signal, the so-called volcanic tremor, turned out of paramount importance. Changes in the state of the volcano as well as in its eruptive style are usually concurrent with variations of the spectral characteristics (amplitude and frequency content) of tremor. The huge amount of digital data continuously acquired by INGV’s broadband seismic stations every day makes a manual analysis difﬁcult, and techniques of automatic classiﬁcation of the tremor signal are therefore applied. The application of unsupervised classiﬁcation techniques to the tremor data revealed signiﬁcant changes well before the onset of the eruptive episodes. This evidence led to the development of speciﬁc software packages related to real-time processing of the tremor data. The operational characteristics of these tools – fail-safe, robustness with respect to noise and data outages, as well as computational efﬁciency – allowed the identiﬁcation of criteria for automatic <b>alarm</b> <b>ﬂagging.</b> The system is hitherto one of the main automatic alerting tools to identify impending eruptive events at Etna. The currently operating software named KKAnalysis is applied to the data stream continuously recorded at two seismic stations. The data are merged with reference datasets of past eruptive episodes. In doing so, the results of pattern classiﬁcation can be immediately compared to previous eruptive scenarios. Given the rich material collected in recent years, here we propose the application of the alert system to a wider range (up to a total of eleven) stations at different elevations (1200 - 3050 m) and distances (1 - 8 km) from the summit craters. Critical alert parameters were empirically deﬁned to obtain an optimal tuning of the alert system for each station. To verify the robustness of this new, multistation alert system, a dataset encompassing about eight years of continuous seismic records (since 2006) was processed automatically using KKAnalysis and collateral software ofﬂine. Then, we analyzed the performance of the classiﬁer in terms of timing and spatial distribution of the stations...|$|R
40|$|Traffic anomaly {{detection}} {{has received a}} lot of attention over the years. Various techniques have been proposed in this area and some of them be-come commercial.

40|$|Over fifty eruptive episodes with Strombolian activity, lava fountains, and {{lava flows}} {{occurred}} at Mt Etna volcano between 2006 and 2013. Namely, {{there were seven}} paroxysmal lava fountains at the South-East Crater in 2007 - 2008 and 46 at the New South-East Crater between 2011 and 2013. Lava emissions lasting months affected the upper eastern flank of the volcano in 2006 and 2008 - 2009. Effective monitoring and forecast of such volcanic phenomena are particularly relevant for their potential socio-economic impact in densely populated regions like Catania and its surroundings. For example, explosive activity has often formed thick ash clouds with widespread tephra fall able to disrupt the air traffic, {{as well as to}} cause severe problems at infrastructures, such as highways and roads. Timely information about changes {{in the state of the}} volcano and possible onset of dangerous eruptive phenomena requires efficacious surveillance methods. The analysis of the continuous background seismic signal, the so-called volcanic tremor, turned out of paramount importance to follow the evolution of volcanic activity [e. g., Alparone et al., 2003; Falsaperla et al., 2005]. Changes in the state of the volcano as well as in its eruptive style are usually concurrent with variations of the spectral characteristics (amplitude and frequency) of tremor. The huge amount of digital data continuously acquired by INGV’s broadband seismic stations every day makes a manual analysis difficult. In order to tackle this problem, techniques of automatic classification of the tremor signal are applied. In a comparative study, the robustness of different methods for the identification of regimes in volcanic activity were examined [Langer et al., 2009]. In particular, Langer et al. [2011] applied unsupervised classification techniques to the tremor data recorded at one station during seven paroxysmal episodes in 2007 - 2008. Their results revealed significant changes in the pattern classification well before the onset of the eruptive episodes. This evidence led to the development of specific software packages, such as the program KKAnalysis [Messina and Langer, 2011], a software that combines an unsupervised classification method (Kohonen Maps) with fuzzy cluster analysis. The operational characteristics of these tools - fail-safe, robustness with respect to noise and data outages, as well as computational efficiency - allowed on-line processing at the operative centre of the INGV-Osservatorio Etneo in 2010 and the identification of criteria for automatic <b>alarm</b> <b>flagging.</b> The system is hitherto one of the main automatic alerting tools to identify impending eruptive events at Etna. The software carries out the on-line processing of the new data stream coming from two seismic stations, merged with reference datasets of past eruptive episodes. In doing so, results obtained for new data are immediately compared to previous eruptive scenarios. Given the rich material collected in recent years, we are able to apply the alert system to eleven stations at different elevations (1200 - 3050 m) and distances (1 - 8 km) from the summit craters. Critical alert parameters were empirically defined to obtain an optimal tuning of the alert system for each station. To verify the robustness of this new, multistation alert system, a dataset encompassing about eight years of continuous seismic records (since 2006) was processed automatically using KKAnalysis and collateral software off-line. Then, we analyzed the performance of the classifier in terms of timing and spatial distribution of the stations. We also investigated the performance of the new alert system based on KKAnalysis in case of activation of whatever eruptive centre. Intriguing results were obtained in 2010 throughout periods characterized by the renewal of volcanic activity at Bocca Nuova-Voragine and North-East Crater, and in the absence of paroxysmal phenomena at South-East Crater and New South-East Crater. Despite the low-energy phenomena reported by volcanologists (i. e., degassing, low-to moderate explosions), the triggered alarms demonstrate the robustness of the classifier and its potential: i) to identify even subtle changes within the volcanic system using tremor, and ii) to highlight the activation of a single eruptive centre, even though different from the one for which the classifier was initially tested. It is worth noting that in case of activation of weak sources, the successful performance of the classifier depends upon the general level of signals originating from other sources in that specific time span...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: The Objective Structured Clinical Examination was {{designed}} 30 {{years ago by}} Harden. It has been {{thought of as a}} reliable and objective tool to evaluate clinical competences in structured patient encounters. Although generally accepted as a high stake assessment process, reliability, validity and reproducibility of an OSCE still are subject of discussions and concerns. These days the question urges wether a compensatory or an additional rating is advisable for the final pass-fail decision. Aim: The hypothesis is that a yellow card system (red flagging) could help to identify the high risk future clinicians. Method: During 8 OSCE-sessions, which included 354 GP-students, observers were asked to deal a yellow card in case of ‘alarming acts’. These acts were defined as dramatic or dangerous shortcomings on three levels: theoretical, practical and behavioral level. Result: During three academic years, involving 354 students, and eight OSCE-sessions only 41 yellow cards were dealt. Strikingly, one single observer was responsible for one quarter of the allocations. During two sessions half of all yellow cards was dealt to poor performing students. Students remembered with a yellow card were more likely to underperform on all assessments except on the internship. Conclusion: <b>Flagging</b> <b>alarming</b> or critical events during simulated patient encounters does not identify high risk students. Perhaps in future research the evaluation of internships should be stressed in order to guarantee an objective quotation. Finally, the idea of ‘flagging’ is not be abandoned but moved to other assessment situations. status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} Markov Decision Process (MDP) {{framework}} for computing post-fault reconfiguration {{policies that are}} optimal {{with respect to a}} discounted cost. Our cost function penalizes states that are unsuitable to achieve the remaining objectives of the given mission. The cost function also penalizes states where the necessary goal achievement actions cannot be executed. We incorporate probabilities of missed detections and false alarms for a given fault condition into our cost to encourage the selection of policies that minimize the likelihood of incorrect reconfiguration. To illustrate the implementation of our proposed framework, we present an example inspired by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spacecraft with a mission to collect scientific data from 5 targets. Using this example, we also demonstrate that there is a design tradeoff between safe operation and mission completion. Simulation results are presented to illustrate and manage this tradeoff through the selection of optimization parameters. Nomenclature F = Vector of fault flags (F = {f 1, f 2, …, f m 1 }).
