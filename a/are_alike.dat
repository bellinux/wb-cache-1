25|$|The brown awl is a non-descript brown butterfly, darker {{above and}} lighter below. The sexes <b>are</b> <b>alike,</b> except {{for three to}} four semi-transparent spots on the forewing which cannot be {{differentiated}} in the field.

25|$|The {{date of the}} {{composition}} of the declaration and its author <b>are</b> <b>alike</b> unknown; but it was in existence at the Geonic period (589–1038 CE).

25|$|Many novels {{focusing}} on life on other planets written close to 1900 echo scientific {{ideas of the}} time, including Pierre-Simon Laplace's nebular hypothesis, Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, and Gustav Kirchhoff's theory of Spectroscopy. These scientific ideas combined to present the possibility that planets <b>are</b> <b>alike</b> in composition and conditions {{for the development of}} species, which would likely lead to the emergence of life at a suitable geological age in a planet's development.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} subspecies (Precis octavia sesamus) has {{a summer}} form (natalensis) which is red with black markings, and a winter form (sesamus) which is blue {{with a line}} of red markings on the wings. The winter form is slightly larger than the summer form. In both forms the males and females <b>are</b> <b>alike,</b> however the females are slightly larger. Intermediate forms of the gaudy commodore are rare, but display {{a wide range of}} mixtures of the wing patterns of both forms.|$|E

The sexes <b>are</b> <b>alike.</b> The iris is yellow and the bill is black while the base of the lower mandible is greenish grey. The tarsi are grey. The juvenile is similar but has a pale lower mandible and white fringes to the feathers of the upper body.|$|E
25|$|As a {{supplement}} to this treatise he wrote a second, which he called the Kitab al-Af'al Dhawat al-Mathalain (The Book of Verbs Containing Double Letters), and in which he points out the principles governing the verbs whose second and third radicals <b>are</b> <b>alike.</b> He furnishes a list of these verbs, together with their various forms occurring in the Bible. Besides the two treatises on verbs Hayyuj wrote Kitab al-Tanqit (The Book of Punctuation). This work, probably written before his two chief treatises, {{is an attempt to}} set forth the features underlying the Masoretic use of the vowels and of the word-tone. In this work he deals chiefly with nouns, and its purpose is more of a practical than of a theoretical character.|$|E
25|$|The preludes {{are quite}} varied {{in style and}} structure, and are {{therefore}} hard to categorize, as no two praeludia <b>are</b> <b>alike.</b> The texture of Buxtehude’s praeludia {{can be described as}} either free or fugal. They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants. Structure-wise, there usually is an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this basic scheme is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude’s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, does so in a new, changed way. A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with five-voice structure in which two of the voices are taken by the pedal).|$|E

The man is {{revealed}} to be Willmott-Brown and that Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), Luke Browning (Adam Astill) and Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre) are his children. On Halloween, Michelle tells Kathy about her stalker, Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey) and she and Michelle give relationship advice to Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) about Bex. When Kathy shuts up the café, she is startled when James comes in. As James acts casual, Kathy takes hold of a knife and James tells Kathy he has been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Kathy rubbishes James' beliefs that they <b>are</b> <b>alike</b> and James says {{the reason for his}} visit is to move on from the past. Kathy wants James to explain truthfully what happened {{on the night of the}} rape, but when he refuses to do so, Kathy retells it, demanding to know when he decided to rape her and she realises that James chose to rape her when he locked up The Dagmar. Kathy tells James that he has scared her that night like the night he raped her, but James, still in denial, refuses to apologise for the rape and he leaves Kathy his address. Kathy confides in Ian that James is back and Ian contacts Phil about James.|$|E

500|$|Liszt's Faust and Dante symphonies {{share the}} same {{aesthetic}} stance as the symphonic poems, though they are multi-movement works that employ a chorus, their compositional methods and aims <b>are</b> <b>alike.</b> Two Episodes from Lenau's Faust should also be considered with the symphonic poems. The first, [...] "Der nächtliche Zug", is closely descriptive of Faust as he watches a passing procession of pilgrims by night. The second, [...] "Der Tanz in der Dorfschenke", which {{is also known as}} the First Mephisto Waltz, tells of Mephistopheles seizing a violin at a village dance.|$|E

500|$|It is as a symphonist that Vaughan Williams is best known. The {{composer}} and academic Elliott Schwartz wrote (1964), [...] "It {{may be said}} with truth that Vaughan Williams, Sibelius and Prokofieff are the symphonists of this century". Although Vaughan Williams did not complete the first of them until he was thirty-eight years old, the nine symphonies span {{nearly half a century}} of his creative life. In his 1964 analysis of the nine, Schwartz found it striking that no two of the symphonies <b>are</b> <b>alike,</b> either in structure or in mood. Commentators have found it useful to consider the nine in three groups of three—early, middle and late.|$|E

500|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} is [...] long {{with a broad}} body, wings and tail. It has sooty-brown upperparts and {{slightly}} paler underparts, with a streaked pale dull rufous chin, throat and foreneck. The tail is short and square, with small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. The underwing coverts are dark brown, the eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes <b>are</b> <b>alike,</b> but juveniles have rufous grey tips to the plumage of the upperparts and wings. This species can be distinguished from the Eurasian crag martin and rock martin by its darker underparts, and its white tail spots are significantly smaller {{than those of the}} Eurasian crag martin. The under-tail coverts are of the same shade as the underside of the abdomen but these are darker in the Eurasian crag martin.|$|E
500|$|The outer {{and inner}} mantapa (open and closed) have {{circular}} lathe-turned pillars having four brackets at the top. Over each bracket stands sculptured figure(s) called salabhanjika or madanika. The pillars may also exhibit ornamental carvings {{on the surface}} and no two pillars <b>are</b> <b>alike.</b> This is how Hoysala art differs from the work of their early overlords, the Western Chalukyas, who added sculptural details to the circular pillar base and left the top plain. The lathe-turned pillars are 16, 32, or 64-pointed; some are bell-shaped and have properties that reflect light. The Parsvanatha Basadi at Halebidu is a good example. According to Brown, the pillars with four monolithic brackets above them carry images of salabhanjikas and madanikas (sculpture of a woman, displaying stylised feminine features). This is a common feature of Chalukya-Hoysala temples. According to Sastri, the shape of the pillar and its capital, the base of which is square and whose shaft is a monolith that is lathe turned to render different shapes, is a [...] "remarkable feature" [...] of Hoysala art.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{details of}} the {{sticking}} mechanism remain controversial. Possibilities include mechanical interlocking, sintering, electrostatic attraction {{as well as the}} existence of a [...] "sticky" [...] liquid-like layer on the crystal surface. The individual ice crystals often have hexagonal symmetry. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles. The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed. Rarely, at a temperature of around , snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry — triangular snowflakes. The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near-perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more visually appealing. It is unlikely that any two snowflakes <b>are</b> <b>alike</b> due to the estimated 1019 (10 quintillion) water molecules which make up a typical snowflake, which grow at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through {{on its way to the}} ground.|$|E
