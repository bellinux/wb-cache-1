40|$|Purpose: This study {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} model of {{level of service}} evaluation to a small-sized airport {{with a focus on}} departing passengers. Design/methodology: The variables selected to compose the model were chosen according to their adequacy to departing passengers and the <b>airport’s</b> <b>characteristics.</b> A survey was conducted, and, posteriorly, exploratory factor analysis was used in order to verify the adequacy of the conceptual model proposed and also to improve it according to the results obtained. Findings: The results show that the level of service of the airport is composed of three dimensions: <b>airport</b> <b>characteristics,</b> passenger processing, and prices. The relative importance of the dimensions according to their contribution to the composition of the airport’s overall level of service was also determined. Originality/value: The paper combines theoretical and practical findings in a model for level of service evaluation to a small-sized airport from an air transportation management perspective.

40|$|Abstract Italian and European {{legislations}} propose airport noise indicators {{based on}} the acoustic climate in the airport surrounding areas and the noise exposed population density. In fact, Italian Environmental Minister Decree of 20 th May 1999 defines an index for airport classification; besides, an European proposal concerning a new aircraft noise indicator is being discussed (“Proposal for a Directive on {{the establishment of a}} Community framework for noise classification of civil subsonic aircraft for the purposes of calculating noise charges”, 2001 / 0308 COD, Brussels 2001). These indicators are not appropriate to evaluate airport environmental rate-benefits ratio for many airports; in fact, transport and logistic <b>airport</b> <b>characteristics</b> are not taken into account. In this paper, an integrated airport noise index is proposed. The new index takes into account the previous indicators parameters but also <b>airport</b> <b>characteristics</b> such traffic data, logistic and connection structures and the airport strategic significance. Thus, the proposed indicator may be very useful for the airport managing companies; at last, some Italian airports cases have been analyzed by the new noise evaluation procedure in order to test it...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} TRACON flow {{management}} around a major airport. Aircraft flows are analyzed through {{a study of}} TRACON trajectories records. Rerouting and queuing processes are highlighted and <b>airport</b> <b>characteristics</b> are shown as function {{of the number of}} planes in the TRACON. Then, a simple input-output TRACON queuing and landing model is proposed. This model is calibrated and validated using available TRACON data. It reproduces the same phenomenon as the real system. This model is used to show the impact of limiting the number of aircrafts in the TRACON. A limited number of aircraft does not increase delays but reduces the controller’s workload and increases safety. ...|$|R
