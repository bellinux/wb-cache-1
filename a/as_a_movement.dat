5|$|Romanticism {{began to}} subside <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> in the 1830s, but it {{continued}} to significantly affect areas such as music until the early twentieth century. It also had a lasting impact {{on the nature of}} Scottish identity and outside perceptions of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to {{contribute}} poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes, {{making him the}} only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist. Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period. However, with World War I as a backdrop, the times were not easy for avant-garde literary movements (Aldington, for example, {{spent much of the}} war at the front), and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|The discourses {{contained}} {{with this}} gospel {{seem to be}} concerned with issues of the church–synagogue debate at the time of composition. It is notable that in John, the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian community. Though Christianity started <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> within Judaism, it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual opposition between the two religions.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars of {{religion}} have categorised Rastafari <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new religious <b>movement,</b> <b>a</b> new social <b>movement,</b> or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>movement.</b> The scholar {{of religion}} Leonard E. Barrett {{referred to it}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sect, and the sociologist Ernest Cashmore <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cult, while scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> revitalization <b>movement.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> slow <b>movement</b> is <b>a</b> form in a multi-movement musical piece. Generally, {{the second}} <b>movement</b> of <b>a</b> piece will be written <b>as</b> <b>a</b> slow <b>movement,</b> {{although}} composers occasionally write other <b>movements</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> slow <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> well. The tempo of <b>a</b> slow <b>movement</b> {{can vary from}} largo to andante. It is usually in the dominant, subdominant, parallel, or relative key of the musical work's main key.|$|R
50|$|Though it {{has been}} {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>movement,</b> members of the movement believe their actions are better described <b>as</b> part of <b>a</b> civil rights <b>movement.</b> Objections to the characterizations of the <b>movement</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>movement</b> {{are related to the}} belief that discrimination against fathers moves beyond the social sciences and originates in government intervention into family life.|$|R
5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew {{with the}} concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> began to dissolve, {{emerging}} bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not really part of the Britpop scene, included The Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> within architecture, {{as opposed to}} a full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E

25|$|Antifeminism {{might be}} {{motivated}} by the belief that feminist theories of patriarchy and disadvantages suffered by women in society are incorrect or exaggerated; that feminism <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> encourages misandry and results in harm or oppression of men; or driven by general opposition towards women's rights.|$|E

25|$|During this time, Chavez also {{clashed with}} other UFW members about policy issues, {{including}} the possible creation of local unions for the UFW, which was typical for national unions but which Chavez was firmly against, {{on the grounds}} that it detracted from his vision for the UFW <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

25|$|Congregationalism is {{more easily}} {{identified}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> {{than a single}} denomination, given its distinguishing commitment to the complete autonomy of the local congregation. The idea that each distinct congregation fully constitutes the visible Body of the church can, however, be traced to John Wycliffe and the Lollard movement, which followed Wycliffe's removal from teaching authority in the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|The term “retro” or “retro-aesthetic” {{became popular}} in the mass culture of the nineties, rather than through any art connection. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> that has {{penetrated}} film, fashion, music and custom design to a similar extent, retro has become a specific expression of a cultural orientation - {{the spirit of the}} times in {{the last decade of the}} twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|Associated with {{painters}} such as Frank Stella, minimalism in painting, {{as opposed}} to other areas, is <b>a</b> modernist <b>movement.</b> Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> precursor to the postmodern movement. Seen {{from the perspective of}} writers who sometimes classify it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> postmodern <b>movement,</b> early minimalism began and succeeded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> modernist <b>movement</b> to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.|$|R
