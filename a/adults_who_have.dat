They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess.

5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder.

In most healthy adolescents and <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} {{corruption}} of minors statute against adults corrupting the morals of minors under 18 years of age. However, the corruption of minors statute only applies to perpetrators 18 {{years of age and}} older, so it is always legal for minors 16-17 to have sex with each other but not always with a partner 18 or older. Pennsylvania prosecutors use this law against <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> consensual intercourse with 16- and 17-year-olds, and it would count as a misdemeanor offense. In 2005 JoAnne Epps, a former prosecutor and Temple University Beasley School of Law dean of academic affairs, stated that the corruption of minors charge {{is considered to be a}} separate crime from that of statutory rape; she stated that the consideration of whether a minor is consenting to sexual activity is a separate issue from whether someone is corrupting the minor's morals.|$|E

25|$|Potassium bromide is not {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans to control seizures. In Germany, it is still approved as an antiepileptic drug for humans, particularly children and adolescents. These indications include severe forms of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, early-childhood-related Grand-Mal-seizures, and also severe myoclonic seizures during childhood. <b>Adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> reacted positively to the drug during childhood/adolescence may continue treatment. Potassium bromide tablets are sold under the brand name Dibro-Be mono (Rx-only). The drug has almost complete bioavailability, but the bromide ion has a relatively long half life of 12 days in the blood, making bromide salts difficult to adjust and dose. Bromide is not known {{to interfere with the}} absorption or excretion of any other anticonvulsant, though it does have strong interactions with chloride in the body, the normal body uptake and excretion of which strongly influences bromide's excretion.|$|E
500|$|Pugs are one {{of several}} breeds that are more {{susceptible}} than other dogs to demodectic mange, also known as [...] "demodex". This condition is caused when parasitic mites, that are often present in a dog's skin without causing symptoms, are allowed to do damage because their host has a weakened immune system. It {{is a problem for}} many young Pugs, although not usually a major one, and is easily treatable, but some are especially susceptible and present with a systemic form of the condition. This vulnerability is thought to be genetic and breeders will avoid producing puppies from <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> this condition. In 2008, an investigative documentary carried out by the BBC found significant inbreeding between pedigree dogs, with a study by Imperial College, London, showing that the 10,000 Pugs in the UK are so inbred that their gene pool is the equivalent of only 50 individuals.|$|E

Approaches such as [...] "Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia" [...] train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words, providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation. Communication boards can be very helpful for patients with aphasia, especially with patients who are very severe.

500|$|Naruto {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a coming-of-age story. Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series. [...] In Yukari Fujimoto's view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as One Piece and Air Gear. [...] Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: [...] "Naruto’s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge". [...] Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins. [...] Shōnen Jump began to carry comedies such as Gintama and Reborn! from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki's view {{this is part of the}} reason for the change in emphasis: Naruto [...] "was not supposed to provide laughter anymore".|$|E
500|$|Margaret Beale Spencer and Vinay Harpalani (2008) {{argue that}} {{usage of the}} term [...] "acting white" [...] by black {{teenagers}} does not reflect their cultural values; rather, it is a manifestation of their racial identity development, experienced in conjunction with normal adolescent hassles and peer pressure. [...] Spencer and Harpalani employ William E. Cross's (1991) Nigrescence framework and contend that black teenagers' use of [...] "acting white" [...] in relation to academic achievement is similar to white teenagers' {{use of the term}} [...] "nerd": {{the only difference is that}} black teenagers express it in racialized terms, as in addition to normal teenage peer pressure, they are grappling with racial identity and what it means to be [...] "black". [...] Expressions such as [...] "acting white" [...] may or may not reflect black teenagers' cultural values, and their usage is sometimes counterintuitive: for example, Ogbu (2003) himself documented one instance where a black teenage girl with natural hair was accused of [...] "acting white" [...] by her black peers because [...] "like white people, she did not have to process her hair." [...] These kind of examples show that accusations of [...] "acting white" [...] are not fundamentally about black cultural attributes (although such accusations may reflect these attributes). [...] Rather, [...] "acting white" [...] is just a manifestation of racial identity development for black children and teenagers, who are learning and defining for themselves what it means to be [...] "black"—in conjunction with normal adolescent peer pressure and hassles. That is also why such accusations are less common among black <b>adults,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> come to greater resolution regarding racial identity issues.|$|E
