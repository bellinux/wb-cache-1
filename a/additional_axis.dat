50|$|Once again, {{a process}} for {{producing}} flat profiles from sheet or plate metal, however with the introduction of an <b>additional</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation, the cutting head of a CNC Plasma Cutting machine can tilt whilst being taken through a conventional 2 dimensional cutting path. The result of this is cut edges at an angle other than 90 Degrees to the material surface, for example 30-45 Degree angles. This angle is continuous throughout the thickness of the material. This is typically applied in situations where the profile being cut is to be used as part of a welded fabrication as the angled edge forms part of the weld preparation. When the weld preparation is applied during the cnc plasma cutting process, secondary operations such as grinding or machining can be avoided, reducing cost.
