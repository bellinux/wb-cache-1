5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl <b>and</b> <b>walk,</b> are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|At the Miles family home, Billy, now highly suspicious, {{enters and}} pulls his {{gun on the}} man {{who appears to be}} his father. After the confrontation, Billy relinquishes his gun, at which point the other man {{physically}} morphs and reveals himself to be the Alien Bounty Hunter. At that point, Mulder and Scully pull up <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> into the house, unable to locate Billy or his father.|$|E

5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|He {{had shot}} June in her bed, but {{she managed to}} get up <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> a few steps before {{collapsing}} and dying. He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill {{was able to get}} downstairs where he and Bamber fought in the kitchen, before Bamber shot him four times, twice in his temple and twice into the top of his head. He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as they slept.|$|E

She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with Tall Story, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins.

5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jasper {{visits the}} Kwik-E-Mart and {{attempts}} to empty the freezer containing ice cream in order to freeze himself, {{with the intention of}} being defrosted sometime in the distant future.

The convenience store becomes more profitable as a tourist trap, until the freezer's cooling system fails, causing Jasper to defrost <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> away.|$|E
5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E

5|$|The Adenhart family {{created the}} Nick Adenhart Memorial Fund, which is {{designed}} to provide financial support to youth baseball organizations. The goal is to lend a helping hand to struggling leagues around the country to buy equipment and cover expenses to keep youth baseball functioning. The first presentation from the fund was for $5000 to the Halfway Little League in Halfway, Maryland. Two annual events, the Nick Adenhart 5K Run <b>and</b> <b>Walk</b> and the Nick Adenhart Baseball Camp, have been established to benefit the foundation.|$|E
5|$|When this {{prayer is}} finished, the choir sings an English {{translation}} of the traditional Latin antiphon Confortare: Be strong and of a good courage; keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> in his ways. During the singing of this antiphon, all stand in their places, and the monarch remains seated in the Coronation Chair still wearing the crown and holding the sceptres. The recitation of this antiphon {{is followed by a}} rite of benediction consisting of several prayers.|$|E
5|$|William and a tearful Mary {{were married}} in St James's Palace by Bishop Henry Compton on 4 November 1677. Mary {{accompanied}} her husband on a rough sea crossing back to the Netherlands later that month, after a delay of two weeks caused by bad weather. Rotterdam was inaccessible because of ice, and {{they were forced to}} land at the small village of Ter Heijde, <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> through the frosty countryside until met by coaches to take them to Huis Honselaarsdijk. On 14 December, they made a formal entry to The Hague in a grand procession.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the girl}} {{told her the}} whole story, and the Moon listened, and was sorry for her; and though she could not tell her where to find her husband, she gave her an almond, {{and told her to}} crack it when she was in great need.

5|$|After the 1976 tour, Townshend took {{most of the}} {{following}} year off {{to spend time with}} his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand <b>and</b> <b>walk.</b> The events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.|$|E
5|$|Castle Wolfenstein, {{originally}} {{available on}} the Apple II in 1981, also employed stealth elements as a focus of the gameplay. Players were charged with traversing the levels of Castle Wolfenstein, stealing secret plans and escaping. Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> by guards undetected. Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, released in 1984, included some additions to its predecessor, such as a dagger for close-range kills and {{a greater emphasis on}} disguising in enemy uniform. id Software's technically updated 1992 remake Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to feature some of the original's stealth gameplay, such as body hiding, but this was cut to make the game faster paced. This Wolfenstein game would ironically pave the way for quite a few later 3D action games, specifically first-person shooters.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor also {{broke with}} {{tradition}} by inviting hundreds of African-American guests to the White House. When the black singer Marian Anderson was denied {{the use of}} Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939, Eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert {{on the steps of}} the Lincoln Memorial. Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner. Roosevelt also arranged the appointment of African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. To avoid problems with the staff when Bethune would visit the White House, Eleanor would meet her at the gate, embrace her, <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> in with her arm-in-arm.|$|E

60|$|Then {{the bride}} {{told him the}} whole story. and did not hide her own ill-doing.

5|$|Humber was {{assigned}} to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber {{was hit in the}} face on a line drive by Luis Cruz. After lying on the mound for a few minutes, he was able to get up <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> on his own to the dugout. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he received eighteen stitches.

Conservation work was carried out on the listed structures, including the statues, railings and fountain. In the Museum Gardens, the bowling green was relocated to the Recreation Grounds and in its previous location beds of flowers were planted to recreate the Victorian geometric landscaping to the gardens.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the fashion}} of those times... for the {{principal}} gentry, lords, courtiers, and men of all professions not merely mechanic, to meet in Paul's Church by eleven <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> in the middle aisle till twelve, and after dinner from three to six, during which times some discoursed on business, others of news. Now in regard of the universal there happened little that did not first or last arrive here... And those news-mongers, as they called them, did not only take the boldness to weigh the public but most intrinsic actions of the state, which some courtier or other did betray to this society.|$|E
