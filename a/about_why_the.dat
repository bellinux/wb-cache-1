5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

She declares war on the Inhumans when Beast reports that the Terrigen cloud will soon saturate and render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants, believing that they have no time to attempt negotiation. When Medusa learns the truth <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> X-Men went to war against the Inhumans, she willingly destroys the cloud and ends the possibility of future Inhuman manifestations so that the mutants can survive.|$|E

[...] He noted that accounting scandals were not uniquely Japanese, but that it was [...] "a nice piece of corporate satire to conceal losses by exploiting the widespread habit of paying too much for acquisitions and writing them down [...] the 'advisory fee' was especially creative". Gapper criticised the weakness in governance, particularly how 12 out of 15 directors were either executives or former executives of the company, and that Hideo Yamada, head of the Audit Board, was complicit in the scam. He also noted that auditors KPMG and Ernst & Young would have to answer tough questions <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> manipulation was never discovered or properly questioned.|$|E
500|$|Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{wrote an}} article <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> video was an {{important}} release for Madonna. He felt that although the Rebel Heart era had received more promotion than the previous MDNA era, the commercial returns had been diminishing. The first two singles, [...] "Living for Love" [...] and [...] "Ghosttown", failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the first Madonna album without a Hot 100 single, until [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] debuted at number 84. The video, Lipshutz theorized, was Madonna's attempt to bring back an audience for the whole era. Joe Lynch from the same magazine called the video an [...] "embarrassment of star power", adding that it [...] "has everything: Miley's middle fingers, Madonna kissing a shirtless hunk, topless women in a bathtub, break-dancing, sock puppets singing, Moschino fashion and much more".

500|$|The {{performers}} {{category is}} meant for recording artists and bands that have [...] "influence and {{significance to the}} development and perpetuation of rock and roll." [...] Artists become eligible for induction in that category 25 years {{after the release of}} their first record. In order to be inducted, an artist must be nominated by a committee that selects anywhere from nine to a dozen candidates. Ballots are sent to 600 [...] "rock experts" [...] who then evaluate the candidates and vote on who should be inducted. The performers who receive the highest number of votes and more than 50 percent of the vote are inducted. In 2011, the number inducted was five. The rest of the categories are voted on by special committees. In 2012, six additional bands and groups were inducted as performers by a special committee, due to the controversial nature of their band being excluded when their lead singer was inducted. [...] "There was a lot of discussion about this," [...] said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. [...] "There had always been conversations <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result." ...|$|E

500|$|Mayor Richard M.

[...] "Lawyers do make mistakes," [...] Daley said. [...] "That's what it was. ... It's {{embarrassing}} to them. Yes it is - the corporation counsel and the Park District counsel." [...] Chicago Park District Superintendent Tim Mitchell said the Park District also wanted to renegotiate the contract. In a February 9, 2005 letter to O'Malley and Horan, Georges warned that the concession agreement [...] "does not authorize your occupation of the Park Grill facilities" [...] because the city owns the land, and City Hall should have been party to the original agreement when it was not. On February 11, 2005, Daley asked state lawmakers to impose tougher penalties for defrauding tax payers, and was questioned by reporters <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Park Grill had not paid any property taxes and gets free gas, water and garbage pick-up. Erma Tranter, president of the Friends of the Parks watchdog group, speaking at a Park District Board of Commissioners meeting, questioned why the Park Grill contract had yet to be renegotiated 11 months after Mayor Daley vowed to do so. The Chicago Sun-Times dubbed the Park Grill the [...] "Clout Cafe" [...] and included the contract award process in a year-end review of 2005 Daley administration scandals.|$|E
500|$|Others saw no {{intentional}} snub of Colbert by the press. Responding to {{a question}} <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>The</b> Washington Posts article about the dinner did not go into any detail about Colbert's speech, Media Backtalk writer Howard Kurtz responded, [...] "The problem in part is one of deadline. The presses were already rolling by the time Colbert came on at 10:30, so the story had to be largely written by then." [...] Asked why television news favored Bush's performance over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an assistant dean at the Columbia School of Journalism and a former 60 Minutes producer, told MTV that the [...] "quick hit" [...] for television news shows {{would have been to}} use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator. [...] "It's an easier set up for visual effect", she noted. Steve Scully, president of the White House Correspondents' Association (which hosted the dinner) and political editor of C-SPAN (which broadcast the dinner), scoffed at the whole idea of the press intentionally ignoring Colbert: [...] "Bush hit such a home run with Steve Bridges that he got all of the coverage. I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy." [...] Time columnist Ana Marie Cox dismissed allegations of a deliberate media blackout, because Colbert's performance received coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the major wire services. Fellow commentator Kurtz concurred, noting that the video was carried on C-SPAN and was freely available online; he also played two clips on his own show. [...] "Apparently I didn't get the memo," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E
