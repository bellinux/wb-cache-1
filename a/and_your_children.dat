5|$|Many of Khrushchev's {{innovations}} {{were reversed}} after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, {{as was the}} division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program {{for high school students}} was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries. People were required to register to attend, and church-going would bar you from party membership, from promotion, from better housing <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> {{would not be able to}} get into the better schools.|$|E

500|$|Residents of Mokhoyan, {{a village}} about 500 metres east of Camp Belamby, stated that a bomb had {{exploded}} in their vicinity on 8 March, destroying an armored vehicle and wounding several U.S. soldiers. They recounted that U.S. soldiers afterwards lined {{many of the}} male villagers against a wall, threatening to [...] "get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people," [...] and threatening that [...] "you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> will pay for this". One Mokhoyan resident told The Associated Press [...] "It {{looked like they were}} going to shoot us, and I was very afraid." [...] U.S. officials from The Pentagon declared that they had [...] "no evidence" [...] that villagers had been lined up against a wall and threatened in Mokhoyan. U.S. officials refused to confirm or deny that U.S. soldiers were wounded outside the village on 8 March.|$|E

[...] XXII Deiotariana was disbanded after serious losses. In addition, some historians argue that Legio IX Hispana disbandment in the mid-2nd century could also have been {{a result of this}} war. While previously it had generally been accepted that the Ninth disappearance was after 108 CE (thus possibly suffering a demise in Britain according to Mommsen), with the 2015 Nijmegen archaeological findings dated to 121 CE and the known inscriptions of two senior officers, who were deputy commanders of the Ninth in 120 CE, and lived on for several decades to lead distinguished public careers, it was concluded that the Legion was disbanded between 120 and 197 CE - either {{as a result of the}} Bar-Kokhba revolt (132-6) or Cappadocia (161) or at the Danube (162).|$|E
