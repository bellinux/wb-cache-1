25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, <b>a</b> <b>shriek</b> is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E
500|$|Aimée and Manon cannot {{remain on}} the farm, and Papet offers to buy them out. As mother and {{daughter}} are packing their belongings, Papet and Ugolin {{make their way to}} where they blocked the spring, to pull out the plug. Manon follows them, and when she sees what the two are doing, [...] understands and gives out <b>a</b> <b>shriek.</b> The men hear it, but quickly dismiss the sound as that of a buzzard making a kill. As Papet performs a mock baptism of his nephew in the cold water of the spring, the film ends with the caption [...] "end of part one".|$|E
500|$|In the Russian Imperial Palace, while Tsar Paul I sleeps, a dalliance {{between two}} courtiers ends with <b>a</b> <b>shriek</b> which wakens the tsar. Enraged, he demands that his {{officials}} produce the culprit or face banishment for life. Meanwhile, a clerk's slip {{of the pen}} while compiling a military duty roster results in the inclusion in the list of a fictitious officer, [...] "Lieutenant Kijé". When the tsar inspects the list he is intrigued by this name, and asks that the officer be presented to him. The court officials are too terrified of the tsar to admit that a mistake has been made, and are in a dilemma until it occurs to them to blame [...] "Kijé" [...] for the nocturnal disturbance. They inform the tsar, who duly orders the imaginary lieutenant flogged and sent to Siberia.|$|E

60|$|At last my hand closed {{upon the}} ship's rail and that very instant <b>a</b> horrid <b>shriek</b> rang out below me that sent my blood cold and turned my horrified eyes {{downward}} to <b>a</b> <b>shrieking,</b> hurtling, twisting thing that shot downward into the awful chasm beneath me.|$|R

500|$|Longtime Spielberg {{collaborator}} John Williams {{composed the}} music score of War of the Worlds. It {{was the first}} time Williams had to compose with an incomplete Spielberg film, as only the first six reels, totalling sixty minutes, were ready for him to use as reference. He considered the score [...] "a very serious piece," [...] which had to combine [...] "necessary frightening atmosphere" [...] with [...] "propulsively rhythmic drive for the action scenes" [...] – the music would be symbolically [...] "pulling forward" [...] vehicles in chase scenes such as Ray driving out of Bayonne or the Tripod attacking the Hudson ferry. Williams added small nods to classic monster movie scores by having orchestras doing a [...] "grand gesture" [...] in scenes overlooking Tripods. To increase the scariness, Williams added a female chorus with a crescendo resembling <b>a</b> <b>shriek</b> – which would [...] "humanize" [...] the track representing [...] "victims that go out without saying an 'ouch' – they're gone before they can say that" [...] – for the Tripod attacks, and a nearly inaudible male choir – which Williams compared to [...] "Tibetan monks, the lowest known pitch our bodies can make" [...] – for the aliens exploring the basement. The only deviation from orchestras were electronic sounds for the opening and closing narrations.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{said the}} album was never {{finished}} {{and because of the}} demand for the record, the distributors insisted the album be completed, otherwise they would cancel the album's orders. This resulted in Dr. Dre mixing the album and inserting the skits within 48 hours, which enabled the album to be released. Rolling Stone writer Jonathan Gold described how Dr. Dre produced a beat from scratch to complete instrumental: [...] "Dre may find something he likes from an old drum break, loop it and gradually replace each part with a better tom-tom sound, a kick-drum sound he adores, until the beat bears the same relationship to the original that the Incredible Hulk does to Bill Bixby". Gold also described how the track progressed with other musicians adding to the song, stating [...] "A bass player wanders in, unpacks his instrument and pops a funky two-note bass line over the beat, then leaves to watch CNN, though his two notes keep looping into infinity. A smiling guy in a striped jersey plays a nasty one-fingered melody on an old Minimoog synthesizer that's been obsolete since 1982, and Dre scratches in a sort of surfadelic munching noise, and then from his well-stocked Akai MPC60 samples comes <b>a</b> <b>shriek,</b> a spare piano chord, an ejaculation from the first Beastie's record -- [...] "Let me clear my throat"—and the many-layered groove is happening, bumping, breathing, almost loud enough to see." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 15th Hussars charged, {{over about}} [...] of snowy, frozen ground, {{shouting}} [...] "Emsdorf and Victory!" [...] It {{was so cold}} the hussars wore their pelisses, rather than having them slung over their shoulders, and many had cloaks over all. Eyewitnesses also spoke of numbed hands hardly able to grasp reins and sabres. The impact when the hussars met the chasseurs was terrible, as one British officer recorded: [...] "horses and men were overthrown and <b>a</b> <b>shriek</b> of terror, intermixed with oaths, groans and prayers for mercy issued from the whole extent of their front." [...] The impetus of the British hussars carried them {{through the ranks of}} the chasseurs and into those of the dragoons behind. The French force was broken, and it routed eastwards with the British in pursuit. Many French cavalrymen (though the chasseurs were largely of German origin) were taken prisoner at very little cost to the 15th Hussars. Two French lieutenant colonels were captured and the chasseurs, who lost many men captured, ceased to exist as a viable regiment. The 10th Hussars came up during the pursuit, however, they were initially mistaken for French cavalry. This caused the 15th Hussars to break off their pursuit to re-form, ending the action.|$|E

2500|$|The American Society for Psychical Research wanted further investigation. In 1926, a {{committee}} of three professors (Knight Dunlap, Henry C. McComas and Robert Williams Wood) was sent to Boston. Crandon had a luminous star attached to her forehead, identifying the location of {{her face in the}} dark. After a few minutes, a narrow dark rod appeared over a luminous checkerboard which had been placed on the table opposite Crandon. It moved from side to side and picked up an object. As it passed in front of Wood he lightly touched it with the tip of his finger and followed it back to a point very near Crandon's mouth. Wood thought it probable she was holding the rod by her teeth. He took hold of the tip and very quietly pinched it. It felt like a knitting needle covered with one or two layers of soft leather. Though the committee had been warned that touching the ectoplasm could result in the illness or death of the medium, neither Crandon nor the [...] "ectoplasm" [...] rod showed any reaction to Wood's actions. At the end of the sitting, Wood dictated his actions to the stenographer. Upon hearing this, Crandon gave <b>a</b> <b>shriek</b> and fainted. She was carried {{out of the room and}} the committee was asked to depart. Wood was never invited again.|$|E
