40|$|The dynamic {{processes}} {{leading to}} synconvergent exhumation of high-pressure low-temperature (HP-LT) rocks at oceanic accretionary margins, {{as well as}} the mechanisms maintaining nearly steady state regime in most <b>accretion</b> <b>prisms,</b> remain poorly understood. The present study aims at getting better constraints on the rheology, thermal conductivity, and chemical properties of the sediments in subduction zones. To reach that goal, oceanic subduction is modeled using a forward visco-elasto-plastic thermomechanical code (PARA(O) VOZ-FLAC algorithm), and synthetic pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t) paths, predicted from numerical experiments, are compared with natural P-T-t paths. The study is focused on the well constrained Schistes Lustrés complex (SL: western Alps) which is thought to represent the fossil accretionary wedge of the Liguro-Piemontese Ocean. For convergence rates comparable to Alpine subduction rates (∼ 3 cm yr− 1), the best-fitting results are obtained for high-viscosity, low-density wedge sediments and/or a strong lower continental crust. After a transition period of 3 - 5 Ma the modeled accretionary wedges reach a steady state which lasts over 20 Ma. Over that time span a significant proportion (∼ 35 %) of sediments entering the wedge undergoes P-T conditions typical of the SL complex (∼ 15 - 20 kbar; 350 - 450 °C) with similar P-T loops. Computed exhumation rates (< 6 mm yr− 1) are in agreement with observations (1 - 5 mm yr− 1). In presence of a serpentinite layer below the oceanic crust, exhumation of oceanic material takes place at rates approaching 3 mm yr− 1. In all experiments the total pressure in the accretionary wedge never deviated by more than ± 10 % from the lithostatic component...|$|R

High CaO and MgO contents of the previous termrocksnext term suggest a proximal previous termsourcenext term of the komatiitic basalt. The previous termrocksnext term {{in the study area}} record a pressure–temperature (P–T) path with three previous termtectono-metamorphicnext term stages. The first stage formed staurolite (500 – 700 °C) under medium P–T (MP–MT) metamorphic conditions shortly after the sedimentation. The second stage yielded the biotite–sillimanite–garnet assemblage under the peak conditions of 0. 6 ± 0. 1 GPa and 700 ± 70 °C during transpressional deformation. The third stage, low P–medium T (LP–MT; 0. 25 ± 0. 11 GPa, 540 ± 80 °C) metamorphism, was associated with regional south-southeast compression and its timing is constrained by a new U–Th–Pb monazite age of 2667 ± 20 Ma. Combining the regional deformation events, we suggest the burial metamorphism of sediments up to MP–MT conditions during the D 1 deformation at 2698 – 2689 Ma. They attained the peak metamorphic conditions during the regional transpressive D 2 –D 3 deformation (2689 – 2671 Ma), and retrograded to LP–MT condition during the south-southeast compression (regional D 4) at 2671 – 2667 Ma. A short time span between the sedimentation and MP–MT metamorphism accompanied by D 1 deformation suggest that the Quetico sedimentary previous termrocksnext term formed in an acretionary prism. The studied previous termrocksnext term in the Jean Lake area deposited close to the Wabigoon Subprovince, transported towards the south, and buried up to not, vert, similar 20 km by rapid underthrusting to amphibolite facies conditions. Subsequent dextral transpressive deformation (D 2 –D 3) during the oblique docking of the Quetico belt to the Wabigoon Subprovince to the north and Wawa greenstone belt from the south resulted in the displacement of the sedimentary previous termrocksnext term to the west from the original depositional site.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{mechanism of}} methane hydrates {{has been a}} central issue in previous hydrate research regarding the Nankai accretionary prism, southwest of Japan. Expulsion of formation fluids is significant during the <b>prism</b> <b>accretion</b> process, and the migration of these methane-bearing fluids exerts a strong control on the accumulation of hydrates. Two types of fluid pathways, inter-granular porosity and faults, need to be evaluated to understand hydrate accumulation. Fluid migration along faults can be partly modeled by examining faulting activity. Our study modeled the accretion process by using two granular methods that approximated the geologic body as an assemblage of particles: (1) analog experiments using granular materials, and (2) a numerical simulation based on the distinct element method. The analog experiments closely reproduced the prism geometry observed in seismic profiles across the Nankai accretionary prism. Digital image correlation analysis indicated that the frontal thrust is generally active but older structures are also frequently reactivated. The numerical simulations produced prism geometries {{similar to those of}} the analog experiments. The velocity distributions of the particles showed evidence of episodic faulting and reactivation, but the internal stress field exhibited little change in the deeper part of the prism during deformation. The frequent and substantial changes in fault activity displayed by the models indicate episodic fluid flow along fault surfaces. Active frontal thrusting suggests that formation fluids generally migrate from deep within the prism to the deformation front, but may move along reactivated older faults. Inter-granular permeability also fluctuates, as it is controlled by temporal and spatial variations in the internal stress field. However, fluid flow is likely to be relatively stable in the deeper segment of the prism...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} (10 – 100 years) {{evolution of}} tidal channels {{is generally considered}} {{to interact with the}} bio-geomorphic evolution of the surrounding intertidal platform. Here we studied how the geometric properties of tidal channels (channel drainage density and channel width) change as (1) vegetation establishes on an initially bare intertidal platform and (2) sediment accretion on the intertidal platform leads to a reduction in the tidal prism (i. e. water volume that during a tidal cycle floods to and drains back from the intertidal platform). Based on a time series of aerial photographs and digital elevation models, we derived the channel geometric properties at different time steps during the evolution from an initially low-elevated bare tidal flat towards a high-elevated vegetated marsh. We found that vegetation establishment causes a marked increase in channel drainage density. This is explained as the friction exerted by patches of pioneer vegetation concentrates the flow in between the vegetation patches and promotes there the erosion of channels. Once vegetation has established, continued sediment <b>accretion</b> and tidal <b>prism</b> reduction do not result in significant further changes in channel drainage density and in channel widths. We hypothesize that this is explained by a partitioning of the tidal flow between concentrated channel flow, as long as the vegetation is not submerged, and more homogeneous sheet flow as the vegetation is deeply submerged. Hence, a reduction of the tidal prism due to sediment accretion on the intertidal platform, reduces especially the volume of sheet flow (which does not affect channel geometry), while the concentrated channel flow (i. e. the landscape forming volume of water) is not much affected by the tidal prism reduction...|$|R
40|$|Corbo-Camargo et al. 268 Two magnetotelluric (MT) {{profiles}} {{perpendicular to}} the trench provide information on the subduction of the Rivera plate under the Jalisco block (JB). The geometry of the subducting slab is inferred by the anomalous conductor {{on the top of}} the profile in the central part of the JB. High conductivity zones (< 50 ohm-m) at depths shallower than 10 km are associated to dewatering of the oceanic crust below the <b>accretion</b> <b>prism</b> in the SW of the profile. Away from the coast, observed upper crustal conductors (< 10 km) are interpreted as partial melt related to the Central Jalisco volcanic lineament. The source of the crustal conductor in the central part of the MT profile, ~ 25 – 75 km inland and depths between 40 and 60 km, is interpreted as a region of interconnected fluids associated with the metamorphic dehydration of the oceanic plate. Contrasting resistivity in the mantle wedge at depths below 40 km suggests that hot mantle material may be migrating upwards, mixing with dehydration reaction products. Near Bahía de Banderas subduction appears steeper closer to the trench than toward the SW suggesting a twisted oceanic subducting slab beneath the continental crustal block. Our results support the mantle upwelling model as an explanation for the reported 1. 5 km uplift of the central part of the JB and subsidence of the fore arc region, as well as a change in mantle properties at the NW edge of the JB, which is backed by seismic data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. – Guadeloupe island (West French Indies) {{is one of}} {{the twenty}} islands that compose the Lesser Antilles arc, which results from the {{subduction}} of the Atlantic ocean plate beneath the Caribbean one. The island lies in a complex volcano-tectonic system and the need to understand its geological context has led to numerous on- and offshore geo-physical investigations. This work presents a compilation and the processing of available, on-land, airborne and marine, gravity and magnetic data acquired during the last 40 years on Guadeloupe islands and at the scale of the Lesser Antilles arc. The overall dataset provides new Bouguer and reduced to the pole magnetic anomaly maps at the highest achievable resolution. Regionally, the main central negative gravity trend of the arc allows defining two subsident areas. The first one is parallel to the arc direction (~N 160 oE) to the north, whereas the second unexpected southern one is oriented par-allel to oceanic ridges (N 130 oE).

40|$|International audienceThere {{was much}} debate {{recently}} on {{the mechanisms of}} continental convergence and related pressure­temperature (P­T) conditions, both in modeling and petrologic community. Depending on the mechanisms of convergence (subduction, collision, folding or RT instability) one can argue {{about the possibility of}} large-scale deviations of pressure and temperature in the <b>accretion</b> <b>prism</b> and below it, from "reference" (i. e. lithostatic) conditions commonly used for petrologic reconstructions of evolution of exhumed metamorphic rocks. These deviations can be caused, for example, by tectonic overpressure that, as suggested in some studies, may be responsible for formation of UHP (Ultra High Pressure) rocks. However, overpressure in exhumation zones can be built only in specific collision scenarios associated with plate coupling (pure shear, folding). In this study, we analyze conditions that define various mechanisms of convergence, and consequently, of exhumation. These mechanisms can be represented as a superposition of (1) simple shear (subduction), (2) pure shear (collision), (3) folding and (4) Rayleigh­Taylor instability. We study these scenarios using a thermo-mechanical model that accounts for brittle­elastic­ductile rheology, surface processes, and metamorphic changes. It appears that stable, "oceanic-type" subduction may occur in the case of cold lithospheres (TMohob 550 °C) and relatively high convergence rates (N 3 ­ 5 cm/yr). Depending on the lower-crustal rheology (strong or weak), either the whole (upper and lower) crust or only the lower crust can be involved in subduction. In case of weak metamorphic rheologies, phase changes improve chances for stable subduction. Pure shear becomes a dominant mechanism when TMohoN 550 °C or convergence rates are lower than 3 cm/yr. Large-scale folding is favored in case of TMoho= 500 ­ 650 °C and is more effective in the case of mechanical coupling between crust and mantle (e. g., strong lower crust). Gravitational (Rayleigh­Taylor) instabilities overcome other mechanisms for very high values of TMoho (N 800 °C) and may lead to development of subvertical "cold spots. " However, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that in most cases continental collision is initiated at oceanic subduction rate, which is rarely slower than 5 cm/yr. This rate is sufficient to drive continental subduction during the first several Myr of collision. In this case, the subduction channel is characterized by nearly lithostatic pressure conditions. Large-scale zones of tectonic overpressure may be built outside the channel but do not affect the exhumed rocks. Overpressure may be built inside the channel in the short moment of its closure. We suggest that most continental orogenic belts could have started their formation from continental subduction. This evokes small tectonic overpressures and thus deep origin of the UHP rocks that may be brought to the surface via the suggested multi-level mechanism of exhumation...|$|E
