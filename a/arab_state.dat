5|$|At {{a meeting}} on 29 November, the United Nations General Assembly decided to end the British Mandate on 1August1948. Palestine would be {{partitioned}} into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. The Jewish state would have fifty-six per cent of the land {{with a population of}} 490,000Jews and 325,000Arabs, while the <b>Arab</b> <b>state</b> would have 807,000Arabs, but only 10,000Jews.

5|$|Although he {{verbally}} {{dismissed the}} French order expelling {{him and his}} family from Syria, Faisal departed Damascus on 27 July with only one of his cabinet members, al-Husri. He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran region where he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders. However, a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British-held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed. Faisal's departure from Syria marked an end to his goal of establishing and leading an <b>Arab</b> <b>state</b> in Syria.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Darwaza {{served as}} Postal Directorate-General of Beirut and {{retained}} this post until 1918. In 1916, while serving with the Ottoman {{army in the}} Sinai Peninsula, he joined the underground al-Fatat organization through Ahmad Qadri, a high-ranking member from Damascus. The aim of al-Fatat was to liberate and unite the Arab lands under Ottoman rule. In {{the wake of the}} Arab Revolt of 1916, Darwaza left the Ottoman civil service to serve in King Faisal's provisional government in Damascus. Ideologically, Darwaza became an Arab nationalist endorsing the concept of a Greater Syrian <b>Arab</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

ALA commander Fawzi al-Qawuqji claimed Jewish forces ("Haganah") had attempted to reach the crossroads at Lajjun in an outflanking operation, but the attack failed. The New York Times reported that twelve Arabs were killed and fifteen wounded during that Haganah offensive.

5|$|The British were {{formally}} {{awarded the}} mandate {{to govern the}} region in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929, and 1936. In 1947, following World War II and The Holocaust, the British Government announced its desire to terminate the Mandate, and the United Nations General Assembly adopted in November 1947 a Resolution 181(II) recommending partition into an <b>Arab</b> <b>state,</b> a Jewish state and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal, but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a civil war began immediately after the Resolution's adoption. The State of Israel was declared in May 1948.|$|E

5|$|The {{influence}} of Nasser's Arab nationalism over the RCC was immediately apparent. The administration was instantly {{recognized by the}} neighbouring Arab nationalist regimes in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Sudan, with Egypt sending experts to aid the inexperienced RCC. Gaddafi propounded Pan-Arab ideas, proclaiming {{the need for a}} single <b>Arab</b> <b>state</b> stretching across North Africa and the Middle East. In December 1969, Libya signed the Tripoli Charter alongside Egypt and Sudan. This established the Arab Revolutionary Front, a pan-national union designed as a first step towards the eventual political unification of the three nations. In 1970 Syria declared its intention to join.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{fears of}} war with Germany were {{realised}} in 1914 with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and Samoa respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement. This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca, who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent <b>Arab</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the British {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans, and in 192223 Tubas {{was incorporated into}} the British Mandate of Palestine. In 1947, the United Nations drew up a partition plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states; Tubas and the surrounding villages and hamlets were {{to be included in}} the <b>Arab</b> <b>state.</b> During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Fawzi al-Qawuqji led 750 Arab Liberation Army (ALA) soldiers to Tubas from Transjordan and set up base there; Tubas would serve as the ALA's headquarters in central Palestine throughout the war. Transjordan (became Jordan in April 1949) annexed the city along with the entire West Bank, after gaining control of it during the war. In 1955 the first girls' school was opened. Tubas was under their control until 1967, when Israel occupied the West Bank during the Six-Day War.|$|E

Moreover, the <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> of the Persian Gulf and Iran together stand to lose $30 billion as the opportunity cost of not exporting oil to Israel {{in the second half of}} the decade.|$|R
5000|$|Today, <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> are {{characterized}} by their autocratic rulers and lack of democratic control. The 2016 Democracy Index classifies Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine as [...] "hybrid regimes", Tunisia as a [...] "flawed democracy" [...] and all other <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> as [...] "authoritarian regimes". Similarly, the 2011 Freedom House report classifies Comoros and Mauritania as [...] "electoral democracies", Lebanon, Kuwait and Morocco as [...] "partly free", and all other <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> as [...] "not free".|$|R

5|$|The Battles of Latrun were {{a series}} of {{military}} engagements between the Israel Defense Forces and the Jordanian Arab Legion {{on the outskirts of}} Latrun between 25 May and 18 July 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Latrun takes its name from the monastery close to the junction of two major highways: Jerusalem to Jaffa/Tel Aviv and Gaza to Ramallah. During the British Mandate it became a Palestine Police base with a Tegart fort. The United Nations Resolution 181 placed this area within the proposed <b>Arab</b> <b>state.</b> In May 1948, it was {{under the control of the}} Arab Legion. It commanded the only road linking the Yishuv-controlled area of Jerusalem to Israel, giving Latrun strategic importance in the battle for Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India. The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking {{to be admitted to}} Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed {{to the creation of a}} Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an <b>Arab</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{leading the}} Allied Forces during World War I, the British won {{control of the}} city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was {{included}} in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction. In the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned {{to be part of}} an <b>Arab</b> <b>state</b> in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees fleeing nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.|$|E

5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza {{spent the rest}} of his life in the modern state of Syria where he left {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an <b>Arab</b> <b>state.</b> Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E
5|$|He later {{enlisted in}} the Ottoman army when World War I broke out, where he {{received}} military training and was attached as a chaplain to a base near Damascus. Returning to Jableh before the war's end, al-Qassam used funds from his planned expedition to Libya to organize a local defense force to fight the French occupation. His principal role in the local resistance was financing the acquisition of weapons for Jableh's militia. By 1919, French forces moved into the coastal area of northern Syria while Faisal I established the Kingdom of Syria in Damascus as an independent <b>Arab</b> <b>state.</b> During this period, al-Qassam's Jableh militia fought against local French-backed Alawite militiamen who occupied areas around the city. The Alawites were eventually repelled, but French forces moved in soon after to consolidate their control. Consequently, al-Qassam {{and many of his}} disciples left Jableh for Mount Sahyun where he established a base near the village of Zanqufeh to launch guerrilla raids against the French Army.|$|E
5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the <b>Arab</b> <b>State</b> according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E
50|$|The 1973 Yom Kippur War was {{the fourth}} major {{conflict}} between Israel and the neighboring <b>Arab</b> <b>States.</b> Like many other <b>Arab</b> <b>States,</b> Algeria contributed to the fighting in the Yom Kippur War.

50|$|Iran's {{relations}} with the <b>Arab</b> <b>states</b> have been complex, {{partly due to the}} Islamic Revolution of decades ago, as well as more recent efforts by the United States to establish a united front against Iran over the nuclear issue and War on Terror.

Outside the Persian Gulf, Ahmadinejad has sought to reestablish {{relations with}} other major <b>Arab</b> <b>states,</b> most notably Egypt. As of 2007, Iran did not have an open embassy there.|$|R
