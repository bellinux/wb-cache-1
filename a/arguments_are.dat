The rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail.|$|E
5|$|No queen consort of Menkauhor {{has been}} {{identified}} for certain. The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has proposed that Khuit I was a queen of Menkauhor. Based on the dating of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. By the process of elimination, he attributes known queens to each king of the period, which leaves only Menkauhor {{as a candidate for}} her king. These <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> criticized by the Egyptologist Michel Baud, who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen.|$|E

5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{difficulty}} with Bede's chronology {{on the date}} of Æthelburg's marriage, as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only recently had become a Christian, which conflicts with Bede's chronology. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that Paulinus and Æthelburg must therefore have gone to Northumbria earlier than 624, and that Paulinus went north, not as a bishop, but as a priest, returning later to be consecrated. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting agrees with Kirby's reasoning. Another historian, Peter Hunter Blair, argues that Æthelburg and Edwin were married before 625, but {{that she did not}} go to Northumbria until 625. If Kirby's <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> accepted, then the date of Paulinus' consecration needs to be changed by a year, to 21 July 626.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} a short {{presentation}} {{of some of the}} main ideas of the author's "Practical Theory of Argument". The function of <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> analysed in an epistemological way, it is: rationally convincing, i. e. leading to new knowledge. Then, the way of functioning of <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> analysed, i. e. presenting material which guide a process of cognizing the thesis. On this basis the structure of arguments which fulfil the function of <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> determined, first for deductive arguments. Finally an outlook on non-deductive <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
5|$|Swami Gnanapragasar {{believes}} that the first Ariyacakravarti also called Cinkaiariyan (Ariyan from Cinkainakar) was Kalinga Magha himself. Three main <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> adduced to support the claim that these kings were of Eastern Ganga descent. The first is the similar device on their coins; the bull couchant and the crescent surmounting it were struck on coins issued by the Eastern Gangas and Ariyacakravartis. The second is the traditions of their origins are almost identical. The last is the assumption of titles Kangkainaadan (From the country of Ganges) and Kangkaiariyan (Ariyan from the Ganga dynasty). According to S. Pathmanathan's history of the Jaffna kingdom, these only establish similarity, but not any conclusive direct connections. Pathmanathan {{believes that}} we cannot categorically link the Aryacakravarti dynasty with Eastern Gangas and can explain most of the similarities based on influence, even Western Ganga Dynasty descendants who had moved into Tamil lands after their defeat by the Chola Empire around the year 1000 and interpret them simply as reflecting a claim of origin from the Hindu holy city of Varanasi {{on the banks of}} the holiest river Ganges.|$|E
5|$|Gordon's <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> {{valid for}} the second phase (1879–84) when every stone laid {{required}} a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> neither a) advice nor b) {{moral or}} {{economical}} judgement, but {{the connection between}} the two. An argument always uses the connective because. An <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> not an explanation. It does not connect two events, cause and effect, which already took place, but a possible individual action and its beneficial outcome. An <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> not a proof. A proof is a logical and cognitive concept; an <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> a praxeologic concept. A proof changes our knowledge; an argument compels us to act.|$|R
50|$|This <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> valid, {{but this}} has no bearing on whether any of the {{statements}} in the <b>argument</b> <b>are</b> true; for modus ponens to <b>be</b> a sound <b>argument,</b> the premises must be true for any true instances of the conclusion. An <b>argument</b> can <b>be</b> valid but nonetheless unsound if one or more premises are false; if an <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> valid and all the premises are true, then the <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> sound. For example, John might be {{going to work on}} Wednesday. In this case, the reasoning for John's going to work (because it is Wednesday) <b>is</b> unsound. The <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> not only sound on Tuesdays (when John goes to work), but valid on every day of the week. A propositional argument using modus ponens is said to be deductive.|$|R
5000|$|Labellings are a more {{expressive}} {{way than}} extensions {{to express the}} acceptance of the arguments.

Nonetheless, once the <b>argument</b> <b>was</b> put forward, it took on a life of its own, and people continue to advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this <b>argument</b> <b>was</b> vitiated from the start.|$|R
