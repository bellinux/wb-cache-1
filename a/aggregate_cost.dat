25|$|H.R. 4587 {{contains}} no intergovernmental mandates {{as defined in}} the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. H.R. 4587 would impose private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA by prohibiting certain transactions with entities associated with human rights violations in Venezuela. In addition, individuals {{found to be associated}} with the human rights violations could have their visas revoked. The cost of the mandates would be any forgone income directly related to the prohibited transactions and to the loss of visas. Based on data from the U.S. International Trade Commission, the total value of transactions that could be affected by the legislation is low. Further, CBO expects that the number of individuals in the United States that could have their visa revoked under the bill is small. Therefore, CBO estimates that the <b>aggregate</b> <b>cost</b> of the mandates would fall below the annual threshold for private-sector mandates established in UMRA ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation).|$|E

30|$|The {{significant}} differences between AW and other aggregation methods is that the sliding window cannot be applied, as the adaptive weight has to be recomputed at every pixel. Therefore, cost aggregation has to be performed in an exhaustive manner and the computational requirements are directly {{depending on the size}} of matching window. This is particularly bad, as we found the AW approach usually require larger window to get good quality result. Thus, we had to reduce the computation's complexity and make it again suitable for real-time implementations. Figure 12 shows block diagrams of our aggregation strategy. Instead of directly <b>aggregates</b> <b>cost</b> of whole support size n × n, we use a two pass approach that first pass <b>aggregates</b> <b>cost</b> along vertical direction, followed by a pass <b>aggregating</b> <b>cost</b> along horizontal direction. This reduces the arithmetic complexity form O(n 2) to O(2 n). It is also worth observing that the weight term obtained only using the target image in our weight generation strategy and the correlated blocks shares the same weights under the different disparity hypotheses. Consequently, we omit the weights accumulation operation as well as the normalization operation module. The weight of every pixel is a combination of the similarity and proximity measurements. Thus those two kinds of weights component have to be calculated in each aggregation pass.|$|R

This paper further identifies an optimization framework which finds an optimal path for routing in WMN. We formulate optimal path routing problem as search-based problem. We have investigated evolutionary optimization techniques to solve the routing problem in WMN. These techniques can find global optimum solution to a given problem. We have used an evolutionary optimization technique named as genetic algorithm for routing in WMN. It considers the link bandwidth and packet loss ratio into account; optimal path is selected among all the available paths from source to destination on the basis of <b>aggregated</b> <b>cost</b> of all the links of the path. The <b>aggregated</b> <b>cost</b> of the path is calculated by our newly designed cost metric that is used as fitness function in genetic algorithm to evaluate the optimal path.|$|R

30|$|Overall, Chinese trade cost shows a {{downward}} trend with 108.4 % in 2000 declining to 0.9089 in 2013, which falls by 16.2 %.

During this period, the trade cost reached 0.973, which ranks fourth. This is due to the declining economic since the global financial crisis, which contributes to the deterioration of external situation. For example, the year of 2009 has the highest number of Chinese trade friction cases and highest amount.

Using the US 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances we employ a logistic regression approach to understand the characteristics of households who engage financial advisors for investment or comprehensive financial advice. We find that age, education, employment category, income and net worth are highly significant variables related to the propensity to engage a financial advisor. The results also indicate significantly reduced active engagement between advisors and low net worth investors than claimed by the low net worth investors in the survey. We construct a model to derive the expected fee profile of financial advisors {{as a function of}} wealth and compare the fee structure against a financial advisor client portfolio. We find that a combination of lower <b>aggregate</b> <b>costs</b> per investor and higher expected fee income motivates advisors to target higher net worth investors.
