40|$|While {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{research}} on air entrainment at hydraulic jumps within closed conduits, very little of the research has specifically addressed size and temperature scale effects. Influences from jump location and changing length characteristics on air entrainment have also received little attention from past research. To determine the significance of size-scale effects of air entrained by hydraulic jumps in closed conduits, air flow measurements were taken in four different-sized circular pipe models with similar Froude numbers. Each of the pipe models sloped downward and created identical flow conditions that differed only in size. Additionally, specific measurements were taken in one of the pipe models with various water temperatures to identify any effects from changing fluid properties. To determine the significance of the effects of changed length characteristics on <b>air</b> <b>demand,</b> air flow measurements were taken with hydraulic jumps at multiple locations within a circular pipe with two different air release configurations at the end of the pipe. Results showed that <b>air</b> <b>demand</b> was not affected by the size of the model. All together, the data from four different pipe models show that size-scale effects of air entrained into hydraulic jumps within closed conduits are negligible. However, it was determined that air entrainment was significantly affected by the water temperature. Water at higher temperatures entrained much less air than water at lower temperatures. Hydraulic jump location results showed that for both configurations the percentage of air entrainment significantly increased as the hydraulic jump occurred near the point of air release downstream. As the jump occurred nearer to the end of the pipe, its length characteristics were shortened and <b>air</b> <b>demand</b> increased. However, jump location was only a significant factor until the jump occurred some distance upstream where the length characteristics were not affected. Upstream of this location the <b>air</b> <b>demand</b> was dependent only on the Froude number immediately upstream of the jump...|$|E
40|$|Most dams have a {{low-level}} outlet {{that consists of}} a closed conduit through the dam with a slide gate or valve to regulate flow. These outlets are used mainly for irrigational purposes but also for flushing the reservoir and controlling the reservoir elevation. When discharging through the low-level outlet works, negative pressures can develop on the downstream side of the gate creating a potential for cavitation damage and vibration. To minimize these effects, air vents (vented to the atmosphere) are installed on the downstream side of the gate to limit downstream pressure to something above vapor pressure (i. e., near atmospheric pressure). Previous air venting studies have been mostly limited to large dam outlet geometries, which typically feature a vertical gate in a flat-bottomed discharge tunnel. The large-dam <b>air</b> <b>demand</b> analysis {{has been based on}} the Froude number of the supercritical flow at the vena contract (located between the gate and the hydraulic jump) and the water flow rate. Small to medium-sized embankment dams typically utilize a slide gate installed on the sloped upstream face for flow control, followed by a vertical elbow connected to a sloping pipe. With this outlet geometry, there is no 1 -D vena contracta flow, no classical hydraulic jump, and no representative Froude number. Additionally, no head-discharge characteristic data have been found for inclined slide gates (vented or non-vented) for small to medium-sized dams. Consequently, unless a flow measurement structure is installed in the discharge channel downstream of the dam, determining the water discharge rate based on gate opening and head on the gate, and consequently the <b>air</b> <b>demand</b> is problematic. This study focuses on quantifying <b>air</b> <b>demand</b> and air vent sizing for the small to medium-sized embankment dam low-level outlet geometries by providing: 1. Cd values as a function of gate openings and air demand; to better estimate flow rates from outlet works of similar geometries. 2. Flow conditions for varying operating conditions. 3.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of high-speed passenger rail service is often argued as a potentially effective, lower-carbon substitute for intercity air travel. Previous studies on high-speed rail on air travel in Europe and Asia have primarily examined {{the impact of}} travel time and price on market share for a specific city pair (or a handful of city pairs). There has been little focus {{on the extent to}} which high-speed rail (HSR) has reduced total short-haul <b>air</b> travel <b>demand</b> (versus market share), or on the potential impacts of high-speed rail on system-wide <b>air</b> travel <b>demand.</b> This paper presents an empirical, econometric analysis of <b>air</b> travel <b>demand</b> in Europe, utilizing an expanded data set to explore: 1) the impact of rail travel times, population density, and market characteristics on air tra c; and 2) the impact of high-speed rail and low-cost-carriers on system-wide air traffic. Although improvements in rail travel times have resulted in reductions in short-haul air travel, variations in city and airport characteristics significantly influence the substitution between air and rail. This paper also finds that HSR substitution has resulted in a modest reduction in system-wide <b>air</b> travel <b>demand,</b> whereas the {{expansion of}} low-cost carriers has led to a significant increase in total European air traffic.

40|$|Abstract: Since {{the coal}} {{is one of}} major source of energy it is {{predicted}} {{that will continue to}} play an important role in the world energy demands. Although as a fossil resource, i. e. a non-renewable resource, that should take into account atmosphere emissions. Recently, the gasification has proven to be very promising to enable the conversion of carbon-based fuels for applications in synthesis and co-generation. In this sense, the joint processing of coal and renewable carbon-based fuel (biomass) allows to use coal in a cleaner way. This work evaluates the gasification potential of coal and biomass available in Brazil. For that a thermodynamic approach is used. High ash coal and biomasses of bigger energetic potential for co-generation are evaluated. Predictions evaluate the process performance through the estimation of efficiency by changing operational conditions, concerning the gasifying agent (air and steam). The preliminary results show the range of 70 to 80 % efficiency by using only air as gasifying agent with up to 65 % of stoichiometric <b>air</b> <b>demand.</b> On the other hand, using air and steam those values can reach 85 % to close to 100 % with smaller than 40 % of stoichiometric <b>air</b> <b>demand...</b>|$|E

The compressed air is used to boost and start the engine. It is generated during deceleration phases by running the engine as a piston compressor.

The <b>air</b> <b>demand</b> of the pneumatic start shows a piecewise continuous dependence on the tank pressure. Finally, a tank sizing method is proposed which uses a quasi-static simulation.

40|$|Air vent {{systems are}} {{designed}} to protect hydropower penstocks and reservoir outlets under various operating conditions. During an emergency closure of an upstream gate the hydraulic jump that forms downstream of the gate is not stationary and may advance downstream potentially increasing the total <b>air</b> <b>demand.</b> A lab-scale physical model of a general outlet works piping configuration was constructed at Reclamation’s Hydraulics Laboratory in Denver, CO to observe hydraulic jump behavior during emergency gate closures. Parameters including gate discharge, gate closure rate, air vent size, and downstream pipe pressure were tested at two different pipe slopes. Results indicate that the hydraulic jump travel speed is dependent on air vent size as well as gate closure rate, both of which affect the internal pressure in the pipe near the vent connection. For a shallow-sloped pipe, the jump speed remains steady throughout the entire pipe length if the air supply is sufficient. However, if air flow is significantly reduced due to an undersized air vent, unsteady travel speeds and pressure surges were observed. This {{was not the case}} for a steep-sloped pipe which produced steady jump speeds for all vent sizes. Once completed, these results are expected to be applicable for prediction of hydraulic jump travel speed and its effects on <b>air</b> <b>demand</b> for vent sizing considerations based on hydraulic operating conditions...|$|E
