5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> Newt's imagination, Rae was {{depicted as a}} goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes her opinion known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E
5|$|The poems {{were written}} during {{a short period}} while the poet lived in Germany. Although they {{individually}} deal {{with a variety of}} themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.|$|E

25|$|An {{element of}} Kierkegaard's {{critique}} of modernity in his socio-political work, Two Ages, is {{the mention of}} money — which he calls an abstraction. An abstraction is something that only has a reality in an ersatz reality. It is not tangible, and only has meaning within an artificial context, which ultimately serves devious and deceptive purposes. It is <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> thought that has no concrete reality, neither now nor in the future.|$|E
25|$|During the series, {{the main}} storyline follows Alex Drake in her {{struggle}} {{to return to}} the present day. In order to do this, she believes that preventing the death of her parents, Tim (Andrew Clover) and Caroline Price (Amelia Bullmore), will enable her to return. While watching the death of her parents in the finale of the first series, she discovers that the person she remembers taking her hand as a child was Gene Hunt and not Evan White (Stephen Campbell Moore) as she previously thought.

Zane directs Alan to follow a signal through a cell phone to focus and guide himself out of [...] "the Dark Place", the realm where the Dark Presence came from and where the written word can become reality. As Alan {{continues}} to avoid and defeat various Taken, he encounters several television screens that show a more maniacal version of Alan, ranting about upcoming events, forewarning Alan of what is to come. He also encounters an ethereal version of Barry, <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> his subconsciousness, who also helps to guide Alan safely across the abstract landscape.|$|E

500|$|Hendrick Vroom explains, [...] "the term Maya [...] {{has been}} {{translated}} as 'illusion,' {{but then it}} does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' {{does not mean that}} the world is not real and simply <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> the human imagination. Maya means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned." [...] According to Wendy Doniger, [...] "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge." ...|$|E
500|$|The Season Eight DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Robert complimenting Jim and Pam's marriage and admitting his desire to share in their love, which the two take as a metaphorical compliment, Jim receiving a text from Robert asking him if Pam and he are free at 10 the following Friday which causes the two to think that California literally {{wants to be a}} part of their relationship, Pam trying to reassure Jim that Robert's odd behavior is <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> their imagination, and Robert calling off the get-together due to this resignation as CEO of Sabre.

The song is {{in the style of}} Cat Stevens, and described by Zaleski as [...] "an in-depth vignette about a bus-ride-length romance that's really <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> the protagonist's imagination." [...] Another review detailed that the piece is a conversation between two bus passengers involving topics such as relationships, [...] deodorant, and wearing the skin of another person; the protagonist insists that the latter is [...] "not in a creepy way."

5000|$|In 1911 Shaw parodied Walkley as the pompous theatre critic Mr Trotter in Fanny's First Play.

5000|$|Marx himself {{regarded}} {{the idea that}} society was somehow balanced out by market trade as <b>a</b> typical <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> [...] "bourgeois ideology" [...] {{and he was a}} strong critic of Jean-Baptiste Say. In the real world, there was only a more or less haphazard adjustment of supply and demand through incessant price fluctuations.

500|$|Love. Angel. Music. Baby. {{introduced}} the Harajuku Girls, an entourage of four Japanese women whom Stefani {{referred to as}} <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> her imagination. The Harajuku Girls are discussed {{in several of the}} songs, including one named after and entirely dedicated to them. They appear in most of the music videos produced for the album and those for Stefani's second album The Sweet Escape (2006). Love. Angel. Music. Baby. includes various styles of music. Many songs are influenced by electro beats designed for club play. Producers Austin and Kanal incorporated R into the song [...] "Luxurious" [...] which contains a sample of The Isley Brothers' 1983 single [...] "Between the Sheets". Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporate new jack swing, a fusion genre of R that the pair had developed and popularized during the mid-1980s.|$|E
500|$|... "Night of Desirable Objects" [...] was {{the first}} episode to feature guest actor Kevin Corrigan as the mysterious Sam Weiss. To help Corrigan, Torv {{compared}} Sam Weiss to the Oracle in The Matrix, which the actor had not yet seen. Corrigan noted, [...] "It opened my mind up... So now Sam's just this regular guy in a bowling alley but he's {{so much more than}} that." [...] Weiss' appearance generated some rumors that he was <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> Olivia's imagination, causing actress Anna Torv to state in a later interview that she has always believed Weiss to be [...] "100 percent real" [...] and her character's [...] "guide". The episode marked the last appearance by guest actress Meghan Markle, who plays Agent Amy Jessup. Frequent Fringe collaborator Akiva Goldsman later hinted in January 2010 that audiences have [...] "not seen the last of Agent Jessup". Other guest stars included John Savage and Charles Martin Smith, as well as Stefan Arngrim, who made his second appearance on the series.|$|E
500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be <b>a</b> <b>figment</b> <b>of</b> Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox." ...|$|E
