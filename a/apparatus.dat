5|$|The Golgi <b>apparatus</b> (also {{known as}} the Golgi body and the Golgi complex) is {{composed}} of separate sacs called cisternae. Its shape {{is similar to a}} stack of pancakes. The number of these stacks varies with the specific function of the cell. The Golgi <b>apparatus</b> is used by the cell for further protein modification. The section of the Golgi <b>apparatus</b> that receives the vesicles from the ER is {{known as the}} cis face, and is usually near the ER. The opposite end of the Golgi <b>apparatus</b> is called the trans face, this is where the modified compounds leave. The trans face is usually facing the plasma membrane, which is where most of the substances the Golgi <b>apparatus</b> modifies are sent.|$|E
5|$|There are two <b>apparatus</b> in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the {{suspensory}} <b>apparatus</b> and the stay <b>apparatus.</b> The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory <b>apparatus.</b> This <b>apparatus</b> carries much {{of the weight of}} the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the <b>apparatus</b> stores and releases energy {{in the manner of a}} spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory <b>apparatus</b> consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E

5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the <b>apparatus.</b> With the <b>apparatus</b> oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the <b>apparatus</b> oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the <b>apparatus</b> oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the Upper Cambrian and Tremadocian organophosphatic microfossils which were {{hitherto}} treated as conodonts and assigned mainly to the genera Coelocerodontus and Viirodus. Individual elements of the fossils, similarly to the elements of conodonts, belonged originally to the multi-element <b>apparatuses.</b> Present studies, based mainly on the collections from Sweden, Poland (core sections), Estonia and Kazakhstan, show that despite the similarities of their individual elements to conodonts, they significantly differ from them in the inner structure, {{as well as in the}} construction of the <b>apparatuses</b> composed of them. Elements of their <b>apparatuses</b> are matched in shape to each other and certainly functioned in conjunction, while those belonging to the euconodont <b>apparatuses</b> are usually differentiated in shape and usually functioned in separation. All fossils of this group are provisionally named coelocerodonts in this paper.

40|$|Starting {{from recent}} {{formulas}} of EU bureaucracy for subordinating scientific and educational <b>apparatuses</b> {{to the needs}} of the capital and to the requests of its political representatives, the article analyses the interconnection between the historical transformation of the ideological state <b>apparatuses</b> (universities, higher education institutions, research institutes etc.) and the epistemological discontinuity provoked by the triumph of technosciences. The hypothesis to be tested is the following: While the crisis of West European-North American capitalism requires an ever tighter submission of ideological state <b>apparatuses,</b> and especially of scientific and academic <b>apparatuses</b> {{to the needs of}} the capital, theoretical practices in the humanities and social sciences have come to the point where they entered into an open conflict with the domination of the capital and have, as a consequence, started to subvert their own institutional supports in the ideological <b>apparatuses</b> of the capitalist state. For this purpose, the article reconsiders social sciences as a compromise formation and, eventually, reassesses the historical materialism as a non-Cartesian modern science...|$|R

In a {{nasotracheal}} procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal <b>apparatus</b> into the trachea.

5|$|There {{are three}} well known types of vesicles. They are clathrin-coated, COPI-coated, and COPII-coated vesicles. Each {{performs}} different {{functions in the}} cell.
