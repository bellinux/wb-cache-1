During this period, Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith <b>and</b> <b>chanting</b> Nam Myoho Renge Kyo to help her deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal with Cream Records. The deal was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina got into a fight during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{a study of the}} metrics of sung <b>and</b> <b>chanted</b> verse, based on a data corpus of 670 English folksong lines, as well as chanted {{renditions}} of the corpus by ten native speaker consultants. Our theoretical focus is on the role of phonological phrasing in metrics. We find that in sung <b>and</b> <b>chanted</b> verse, an especially tight correspondence to the metrical pattern is imposed on linguistic material that is either bounded within a tight phrasal domain or located at the right edge of a high-level domain. These patterns have been observed earlier for spoken verse. But for the phenomenon of metrical inversion, the behavior of sung <b>and</b> <b>chanted</b> verse is quite different from spoken verse. We develop an explanation of the difference, {{based on the idea that}} inversion in sung <b>and</b> <b>chanted</b> verse occurs only in those cases where it is the best available metrical option. A further finding is that sung <b>and</b> <b>chanted</b> verse tends to match the number of beats alloted to a syllable to that syllable's natural linguistic duration. We suggest that the relevant measure of duration is phonetic, not phonological; and that the tendency to phonetic duration matching in sung <b>and</b> <b>chanted</b> verse has a categorial, phonologized analogue in the phenomenon of spoken-verse Resolution. 1 An anonymous reviewer made a number of very thoughtful suggestions for improving this article.
