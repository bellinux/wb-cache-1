40|$|Abstract. A new {{volatile}} liquid copper precursor, (<b>a-methylstyrene)</b> Cu(I) (hfac), {{has been}} synthesized. A green liquid solution of (<b>a-methylstyrene)</b> Cu(I) (hfac), stabilized with Cu(hfac) z and <b>a-methylstyrene,</b> {{can be used}} for CVD copper thin film deposition. In contrast, pure yellow (<b>a-methylstyrene)</b> Cu(I) (hfac) failed in CVD processing because of poor stability in the delivery system. The structure of solid crystalline [(a-methylstyrene) C~(I) (hfac) ]~[Cu(hfac) ], collected from the concentrated green liquid precursor solution, was obtained by x-ray crystallography. In copper thin film deposition using the green liquid precursor, a two-step water introduction process has been proposed for the purposes of obtaining good adhesion on metal nitride coat& substrates and low bulk resistivity. The film purity was analyzed by SIMS. The effects of various process conditions have been studied, from which the film deposition activation energy was calculated as 12. 82 Kcallmol for deposition temperatures lower than 180 °C. The resistivity of the copper thin films was measured as 1. 92 pn-cm when deposited at 190 - 200 °C. Good film conformality and gap filling. has also been demonstrated using this new copper precursor. 1...|$|E
40|$|Styrene–maleic {{anhydride}} copolymers {{have been}} successfully synthesized using catalytic chain transfer polymerization employing the low spin [bis(difluoroboryl) dimethylglyoximato]cobalt(II) (COBF) complex. By partially replacing styrene with <b>a-methylstyrene</b> (while maintaining the amount of maleic anhydride at 50 mol %) over a range of ratios, it was shown {{that the rate of}} reaction and molar mass decreases with increasing <b>a-methylstyrene</b> content. The polymers were characterized using MALDI–ToF–MS and 1 H– 13 C gHMQC NMR to determine the end groups, which in the presence of <b>a-methylstyrene</b> was an <b>a-methylstyrene</b> unit with a vinylic functionality. For styrene–maleic anhydride copolymers, the end group was determined to be predominantly maleic anhydride with a vinylic functionality. Considering the fact that in a styrene–maleic anhydride copolymerization the propagating radicals are predominantly of a styrenic nature, this was a very surprising result, suggesting that the maleic anhydride radicals undergo a chain transfer reaction, which is orders of magnitude faster than that of styrenic radicals. This conclusion was supported by high-level ab initio quantum chemical calculations, which showed that hydrogen abstraction from the maleic anhydride radical is 40 kJ/mol more exothermic than that from a styrene radical. The chain transfer constant of COBF was determined for the different ratios of styrene and <b>a-methylstyrene.</b> It was found to increase 2 orders of magnitude from a purely styrene–maleic anhydride to a purely a-methylstyrene–maleic anhydride copolymer. Diels–Alder and thiol–ene reactions were performed on the vinylic end groups as postpolymerization modification reactions, as well as graft copolymerization reactions of the macromonomers with styrene and butyl acrylat...|$|E

40|$|The {{copolymerization}} of styrene with <b>á-methylstyrene</b> {{has been}} tested using combined metallocene-MAO initiator systems with and without diphenylzinc. The metallocenes used were biscyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride, Cp 2 TiCl 2, bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) titanium dichloride, (n-BuCp) 2 TiCl 2, and the half-sandwich metallocene indenyltitanium trichloride, IndTiCl 3. The results indicate that both binary metallocene-MAO, and ternary Ph 2 Zn-metallocene-MAO systems are capable of polymerizing <b>á-methylstyrene</b> to poly(á-methylstyrene) as well of its copolymerization with styrene. These initiator systems also show that despite the 1 + inductive effect of the methyl group, which enhances electrón density at the vinyl double bond of styrene, the steric consequence of vinyl substitution hinders monomer coordination to active species, causing a decrease in conversion of either á-MeS to homopolymer or S/á-MeS to the corresponding copolymer. The nature {{and structure of the}} metallocene included in the initiator system are determinant of the initiator system's efficiency. For the metallocenes used the efficiency follows the order IndTiCl 3 > Cp 2 TiCl 2 > (n-BuCp) 2 TiCl 2, with the half-sandwich metallocene IndTiCl 3 showing greater efficiency than the true metallocenes...|$|E
40|$|Three chiral Mn(salen) {{complexes}} were immobilized {{into different}} mesoporous material via phenoxy group by a simplified method and they show high activity and enantioselectivity for asymmetric epoxidation of various substituted unfunctional olefins. The heterogeneous Mn(salen) catalysts show comparable ee values for asymmetric epoxidation of styrene and 6 -cyano- 2, 2 -dimethylchromene and much higher ee values for epoxidation of <b>a-methylstyrene</b> (heterogeneous 79. 7 % ee versus homogeneous 26. 4 % ee) and cis-beta-methylstyrene (heterogeneous 94. 9 % ee versus homogeneous 25. 3 % ee for cis-epoxide) than the homogeneous catalysts. These heterogeneous catalysts also remarkably alter the cis/trans ratio of epoxides for asymmetric epoxidation of cis-beta-methylstyrene (heterogeneous 21 versus homogeneous 0. 38). The axial tether group {{does not make}} a big effect on ee values and the increase in ee value and change in cis/trans ratio are mainly attributed to the axial immobilization mode and the support effect of heterogeneous catalysts. The catalysts keep constant ee values for the recycle tests of eight times for asymmetric epoxidation of <b>a-methylstyrene.</b> And several possibilities were proposed to elucidate the difference in ee values of heterogeneous catalysts from homogeneous catalysts.

Herein is reported the preparation of iodohydrins in good yields by the reaction of alkenes (ciclohexene, styrene, <b>a-methylstyrene,</b> and 1 -octene) with iodine and water at room temperature, in presence of acid commercial clays (K- 10 and KSF) and natural Brazilian clays (F- 101 and F- 117), being the best results obtained with Brazilian clays (61 - 90 %).

The compounds are thermally stable and, unlike previously isolated trialkyl carbocations, do not require superacidic media or weakly coordinating anions for stability. The crystal structure and DFT calculations suggest polarization of the Sn substituents and hyperconjugation as the reason for the unexpected stability. The stabilizing effect of tin is significantly stronger than that of Si. The carbocations are effective initiators for the polymerization of isobutene, isoprene, and <b>a-methylstyrene...</b>|$|E
40|$|Rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of styrene, <b>a-methylstyrene,</b> {{dimethyl}} itaconate, and (R) -limonene {{was performed}} in gamma-valerolactone (GVL) as a proposed biomass-based environmentally benign solvent for hydroformylation referring to toluene as a generally used conventional solvent. Both achiral (triphenylphosphine, 1, 3 -bis(diphenylphoshino) propane) and enantiopure bidentate phosphine ligands ((S,S) -BDPP, (R) -BINAP, (R) -QUINAP, (R,R) -DIOP, (Rc),(Sp) -JOSIPHOS, (S) -SEGPHOS, (S) -(DM) -SEGPHOS) were investigated in in situ generated Rh-diphosphine catalyst systems.

The adsorption {{is described}} well by the Freundlich equation. The adsorption capacity decreases {{in the order}} Fe 3 +> A 13 +> Ca 2 §> Na § clay. The dimepiperate adsorption from chloroform solution was also investigated by analytical, spectroscopic, and X-ray powder diffraction techniques. IR results uggest that the adsorption i volves the interaction ofthe thioester carbonyl group of dimepiperate possibly with the surrounding water of metal ions. On A 13 + and Fe 3 § clays, this interaction leads to hydrolysis of the thioester bond and formation of the thiol and carbamic acid derivatives that yield <b>a-methylstyrene</b> and piperidine, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of any {{templated}} agents, A novel type of organic polymer-inorganic hybrid material layered crystalline zinc poly(styrene-phenylvinylphosphonate) -phosphate (ZnPS-PVPP) was designed and prepared. A series of new heterogeneous catalysts were obtained by grafting chiral salen Mn(III) onto aryldiamine-modified ZnPS-PVPP. The immobilized catalysts revealed much higher ee values for asymmetric epoxidation of <b>a-methylstyrene</b> (ee, > 99 % vs 54 %) and indene (99. 9 % vs 65. 0 %) with m-CPBA as oxidant than those of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst and could be reused at least nine times without significant loss of activity and enantioselectivity. Another noteworthy aspect of these heterogeneous catalysts was that it was so reactive that no additional co-catalyst 4 -methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) was required to increase the reactivity, which provided the potentiality for application in industry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the catalyst support type on mass transport and reaction rate for the case of hydrogenation of <b>a-methylstyrene</b> to cumene in a gas inducing stirred slurry reactor and in a slurry bubble column. The reaction is carried out in the presence of 3 % Pd/carbon and 3 % Pd/silica catalyst particles. The lyophobicity of the two catalyst supports in the cumene slurry is found to be similar. The overall rate of the hydrogenation reaction is described by the classical transport and reaction resistances-in-series model. The rate of gas-to-liquid mass transfer is somewhat larger during reaction than without reaction. This enhanced mass transfer points to particle-to-bubble adhesion {{as a result of the}} relative affinity of both catalyst supports to the gas phase. The observed reaction enhancements are similar for both Pd/carbon and Pd/silica catalyst/cumene slurries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first report}} on a terpolyperoxide (TPPE) synthesized by the oxidative terpolymerization of styrene, methyl methacrylate, and <b>a-methylstyrene.</b> TPPEs of different compositions were synthesized by varying the vinyl monomers feed, and they were then characterized by spectroscopic and thermal studies. The conventional terpolymer equation {{has been used to}} predict the composition of TPPEs. The H- 1 NMR chemical shift values of TPPEs were found to vary with the composition. The shape of the backbone methylene protons (4. 00 - 4. 50 ppm) was found {{to be sensitive to the}} sequence distribution of vinyl monomers in the polymer chain. Formaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acetophenone, and methyl pyruvate were identified as the primary degradation products. The overall thermal stability and the average enthalpy of degradation (Delta H-d), as obtained by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively, do not vary much with the composition of TPPEs...|$|E
40|$|Novel chiral {{monodentate}} oxazoline ligands {{have been}} synthesized in good yields. The catalytic activity of these monodentate oxazoline/Cu catalysts was evaluated {{in the catalytic}} asymmetric cyclopropanation of styrene and <b>a-methylstyrene,</b> giving moderate to good enantioselectivities (up to 74 % ee for the transcyclopropane product) and full conversions (up to 100 %). In an attempt to enhance the enantioselectivities of the cyclopropanations, heterocombinations of these ligands were used. Unfortunately, with the data set {{that was used in}} this study, no improvements were observed. However, to gain an insight into the nature of the active catalyst present under these circumstances, NMR, mass spectrometric and computational studies were carried out and indicated the presence of bidentate heterocomplexes in the equilibrium mixture. Analysis of the stereoselectivities (ees and des) did not prove very useful in pinpointing the identity of the active chiral catalyst and only afforded a very weak conclusion. In order to ascertain the importance of the pi-pi interactions, the monodentate oxazoline ligands 3 a and 3 b were synthesized and screened in these reactions, and the resulting stereoselectivities were compared to the results obtained using ligands 1 a and 1 b. There seemed to be very weak pi-pi iinteractions at work...|$|E
40|$|A {{straightforward}} synthetic pathway {{based on}} nitroxide mediated polymerisation (NMP) for {{the synthesis of}} a variety of high molar mass segmented copolymers comprising both polystyrene (PS) and polyether segments is reported. First, various precursors such as linear or star-shaped polyether macromonomers, containing either <b>a-methylstyrene</b> or styrene functions at one polymer terminus, as well as PS and polyether macroalkoxyamines bearing either 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 1 -piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) or N-tert-butyl- 1 -diethylphosphono- 2, 2 -dimethylpropyl nitroxide (SG 1) end-groups, were prepared. In a second step, these prepolymers were used to design different copolymer architectures such as block, graft, star-grafted, toothbrush and palm tree structures, in which PS constituted the backbone and polyether the side chains. Block copolymers were obtained by NMP of styrene initiated with polyether macroalkoxyamines. Copolymerisation of styrene with linear and star-shaped polyether macromonomers by NMP resulted in graft and star-grafted copolymers, respectively. A toothbrush copolymer was produced in a similar way {{with the exception of the}} initiator, which was a PS macroalkoxyamine. Likewise, palm tree architectures were obtained by homopolymerising polyether macromonomers initiated by PS macroinitiators. Advanced characterisation of the different polymer structures was performed, including 2 D chromatography...|$|E
40|$|Bifunctional {{mesoporous}} silica nanomaterials (MSN) with various Si/Al molar ratios of 7, 10, 20 and 50 in platinum supported (Pt/HAlMSN) were synthesized using sol-gel methods followed by post-synthesis methods. XRD and nitrogen sorption results confirmed the mesoporous structure with surface areas of 537 - 775 m 2 g- 1. 27 Al NMR spectroscopy confirmed aluminium loading with tetrahedral, pentahedral and octahedral structures. Pyridine adsorption IR {{results indicated that}} incorporation of aluminium led to the generation of strong Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. Catalytic activity was investigated for cumene hydrocracking in a pulse microcatalytic reactor in the temperature range of 323 - 573 K which revealed that this activity depends {{on the number of}} Lewis and Brønsted sites. The high yield of cumene conversion increased from Si/Al molar ratios of 50 to 10 and decreased for the Si/Al molar ratio of 7 due to the presence of pentahedral Al and/or inactive tetrahedral Al atoms in Pt/HAlMSN- 7. The high selectivity of <b>a-methylstyrene</b> showed the important role of Lewis acid sites in these bifunctional catalysts. In spite of the coke formation in the Pt/HAlMSN catalysts, reactivation recovered the activity of the catalysts after 100 h of reaction. The molar absorption coefficients of Pt/HAlMSN were measured using pyridine followed by water adsorption monitored by FTIR...|$|E
