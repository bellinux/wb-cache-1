5|$|In some situations, profit-maximizing {{prices are}} not an optimal strategy.

5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of bony fishes, as well as eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As with other members of its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{target of}} the privateers were the East Indiamen, huge and well-armed merchant vessels operated by the Honourable East India Company, which controlled British mercantile operations {{to the east of}} Africa. These ships often weighed over 1,000 tons and carried as many as 30 cannon, although their crews were not military men and they could not usually resist a determined attack by a well-trained warship. Despite the size and power of these vessels, they were a primary target for French ships operating in the Indian Ocean <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> carried goods worth thousands of pounds: the annual convoy from China alone was worth over $8 million in 1804. To combat these ships, the British naval authorities at Madras tried a number of solutions, including blockades of the French island colonies which failed due to the huge distances involved, armed military convoys escorting the most valuable ships and small fast cruisers patrolling the most dangerous trade routes. One solution tried in 1806 was to disguise Royal Navy warships as the East Indiamen they superficially resembled in the hope of luring French ships into attacking them, unaware of their true identity.|$|E

25|$|The blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii) is {{a species}} of true goby in the family Gobiidae. It is the sole species {{classified}} under the genus Rhinogobiops. They are common inhabitants of coral reefs and rocky habitats along the Eastern Pacific Ocean coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada, though they are hardly noticed, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> rest motionless near their shelters. Other common names for the species include bluespot goby and crested goby.|$|E

The annual Durban International Film Festival in South Africa and Zanzibar International Film Festival in Tanzania have grown in importance for the film and entertainment industry, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> screen the African premieres of many international films.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of bishops, who remain celibate, the Orthodox Church has always allowed priests and deacons to be married, provided the marriage takes place before ordination. In general it is considered preferable for parish priests to be married <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> act as counsel to married couples and thus can draw on their own experience. Unmarried priests usually are monks and live in monasteries, though there are occasions when, {{because of a lack}} of married priests, a monk-priest is temporarily assigned to a parish.|$|E

25|$|Woodall and Constantine {{have been}} parodied many times on comedy {{impression}} programmes. Alistair McGowan's Big Impression took to spoofing their personalities on What Not to Wear, as did 2DTV who made cartoon versions of Woodall and Constantine giving Santa Claus a makeover, where they stripped {{him of his}} red suit and added a casual shirt and trousers. Avid Merrion's Bo' Selecta! took to portraying them as lesbians. In an interview, despite being lampooned on Bo' Selecta!, they commented that the portrayal was a compliment <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> feel women's breasts during makeovers on their show.|$|E
25|$|Because the typhus-infected lice live in clothing, the {{prevalence}} of typhus is also affected by weather, humidity, poverty and lack of hygiene. Lice, and therefore typhus, are more prevalent during colder months, especially winter and early spring. In these seasons, people tend to wear multiple layers of clothing, giving lice more places to go unnoticed by their hosts. This is particularly a problem for poverty-stricken populations <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> do not have multiple sets of clothing, preventing them from practicing good hygiene habits that could prevent louse infestation.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} problems were cause {{by a lack}} of focus on single market segments. ND had bought several software and hardware companies without a defined strategy, and often without adding new segments to the portfolio, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> had overlapping products. The purchases were made in the hope that new software would bring new clients to choose ND hardware, which was the only product ND made profits from. Rolf Skår stated in 1988 that the company should focus on the banking industry, but this was never carried out. Sales had continued to fall during 1989, as customers were concerned that the Sintran-based product line would be discontinued.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous version of the cricket cap in the modern setting is the baggy green cricket cap of the Australian cricket team, for which the players and fans of Australia hold a degree of reverence. The cap is treated {{with a degree of}} mysticism, and players who have long careers often refuse to replace the {{original}} one they receive <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> feel the cap is a lucky talisman. This sometimes results in players who have long careers wearing their cricket caps in quite a tattered state. The Australian side has long worn their baggy cricket cap, rather than alternatives such as a sun hat, for the first session of each match as a symbol of team solidarity.|$|E
25|$|In most applications, {{multiple}} cans {{are arranged}} around the central {{axis of the}} engine, and their shared exhaust is fed to the turbine(s). Can type combustors were most widely used in early gas turbine engines, owing to their ease of design and testing (one can test a single can, rather than have to test the whole system). Can type combustors are easy to maintain, as only a single can needs to be removed, rather than the whole combustion section. Most modern gas turbine engines (particularly for aircraft applications) do not use can combustors, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> weigh more than alternatives. Additionally, the pressure drop across the can is generally higher than other combustors (on the order of 7%). Most modern engines that use can combustors are turboshafts featuring centrifugal compressors.|$|E
25|$|Cox {{enjoyed the}} {{closeness}} of Cynthia Lennon and Pattie Harrison, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> went on holiday together, shopping, and celebrated Christmas. Starr promised that he would set up a nationwide hairdressing business for his wife, but the idea was later shelved, as she {{had to deal with}} looking after their children and being the wife of a Beatle. This would entail waiting with other Beatles' partners, at clubs like the Speakeasy Club, the Ad-Lib, or the Scotch of St James, or staying up all night, waiting for Starr to come home after a recording session, with a cooked meal waiting for him. She was also asked to look after voluminous fan club mail, and would personally answer letters. The Starrs were both interested in various arts, and collaborated on photo montages, paintings and simple sculptures together.|$|E

25|$|In Goa, India, {{which was}} a Portuguese colony until 1961, some Portuguese {{influences}} are still retained. A suburb of Margão, Goa's largest city, has a street named Rua de Saudades. It was aptly named because that very street has the Christian cemetery, the Hindu shmashana (cremation ground) and the Muslim qabrastan (cemetery). Most {{people living in the}} city of Margão who pass by this street would agree that the name of the street could not be any other, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> think fond memories of a friend, loved one, or relative whose remains went past that road. The word saudade takes on a slightly different form in Portuguese-speaking Goan families for whom it implies the once-cherished but never-to-return days of glory of Goa as a prized possession of Portugal, a notion since then made redundant by the irrevocable cultural changes that occurred {{with the end of the}} Portuguese regime in these parts.|$|E
25|$|Local gossips noticed Wright's flirtations, and he {{developed}} a reputation in Oak Park as a man-about-town. His family had grown to six children, but Wright was not parental and he relied on his wife Catherine to care for them. In 1903, Wright designed a house for Edwin Cheney, a neighbor in Oak Park, and immediately took a liking to Cheney's wife, Mamah. Mamah Cheney was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. The two fell in love, and they became {{the talk of the}} town, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. Wright's wife, Kitty, sure that this attachment would fade as the others had, refused to grant him a divorce. Mamah had to live in Europe for two years in order to obtain a divorce from Edwin on the grounds of desertion.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) {{describes}} a non-progressive disorder of motor function stemming from malformation or early {{damage to the}} brain. CP can manifest in many ways, given the different manner in which brain can be damaged; in common to all forms {{is the emergence of}} signs and symptoms of impairment as the child develops. However, milestones that have been accomplished and neurologic functions that have developed do not deteriorate in CP <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>often</b> do in children with A-T in the late pre-school years. Most children with ataxia caused by CP do not begin to walk at a normal age, whereas most children with A-T start to walk at a normal age even though they often “wobble” from the start. Pure ataxia is a rare manifestation of early brain damage or malformation, however, and the possibility of an occult genetic disorder of brain should be considered and sought for those in whom ataxia is the chief manif estation of CP. Children with ataxic CP will not manifest the laboratory abnormalities associated with A-T.|$|E
