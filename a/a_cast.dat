5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, {{lies in the fact that}} Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered <b>a</b> <b>cast</b> for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which <b>a</b> <b>cast</b> was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} on the cooling characteristics of AC 4 C aluminum alloy and AC 7 A aluminum alloy used as <b>a</b> <b>casting</b> material for manufacturing automobile tire mold by experiment. The metal mold device by gravity casting method was manufactured. AC 4 C casting material and AC 7 <b>A</b> <b>casting</b> material were heated in smelting furnace at about 650 °C and 670 °C, {{and then they}} injected into the metal mold device when the melting process was completely finished, respectively. When the melted casting material was completely injected into the metal mold device, the temperature inside the casting was measured by 9 measurement points. Also, when the temperature inside the casting was measured approximately 500 °C during the cooling process, the casting is separated to metal mold device and carried out cooling at normal temperature. The separating time from metal mold device of AC 4 C casting material and AC 7 <b>A</b> <b>casting</b> material have been taken 25 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. The final cooling time of AC 4 C casting material and AC 7 <b>A</b> <b>casting</b> material have been taken 400 minutes and 380 minutes, respectively. Accordingly, AC 7 <b>A</b> <b>casting</b> material is able to improve on productivity than AC 4 C casting material because production time was decreasing...|$|R
