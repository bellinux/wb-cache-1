40|$|We {{initiate}} the formal study on authenticated key exchange (<b>AKE)</b> under bad randomness. This could happen when (1) an adversary compromises the randomness source and hence directly controls the randomness of each <b>AKE</b> session; and (2) the randomness repeats in different <b>AKE</b> sessions due to reset attacks. We construct two formal security models, Reset- 1 and Reset- 2, to capture these two bad randomness situations respectively, and investigate {{the security of}} some widely used <b>AKE</b> protocols in these models by showing that they become insecure when the adversary is able to manipulate the randomness. On the positive side, we propose simple but generic methods to make <b>AKE</b> protocols secure in Reset- 1 and Reset- 2 models. The methods work in a modular way: first, we strengthen a widely used <b>AKE</b> protocol to achieve Reset- 2 security, then we show how to transform any Reset- 2 secure <b>AKE</b> protocol to a new one which also satisfies Reset- 1 security...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{security}} definitions for authenticated key exchange (<b>AKE)</b> protocols. We observe {{that there are}} several families of attacks on <b>AKE</b> protocols that lie outside the boundary of the current class of security definitions. In an attempt to bring these attacks {{within the scope of}} analysis we extend the <b>AKE</b> security definition to provide greater powers to the adversary. We provide a general framework for defining <b>AKE</b> security, which we call strong <b>AKE</b> security, such that existing security definitions occur as instances of the framework. We then introduce NAXOS, a new two-pass <b>AKE</b> protocol, and prove that it is secure in this stronger definition. In addition, we formulate a notion of ephemeral secret key which captures all ephemeral information used in session establishment. We demonstrate the importance of this formulation by showing that a secure <b>AKE</b> protocol SIG-DH can become vulnerable when instantiated with signature schemes which are insecure against revelation of the secret random bits used in the signature generation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: IEEE 802. 11 {{wireless}} LAN {{has become}} one of the hot topics on the design and development of network access technologies. In particular, its authentication and key exchange (<b>AKE)</b> aspects, which form a vital building block for modern security mechanisms, deserve further investigation. In this paper we first identify the general requirements used for WLAN authentication and key exchange (<b>AKE)</b> methods, and then classify them into three levels (mandatory, recommended, and additional operational requirements). We present a review of issues and proposed solutions for <b>AKE</b> in 802. 11 WLANs. Three types of existing methods for addressing <b>AKE</b> issues are identified, namely, the legacy, layered and access control-based <b>AKE</b> methods. Then, we compare these methods against the identified requirements. Based on the analysis, a multi-layer <b>AKE</b> framework is proposed, together with a set of design guidelines, which aims at a flexible, extensible and efficient security as well as easy deployment...|$|R
