In her mind there was an evident necessity that every one should be up and doing: Monday, because it was washing day; Tuesday, because it was ironing day; Wednesday, because it was baking day; Thursday, because to-morrow was Friday; and so on {{to the end of the}} week. Then she had the care of reminding all in the house of every thing each was to do from week's end to week's end; and she was so faithful in this respect, that scarcely an original act of volition took place in the family. The poor deacon was reminded when he went out and when he came in, when he sat down and when he rose up, so that an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> could only have been committed through sheer malice prepense.|$|E

50|$|In general, abuse {{refers to}} (usually deliberate) <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> {{commission}} while neglect refers to <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission.</b> Child maltreatment includes both <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> commission and <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> {{on the part}} of parents or caregivers that cause actual or threatened harm to a child. Some health professionals and authors consider neglect as part of the definition of abuse, while others do not; this is because the harm may have been unintentional, or because the caregivers did not understand the severity of the problem, which may have been the result of cultural beliefs about how to raise a child. Delayed effects of child abuse and neglect, especially emotional neglect, and the diversity <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> that qualify as child abuse, are also factors.|$|R

Thus the English Jews, by an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission,</b> as it were, became full citizens, subject to no more disabilities than those inherent in their own unwillingness, like Catholics and Nonconformists, to belong to the Church of England or, in their particular case, to swear Christian oaths.|$|E

40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes {{child maltreatment}} {{as a serious}} public health problem with {{extensive}} short- and long-term health consequences. In addition to the immediate physical and emotional effects of maltreatment, children who have experienced abuse and neglect {{are at increased risk}} of adverse health outcomes and risky health behaviors in adolescence and adulthood. Child maltreatment has been linked to higher rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, smoking, multiple sexual partners, suicide, and chronic disease. CDC defines child maltreatment as any <b>act</b> or series <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> commission or <b>omission</b> by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> include physical abuse, sexual abuse, and psychological abuse, and <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> include neglect (physical, emotional, medical/dental, or educational) and failure to supervise. In 2008, an estimated 1, 740 children died in the United States as a result of maltreatment, and approximately 772, 000 children were found by protective services agencies to be victims of maltreatment. Because many cases go unreported or undetected, the actual number of children who experience maltreatment each year is estimated to be far greater. cm_prog_activities_guide-a. pdfPublication date from document properties...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{failure to}} provide proper care for animals is an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> or neglect rather than an affirmative act, the failure to care for an animal is {{considered}} a misdemeanor offense in most states. [...] For instance, in Alaska, if an animal owner fails to provide the aforementioned standards of care, the state has prima facie evidence of a failure to care for an animal. If the prosecutor can prove the owner’s failure to care for an animal was done with criminal negligence {{and the failure to}} care for the animal caused its death or severe physical pain or prolonged suffering, then the owner may be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. In Colorado, {{failure to provide}} an animal with the proper standard of care is a Class 1 misdemeanor. In Virginia, each owner must provide for each of his companion animals: adequate feed; adequate water; adequate shelter that is properly cleaned; adequate space in the primary enclosure for the particular type of animal depending upon its age, size, species, and weight; adequate exercise; adequate care, treatment, and transportation; and veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering or disease transmission. Violation of these standards is a Class 4 misdemeanor. A second or subsequent violation may result in a higher grade misdemeanor. Likewise, under Virginia's animal cruelty statute, any person who deprives any animal of necessary food, drink, shelter or emergency veterinary treatment is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.|$|E

We believe that lack of guidance on what is the most efficient way to reduce adverse events and improve the quality of health care limits the scale-up of health system improvement interventions. Challenges to economic evaluation of these interventions include defining and implementing improvement interventions in different settings with high fidelity, capturing all of the positive and negative effects of the intervention, using process measures of effectiveness rather than health outcomes, and determining the full cost of the intervention and all economic consequences its effects. However, health system improvement interventions should be treated similarly to individual medical interventions and undergo rigorous economic evaluation to provide actionable evidence to guide policy-makers in decisions of resources allocation for improvement activities among other competing demands for health care resources...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inappropriate {{prescribing}} encompasses <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> commission i. e. giving {{drugs that}} are contraindicated or unsuitable, and <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> i. e. failure to prescribe drugs when indicated due to ignorance of evidence base or other irrational basis e. g. ageism. There are considerable published data on the prevalence of inappropriate prescribing; however, there are no recent published data on the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} calculate the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> prescribing <b>omission</b> in a population of consecutively hospitalised elderly people. METHODS: A screening tool (screening tool to alert doctors to the right treatment acronym, START), devised from evidence-based prescribing indicators and arranged according to physiological systems was prepared and validated for identifying prescribing omissions in older adults. Data on active medical problems and prescribed medicines were collected in 600 consecutive elderly patients admitted from the community with acute illness to a teaching hospital. On identification of an omitted medication, the patient's medical records were studied to look for a valid reason for the prescribing omission. RESULTS: Using the START list, we found one or more prescribing omissions in 57. 9 % of patients. In order of prevalence, the most common prescribing omissions were: statins in atherosclerotic disease (26 %), warfarin in chronic atrial fibrillation (9. 5 %), anti-platelet therapy in arterial disease (7. 3 %) and calcium/vitamin D supplementation in symptomatic osteoporosis (6 %). CONCLUSION: Failure to prescribe appropriate medicines is a highly prevalent problem among older people presenting to hospital with acute illness. A validated screening tool (START) is one method of systematically identifying appropriate omitted medicines in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{discusses}} the naked licensing doctrine, under which trademark owners may lose their trademark protection through failing to exercise {{control over their}} licensees. Even though the Lanham Act holds that abandonment of trademark rights is only appropriate when a trademark has lost its significance, courts have held that a trademark owner may abandon its rights through naked licensing when it breaches its affirmative duty to police its licensees. In other words, these courts find abandonment even {{when there is no}} evidence that the quality of the goods and services sold under the trademark has declined. This Comment argues that this focus on control formalities conflicts with trademark law 2 ̆ 7 s goal of reducing consumer search costs, does not further trademark law 2 ̆ 7 s goal of encouraging the production of high quality goods and the provision of high quality services, and is no longer necessary because changes in trademark licensing and consumer behavior have reduced the risk of trademark- related consumer deception. In its search for a better standard, this Comment compares naked licensing with genericide, which is another way for a trademark owner to abandon its rights through an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission.</b> Courts evaluate whether a trademark owner has abandoned its rights through genericide by using a loss of distinctiveness standard; arguably, courts should use the same standard for evaluating whether a trademark owner has abandoned its rights through naked licensing. However, courts should not use the loss of distinctiveness standard alone because naked licensing harms consumers more than genericide. A consumer deception standard also finds support in the Lanham Act; however, courts should not focus on consumer deception alone because it is an imprecise and unrealistic standard. Instead, courts should find trademark abandonment through naked licensing when a trademark deceives consumers more than it reduces consumer search costs...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the intra-Salafī disputes in the 1990 s over {{the legitimacy of}} present-day rulers in the Muslim world and their status as Muslims. While these issues are theological in their essence, they are intertwined with the political milieu of the Middle East. Fundamentally, these intra-Salafī disputes pivot around the central question {{of the impact of}} implementing manmade law systems (instead of sharīʿah) on the legitimacy of the ruler. This study tackles this question and related issues that form the themes addressed in this study. It begins by providing a minimal definition of Salafism which identifies its main characteristics that distinguishes its adherents from other Muslim denominations. Chapter two and three discuss the disputes over whether present-day rulers meet the required qualification to qualify as legitimate rulers in Islam and hence what position Muslims should take towards them. Chapter four digs deeper into the theological aspect of these debates in order to ascertain the different views on what acts can and cannot strip a Muslim from his/her status as a Muslim. It begins by highlighting the importance laid on creed in Salafism and providing the general principles on belief and unbelief upon which all Salafī proponents agree. After that, it examines the disagreements amongst contemporary Salafīs over which criteria should be considered to determine that an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> or commission is sinful enough to cause unbelief. Chapter five investigates the accusations levelled against the prominent Salafī scholar al-Albānī in regards to deviancy from the teachings of Salafism on belief and unbelief {{as an example of the}} importance of this debate. This study demonstrates how intra-Salafī disputes evolved from a mere disagreement over the legitimacy of political opposition to the state to become an intense complex quarrel on the nature of the Islamic faith. It argues that political affiliations alone fail to explain intra-Salafī disagreements over politics and violence and only through accurate analyses of the underpinning doctrinal differences one can understand their divergent reactions to contemporary political issues. This research aims to contribute to the study of the Islamic governance genre as well as to the studies on Salafism which despite its rapid spread worldwide, remains a scarcely studied subject...|$|E

Absolute poverty is associated with overt exploitation and connected to humiliation (e.g., being forced to eat food from other people's garbage), but being dependent upon others to stay alive is a violation of dignity {{even in the absence of}} more direct violations. Relative poverty, on the other hand, is a violation because the cumulative experience of not being able to afford the same clothes, entertainment, social events, education, or other features of typical life in that society results in subtle humiliation; social rejection; marginalization; and consequently, a diminished self-respect.|$|R
