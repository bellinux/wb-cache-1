25|$|The pool {{round at}} the ACHA National Tournament in Newark, Delaware was a tight-checking, nail-biting two days. An upstart Liberty team (the runners-up from 2013, but only seeded seventh in 2014) gave the Minutemen <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> they wanted before a Chelsea Bräm goal with 5:02 {{remaining}} squeaked out a 2–1 victory. That evening, UMass survived another close call, as Labossiere buried Adrian in overtime by a 2–1 count after the Bulldogs tied things late. After those two wins secured {{a spot in}} the semifinals - and results early {{on the second day of}} the tournament clinched first place in the pool - Robert Morris (IL) overcame two Harrington goals with five in the second period, as the Eagles picked up what amounted to a consolation win by a 6–4 count. The contest was notable as a meeting of future Buffalo Beauts teammates Harrington and Hayley Williams (who grabbed an assist), and as a World University Games reunion of sorts - in addition to the five Minutemen and Williams, RMU's Jessica Merritt and Ramey Weaver were also on Team USA, with the latter both its captain and leading scorer.|$|E
25|$|Simon Bodger (Andy Cunningham) - Simon Bodger is a {{handyman}} {{who has had}} various jobs {{throughout the}} series, probably because when he is nervous he makes silly mistakes and Badger's antics repeatedly get him sacked. In the first series he {{was working as a}} cook for Troff's Nosherama. He got sacked after Badger accidentally revealed himself to praise Mr Troff for giving Simon the job of chef. In the second and third series he was a caretaker at the (fictional) Letsby Avenue Junior School. This is not far from Troffs' Nosherama, as the Letsby Avenue football team are referenced in the first episode of series one. In the fourth series he was a handyman and zookeeper at Chessington World of Adventures. In the fifth, sixth and seventh series he was seemingly unemployed and renting a flat, occasionally working as a casual handyman to his landlady, Mrs Dribelle. In the eighth and ninth series he was manager of his own Bed and Breakfast while a relative who owned it went on a round-the-world trip. Badger is his anthropomorphic talking pet and best friend, although <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> that Bodger ends up in is usually down to Badger. Regular gags usually involve Badger covering Bodger in mashed potato or some other messy substance, either intentionally or accidentally.|$|E

This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and he speaks to the headmaster Mr Allcock (Bill Buckhurst).

Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want to go, so tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby George and saying it is a shame after Shirley went to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> to get her into school.

Hargitay was appointed the guardian of Mickey, Zoltan, and Mariska by a court decree in June 1967, though they went on living with their mother. He married airline stewardess Ellen Siano in 1968, who accompanied him to New Orleans when he went to pick up his three children with Mansfield after her death. In January 1969, he lost his claim of $275,533 from Mansfield's estate to support the three children ($ in [...] dollars).
