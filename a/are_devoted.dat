Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design, in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{reconstruction}} of a building, starting from a point cloud. The shape of this building is a non-stellar concave and multi-connected structure, composed of sowns and chains. A sown is the representation of a horizontal plane formed by dense points. A chain is a planar loop modeled by rare points. CCTV structure is defined only by the three orthogonal Cartesian coordinates. The reconstruction uses a sequence of procedures and the desired output is a consistent 3 D model. The first procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> to attributing points to their voxel and to estimating the three values needed afterwards. The second procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> to analyzing clusters vertically and horizontally, to preliminarily distinguishing chains from sowns and to generating relational matching. The third procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> to building closed loops between all chains and all their projections on sowns. The fourth procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> to connecting points with triangles. The fifth procedure, still being implemented, <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> to interpolating triangles with triangular splines...|$|R
