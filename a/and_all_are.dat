5|$|Forty-two {{species from}} five genera {{populate}} New Zealand, ranging from sea level to mountain tops, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> endemic to New Zealand {{and the surrounding}} islands (Norfolk Island, New Caledonia).|$|E
5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns, the Eurasian crag martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky crag martin is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata {{appeared in the}} Permian <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the Permian had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E

5|$|Edward's unorthodox {{approach}} to his role also {{extended to the}} coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that {{of his or her}} predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done), to show the parting in his hair. Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> very rare. When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right.|$|E
5|$|The College of All Saints was an ecclesiastical {{college in}} Maidstone, Kent, England, founded in 1395 by Archbishop Courtenay. It {{was part of}} the {{establishment}} of the nearby Archbishop's Palace, but was closed in 1546. The College church was the neighbouring Church of All Saints. Following its closure, the College estate was sold. The buildings and land passed through the ownership of three aristocratic families, being farmed until the late 19th century. A number of the College's buildings survive <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> listed buildings. Additionally, the whole site of the College is protected as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of {{definite}}ness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some <b>and</b> <b>all,</b> <b>are</b> used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E

5|$|The polyatomic {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished from}} the diatomic nonmetals by virtue of having higher coordination numbers, higher melting points (in their thermodynamically most stable forms), and higher boiling points; and having wider liquid ranges and lower room temperature volatility. More generally they show a marked tendency to exist in allotropic forms, and a stronger inclination to catenate; and have a weaker ability to form hydrogen bonds. The ability of carbon to catenate, in particular, is fundamental {{to the field of}} organic chemistry and life on Earth. All of the polyatomic nonmetals are solids, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> known in either malleable, pliable or ductile forms; most also have lower ionisation energies and electronegativities than those of the diatomic nonmetals.|$|E
5|$|Verbs are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more verbs are possible. They are often monosyllabic verb roots <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> vowel-final. Wagiman verbs obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments, and for the tense and aspect of the clause. A small set of verbs may take a non-finite suffix -yh, in which {{it may not be}} further inflected for person or tense. That non-finite verb must then co-occur with another auxiliary verb.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E

5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The African rock martin {{and the south}} Asian dusky crag martin are resident, but the Eurasian crag martin is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north Africa or India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the breeding site with a slow hunting flight as they seek their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
