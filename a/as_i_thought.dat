25|$|The Saints' first release after Kuepper's {{departure}} was {{the live}} EP, Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow, in March 1980 on Lost Records with Bailey producing. It {{was followed by}} a studio album, The Monkey Puzzle, co-produced by Bailey and Gerry Nixon for Mushroom Records in February 1981. It reached the Top100 on the Australian Albums Chart. They had shifted to a more melodic pop-rock sound and included Hay on keyboards in the line-up. Hay left again before the next album was released in Australia in 1982 <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Thought</b> This Was Love, But This Ain't Casablanca on Mushroom Records and elsewhere as Out in the Jungle... Where Things Ain't So Pleasant on New Rose Records. Production was credited to Ricardo Mentalban, and with Bailey, in The Saints, were Hall on bass guitar and Iain Shedden (ex-The Jolt) on drums. Additional musicians included Roger Crankwell on saxophone and clarinet, Denis Haines on piano, Paul Neiman on trombone, Steve Sidwell on trumpet and Jess Sutcliffe on piano. The Damned's Brian James guested on lead guitar.|$|E

Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as [...] "mediocre", and comments [...] "the devil's urn is not as bad <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was going to}} be.

During {{his time in}} Rishikesh, Lennon decided to write a song about the recent wave of social upheaval. He recalled, [...] "I thought it was about time we spoke about it , the same <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was about time we stopped not answering about the Vietnamese war.

500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, {{calling her}} [...] "the most genuine character". Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was {{critical}} {{of the rest of}} the episode, writing: [...] "The funeral wasn't as sad <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all.

500|$|In 1983, Bill Parcells' {{first year}} as head coach, Woolfolk gained 1,225yards from {{scrimmage}} for the Giants (857yards rushing and 368yards receiving) -- more yards than any Giants running back in the previous ten years. [...] He also set the NFL record for most rushing attempts in a game with 43carries (for 159yards) on November 20, 1983. Woolfolk gained 115yards on 26carries {{in the first half}} alone and said after the game: [...] "I'm not as tired <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I would be when somebody told me how many carries I had." [...] Ironically, Woolfolk's 43-carry record was broken in 1988 by Jamie Morris, the same player who also broke Woolfolk's career rushing record at the University of Michigan.|$|E
500|$|The casting of {{the lead}} pair was leaked well before the {{intended}} official announcements. Gowariker cast Harman Baweja after watching the trailer of his debut film, the science fiction romance Love Story 2050 (2008). He asked Harman's father, Harry Baweja, to show him the film's rushes and was impressed with his performance, calling him the best person for the part. Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve zodiac signs. On casting Chopra, Gowariker said: [...] "I have always liked Priyanka's work, right from [...] She's been fabulous in all her films. So when I thought of somebody doing twelve roles I thought about her, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she had the potential." [...] When Gowariker offered the film to her, Chopra instantly agreed to star in it.|$|E
500|$|... 300 writer Frank Miller said: [...] "The Spartans were a {{paradoxical}} people. They were the biggest slave owners in Greece. But {{at the same}} time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox {{that they were a}} bunch of people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy. The closest comparison you can draw in terms of our own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They're these almost superhuman characters with a tremendous warrior ethic, who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. I didn't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms, because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans. I couldn't show them being quite as cruel as they were. I made them as cruel <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> a modern audience could stand." ...|$|E

"During {{many years}} I {{collected}} {{notes on the}} origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth." [...] In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: [...] "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} partially by Foote's nephew, who struggled {{to succeed in}} the country music business. Foote was initially interested in writing a film based on his nephew's efforts to organize a band, which he saw as paralleling his own youthful attempts to find work as an actor. During his research, however, he met an experienced musician who had offered to help his nephew's band, and Foote found himself growing more interested in a story about him, rather than the band itself. Foote said, [...] "This older man had been through it all. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about a storyline, I got very interested in that type of character." [...] The moment in the film where a woman asks, [...] "Were you really Mac Sledge?" [...] and he responds, [...] "Yes ma'am, I guess I was," [...] was based on an exchange that Foote overheard between a washed-up star and a fan. Foote said the entire film pivots on that statement, which he believed spoke volumes about Mac's personality and former status.|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as much fun <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E

500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "I have {{a strong}} memory from my {{childhood}} of just how dark and gruesome their tale was and I wondered {{what would have happened}} to the two of them when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|Arnold Schwarzenegger, {{star of the}} {{preceding}} three films in the series, initially remarked that Terminator Salvation was [...] "a great film, I was very excited", but later reversed this position {{and said it was}} [...] "...awful.

[...] Terminator series creator James Cameron considered it an [...] "interesting film" [...] that he [...] "didn't hate as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I was going to", and praised Sam Worthington's performance, but also said he would not return to the franchise: [...] " [...] has kind of run its course [...] frankly, the soup's already been pissed in by other film makers". He also felt his two films were better than either of the later films. Linda Hamilton, who portrayed Sarah Connor in The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day and lent her voice to Terminator Salvation, wished the film [...] "all the best" [...] but expressed her opinion that the series [...] "was perfect with two films. It was a complete circle, and it was enough in itself. But there will always be those who will try to milk the cow".|$|E
500|$|Despite his injury, Stewart said {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race. Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was [...] "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" [...] and admitted fault for causing the crash. According to Kenseth, [...] "I {{knew he was going to}} get a run on me, so I laid back a little bit...We came off [...] 2 and I was up as high <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I could, and Jeff just came across. Whether it was on purpose or not, it just kind of wiped us out." [...] Gordon {{said he hoped}} Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track. Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed. After consultation with NASCAR officials, construction crews installed a [...] long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008.|$|E
