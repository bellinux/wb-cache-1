5|$|A loon’s wail is a {{long call}} {{consisting}} of up to three notes, and is often compared to a wolf’s howl. It uses this call to communicate its location to other loons. The call is given back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> breeding pairs or an adult and its chick, either to maintain contact or {{in an attempt to}} move closer together after being separated. It is a loud aaoo, weee-wea weee-wea weee-wea, or ooo-aaah-éééé.|$|E

5|$|Each {{level in}} the game is {{intended}} to have a unique theme, in either fiction or game mechanic. In one level, the player is confronted with two factions each with their own assassination target, and may use the level's reoccurring dust storms for cover. In another, time distortion is introduced as the player traverses an abandoned mansion in ruins. The player is given a device that lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> the two points in time.|$|E

5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to {{the lights of the}} aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E

5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{somewhat}} similar to {{elements of the}} 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston, as well as inanimate objects coming {{to life in the}} Beast's castle. The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.|$|E

5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E

Because Ko and Wakaba are the same age and always together, Aoba is jealous of all the time Ko spends with her older sister. Aoba is a natural pitcher with excellent form, and Ko secretly trains to become as good as she is, even while publicly showing little interest in baseball. Then Wakaba dies in a swimming accident at a summer camp during fifth grade.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{recruited}} McMillan to {{join the}} Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to create atomic bombs, in September 1942. Initially, he commuted back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> San Diego, where his family was, and Berkeley. In November he accompanied Oppenheimer {{on a trip to}} New Mexico on which the Los Alamos Ranch School was selected as the site of the project's weapons research laboratory, which became the Los Alamos Laboratory. With Oppenheimer and John H. Manley, he drew up the specifications for the new laboratory's technical buildings. He recruited personnel for the laboratory, including Richard Feynman and Robert R. Wilson, established the test area known as the Anchor Ranch, and scoured the country for technical equipment from machine tools to a cyclotron.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore {{stability}} in England, and power swung back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> the different factions. One of the priorities for the new regime was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, {{at the end of}} 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a peace treaty with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government. Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.|$|E
5|$|The film opens {{by cutting}} back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> scenes of a naval ship {{carrying}} Admiral Croft (John Woodvine), and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd (David Collings) {{and his daughter}} Mrs. Clay (Felicity Dean) to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (Corin Redgrave), while Croft discusses {{the end of the}} Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish baronet, is faced with financial ruin unless he retrenches. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, the intelligent Anne (Amanda Root).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of these emissions {{are thought to be}} produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>between</b> the poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk. The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1GW.|$|E
