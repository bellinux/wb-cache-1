5|$|Mr Carkdale (John Grillo), {{the head}} of English, very rarely utters {{anything}} but expletives. Struggling to find a rationale for his character, Grillo paced up and down <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> room carrying a brown briefcase, which he remembers all of his own teachers carrying around, and shouting profanities.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there would}} be only one chance {{to carry out the}} test correctly, Bainbridge decided that <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> should be carried out to allow the plans and {{procedures}} to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical, but gave permission, and later agreed that it contributed {{to the success of the}} Trinity test.|$|E
5|$|Japanese theatre styles {{have been}} applied to The Tempest. In 1988 and again in 1992 Yukio Ninagawa brought his version of The Tempest to the UK. It was staged as <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> of a Noh drama, with a {{traditional}} Noh theatre {{at the back of}} the stage, but also using elements which were at odds with Noh conventions. In 1992, Minoru Fujita presented a Bunraku (Japanese puppet) version in Osaka and at the Tokyo Globe.|$|E
50|$|The Gosser Fine Arts Center {{is home to}} Campbellsville University's School of Music. Housed in {{this complex}} are classrooms, {{practice}} rooms, faculty studios, offices, a computer lab, a piano lab, <b>an</b> instrumental <b>rehearsal</b> hall, <b>a</b> choral <b>rehearsal</b> hall, and the Gheens Recital Hall.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> music <b>rehearsal</b> space exists {{according}} {{to the size of}} the community it serves and how it is financed. Some can be for general purposes, while others may specialise. The cost of running <b>a</b> music <b>rehearsal</b> space is such that its support by any given population is limited. With a smaller population it may be difficult to sustain a space: there may be only two practice rooms or even one, jeopardising its very survival. <b>A</b> music <b>rehearsal</b> space represents <b>a</b> great capital investment in equipment and premises.|$|R
50|$|The HPAC also houses all of {{the offices}} {{required}} for running the Center and its events, {{as well as the}} offices of the HPAC Orchestra. Additionally, there is <b>a</b> large <b>rehearsal</b> room designed to replicate the acoustic of the Grand Hall, <b>a</b> small <b>rehearsal</b> room, and several practice rooms.|$|R
5|$|Lugovoy and Kovtun met Litvinenko in the Millennium {{hotel bar}} twice, on 1 November (when the {{poisoning}} took place), and earlier, on 16 October. Trails left by Lugovoy and Kovtun started on 16 October, {{in the same}} sushi bar where Litvinenko was poisoned later, but at a different table. It was assumed that their first meeting with Litvinenko was either <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> of the future poisoning, or an unsuccessful attempt at the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|They rented <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> {{space and}} began working on the new {{material}} before going on to record the album at Jupiter Studios with producer Martin Feveyear. They released a series of Webisodes during this time, featuring footage from the recording sessions for the group's new album. They booked {{a tour of the}} UK and Ireland and were added to the lineups of few European festivals. The album was completed in less than two weeks and cost only $20,000.|$|E
5|$|At <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> for one {{of these}} entertainments, Ages Ago (1869), the {{composer}} Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together. Those two intervening years continued to shape Gilbert's theatrical style. He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and A Sensation Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870), and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871).|$|E

5|$|Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford {{hosted the}} Tuesday and Thursday {{broadcasts}} of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, {{participated in the}} first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> in the afternoon, then two in the eveningone for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Enormous crowds {{could be}} {{accommodated}} at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks attracted {{an audience of}} 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. Many {{of the best known}} musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example Sophia Baddeley. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by a fancy dress ball attended by Frederick, Prince of Wales. At that time access from the West End was by water, but the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.|$|E
5|$|In September 1995, Crahan and Gray {{started a}} band named the Pale Ones. The lineup {{was made up}} of friends who met through the local music scene, {{including}} vocalist Colsefni and guitarist Donnie Steele. Not long after their inception, Gray invited Jordison to <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> because the band was interested in experimenting with additional drum elements. Jordison subsequently joined the band as their main drummer, moving Crahan to custom percussion. Furthermore, Colsefni also took up custom percussion while remaining the band's vocalist. The band then decided to invite Brainard as their second guitarist, bringing their lineup to six members. On December 4, the band made their live debut; playing a benefit show using the name Meld.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Shaw {{refused to}} seek {{clerical}} employment in London. His mother {{allowed him to}} live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had no thought yet of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet. Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London. Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> pianist and occasional singer.|$|E
5|$|Loose Fur is an American {{rock band}} {{comprising}} Wilco members Jeff Tweedy and Glenn Kotche, and Wilco collaborator Jim O'Rourke. The trio first convened in May 2000 {{in preparation for}} a Tweedy performance at a festival in Chicago. Tweedy was offered the opportunity to collaborate with an artist of his choosing, and he decided to work with O'Rourke. O'Rourke brought Kotche to <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> session, and the trio recorded an album's worth of songs. The trio have since released two albums, 2003's Loose Fur and 2006's Born Again in the USA, for Drag City. The band has only toured once.|$|E
5|$|Princess Ida (1884) spoofed women's {{education}} and male chauvinism and continued {{the theme from}} Iolanthe of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem The Princess: A Medley. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce {{based on the same}} material in 1870, called The Princess, and he reused {{a good deal of the}} dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida. Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal,</b> he dismissed her.|$|E

5000|$|The combat {{phase of}} <b>a</b> play <b>rehearsal</b> is {{referred}} to as <b>a</b> fight <b>rehearsal.</b> Choreography is typically learned step by step, and practiced at first very slowly before increasing to a speed that is both dramatically convincing and safe for the performers and their audience. Even stage combat is risky, and it is preferable for actors to have as much training and experience as possible. A [...] "fight call" [...] or <b>a</b> brief <b>rehearsal</b> before the show is performed each time, set aside for the actors to [...] "mark" [...] through the fight to increase their muscle memory.|$|R
5|$|The {{announcement}} of her resignation {{was met with}} speculation that San Miguel had been forced by Binibining Pilipinas pageant organizers to relinquish her title {{due to a lack}} of professionalism during preparatory training sessions, which strained the patience of her mentors and superiors. In a later interview, she admitted that due to multiple conflicts in schedule she was unable to attend all the training sessions arranged for her by pageant organizers, which included sessions to improve her speaking ability. She also admitted to throwing a fit in the middle of <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> when she received news that her grandfather was dying, and demanded that she be allowed to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management. These works were a success, with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, Ages Ago, opening in 1869. Ages Ago was also {{the beginning of a}} collaboration with the composer Frederic Clay that would last seven years and produce four works. It was at <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> for Ages Ago that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan. The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{formally}} announced during Bethesda's Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015 press conference by Dishonored co-directors Raphaël Colantonio and Harvey Smith, but was leaked {{the night before}} during <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal.</b> Lucie Minne's clay models, along with other Dishonored art, were featured on display at Art Ludique in an exhibit focused on French video games. Dishonored 2 appeared again at E3 2016. An image for the game by Sergei Kolesov was featured {{as part of the}} 2016 Into the Pixel collection. It was released to manufacturing on 1 November 2016 and made available on 11 November 2016. The PC version was tamper-protected by anti-piracy software Denuvo, which was cracked in June 2017 by hacker group SteamPunks.|$|E

5|$|The show's writers begin {{each day}} with a morning meeting where they review {{material}} that researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the Associated Press, cable news television channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects. By lunchtime, Noah — who describes his role {{as that of the}} captain of a team — has begun to review headline jokes. The script is submitted by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal.</b> An hour is left for rewrites before a 6 pm taping in front of a live studio audience.|$|E
5|$|Assembly of a Fat Man {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting {{to perform a}} specific task had to wait their turn outside the building. The first Fat Man assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly cracked and unserviceable. The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> and F31 for operational use.|$|E
5|$|Following Hendrix's {{arrival in}} London, Chandler began {{recruiting}} members for a band designed {{to highlight the}} guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Hendrix met guitarist Noel Redding at an audition for the New Animals, where Redding's knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix, who stated that he also liked Redding's hairstyle. Chandler asked Redding {{if he wanted to}} play bass guitar in Hendrix's band; Redding agreed. Chandler then began looking for a drummer and soon after, he contacted Mitch Mitchell through a mutual friend. Mitchell, who had recently been fired from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, participated in <b>a</b> <b>rehearsal</b> with Redding and Hendrix where they found common ground in their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position, he readily accepted. Chandler also convinced Hendrix to change the spelling of his first name from Jimmy to the exotic looking Jimi.|$|E
