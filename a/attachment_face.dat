40|$|Attacks on {{information}} security {{continue to be}} reported in the media, and result in large losses for organizations. While some attacks {{are the result of}} sophisticated threats, others can be traced to failures by organizational insiders to observe basic security policies such as using caution when opening unsolicited email <b>attachments.</b> <b>Faced</b> with the challenges and time demands of everyday stressors, security policy compliance can be costly for individuals; security actions require time and distract attention from other primary tasks. This costliness can lead individuals to ignore prompts to perform security updates, scan their computers for threats, or reboot their computers to apply security updates. This dissertation contains three studies that address the following overarching research question: How can end-user adherence to security messages be better understood and improved, and how can theory inform security-message design? First, two complementary studies are presented that examine the integration of media naturalness theory into a security message context using field study and fMRI designs. Study 1, the field study, unobtrusively captures objective measures of attention from Amazon Mechanical Turk users (N= 510) as they perform a between-subjects deception protocol. Study 2, the fMRI study, examines neural activations from a within-subjects participant design (N= 23) in response to different security message designs with integrated emotive human facial expressions. Data from studies 1 and 2 show that warnings with integrated facial expressions of threat (fear, disgust) generally elicited greater adherence rates and higher evidence of cognition and elaboration than did warnings with integrated neutral facial expressions or than did warnings with no integrated facial expressions, supporting our hypotheses. Study 3 explores the pattern of risk taking and analysis that users engage in when interacting with interruptive security messages. The corroboration of multiple behavioral dependent variables suggests that users predominantly use a bimodal risk tradeoff paradigm when interacting with interruptive security messages. All three studies address the overarching research question of understanding and improving end user adherence to security messages...|$|R
40|$|Folded-core {{sandwich}} structures have previously been proposed as lightweight, thin-plate building elements. Such structures typically use a Miura-type core pattern {{and have an}} efficient load transfer behaviour, however cannot be used for deployable structures as the <b>attachment</b> of <b>face</b> sheets suppresses any core kinematic behaviours. This limitation can be overcome with patterned face sheets that preserve rigid-foldability and form a layered meta-material, here termed a morphing sandwich structure. The relative performance of folded and morphing {{sandwich structures}} is unknown, with few studies on the structural behaviour of either configuration. The following paper uses a new digital fabrication methodology to manufacture folded and morphing beam prototypes from 0. 9 mm thick steel plate. These are subjected to experimental three point bending tests to assess force-displacement behaviour and failure modes. A numerical finite element analysis is conducted to simulate the failure behaviour of the experimental beams. It is seen that the morphing beam has a 44 % reduction in strength compared with the folded beam, thought to be attributable to face plate eccentricity and flexibility introduced by the morphing beam hinge connection detail...|$|R

This study aimed to determine how attachment theory, specifically the constructs of anxiety and avoidance, predict factors within face theory, specifically distancing, pursuing, and criticizing during a romantic conflict. Undergraduate participants (N = 306) completed a questionnaire measuring their attachment style as well as their preferred type of responses to hypothetical interpersonal conflicts with their significant other. Results indicated that avoidance is a significant predictor of distancer behaviors. Additionally, results expressed that anxiety is a significant predictor of distancing and pursuing behaviors.

The finding of 'adhesion pedestals', which represents a cellular {{response to the}} presence of the organism, is analogous to the response of intestinal cells to enteropathogenic E coli. Thus the development of bacterial attachment sites in H pylori associated gastritis might be an indication of pathogenicity. We have therefore explored the relationship between the proportion of organisms forming attachment sites and histological indices of disease 'activity'. Antral biopsies from 40 patients with H pylori positive gastritis were examined histologically and ultrastructurally, and the percentage of attached organisms compared with subjective assessments of epithelial degeneration, mucin depletion, polymorphonuclear and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. We found {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of attached bacteria in cases showing histological epithelial degeneration, and a significant decrease in cases showing intraepithelial polymorph infiltration. The direct relationship between bacterial attachment and cellular degeneration lends further support to a pathogenic effect.

40|$|Here we {{take the}} {{self-assembly}} of porphyrin molecules as an example to discover {{the reason for the}} diversity of assembled structures. The self-assembly is conducted at a range of pH conditions. Irregular, tubular, and rodlike particles are formed at pH 1. 5, 6. 5 and 12. 5, respectively. X-ray diffraction spectra and UV absorption show that these particles have the same crystalline structures, while the packing types of molecules are different. At low pH, the molecules assemble together by end to end attachment with a J-type aggregation, forming irregular particles. This assembly is dominated by the competition of pi-pi interaction and repulsion force. The latter force is induced by the protonation of molecules under acid conditions. With the increase of pH, the repulsion force is attenuated and finally disappears under basic conditions. The pi-pi interaction becomes the major force under basic conditions, leading to a H-type aggregation via <b>face</b> to <b>face</b> <b>attachment</b> and forming rodlike particles. At the middle pH, the competition disturbs the symmetry of molecules assembly, forming tubular particles. Together with previous studies, we expect that the compromise between competing interactions is probably the governing rule for the diversity of assembled structures...|$|R
40|$|Ziegler Natta (ZN) {{catalysts}} {{are often}} used to produce {{a wide range of}} polyolefins on an industrial scale. It has long been known that polymer produced on these catalysts consists of a relatively wide distribution in chain lengths; values for the Poly-Dispersity Index (PDI) are generally well above 2, the value that would be expected if a single catalyst site type were active. The prevailing view of site heterogeneity in ZN catalysts is reflected in their name: multi-site catalysts. ZN catalysts are conceptualised as containing a number of different active sites, which produce polymer with different average molecular weights [1]. Different molecular weights can result from differing propagation rates. More rapid chain propagation reactions produce longer polymer molecules; a variety of propagation rates will produce a range of chain lengths, leading to a broad chain length distribution. No physical explanation for the existence of different site types has been offered, except for some studies which have investigated different crystal <b>face</b> <b>attachments</b> for Ti active sites on MgCl 2 supports [2 - 4]; these studies do not explain why different propagation rates should exist.

However, this research suffered from methodological issues and has not been validated across ages. Employing a more ecologically valid paradigm to measure attentional processes by virtue of eye tracking, the current study tested the defensive exclusion hypothesis in late childhood. According to this hypothesis, insecurely attached children are assumed to defensively exclude attachment-related information. We hypothesized that securely attached children process attachment- related neutral and emotional information in a more open manner compared to insecurely attached children. Sixty-two children (59. 7 % girls, 8 â 12 years) completed two different tasks, while eye movements were recorded: task one presented an array of neutral faces including mother and unfamiliar women and task two presented the same with happy and angry faces. Results indicated that more securely attached children looked longer at motherâs face regardless of the emotional expression. Also, they tend to have more maintained attention to motherâs neutral <b>face.</b> Furthermore, more <b>attachment</b> avoidance was related to a reduced total viewing time of motherâs neutral, happy, and angry <b>face.</b> <b>Attachment</b> anxiety was not consistently related to the processing of motherâs face.

Theoretical and research evidence suggests that the enhancing of felt attachment security through security-priming may grant an individual access to effective emotion regulation strategies, which in turn may reduce attentional bias and associated abnormal neural activations. Trauma-survivors with elevated anxiety levels were randomised into an experimental group (secure attachment priming, n= 16) where they were primed using positive attachment-related pictures, or a neutral control priming condition (n= 18) where they viewed non attachment pictures of people. Participants then completed a dot-probe task to measure attentional bias to threat, and an emotionally threatening face-matching task to probe amygdala activation. No between groups differences were found on measures of attentional bias. Contrary to the hypothesis, participants in the security-priming group showed significantly greater amygdala activation in response to threatening <b>faces.</b> <b>Attachment</b> style was not found to moderate the impact of security-priming on attentional bias or neural activation.

5000|$|Attachment theory {{predicts that}} people high in {{attachment}} avoidance and people high in attachment anxiety would display different utilization {{of health care}} resources based on their prototypical behavioural responses when stressed. The theory predicts that people high in <b>attachment</b> avoidance, when <b>faced</b> with an illness, are likely to minimize their symptoms, and wait longer to see a health care provider, since they view their own distress {{as a sign of}} unacceptable vulnerability and also because their internal working model dictates that other people are not useful in helping them manage distress. For those high in attachment anxiety, they would have higher distress when faced with an illness, less perceived ability to manage it on their own, and thus visit health care services more frequently to try to attain security. For those with high anxiety and high avoidance, or fearful attachment, they would be predicted to present less frequently than those with secure attachment, but show up in a crisis when they do, which may interfere with optimal care. Research findings have generally been supportive of these predictions. One of the earliest studies in the field found correlations between preoccupied attachment and increased symptom reporting and an inverse relationship between avoidant attachment and visits to health professionals. High attachment anxiety has been associated with increased symptom reporting and visits to healthcare providers, and high attachment avoidance associated with less visits and decreased treatment compliance ...|$|R

(2008), Journal of Theoretical Biology, 253 : 74 - 89), by {{assuming}} that {{the walls of the}} microtubules are involved in cyclic compression/dilation equilibriums {{as a consequence of the}} cyclic curvature of the axoneme, it was proposed that the local adjustments of the spatial frequencies of both the dynein arms, and the Î²-tubulin monomers facing series, create the propagation of joint probability waves of interaction (JPI) between these two necessary partners. Modeling the occurrence of these probable interactions along the entire length of an axoneme between each outer doublet pairs (without programming any cooperative dialog between the molecular complexes) and the cyclic <b>attachment</b> of two <b>facing</b> partners, we show that the active couples such constituted are clustered. Along a cluster the dynein arms exhibit a small phase shift with respect to the order according to which they began each their cycle after being linked to a Î²-tubulin monomer. The numbers of couples included in these clusters depend on the probability of interaction between the dynein arms and the Î²-tubulin, on the location of the outer doublet pairs around the axonemal cylinder, and on the local bending of the axoneme; around the axonemal cylinder, the faster and larger the sliding, the shorter the clusters. This mechanism could be involved in the apparent cooperativity of the molecular motors and the Î²-tubulin monomers, since it is partially controlled by the local curvature, and the cluster length is inversely proportional to the sliding activity of the outer doublet pairs they link...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} cultural creativity in urban belonging. It explores some of the people, places and organisations involved in producing and consuming Bristol as a creative city, to show that this performance is a contingent achievement. Drawing on the performance practices of spoken word, scripted theatre and Carnival in Bristol, the thesis argues that this instability of cultural creativity is played out through a dynamic of order and disorder. This is illustrated through {{the manner in which}} four elements of creative practice take place in Bristol. Firstly, âmakingâ is shown to occur through an emergent order that produces and maintains unstable spaces for creativity in the city. Secondly, such spaces for creativity are worked through by âcirculatingâ pasts that can be both a constraining and a productive force in contemporary belongings. Thirdly, this ambiguity of attachments is played out through acts of âexpressingâ that both constitute and upset the subject. Fourthly, the âfragmentingâ of cultural activity is shown to be both product and producer of such precarious belonging. Taken together these creative movements point to the way culture is vital to building a social world from an individual one, but this is always a fragile construction. The ongoing necessity to belong, however fleetingly, must be balanced with the creative process of culture that is never straightforwardly affirmative. Cultureâs tendency towards disorder might be productive but it also results in uncertainty. Without the stability of roles or the continuity of practices, a recurring implication of the order/disorder tension is the attempt to govern culture, to limit the scope of its creativity. The thesis draws out the potential and the constraints of such contingency to work towards a cultural politics of creativity. The creative tension in culture illustrates how people continue to work to belong, how they maintain <b>attachments</b> in the <b>face</b> of uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Complete {{unilateral}} {{cleft lip}} and palate (UCLP) is a hereditary or multifactorial malformation {{that can be}} corrected successfully with a combined orthodontic, surgical and restorative treatment. Such multidisciplinary treatment takes many years and demands {{a lot of attention}} to both patients' teeth and periodontium. OBJECTIVES: This split-mouth study aimed to compare the periodontal health as well as the microbial parameters between cleft and non-cleft region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 75 patients (52 males, 23 females) between 8 and 20 years with a complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (before (n = 30), during (n = 34) and after (n = 11) the active orthodontic treatment) volunteered for this study. Four regions were defined for the split-mouth comparison: teeth neighbouring cleft (site 1), tooth in cleft (site 2), and the corresponding contra-lateral teeth, respectively, in the unaffected quadrants (sites 3 and 4). At all sites the following periodontal parameters were recorded: plaque and gingivitis indices, pocket depth, attachment loss, bleeding on probing, tooth mobility (visual and Periotest), radiographic bone loss and gingival width. In addition, three pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken (around tooth in cleft, teeth facing the cleft, and contra-lateral teeth of the latter). RESULTS: The differences between the teeth neighbouring the cleft and the corresponding contra-lateral opponents were of borderline significance (P <or= 0. 05) for the plaque index, the approximal probing depths and the <b>attachment</b> loss (teeth <b>facing</b> the cleft always had slightly higher parameters). When the tooth in the cleft was compared to the contra-lateral tooth, differences were only found for both the approximal probing depths, attachment loss and bone loss, which were significantly higher for the tooth in the cleft. The microbial analysis did not reveal differences between the different sites, neither in the proportion of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (differences < 0. 5 log), nor in the detection frequency of periopathogens. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the periodontium in UCLP patients can cope well with a long-term orthodontic treatment, even in unfavourable conditions (like absence of attached gingiva and poor oral hygiene). status: publishe...|$|R

People seek increased <b>attachment</b> in the <b>face</b> of danger. Adults, as well as children, may develop strong emotional ties with people who intermittently harass, beat, and, threaten them. The persistence of these attachment bonds leads to confusion of pain and love. Trauma can be repeated on behavioural, emotional, physiologic, and neuroendocrinologic levels. Repetition on these different levels causes a large variety of individual and social suffering.However, C-PTSD and BPD have been found by researchers to be completely distinctive disorders with incredibly different features - notably, C-PTSD is not a personality disorder - those who suffer do not fear abandonment, do not have unstable patterns of relations - rather they withdraw {{and they do not}} struggle with lack of empathy.There are distinct and notably large differences between Borderline and C-PTSD and while there are some similarities - predominantly in terms of issues with attachment (though this plays out in completely different ways) and trouble regulating strong emotional effect (often feel pain vividly), the disorders are completely different in nature - especially considering that C-PTSD is always a response to trauma rather than a personality disorder. In addition, C-PTSD is not a personality disorder - rather it is often a case of survival reactions to trauma becoming a fundamental aspect of the personality, in response to living with a personality disordered individual."While the individuals in the BPD reported many of the symptoms of PTSD and CPTSD, the BPD class was clearly distinct in its endorsement of symptoms unique to BPD. The RR ratios presented in Table 5 revealed that the following symptoms were highly indicative of placement in the BPD rather than the CPTSD class: (1) frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, (2) unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, (3) markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self, and (4) impulsiveness. Given the gravity of suicidal and self-injurious behaviors, {{it is important to note}} that there were also marked differences in the presence of suicidal and self-injurious behaviors with approximately 50% of individuals in the BPD class reporting this symptom but much fewer and an equivalent number doing so in the CPSD and PTSD classes (14.3 and 16.7%, respectively). The only BPD symptom that individuals in the BPD class did not differ from the CPTSD class was chronic feelings of emptiness, suggesting that in this sample, this symptom is not specific to either BPD or CPTSD and does not discriminate between them.""Overall, the findings indicate that there are several ways in which Complex PTSD and BPD differ, consistent with the proposed diagnostic formulation of CPTSD. BPD is characterized by fears of abandonment, unstable sense of self, unstable relationships with others, and impulsive and self-harming behaviors. In contrast, in CPTSD as in PTSD, there was little endorsement of items related to instability in self-representation or relationships. Self-concept is likely to be consistently negative and relational difficulties concern mostly avoidance of relationships and sense of alienation."In addition 25% of those diagnosed with BPD have no known history of childhood neglect or abuse and individuals are six times as likely to develop BPD if they have a relative who was so diagnosed compared to those who do not. One conclusion is that there is a genetic predisposition to BPD unrelated to trauma. Researchers conducting a longitudinal investigation of identical twins found that [...] "genetic factors play a major role in individual differences of borderline personality disorder features in Western society." [...] A 2014 study published in European Journal of Psychotraumatology was able to compare and contrast C-PTSD, PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder and found that it could distinguish between individual cases of each and when it was co-morbid, arguing for a case of separate diagnoses for each. BPD may be confused with C-PTSD by some without proper knowledge of the two conditions because those with BPD also tend to suffer from PTSD or to have some history of trauma.In Trauma and Recovery, Herman expresses the additional concern that patients who suffer from C-PTSD frequently risk being misunderstood as inherently 'dependent', 'masochistic', or 'self-defeating', comparing this attitude to the historical misdiagnosis of female hysteria. However, those who develop C-PTSD do so as a result of the intensity of the trauma bond - in which someone becomes tightly biolo-chemically bound to someone who abuses them (also known as Stockholm Syndrome - seen in cases of kidnapping in which a person falls in love with their captors) and the responses they learned to survive, navigate and deal with the abuse they suffered then become automatic responses, imbedded in their personality over the years of trauma - a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.|$|R
40|$|Lactose is {{the major}} {{carbohydrate}} in milk. The presence of lactose in whey constitutes a significant pollution problem for dairy factories. At the same time, there is an increasing market for high quality crystalline lactose. The main problem of lactose crystallisation, compared to sucrose, {{which is also a}} disaccharide, is that it is very slow, unpredictable and cannot easily be controlled. Compared to sucrose crystallisation, which has been extensively studied, lactose crystallisation lacks the fundamental research to identify the mechanisms of growth and effect of additives. An important difference from most other crystal growth systems is that ([alpha]-lactose hydrate crystals never grow from a pure environment; their growth environment always contains beta lactose. [alpha]-lactose monohydrate crystallises much more slowly {{because of the presence of}} [beta]- lactose in all solutions. Although there have been some studies on growth rates and the effect of additives, there has not been any reported work on the fundamentals of lactose crystallisation and the mechanisms that operate on the molecular level. The aim of this thesis is to gain a greater understanding at the fundamental processes, which occur at the molecular level during the crystallisation of lactose, in order to improve control at a macroscopic level. The growth rates of the dominant crystallographic faces have been measured in situ, at three temperatures and over a wide range of supersaturation. The mean growth rates of faces were proportional to the power of between 2. 5 - 3. 1 of the relative supersaturation. The rate constants and the activation energies were calculated for four faces. The [alpha]-lactose monohydrate crystals grown in aqueous solutions exhibited growth rate dispersion. Crystals of similar size displayed almost 10 fold difference in the growth rate grown under identical conditions for all the faces. Growth rate dispersion increases with increasing growth rate and supersaturation for all the faces. The variance in the GRD for the (0 10) face is twice the variance of the GRD of the (110) and (100) faces and ten times higher than the (0 11) face at different supersaturations and temperatures. The influence of [beta]-lactose on the morphology of [alpha]-lactose monohydrate crystals has been investigated by crystallising [alpha]-lactose monohydrate from supersaturated DMSO ethanol solutions. The slowness of mutarotation in DMSO allowed preparation of saturated solutions with a fixed, chosen [beta]-lactose content. It was found that [beta]-lactose significantly influences the morphology of [alpha]- lactose monohydrate crystals grown from DMSO solution. At low concentrations of [beta]-lactose, the fastest growing face is the (011) face resulting in long thin prismatic crystals. At higher [beta]-lactose concentrations, the main growth occurs in the b direction and the (020) face becomes the fastest growing face (since the (011) face is blocked by [beta]-lactose), producing pyramid and tomahawk shaped crystals. Molecular modeling was used to calculate morphologies of lactose crystals, thereby defining the surface energies of specific faces, and to calculate the energies of interactions between these faces and [beta]-lactose molecules. It was found that as the replacement energy of [beta]-lactose increased, the likelihood of [beta]-lactose to dock onto faces decreased and therefore the growth rate increased. The attachment energy of a new layer of [alpha]-lactose monohydrate to the faces containing [beta]-lactose was calculated for the (010) and (011) faces. For the (0 10) <b>face,</b> the <b>attachment</b> energy of a new layer was found to be lower than the attachment energy onto a pure lactose surface, meaning slower growth rates when [beta]-lactose was incorporated into the surface. For the (011) <b>face,</b> <b>attachment</b> energy calculations failed to predict the slower growth rates of this face in the presence of [beta]-lactose. AFM investigation of [alpha]-lactose monohydrate crystals produced very useful information about the surface characteristics of the different faces of the [alpha]-lactose monohydrate crystal. The growth of the (010) face of the crystal occurs by the lateral addition of growth layers. Steps are 2 nm high (unit cell height in the b direction) and emanate from double spirals, which usually occurred at the centre of the face. Double spirals rotate clockwise on the (010) face, while the direction of spirals is counterclockwise on the (010) face. A polygonised double spiral, showing anisotropy in the velocity of stepswas observed at the centre of the prism-shaped a-lactose monohydrate crystals grown in the presence of 5 and 10 % [beta]-lactose. The mean spacing of the steps parallel to the (011) face is larger than those parallel to the (100) face, indicating higher growth rates of the (011) face. The edge free energy of the (011) face is 6. 6 times larger than the (100) face in the presence of 5 % [beta]-lactose. Increase of [beta]-lactose content from 5 % to 10 % decreases the edge free energy of the growth unit on a step parallel to the (011) face by 10 %. Tomahawk-shaped [alpha]-lactose monohydrate crystals produced from aqueous solutions where the [beta]-lactose content of the growth solution is about 60 % have shown clockwise double spirals as the source of unit cell high steps on the (010) face of the crystal. However, the spirals are more circular than polygonised, unlike the prism shaped crystals and the mean step spacing of the (011) face is less than the steps parallel to the (110) face, indicating the growth rate reducing effect of [beta]-lactose on the (011) face. The (100) face of the [alpha]-lactose monohydrate crystal grows by step advancement in relative supersaturations of up to 3. 1. Steps are 0. 8 nm high and parallel to the c rection. Above this supersaturation, rectangular shaped two-dimensional nuclei, 10 nm high, were observed. The (011) face of the crystal grown at low supersaturations (s= 2. 1) displayed a very rough surface with no steps, covered by 4 - 10 nm high and 100 - 200 [micro]m wide formations. Triangular shaped macrosteps were observed when the crystal was grown in solutions with s= 3. 1. In situ AFM investigation of the (010) face (T = 20 [degree]C and s = 1. 18) has shown that growth occurs by lateral addition of growth units into steps emanated by double spirals. The growth rate of the (010) face from in situ AFM growth experiments was calculated to be 1. 25 gm/min. The growth rate of crystals grown in the in situ optical growth cell under identical conditions was 0. 69 pm/min. The difference in growth rates can be attributed to the size difference of seed c stals used. The (010) face of a [alpha]-lactosemonohydrate crystal grown at 22. 4 C and s= 1. 31 displayed triangular-shaped growth fronts parallel to the (011) face. The steps parallel to the (O 11) face grow in a triangular shape, and spaces between triangles are filled by growth units until the end of the macrosteps is reached. No such formations were observed on steps parallel to the (110) face. Formation of macrosteps, 4 - 6 nm high, emanating from another spiral present on the surface was also observed on the (010) face of a crystal grown under these conditions...|$|R
