500|$|Between the Times and the Tides {{sound was}} {{influenced}} by Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Leonard Cohen, as well as contemporary artists such as Cat Power. The title of the album comes from a lyric in the song [...] "Xtina <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> Her". Upon its release, Between the Times and the Times received positive critical acclaim and charted in four countries, including Belgium, France, Germany and the United States. Its two singles—"Off the Wall" [...] and [...] "Shouts"—were moderate critical successes but failed to chart. The album's release was followed by two tours of North America and Oceania from April to October 2012, which included appearances at various music festivals, including All Tomorrow's Parties I'll Be Your Mirror and the Melbourne International Arts Festival.|$|E
500|$|In 1912 Barrett was {{selected}} by Kenney to help run the WPSU national campaign, following the raid by police on Clement's Inn and Christabel Pankhurst's subsequent flight to Paris. Barrett moved back to London {{and within a few}} months she was given the role of assistant editor of the WSPU newspaper, The Suffragette, on its launch in October 1912. Writing in her autobiography Barrett described becoming an editor as [...] "an appalling task <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> nothing whatever of journalism". By taking on the job she also took on the risks connected with the increasingly militant WSPU. She travelled under cover to Paris to meet with Christabel Pankhurst, and when speaking to her on the phone she recalled how she [...] "could always hear the click of Scotland Yard listening in." ...|$|E

500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 2011, Between the Times and the Tides was {{announced}} for release through an online blog post by Matador Records.

It was released {{in a number of}} formats, including CD, LP, FLAC and MP3. Demo versions of [...] "Stranded", [...] "Shouts" [...] and [...] "Waiting on a Dream" [...] were included as bonus tracks on the iTunes version of the release. Two singles were released from the album: [...] "Off the Wall" [...] and [...] "Shouts". [...] "Off the Wall" [...] was released as a 7" [...] record and digital download package on January 14 and [...] "Shouts", which featured alternate mixes not found on the album, was released on May 8.|$|E
500|$|The Violin Concerto (1910) was {{commissioned}} by Fritz Kreisler, {{one of the leading}} international violinists of the time. Elgar wrote it during the summer of 1910, with occasional help from W. H. Reed, the leader of the London Symphony Orchestra, who helped the composer with advice on technical points. Elgar and Reed formed a firm friendship, which lasted for the rest of Elgar's life. Reed's biography, Elgar <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> Him (1936), records many details of Elgar's methods of composition. The work was presented by the Royal Philharmonic Society, with Kreisler and the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer. Reed recalled, [...] "the Concerto proved to be a complete triumph, the concert a brilliant and unforgettable occasion." [...] So great was the impact of the concerto that Kreisler's rival Eugène Ysaÿe spent much time with Elgar going through the work. There was great disappointment when contractual difficulties prevented Ysaÿe from playing it in London.|$|E

500|$|M.I.A. {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. In her own book, M.I.A. wrote regarding Wikileaks, [...] "So obviously I love Wikileaks because, after I’d gone through the whole backlash, {{they were the first}} news information site to confirm any news on the Sri Lankan war in the truest form; they were the first to release information stating the truth about {{what had happened to the}} Tamils <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it and to reveal that the United Nations was aware that the Sri Lankan government was lying—war crimes had been committed but their hands were tied because any time anyone tried to impose sanctions, governments would walk out. [...] I support Wikileaks because of that." [...] She composed the theme to Assange's television show The World Tomorrow and later stood by Assange's side as he held a press conference at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Assange was successfully granted political asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. [...] "I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch hunt against WikiLeaks," [...] Assange said at the press conference. She posted a photo of Assange from within the embassy, and later tweeted, [...] "hummmm after this day 2things have 2 happen....., either 500 cops turn up outside every rape case reported even if it's without charge. or we get raped by the powerz that be and we deal 4eva." [...] The tweets were in reference to an arrest warrant the Swedish Prosecutor's Office issued in August 2010 for Assange on two charges: rape and molestation. Earlier in 2012 Britain's Supreme Court denied an appeal by Assange to avoid extradition to Sweden to face these charges. In November 2013, Assange appeared via Skype to open M.I.A.'s New York City concert. Also, on 18 September 2014 Maya tweeted a link to a documentary on YouTube entitled [...] "The Internet's Own Boy: Aaron Swartz". The documentary is about the life of Aaron Swartz, who was a computer programmer, writer, political organiser and Internet hacktivist. In the same tweet Maya included a link and invitation to RSVP to a party to launch Julian Assange's new book [...] "When Google Met WikiLeaks".|$|E

2500|$|An {{account of}} Murdoch's {{life with a}} {{different}} ambition is given by A. N. Wilson in his 2003 book Iris Murdoch <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> Her. The work was described by Galen Strawson in The Guardian as [...] "mischievously revelatory" [...] and labelled by Wilson himself as an [...] "anti-biography". Wilson eschews objectivity, but is careful to stress his affection for his subject. Wilson remarks that Murdoch [...] "had clearly {{been one of those}} delightful young women... who was prepared {{to go to bed with}} almost anyone". [...] While Murdoch's thought is an inspiration for Conradi, Wilson treats Murdoch's philosophical work as at best a distraction. [...] In a BBC Radio 4 discussion of Murdoch and her work in 2009, Wilson stated his opinion, with which he acknowledged that [...] "no doctor would agree", that Murdoch's struggle to complete her late philosophical book, Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals, reduced her to despair and precipitated her into Alzheimer's.|$|E
