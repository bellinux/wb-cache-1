5|$|An {{individual}} {{identified as}} Mac Ragnaill (son of Ragnall) by the <b>annals</b> {{may have been}} Ragnall's son, though no name is given. In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick, but within a week {{he was killed by}} Matudán, Overking of Ulster. The <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but the <b>Annals</b> of Ulster call him a king. The <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters also suggests he and his fellow plunderers came from an island.|$|E

5|$|Whatever the {{circumstances}} of Domnall's accession, the Uí Chennselaig regime in Dublin was short-lived. The <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen, the <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, and the fifteenthsixteenth-century <b>Annals</b> of Ulster, all reveal that, within the year, Domnall died after a brief illness, with the latter two sources specifying that he succumbed after three nights of sickness. The <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen and the <b>Annals</b> of Ulster accord him the title King of Dublin, and make no mention of any connection with the Leinster kingship. Upon Domnall's demise, Toirdelbach had his own son, Muirchertach (died 1119), appointed King of Dublin. In so doing, Toirdelbach reinforced his authority in Dublin, and followed a precedent started by Domnall's grandfather, in which a claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland installed his own heir to the kingship of Dublin.|$|E

5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these <b>annals</b> were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified the chronology and content {{of some of the}} materials, and is thus chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that would otherwise have been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} his {{intrusion}} into the Islesperhaps in 1113 or 1114Domnall {{appears to have}} been either driven out by force, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Muirchertach's failing health. This would appear to have been about the point when Amlaíb mac Gofraid began his own forty-year reign in the Isles. The latter, who apparently spent a considerable part of his childhood at the court of Henry I, King of England (died 1135), may well have enjoyed the English king's assistance in assuming control of the Isles, and perhaps precipitated Domnall's departure. Whatever the cause for Domnall's return to Ireland, he certainly predeceased his rival uncle, and was killed by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1156), as the <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen, the sixteenth-century <b>Annals</b> of Loch Cé, the <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, the fourteenth-century <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach, and the <b>Annals</b> of Ulster, all report Domnall's death {{at the hands of the}} Connachta in 1115. In fact, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had invaded Thomond earlier that year, and the <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach elaborates that he had installed Domnall as King of Thomond at that point. This source further reveals that Domnall had afterwards turned against Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, who in turn invaded Thomond and had Domnall eliminated.|$|E

5|$|Surviving Pictish {{sources for}} the period are few, limited to king lists, the {{original}} of which was prepared in the early 720s, {{and a number of}} accounts relating to the foundation of St Andrews, then called Cennrígmonaid. Beyond Pictland, the principal sources are the Irish <b>annals,</b> of which the <b>Annals</b> of Ulster and the <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach are the most reliable. These include materials from an annal kept at the monastery of Iona in Scotland. Óengus and the Picts appear occasionally in Welsh sources, such as the Annales Cambriae, and more frequently in Northumbrian sources, of which the Continuation of Bede's chronicle and the Historia Regum Anglorum attributed to Symeon of Durham are the most important.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters {{records that}} Brian and Máel Sechnaill united their forces, and {{according}} to the <b>Annals</b> of Ulster, they met the Leinster-Dublin army at Glenmama on Thursday, 30 December 999. Glenmama, near Lyons Hill in County Kildare, was the ancient stronghold of the Kings of Leinster.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach {{states that}} Echmarcach succeeded Ímar. The <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters specifies that Ímar was driven from the kingship by Echmarcach, {{who was then}} elected king by the Dubliners. After this point in Ímar's life, all that is known for certain is that he died in 1054, as recorded by the <b>Annals</b> of Ulster and the sixteenth-century <b>Annals</b> of Loch Cé. Nevertheless, since these sources style Ímar in Gaelic rí Gall ("king of the foreigners"), there may be evidence to suggest that, when Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072) drove Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, Diarmait reinstalled Ímar as king.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources for}} Áedán's life include Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; Irish <b>annals,</b> principally the <b>Annals</b> of Ulster and the <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach; and Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba. The Senchus fer n-Alban, a census and {{genealogy}} of Dál Riata, purports to record his ancestry {{and that of}} his immediate descendants. None of these sources are contemporary. Adomnán's work was written in the very late 7th century, probably to mark the centenary of Columba's death. It incorporates elements from a lost earlier life of Columba, De virtutibus sancti Columbae, by Cumméne Find. This may have been written as early as 640; neither the elements incorporated from Cumméne's work nor Adomnán's own writings can be treated as simple history. Bede's history was written 30 years after Adomnán's. The surviving Irish <b>annals</b> contain elements of a chronicle kept at Iona {{from the middle of the}} 7th century onwards, so that these too are retrospective when dealing with Áedán's time.|$|E

5|$|Ímar was {{probably}} the son of Aralt mac Amlaíb (died 999), a man whose death at the Battle of Glenn Máma is recorded by the seventeenth-century texts <b>Annals</b> of Clonmacnoise and <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, the fifteenth–sixteenth-century <b>Annals</b> of Ulster, and the twelfth-century Chronicon Scotorum. If this identification is correct, Ímar's paternal grandfather would have been Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Northumbria and Dublin (died 980/981), and a paternal uncle of Ímar would have been Sitriuc mac Amlaíb, King of Dublin (died 1042).|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the longer version of the <b>Annals</b> of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the <b>Annals</b> of Einsiedeln.

The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a dinner on the pretext of negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him. Kristó and other Hungarian historians argue that the dual leadership over the Hungarians ended with Kurszán's death.|$|E

5|$|Even before Diarmait's demise, the Uí Chennselaig {{began to}} fight amongst {{themselves}} in a struggle that was almost certainly an after-effect of Diarmait's sons' untimely deaths. Specifically, the seventeenth-century <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, and the eleventhfourteenth-century <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen reveal that Domnall battled {{against the forces of}} his own first cousin once removed, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair (died 1089), before Diarmait's ally, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086), was able to intervene and restore order in the Kingdom of Leinster.|$|E

5|$|In 1052, Diarmait drove Echmarcach from Dublin. The {{event is}} {{documented}} by the <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, the <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach, the <b>Annals</b> of Ulster, and Chronicon Scotorum. These annalistic accounts indicate that, although Diarmait's conquest evidently {{began with a}} mere raid upon Fine Gall, this action further escalated into the seizure of Dublin itself. Following several skirmishes fought around the town's central fortress, the aforesaid accounts report that Echmarcach fled overseas, whereupon Diarmait assumed the kingship. With Diarmait's conquest, Norse-Gaelic Dublin ceased to be an independent power in Ireland; and when Diarmait and his son, Murchad, died about twenty years later, Irish rule had been exercised over Fine Gall and Dublin in a degree unheard of before. In consequence of Echmarcach's expulsion, Dublin effectively became the provincial capital of Leinster, with the town's remarkable wealth and military power at Diarmait's disposal.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} that some biographical—or autobiographical—texts are important historical documents. For example, the biographical stelas of military generals in tomb chapels built under Thutmose III provide {{much of the}} information known about the wars in Syria and Palestine. However, the <b>annals</b> of Thutmose III, carved into the walls of several monuments built during his reign, such as those at Karnak, also preserve information about these campaigns. The <b>annals</b> of Ramesses II (r. 1279–1213 BC), recounting the Battle of Kadesh against the Hittites include, {{for the first time in}} Egyptian literature, a narrative epic poem, distinguished from all earlier poetry, which served to celebrate and instruct.|$|E

5|$|According to the seventeenth-century <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, he {{had secured}} the {{cooperation}} of Dublin, and perhaps gained the kingship of the town itself, through a stipend of 4,000 cows. In consequence, Dubliners formed part of Ua Conchobair's forces when he marched to Drogheda and Leinster, where he forced the submissions of the kings of Airgialla and Leinster respectively. In fact, Dublin appears to have formed {{a key part of}} Ua Conchobair's arsenal, and it is apparent that Mac Murchada was doomed without the support of this coastal-kingdom. Certainly, the twelfth–thirteenth-century La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande relates that Ascall ("MacTurkyl de Diveline") had abandoned his former overlord, and the eleventh–fourteenth-century <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen specify that Mac Murchada was only expulsed from Ireland after the Leinstermen and Dubliners had turned against him. Although Ua Conchobair appears to have allowed Mac Murchada to retain his patrimonial lordship of Uí Chennselaig, the <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters reveals that the Leinstermen and Dubliners assisted Tigernán Ua Ruairc, King of Bréifne (died 1172) in forcing Mac Murchada from this final vestige of authority and into exile.|$|E

The Chronicle grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.|$|E
