5|$|Although in most {{countries}} English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. In {{the countries of the}} EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E

Hardie, {{who was in a}} bookmakers {{at the time of the}} call, {{suggests}} that Bulloch and Paul Savage continue mixing the song, and says he will try to contact Braithwaite. This ends at (7:04), leaving the sound of ambient guitar noise to fade out and end the song.|$|E
5|$|Many {{users of}} English in the {{expanding}} circle {{use it to}} communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English. Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties. Very often today <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> English {{anywhere in the world}} may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.|$|E

Principal photography began on 22 February 2011 and continued until late February 2012. Makuta VFX and Annapurna Studios oversaw Eega visual effects and digital intermediate process, respectively.|$|E

Neto is sedated by a nurse before receiving the diagnosis of Dr. Cintra. When he wakes up, Neto encounters Ceará, a hyperactive man, and finds out the hospital is decaying and careless. He also meets Rogério, an injectable drugs user committed by his family, who tells him {{it is impossible to}} escape and that if he were to try he would be drugged with haloperidol or electrocuted. Rogério also tells him not to consume the medications administered by nurses because it awakes the appetite in order to make patients look healthier. Meanwhile, Cintra has <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> which he discusses that if necessary he could easily admit more people, mostly homeless, to avoid losing the government subsidy.|$|E

Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him time to do it, and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.|$|E

Holdridge filed for defamation of character, claiming Rankin had slandered him in comments made to a reporter in a Congressional cloakroom during 1946. A Federal District judge ruled against Holdridge, saying that such <b>a</b> <b>conversation,</b> <b>in</b> person, and within the Capitol building, was immune to lawsuit.|$|E

He stated that a mix-up resulted in the marijuana not being removed and subsequently being transported to Indonesia, all without Corby's knowledge. He refused to name the man who he claimed planted the drugs. The prosecution pointed out that his evidence was entirely hearsay and that he was facing trial for several serious offences in Australia. In the Australian media, Vigenser strongly denied any connection with the drugs and reportedly gave a statement to the Australian Federal Police.|$|E
25|$|The {{desire to}} offer {{children}} a lower-pressure educational experience in an English-speaking country, {{as well as}} a cleaner environment, is a major motivation for Korean migration to New Zealand. Of the 7,696 Koreans pursuing secondary or tertiary education in New Zealand as of 2001, 50% were studying in English as a second language courses. 1.5 generation Koreans who migrated at a young age show a marked shift towards English regardless of which region their parents settled in, but among those who migrated at the age of 16 or older, Wellington residents also showed a much stronger preference for English, while those in other regions maintained Korean as their preferred language. In the 1996 census, 40.7% of Koreans stated that they could not hold <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> English, the highest proportion for any group; however, by the 2001 census, that figure had decreased to 21% for males and 27% for females.|$|E
