40|$|Two {{techniques}} for retrieving the slope and intercept parameters of an assumed exponential raindrop size distribution (RSD), vertical air velocity, and <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> <b>precipitation</b> and water vapor in light stratiform rain using observations by airborne, nadir looking dual-wavelength (X-band, 3. 2 cm and W-band, 3. 2 mm) radars are presented. In both techniques, the slope parameter of the RSD and the vertical air velocity are retrieved using only the mean Doppler velocities {{at the two}} wavelengths. In the first method, the intercept of the RSD is estimated from the observed reflectivity at the longer wavelength assuming no attenuation at that wavelength. The attenuation of the shorter wavelength radiation by precipitation and water vapor are retrieved using the observed reflectivity at the shorter wavelength. In the second technique, {{it is assumed that}} the longer wavelength suffers attenuation only in the melting band. Then, assuming a distribution of water vapor, the melting band attenuation at both wavelengths and the rain attenuation at the shorter wavelength are retrieved. Results of the retrievals are discussed and several physically meaningful results are presented...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} benefits of using simulated spatially-correlated fields of tropospheric attenuation to predict the joint attenuation probability distributions underpinning the analysis of a site diversity system. The attenuation field is obtained by first combining three-dimensional rain rate and cloud fields so as to maintain their spatial correlation, and afterwards by simulating {{the interaction of the}} wireless system with the complete atmospheric environment. This approach allows a “real-time” combination of the <b>attenuation</b> induced <b>by</b> <b>precipitation</b> and clouds (in contrast to the summation of such contributions on statistical basis as currently recommended by ITU-R) which increases the model’s prediction accuracy and reliability. The paper investigates the gain achievable by multiple-site diversity schemes operating in the Ka and Q bands, for which the impairments due to clouds (not captured by the current ITU-R framework) become more important, in terms of required system wide margins and resulting link spectral efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This study proposes an {{alternative}} methodology to obtain high-resolution radar reflectivity composites {{based on a}} variational approach considering different error sources in an explicit manner. The methodology retrieves the 3 -dimensional precipitation field most compatible with the observations from the different radars of the network. With this aim, the methodology uses a model that simulates the radar sampling of the atmosphere. The model settings are different for each radar and include features such as the radar location, hardware parameters (beam width, pulse length…) and the scan strategy. The methodology follows {{the concept of an}} inverse method based on the minimization of a cost function that penalizes discrepancies between the simulated and actual observations for each radar. The simulation model is able to reproduce the effect of beam broadening with the distance and <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> intense <b>precipitation.</b> The methodology has been applied on two radars close to Barcelona (Spain).

40|$|Measuring rain rates over complex {{terrain is}} afflicted with large {{uncertainties}} because rain gauges {{are influenced by}} orography and weather radars are mostly not able to look into mountain valleys. We apply a new method to estimate near surface rain rates exploiting attenuation data from commercial microwave links in the alpine region of Southern Germany. Received signal level (RSL) data is recorded minutely with small data loggers at the towers and then sent to a database server via GSM. Due to the large RSL fluctuations in periods without rain, the determination of <b>attenuation</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>precipitation</b> is not straightforward. To be able to continuously process the RSL data from July 2010 to October 2010, we introduce a new method to detect wet and dry periods using spectral time series analysis. We show the performance and limitations of the method and analyse the derived rain rates compared to rain gauge and weather radar measurements. The resulting correlations differ for different links and reach values of R 2 = 0. 80 for the link-gauge comparison and R 2 = 0. 84 for the link-radar comparison...|$|R
50|$|The cloud {{must develop}} {{to a certain}} {{vertical}} extent before lightning is produced, so generally weather radar will indicate a developing storm before a lightning detector does. It is not always clear from early returns if a shower cloud will develop into a thunderstorm, and weather radar also sometimes suffers from a masking effect <b>by</b> <b>attenuation,</b> where <b>precipitation</b> close to the radar can hide (perhaps more intense) precipitation further away. Lightning detectors do not suffer from a masking effect and can provide confirmation when a shower cloud {{has evolved into a}} thunderstorm.|$|R
40|$|For space-borne SAR systems {{operating}} in X-band and beyond, the propagation media along the propagation path may distort SAR measurements. In {{order to meet}} the high demand on radiometric accuracy, tropospheric attenuation effects have {{to be taken into account}} during the external calibration procedure. Especially in X-band it is well known that the <b>attenuation</b> caused <b>by</b> heavy <b>precipitation</b> events may reach values up to about 30 dB. In this contribution it is shown how the calibration of SAR-systems is influenced <b>by</b> weather (<b>precipitation)</b> and how the radiometric accuracy can be improved by taking the atmospheric conditions into account. A concept is introduced that has been applied during the commissioning phase of the German TerraSAR-X satellite. By acquiring simultaneously ground-based weather radar data and the SAR acquisitions it was possible to flag affected SAR images and to exclude them from the procedure to derive the absolute calibration factor. Thus, the precision of calibrating TerraSAR-X could be improved yielding a high radiometric accuracy of 0. 31 dB in strip-map mode acquisition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> {{a human body}} and trees as well as {{material}} penetration loss at 26 and 39 [*]GHz by measurements and theoretical modeling work. The measurements were carried out at a large restaurant and a university campus by using a time domain channel sounder. Meanwhile, the knife-edge (KE) model and one-cylinder and two-cylinder models based on uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) are applied to model {{the shape of a}} human body and predict its attenuation in theory. The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and its modified models are used to predict the <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> trees. The results show that the upper bound of the KE model is better to predict the <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> a human body compared with UTD one-cylinder and two-cylinder models at both 26 and 39 [*]GHz.

This dataset provides a multi-wavelength look at the evolution of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> dust, and here we compare a traditional measure of dust attenuation (L(TIR) /L(FUV)) to a diagnostic based on a recently-developed robust star formation rate (SFR) indicator, [H-alpha_obs+ 24 -micron]/H-alpha_obs. With such data over multiple epochs, the evolution in the <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> dust with redshift can be assessed.
