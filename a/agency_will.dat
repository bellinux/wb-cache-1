5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} roams Pacific City, {{systematically}} eliminating the leaders and subordinates {{of the three}} gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free. Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: the Agency had secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for the Agency to control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that the <b>Agency</b> <b>will</b> replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order.|$|E

25|$|The Reconstruction Agency was {{established}} to replace the Reconstruction Headquarters {{in response to the}} Great East Japan earthquake, created on June 24, 2011. The Reconstruction Agency is headed by the Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. Noda was named direct head of the agency in an effort to strengthen the leadership of the organization. Tatsuo Hirano, a native of Iwate Prefecture, served as the agency's first Minister of State for Disaster Management until he was replaced by Osamu Fujimura on June 4, 2012. The Reconstruction Agency is not a Cabinet Office, but will have authority over other government ministries. The <b>agency</b> <b>will</b> exist for ten years, the length of time estimated to fully restore the region after the disaster, and be dissolved on March 3, 2021. A wooden tablet for the new agency was made from materials from the earthquake zone. Prime Minister Noda placed the tablet at the Akasaka Agency headquarters as a reminder of the responsibility to residents of the disaster-hit regions.|$|E

On February 15, 2017, Time Warner shareholders approved the merger, which is still pending regulatory approval. On February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his <b>agency</b> <b>will</b> not review the deal, leaving the review to the US Department of Justice. On March 15, 2017, the merger, which is still pending approval from U.S. regulators, was approved by the European Commission. On August 22, 2017, the merger was approved by Mexican authorities. On September 5, 2017, the merger was approved by Chilean authorities. US is the last country needed for its approval as Brazil approved the merger. On October 23, 2017, the deadline was extended {{for a short period of}} time to finalize the deal. The original deadline was on Oct. 22.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent <b>agency</b> <b>will</b> administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E
500|$|Information {{provided}} by Canadian residents to the Canada Revenue <b>Agency</b> <b>will</b> only {{be shared with}} Elections Canada if the resident consents to such a transfer in their income tax and benefits return.

Bill C-31 introduced {{an amendment to the}} Act to ensure that tax filers consenting to their personal information being included in the National Register of Electors are Canadian citizens; before this change, it was possible for non-citizen taxpayers to consent, and thus be included in the National Register of Electors, despite not being an eligible elector.|$|E

500|$|On August 2, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit {{issued its}} ruling on the Hours of Service {{litigation}} {{brought by the}} American Trucking Associations and Public Citizen. The Court upheld the 2011 Hours of Service regulations in all aspects except for the 30-minute break provision {{as it applies to}} short haul drivers. While the decision does not officially take effect until the mandate is issued 52 days after the decision (unless a party files a petition for rehearing, either by the panel or en banc, or moves to stay the mandate pending the filing of a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court), FMCSA announces the <b>Agency</b> <b>will</b> immediately cease enforcement of the 30-minute rest break provision of the HOS rule against short-haul operations.|$|E
500|$|On March 4, 2010, the Chemetco {{site was}} added to the Superfund National Priorities List because of the lead, cadmium and zinc {{contamination}} at the site and of nearby wetlands and Long Lake. [...] The lack of available resources at the bankrupt Chemetco or at the State of Illinois necessitated proposal of this site to the National Priorities List (NPL). [...] This will enable the use of Federal funds to build a CERCLA enforcement case and ensure clean up the site. [...] The U.S. Environmental Protection <b>Agency</b> <b>will</b> oversee the clean up of the site and affected areas. [...] After the site was listed on the NPL, U.S. EPA, with the support of Illinois EPA, began the search for potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who may be liable for the clean up. [...] In November 2011, U.S. EPA issued a General Notice of potential liability to a group of PRPs, and is currently working with a subgroup of them. [...] U.S. EPA plans to negotiate a settlement with PRPs for performance of the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the site, which will define {{the nature and extent of}} contamination associated with the site and present options for the long-term remediation of affected areas. [...] Upon completion of the RI/FS Report, U.S. EPA will select a remedy for the site, with input from the community and stakeholders.|$|E
500|$|... "In Congress, {{there was}} little doubt that homosexuals did not belong in {{sensitive}} government positions." [...] Since the late 1940s, the government had been dismissing about five homosexuals a month from civilian posts; by 1954, the number had grown twelve-fold. [...] "Mixed in with the hysterics were some logic, though: homosexuals faced condemnation and discrimination, and most of them—wishing to conceal their orientation—were vulnerable to blackmail." [...] DCI Roscoe Hillenkoetter was called to Congress to testify on homosexuals being employed at the CIA. He said, [...] "The use of homosexuals as a control mechanism over individuals recruited for espionage is a generally accepted technique which has been used at least on a limited basis for many years." [...] As soon as the DCI said these words, his aide signaled to take {{the remainder of the}} DCI's testimony off the record. Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter's notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: [...] "While this <b>agency</b> <b>will</b> never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. I am certain that if Josef Stalin or a member of the Politburo or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business." [...] The Senators reluctantly agreed the CIA had to be flexible.|$|E
