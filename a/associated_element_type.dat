30|$|Now we {{will define}} (XML) <b>element</b> <b>types,</b> {{following}} the established type system T _reg over B. In order to distinguish tags used in T _reg from element tags we will suppose for each tag {{used in the}} elementary types tag:T or tag: {{the existence of the}} TAG name denoting an <b>associate</b> <b>element</b> <b>type</b> 10. The same holds for any tag ∈ NAME. Thus, NAME contains both tags and TAGs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new framework for users to select relevant data from an XML document and store {{it in an}} existing relational database, as opposed to previous approaches that shred the entire XML document into a newly created database of a newly designed schema. The framework {{is based on a}} notion of XML 2 DB mappings. An XML 2 DB mapping extends a (possibly recursive) DTD by <b>associating</b> <b>element</b> <b>types</b> with semantic attributes and rules. It extracts either part or all of the data from an XML document, and generates SQL updates to increment an existing database using the XML data. We also provide an efficient technique to evaluate XML 2 DB mappings in parallel with SAX parsing. These yield a systematic method to selectively store XML data in an existing database. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for integrating data from multiple relational sources into an XML document that both conforms to a given DTD and satisfies predefined XML constraints. The framework {{is based on a}} specification language, AIG, that extends a DTD by (1) <b>associating</b> <b>element</b> <b>types</b> with semantic attributes (inherited and synthesized, inspired by the corresponding notions from Attribute Grammars), (2) computing these attributes via parameterized SQL queries over multiple data sources, and (3) incorporating XML keys and inclusion constraints. The novelty of AIG consists in semantic attributes and their dependency relations for controlling context-dependent, DTD-directed construction of XML documents, as well as for checking XML constraints in parallel with document-generation. We also present cost-based optimization techniques for efficiently evaluating AIGs, including algorithms for merging queries and for scheduling queries on multiple data sources. This provides a new grammar-based approach for data integration under both syntactic and semantic constraints. 1...|$|R

50|$|An HTML {{attribute}} is a modifier of an HTML <b>element</b> <b>type.</b> An attribute either modifies {{the default}} functionality of an <b>element</b> <b>type</b> or provides functionality to certain <b>element</b> <b>types</b> unable to function correctly without them.

40|$|Initial {{modeling}} of LOX-Methane reaction control (RCE) 100 lbf thrusters and larger, 5500 lbf thrusters with the TDK/VIPER code has shown good agreement with sea-level and altitude test data. However, the vaporization and zonal mixing upstream of the compressible flow {{stage of the}} models leveraged empirical trends to match the sea-level data. This was necessary {{in part because the}} codes are designed primarily to handle the compressible part of the flow (i. e. contraction through expansion) and in part because there was limited data on the thrusters themselves on which to base a rigorous model. A more rigorous model has been developed which includes detailed vaporization trends based on <b>element</b> <b>type</b> and geometry, radial variations in mixture ratio within each of the "zones" <b>associated</b> with <b>elements</b> and not just between zones of different <b>element</b> <b>types,</b> and, to the extent possible, updated kinetic rates. The Spray Combustion Analysis Program (SCAP) was leveraged to support assumptions in the vaporization trends. Data of both thrusters is revisited and the model maintains a good predictive capability while addressing some of the major limitations of the previous version...|$|R
