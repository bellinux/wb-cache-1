5|$|About a month <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> concluded, reports began {{surfacing}} which {{stated that}} Giro director Angelo Zomegnan {{was going to}} be ousted from that position.

A further month later, RCS Sport, owners of the race, confirmed that Zomegnan had been removed from his largely autocratic position as race director. He was replaced by RCS general director Michele Acquarone and Mauro Vegni, along with a team of former professional riders. Zomegnan remains as an RCS consultant and director of the 2013 UCI Road World Championships in Florence. Zomegnan had held the position since 2004, beginning with the 2005 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
