50|$|Saparman Sodimejo, known more {{commonly}} as Mbah Gotho (died 30 April 2017) was an Indonesian Christian man who unverifiably {{claimed to be}} the oldest person ever recorded. In May 2010, Solopos reported that enumerators of that year's census had recorded his <b>age</b> <b>next</b> <b>birthday</b> as 142, which would have made him 19 years older than the official oldest recorded person, Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997. A heavy smoker throughout his life, he outlived ten siblings, four wives and all five of his children. The Liputan 6 website reported that Mbah Gotho's estimated age was 140, and that he could not remember his date of birth but claimed to remember the construction of a sugar factory built in Sragen in 1880.|$|E

5000|$|Absolute {{warranties}} {{provide a}} specific or express {{indication of what}} is required of the insured, who must comply exactly; if he does not, breach of the warranty will occur. “Substantial performance” is not enough; there must be exact performance. In Jordan v New Zealand Insurance, for example, the plaintiff had stated, in the proposal form for the insurance of a motor car, his <b>age</b> at his <b>next</b> <b>birthday</b> as twenty-two, when in fact it would be twenty-three. The court held {{that there was no}} room for the contention that the incorrectness of the answer was not material; nor was there any room for the application of the doctrine of [...] "substantial performance" [...] in considering the truthfulness or otherwise of the answers.|$|R
5000|$|The strict common-law approach, which {{requires}} exact performance of an undertaking {{that has not}} necessarily been established as a “material” aspect of the contract (and risk assessment), and entitles the insurer to cancel a contract {{on the basis of}} a breach of warranty despite the fact that the representation complained of concerns an immaterial inaccuracy, or a matter with no bearing at all on the risk insured against, has led to absurd results in some cases. Jordan v New Zealand, discussed above, is one such example: Jordan stated that his <b>age</b> at his <b>next</b> <b>birthday</b> would be twenty-two, whereas in fact it would be twenty-three. Since this statement was warranted, the insurer was entitled to repudiate liability, in spite of what most would regard as the immateriality of the inaccuracy, and where, in fact, it [...] "was actually to the advantage of the insurer." ...|$|R
25|$|Kyaw Nyein's date of 1910 can be {{considered}} as the more plausible date. First, Kyaw Nyein had access to historical records and he interviewed many surviving members of the Thirty Comrades when he wrote the book in the mid-to late 1990s. (Ne Win was one of the Thirty Comrades who secretly went to undergo military training in Japanese-occupied Hainan Island in the early 1940s for the purpose of fighting for independence from the British). In his book published around 1998, Kyaw Nyein lists the names of the surviving members of the Thirty Comrades whom he had interviewed, although Ne Win was not one of them.) Secondly, when Ne Win died on 5 December 2002, the Burmese language newspapers that were allowed to carry a paid obituary stated the age of 'U Ne Win' to be '93 years'. According to Burmese custom, a person's age is their <b>age</b> upon their <b>next</b> <b>birthday.</b> Since Ne Win turned 92 in July 2002, when he died in December 2002 he was considered to be 93 years old. Most Western news agencies, based on the May 1911 birth date, reported that Ne Win was 91 years old, but the obituary put up by his family (most probably his children) stated that he was 93 years old, which most likely stems from East Asian age reckoning.|$|R

50|$|Data for cycle 1 were {{collected}} from October 2011 through February 2012. The sample design consisted of a single-mode mail survey, with two methods of respondent selection: the All Adult method and the <b>Next</b> <b>Birthday</b> method. The sampling consisted of a two-stage stratified sample of addresses used by Marketing Systems Group (MSG). In the All Adult method, two questionnaires were sent with each mailing, where all adults residing in a sampled household {{were asked to complete}} the questionnaire. In the <b>next</b> <b>birthday</b> method, one questionnaire was sent with each mailing so that the adult who would have the <b>next</b> <b>birthday</b> in the sampled household was asked to complete the questionnaire. Data {{were collected}} from 3,959 respondents. The methodology report, complete data set and the survey instruments are available on the HINTS website.|$|R

Sephy tells Jude that he would be doing her a favour by killing her and wants to die because she misses Callum.

6000|$|No. Coketown did {{not come}} out of its own furnaces, in all respects like gold that had stood the fire. First, the perplexing mystery of the place was, Who belonged to the {{eighteen}} denominations? Because, whoever did, the labouring people did not. It was very strange {{to walk through the}} streets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of them the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away from their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of their own streets, where they lounged listlessly, gazing at all the church and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern. Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this, because there was a native organization in Coketown itself, whose members were to be heard of in the House of Commons every session, indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main force. Then came the Teetotal Society, who complained that these same people would get drunk, and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk, and proved at tea parties that no inducement, human or Divine (except a medal), would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk. Then came the chemist and druggist, with other tabular statements, showing that when they didn't get drunk, they took opium. Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail, with more tabular statements, outdoing all the previous tabular statements, and showing that the same people would resort to low haunts, hidden from the public eye, where they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap joined in it; and where A. B., <b>aged</b> twenty-four <b>next</b> <b>birthday,</b> and committed for eighteen months' solitary, had himself said (not that he had ever shown himself particularly worthy of belief) his ruin began, as he was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise {{he would have been a}} tip-top moral specimen. Then came Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby, the two gentlemen at this present moment walking through Coketown, and both eminently practical, who could, on occasion, furnish more tabular statements derived from their own personal experience, and illustrated by cases they had known and seen, from which it clearly appeared - in short, it was the only clear thing in the case - that these same people were a bad lot altogether, gentlemen; that do what you would for them they were never thankful for it, gentlemen; that they were restless, gentlemen; that they never knew what they wanted; that they lived upon the best, and bought fresh butter; and insisted on Mocha coffee, and rejected all but prime parts of meat, and yet were eternally dissatisfied and unmanageable.
