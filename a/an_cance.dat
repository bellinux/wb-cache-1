Human prospective and retrospective studies strongly indicate that beta-carotene protects against lung cancer and probably against stomach cancer.

40|$|The TERT-CLPTM 1 L {{region of}} {{chromosome}} 5 p 15. 33 is a multi-cancer susceptibility locus that encodes the reverse transcriptase subunit, hTERT, of the telomerase enzyme. Numer-ous cancer-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs 10069690, {{have been identified}} within the hTERT gene. The minor allele (A) at rs 10069690 creates an additional splice donor site in intron 4 of hTERT, and is associated with an elevated risk of multiple cancers including breast and ovarian carcinomas. We previously demonstrated {{that the presence of}} this allele resulted in co-production of full length (FL) -hTERT and an al-ternatively spliced, INS 1 b, transcript. INS 1 b does not encode the reverse transcriptase do-main required for telomerase enzyme activity, but we show here that INS 1 b protein retains its ability to bind to the telomerase RNA subunit, hTR. We also show that INS 1 b expression results in decreased telomerase activity, telomere shortening, and an increased telomere-specific DNA damage response (DDR).

40|$|Mouse {{embryonic}} stem (ES) cells are endowed with four unusual properties. They are exceedingly small, exhibiting an intra-cellular volume {{two to three}} orders of magnitude smaller than that of normal mammalian cells. Their rate of cell division, wherein cell doubling takes place in only 4 – 5 h, is more rapid than even the fastest growing cancer cell lines. They do not senesce. Finally, mouse ES cells retain pluripotency adequate to give rise to all cell types present in either gender of adult mice. We have investigated whether {{some or all of}} these unusual features might relate to the possibility that mouse ES cells exist in a specialized metabolic state. By evaluating the abundance of common metabolites {{as a function of the}} conversion of mouse ES cells into differentiated embryoid bodies, it was observed that the most radical changes in metabolite abundance related to cellular building blocks associated with one carbon metabolism. These observations led to the discovery that mouse ES cells use the threonine dehydrogenase (TDH) enzyme to convert threonine into acetyl-coenzyme A and glycine, thereby facilitating consumption of threonine as a metabolic fuel. Here we describe the results of a combination of nutritional and pharmacological studies, providing evidence that mouse ES cells are critically dependent on both threonine and the TDH enzyme for growth and viability. All types of living cells are endowed with regulatory capabilities that facilitate adaptation to environmental fluctuation and its associated uncertainty. When <b>a</b> <b>cance...</b>|$|R

By using logistic regression, the authors analyzed family history, as reported by 429, 483 women enrolled in 1959, relative to subsequent mortality through 1972 from cancer within and across multiple sites. The associations between family history and cancer mortality were generally stronger within cancer sites than across cancer sites. Within-site associations were found for breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 9), colorectal cancer (OR = 1. 6), stomach cancer (OR = 1. 9), and lung cancer (OR = 1. 7). Across-site associations were observed for a family history of 1) breast cancer as a risk factor for ovarian cancer mortality (OR = 1. 6), 2) stomach cancer as a risk factor for ovarian cancer mortality (OR = 1. 5), and 3) uterine cancer as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer mortality (OR = 1. 6). A general pattern of positive associations was observed between a family history of cancer at several sites and subsequent death from pancreatic cancer.

The link between P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane transporter, and cell volume regulation is controversial, and changes in cells volume are measured using microscopy or electrophysiology.

We hypothesized that the repair of MMC adducts in DNA might be inhibited by dFdCyd leading to a synergistic eect. To test this possibility, we studied the eect of combining dFdCyd and MMC in HT 29 human colon carcinoma cells in vitro. The cells were exposed to a variety of drug concentration ratios and schedules, then assessed for clonogenic survival. D 50 values (drug concentration at which clonogenicity is inhibited by 50 %) were calculated, and the interactive eects of the two drugs were evaluated using median eect analysis. In this approach, if the calculated com-bination index (CI) is 1, it indicates syner-gism, additivity, or antagonism, respectively (Chou and Talalay 1984). We found that marked synergy (CI of 0. 5 – 0. 7) was produced by concurrent exposure to mito-mycin and gemcitabine. In contrast, sequential treat-ment led only to additivity. These findings suggest that, when combined in an appropriate schedule, the chemo-sensitizing eect of gemcitabine may be beneficial in the treatment of malignancies which are sensitive to MMC.

40|$|Summary. -Lymphocytes from 278 gynaecological {{patients}} (100 {{controls and}} 178 {{patients with a}} malignant condition) have been investigated for their response to encephalitogenic factor, cancer basic protein, and KCl extract of adenocarcinoma {{of the body of}} the uterus as "antigens", using tanned sheep erythrocytes ETS as indicator particles in the electrophoretic mobility test (EMT). Electrophoretic mobility was measured with a Zeiss cytopherometer. The study was split into three test series producing in the cancer group 66 % correct positive test results (34 %O false negatives) and in the control group 83 % correct negative results (17 % false positives). Consequently, with the instrumentation used, EMT is, at least in our hands, not sufficiently reliable for the diagnosis of cancer. SEVERAL RESEARCH CENTRES have investigated the possibility of using the macrophage electrophoretic mobility (MEM) test of Field & Caspary (1970), or one of its modifications, as <b>a</b> means of <b>cance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Omphalitis and {{umbilical}} cord separation time {{contributing to the}} number of morbidity and mortality in infants. There are various ways of cord care, but {{there was no significant difference}} in prevent of infection and cord separation time. Breast milk contains anti-infective and antiinflammatory factors that can be used for cord care. WHO recommends to develop it. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of topical breastmilk model on the incidence of omphalitis and separation time of the {{umbilical cord}} to the newborn. Method: The study design was a quasy experimental. The subjects of this study were 30 newborns obtained by consecutive sampling in Rumah Sakit Ibu dan Anak Kendangsari Surabaya May–June 2012. The samples were divided into 2 groups (topical breastmilk and open dry treatment), each group consists of 15 newborns. Data were analyzed using chi-square and independent t-test with <b>a</b> signifi <b>cance</b> level ofα≤ 0. 05. Results: There was no difference in the incidence of omphalitis in the use of topical breastmilk model compared to open dry treatment (p= 0. 33). However, there are significant differences in the average of cord separation time between topical breastmilk model and open dry treatment (p= 0. 020). Discussion: Model of cord care with topical breastmilk lowers the risk of omphalitis and accelerate the cord separation time compared to open dry treatment. Using breastmilk as cord care are safe, effective and efficient...|$|R
40|$|Th is is the fi rst study {{performed}} in population from Bosnia & Herzegovina (BH), {{in which we}} analysed <b>a</b> signifi <b>cance</b> of genetic variations in drug-metabolising enzyme, cytochrome P (CYP), in pathogenesis of Type diabetes. We have determined allele frequencies for CYPC*, CYPC*, and CYPD* in diabetic patients and nondiabetic controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. A real-time polymerase chain reaction {{was used for the}} detection of specifi c CYP polymorphisms, with the application of the specifi c TaqMan ® SNP genotyping tests (Applied Biosystems). Interestingly, results from this study have demon-strated that frequencies of CYPC* and CYPD* variants were in line, while frequency of CYPC* polymorphism seemed to be lower in this sample of BH population as compared to the Caucasians genotype data. Furthermore, no signifi cant diff erence in allele frequencies for CYPC*, CYPC*, and CYPD* was demonstrated between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Th us, results form this study seem to indicate no relationship between CYPC, CYPC, and CYPD genotype and diabetes susceptibility in Bosnian population. Th is in part may refl ect a limited study population included in our study and would require larger cohorts to reveal potential relationships between analysed CYP genetic variants and diabetes risk. In addition, it would be pertinent to further explore possible eff ects of CYP genetic variations on therapeutic and adverse outcomes of oral antidiabetics, which might be the key in optimising therapy for individual patient with Typ...|$|R
