5|$|The {{original}} parish of Great Malvern {{included the}} hamlet of Guarlford and the chapelry of Newland, and stretched from the River Severn {{on the east}} to the Malvern Hills on the west. Guarlford became a separate civil parish in 1894 when, under the Local Government Act of 1894, urban district councils were created for Malvern and Malvern Link. The Guarlford parish covered much of eastern Malvern, including parts of Great Malvern, Pickersleigh, Poolbrook, Barnards Green, Hall Green and Sherrard's Green. By 1900 however, the urban districts of Malvern and Malvern Link amalgamated, absorbing parts of neighbouring parishes to create <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> six wards under the Malvern Urban District Council. In 1934 the boundaries changed again, and those areas came {{under the control of}} the Malvern council.|$|E
5|$|The story {{followed}} Roy Race, a striker for {{the fictional}} football team Melchester Rovers, based in <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> {{the same name}} in an unspecified part of England, where Roy lived with his family. In the first episode, a teenaged Roy and his best friend, Blackie Gray, signed for the Rovers after being spotted playing for a youth club team. Eight months later, Roy and Blackie made their first-team debuts against Elbury Wanderers {{in a game that}} ended in a 3–3 draw, with Roy scoring twice. He soon became a star, leading the team to either the Football League title or a cup almost every season. In January 1975 he was made player-manager, a position he retained for most of the next 20years. Although the strip followed the Rovers through nearly 40seasons, Roy did not age at the same rate and appeared to be at most in his late thirties by the time the weekly comic ended. This unrealistic longevity was never remarked upon by the weekly comic, although the monthly comic attempted to address the anomaly by explaining that more than one Roy Race had played for Melchester over the years.|$|E

In Piana the women organised a boycott of annual religious procession in protest of the priest’s opposition to the movement in 1893.|$|E
