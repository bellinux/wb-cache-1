5|$|Another type of {{approach}} is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or <b>agarose</b> and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. They fall into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials {{can also be used}} as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.|$|E
25|$|<b>Agarose</b> gels {{are made}} from the natural {{polysaccharide}} polymers extracted from seaweed.|$|E
25|$|Agar {{is derived}} from the {{polysaccharide}} <b>agarose,</b> which forms the supporting structure in the cell walls of certain species of algae, and which is released on boiling. These algae are known as agarophytes and belong to the Rhodophyta (red algae) phylum. Agar is actually the resulting mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide <b>agarose,</b> and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called agaropectin.|$|E
25|$|Cyanogen bromide {{is often}} used to {{immobilize}} proteins by coupling them to reagents such as <b>agarose</b> for affinity chromatography. Because of its simplicity and mild pH conditions, cyanogen bromide activation is the most common method for preparing affinity gels. Cyanogen bromide is also often used because it reacts with the hydroxyl groups on <b>agarose</b> to form cyanate esters and imidocarbonates. These groups are reacted with primary amines in order to couple the protein onto the <b>agarose</b> matrix, as shown in the figure. Because cyanate esters are more reactive than are cyclic imidocarbonates, the amine will react mostly with the ester, yielding isourea derivatives, and partially with the less reactive imidocarbonate, yielding substituted imidocarbonates.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonated polysaccharides: They {{occur in}} the cell walls of most algae; those common in red algae include <b>agarose,</b> carrageenan, porphyran, {{furcelleran}} and funoran.|$|E
25|$|Characterization through ligand {{interaction}} may {{be performed}} by electroblotting or by affinity electrophoresis in <b>agarose</b> or by capillary electrophoresis as for estimation of binding constants and determination of structural features like glycan content through lectin binding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Agarose</b> gels {{are easily}} cast and handled {{compared}} to other matrices, because the gel setting is a physical rather than chemical change. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel {{can be stored in}} a plastic bag in a refrigerator.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{of this approach}} include the toxicity of cyanogen bromide and its sensitivity to oxidation. Also, cyanogen bromide activation involves the attachment of a ligand to <b>agarose</b> by an isourea bond, which is positively charged at neutral pH and thus unstable. Consequently, isourea derivatives may act as weak anion exchangers.|$|E
25|$|Partially {{hydrolysed}} {{potato starch}} makes for another non-toxic medium for protein electrophoresis. The gels are slightly more opaque than acrylamide or <b>agarose.</b> Non-denatured proteins can be separated according to charge and size. They are visualised using Napthal Black or Amido Black staining. Typical starch gel concentrations are 5% to 10%.|$|E
25|$|The {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blotting are {{two different}} ways that the purified antigen (or multiple antigens) can be obtained and analyzed. This method involves purifying an antigen through the aid of an attached antibody on a solid (beaded) support, such as <b>agarose</b> resin. The immobilized protein complex can be accomplished either in a single step or successively.|$|E
25|$|To check {{whether the}} PCR {{successfully}} generated the anticipated DNA target region (also {{sometimes referred to}} as the amplimer or amplicon), <b>agarose</b> gel electrophoresis may be employed for size separation of the PCR products. The size(s) of PCR products is determined by comparison with a DNA ladder, a molecular weight marker which contains DNA fragments of known size run on the gel alongside the PCR products.|$|E
25|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} is {{a method}} for separation and analysis of macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins) and their fragments, based on their size and charge. It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge and/or size (IEF <b>agarose,</b> essentially size independent) and in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments or to separate proteins by charge.|$|E
25|$|DNA detection: the {{compound}} ethidium bromide, in aqueous solution, {{has very little}} fluorescence, as it is quenched by water. Ethidium bromide's fluorescence is greatly enhanced after it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in <b>agarose</b> gel electrophoresis. Intercalated ethidium is in a hydrophobic environment when it is between the base pairs of the DNA, protected from quenching by water which is excluded from the local environment of the intercalated ethidium. Ethidium bromide may be carcinogenic – an arguably safer alternative is the dye SYBR Green.|$|E
25|$|Traditional DNA {{sequencing}} {{techniques such}} as Maxam-Gilbert or Sanger methods used polyacrylamide gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use <b>agarose</b> gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used {{in the field of}} immunology and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or isoforms of the same protein into separate bands. These can be transferred onto a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane to be probed with antibodies and corresponding markers, such as in a western blot.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, {{the full}} {{complexity}} of the HLA class I antigens was beginning to be understood. At the time new serotypes were being determined, the problem with multiple alleles for each serotype was becoming apparent by nucleotide sequencing. RFLP analysis helped determine new alleles, but sequencing was more thorough. Throughout the 1990s, PCR kits, called SSP-PCR kits were developed that allowed, at least under optimal conditions, the purification of DNA, PCR and <b>Agarose</b> Gel identification of alleles within an 8-hour day. Alleles {{that could not be}} clearly identified by serotype and PCR could be sequenced, allowing for the refinement of new PCR kits.|$|E
25|$|Bisulfite {{sequencing}} {{relies on}} the conversion of every single unmethylated cytosine residue to uracil. If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in <b>agarose</b> gel {{has been reported to}} improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA physically separate.|$|E
25|$|To achieve maximum purity in {{a single}} step, {{affinity}} purification can be performed, using the antigen to provide specificity for the antibody. In this method, the antigen used to generate the antibody is covalently attached to an <b>agarose</b> support. If the antigen is a peptide, it is commonly synthesized with a terminal cysteine, which allows selective attachment to a carrier protein, such as KLH during development and to support purification. The antibody-containing media is then incubated with the immobilized antigen, either in batch or as the antibody is passed through a column, where it selectively binds and can be retained while impurities are washed away. An elution with a low pH buffer or a more gentle, high salt elution buffer is then used to recover purified antibody from the support.|$|E
25|$|Levels of mRNA can be quantitatively {{measured}} by northern blotting, which provides size and sequence {{information about the}} mRNA molecules. A sample of RNA is separated on an <b>agarose</b> gel and hybridized to a radioactively labeled RNA probe that is complementary to the target sequence. The radiolabeled RNA is then detected by an autoradiograph. Because the use of radioactive reagents makes the procedure time consuming and potentially dangerous, alternative labeling and detection methods, such as digoxigenin and biotin chemistries, have been developed. Perceived disadvantages of Northern blotting are that large quantities of RNA are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate, as it involves measuring band strength in {{an image of a}} gel. On the other hand, the additional mRNA size information from the Northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts.|$|E
25|$|When using RFLP, the {{theoretical}} {{risk of a}} coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because monozygotic twins are 0.2% of the human population. Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures {{do not reflect the}} theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in precisely the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the <b>agarose</b> gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates, which may be cause for concern. In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones. Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.|$|E
25|$|These buffers {{have plenty}} of ions in them, which is {{necessary}} for the passage of electricity through them. Something like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis. There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids Tris/Acetate/EDTA (TAE), Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. lithium borate, which is almost never used, based on Pubmed citations (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic; Borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% <b>agarose</b> gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Agarose</b> gels do {{not have}} a uniform pore size, but are optimal for {{electrophoresis}} of proteins that are larger than 200 kDa. <b>Agarose</b> gel electrophoresis can also be used for the separation of DNA fragments ranging from 50 base pair to several megabases (millions of bases), the largest of which require specialized apparatus. The distance between DNA bands of different lengths is influenced by the percent <b>agarose</b> in the gel, with higher percentages requiring longer run times, sometimes days. [...] Instead high percentage <b>agarose</b> gels should be run with a pulsed field electrophoresis (PFE), or field inversion electrophoresis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{types of}} gel most {{typically}} used are <b>agarose</b> and polyacrylamide gels. [...] Each type of gel is well-suited to different types and sizes of analyte. [...] Polyacrylamide gels are usually used for proteins, and have very high resolving power for small fragments of DNA (5-500 bp). [...] <b>Agarose</b> gels {{on the other}} hand have lower resolving power for DNA but have greater range of separation, and are therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50-20,000 bp in size, but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). [...] Polyacrylamide gels are run in a vertical configuration while <b>agarose</b> gels are typically run horizontally in a submarine mode. [...] They also differ in their casting methodology, as <b>agarose</b> sets thermally, while polyacrylamide forms in a chemical polymerization reaction.|$|E

2500|$|PCR {{products}} then {{separated by}} gel electrophoresis on 1.5% <b>agarose</b> gel in 0.5 x TBE ...|$|E
2500|$|Nucleic acid {{molecules}} {{are separated}} by applying an electric field to move the negatively charged molecules through a matrix of <b>agarose</b> or other substances. Shorter molecules move faster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate more easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called sieving. [...] Proteins {{are separated by}} charge in <b>agarose</b> because the pores of the gel are too large to sieve proteins. [...] Gel electrophoresis {{can also be used}} for separation of nanoparticles.|$|E
2500|$|... "Most <b>agarose</b> gels {{are made}} with between 0.7% (good {{separation}} or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments) and 2% (good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments) <b>agarose</b> dissolved in electrophoresis buffer. Up to 3% {{can be used for}} separating very tiny fragments but a vertical polyacrylamide gel is more appropriate in this case. Low percentage gels are very weak and may break when you try to lift them. High percentage gels are often brittle and do not set evenly. 1% gels are common for many applications." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} {{of large}} DNA or RNA is usually done by <b>agarose</b> gel electrophoresis. See the [...] "Chain termination method" [...] page {{for an example}} of a polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel. Characterization through ligand interaction of nucleic acids or fragments may be performed by mobility shift affinity electrophoresis.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "gel" [...] in this {{instance}} refers to the matrix used to contain, then separate the target molecules. In most cases, the gel is a crosslinked polymer whose composition and porosity is chosen based on the specific weight and composition of the target to be analyzed. When separating proteins or small nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotides) the gel is usually composed of different concentrations of acrylamide and a cross-linker, producing different sized mesh networks of polyacrylamide. When separating larger nucleic acids (greater than a few hundred bases), the preferred matrix is purified <b>agarose.</b> In both cases, the gel forms a solid, yet porous matrix. Acrylamide, in contrast to polyacrylamide, is a neurotoxin and must be handled using appropriate safety precautions to avoid poisoning. <b>Agarose</b> is composed of long unbranched chains of uncharged carbohydrate without cross links resulting in a gel with large pores allowing for the separation of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1984 Tom White, VP of Research at Cetus (and a close friend), {{pressured}} Mullis to {{take his}} idea to the group developing the genetic mutation assay. [...] Together, they spent the following months designing experiments that could convincingly show that PCR is working on genomic DNA. [...] Unfortunately, the expected amplification product was not visible in <b>agarose</b> gel electrophoresis, leading to confusion {{as to whether the}} reaction had any specificity to the targeted region.|$|E
2500|$|Super-resolution optical {{fluctuation}} imaging (SOFI) is a super-resolution {{technique that}} achieves spatial resolutions below the diffraction limit by post-processing analysis with correlation equations, similar to FCS. While original reports of SOFI used fluctuations from stationary, blinking of fluorophores, [...] FCS has been combined with SOFI where fluctuations are produced from diffusing probes to produce super-resolution spatial maps of diffusion coefficients. [...] This {{has been applied}} to understand diffusion and spatial properties of porous materials, including <b>agarose</b> hydrogels and liquid crystals.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1985 the {{development}} group began to apply the PCR technique to other targets. [...] Primers and probes were designed for a variable segment of the Human leukocyte antigen DQα gene. [...] This reaction was much more specific than that for the β-hemoglobin target – the expected PCR product is directly visible on <b>agarose</b> gel electrophoresis. [...] The amplification products from various sources were also cloned and sequenced, the first determination of new [...] alleles by PCR. [...] At this same time the original Oligomer Restriction assay technique was replaced with the more general Allele specific oligonucleotide method.|$|E
2500|$|Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) {{directly}} ligates DNA {{from either}} side of a double-strand break where there is very little or no sequence overlap for annealing. This repair mechanism induces errors in the genome via indels (insertion or deletion), or chromosomal rearrangement; any such errors may render the gene products coded at that location non-functional. [...] Because this activity can vary depending on the species, cell type, target gene, and nuclease used, it should be monitored when designing new systems. [...] A simple heteroduplex cleavage assay can be run which detects any difference between two alleles amplified by PCR. Cleavage products can be visualized on simple <b>agarose</b> gels or slab gel systems.|$|E
2500|$|Ethidium bromide is an {{intercalating agent}} {{commonly}} {{used as a}} fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) in molecular biology laboratories for techniques such as <b>agarose</b> gel electrophoresis. It is commonly abbreviated as [...] "EtBr", which is also an abbreviation for bromoethane. [...] When exposed to ultraviolet light, it will fluoresce with an orange colour, intensifying almost 20-fold after binding to DNA. Under the name homidium, it has been commonly used since the 1950s in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomiasis in cattle, a disease caused by trypanosomes. [...] The high incidence of antimicrobial resistance makes this treatment impractical in some areas, where the related isometamidium chloride is used instead. [...] Ethidium bromide may be a mutagen, although this depends on the organism exposed and the circumstances of exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Microsatellites can be amplified for {{identification}} by the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) process, using the unique sequences of flanking regions as primers. [...] DNA is repeatedly denatured at a high temperature to separate the double strand, then cooled to allow annealing of primers and the extension of nucleotide sequences through the microsatellite. [...] This process results in production of enough DNA to be visible on <b>agarose</b> or polyacrylamide gels; only small amounts of DNA are needed for amplification because in this way thermocycling creates an exponential increase in the replicated segment. [...] With the abundance of PCR technology, primers that flank microsatellite loci are simple and quick to use, but the development of correctly functioning primers is often a tedious and costly process.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogels {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied, {{mainly in the}} entrapment of small molecules for drug delivery, including cases where the hydrogel nanoparticles slowly release the drug to a targeted site. Hydrogels can be classified [...] according their polymers constituents, which can be natural (Hyaluronan, alginic acid, pectin, , chondroitin sulfate, dextran and dextran [...] sulphate, chitosan, polylysine, [...] collagen, carboxymethyl chitin, fibrin, <b>agarose,</b> pullulan), or synthetic (PEG, PLA, PLGA, PCL, PHB, PVA, PNVP, P(HEMA), p(biscarboxy-phenoxy-phosphazene), p(GEMA-sulfate), and others), or a hybrid of the two. In addition to organic hydrogels there are sol-gels, which are oxygen-bridged silicates (or titanium oxide), that polymerise in water. An additional classification can be by method of polymerization, which can be physical (freezing or heating) or chemical (γ-ray, oxygen or photo-induced radical polymerization {{in the case of}} acrylates, vinyls and acrylamides).|$|E
2500|$|Fast protein liquid {{chromatography}} (FPLC), {{is a form}} of {{liquid chromatography}} that is often used to analyze or purify mixtures of proteins. As in other forms of chromatography, separation is possible because the different components of a mixture have different affinities for two materials, a moving fluid (the [...] "mobile phase") and a porous solid (the stationary phase). In FPLC the mobile phase is an aqueous solution, or [...] "buffer". The buffer flow rate is controlled by a positive-displacement pump and is normally kept constant, while the composition of the buffer can be varied by drawing fluids in different proportions from two or more external reservoirs. The stationary phase is a resin composed of beads, usually of cross-linked <b>agarose,</b> packed into a cylindrical glass or plastic column. FPLC resins are available {{in a wide range of}} bead sizes and surface ligands depending on the application.|$|E
