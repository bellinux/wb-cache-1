5|$|In 1996, the Department of Energy, {{which had}} succeeded the Atomic Energy Commission, decided {{that since the}} Dayton sites <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> decontaminated, they did not warrant {{inclusion}} in the Army Corps of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). However, the local community in Dayton were concerned that the cleanup did not meet 21st century environmental standards. Therefore, the state of Ohio asked the United States Congress to have the Army Corps of Engineers conduct a review. This {{was carried out in}} 2004 and 2005. The review concluded that no radioactive contaminants were found that would warrant inclusion in FUSRAP.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|In {{connection}} with the dispute over the royal election, Haakon's mother Inga had to prove his parentage through a trial by ordeal in Bergen in 1218. The result of the trial strengthened the legal basis for his kingship, and improved {{his relationship with the}} church. The saga's claim that Haakon <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> generally accepted as king in 1217/18 has however been contested by modern historians such as Sverre Bagge. Skule and Haakon increasingly drifted apart in their administration, and Skule focused mainly on governing Eastern Norway after 1220, which he had gained the right to rule in 1218 as his third of the Norwegian kingdom. From 1221 to 1223, Haakon and Skule separately issued letters as rulers of Norway, and maintained official contacts abroad. In 1223 a great meeting of bishops, clergy, secular nobles and other high-ranking figures from all across the country was held in Bergen to finally decide on Haakon's right to the throne. Other candidates to the throne were present either personally or through attorneys, but Haakon was in the end unanimously confirmed as King of Norway by the court.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 17th century the eastward {{movement}} of Russian people was slowed by the internal {{problems in the}} country during the Time of Troubles. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. While Cossacks came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russian people came by the Arctic Ocean. These were Pomors from the Russian North, who <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> making fur trade with Mangazeya {{in the north of}} the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of Turukhansk was founded on the northern Yenisey River, near the mouth of the Lower Tunguska, and in 1619 Yeniseysky ostrog was founded on the mid-Yenisey {{at the mouth of the}} Upper Tunguska.|$|E

Years earlier, in the play The Clouds (423 BC), Aristophanes lampooned Socrates as a charlatan, the paradigm philosopher of atheist and scientific sophistry — carefully arranged arguments constructed of ornate words and phrases — misrepresented as wisdom. In light of that definition, Socrates defensively argues that he cannot be mistaken for a Sophist philosopher because Sophists are wise men, are thought to be wise by the people of Athens, and, thus, are highly paid for their teaching; whereas he (Socrates) lives in ten-thousand-fold poverty, and knows nothing noble and good (23c).|$|E
25|$|In the Autumn of 2006 on {{the trade}} fairs in Hannover the world premier {{occurred}} of the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid with hybrid power. The model was made with the cooperation with Allison Transmission and Cummins, which <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> engaged in previous hybrid bus models in North America. The {{main part of the}} model is the Cummins ISLe4 engine with 8.9litre displacement which generates 248kW (340 HP) of power. The second main part of this model is the EP50 system of Allison Transmission with the Allison Ev50 engine. The concept is created by the use of one diesel engine and two electric engines with each having 75kW of power output, which links with the Ev DRIVE module. The system also uses the produced energy when braking, which is accumulated in a nickel-metal hydride batteries located on the roof {{in the front of the}} vehicle. The prototype appeared in mid-2006 and went into production in 2007. The location of the electric and diesel engines is in the front part of the bus between the two doors.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009–10 season, however, Romanov {{soon became}} disliked by Žalgiris fans. After the departures of Jonas Mačiulis and Paulius Jankūnas, the team {{resigned}} the returning Marcus Brown and also signed Martynas Pocius, who quickly {{became one of}} the best players for the team. The team also resigned point guard Mantas Kalnietis, who turned down the offer of Benneton Treviso. The team started the season successfully, winning the new BBL Cup against Lietuvos Rytas. However, soon the team began to play poorly, leading to Krapikas resigning as head coach and being replaced by former Lithuanian National team coach Ramūnas Butautas, who lead the team to the EuroLeague Top 16 phase with a 3–7 regular season record. After the team entered a slump, Romanov fired coach Butautas in a controversial move, replacing him with assistant coach and former captain Darius Maskoliūnas. Under Maskoliūnas, Žalgiris nearly made the Top 8 phase {{for the first time in}} club history, and finished with a solid 2–4 record. Žalgiris won back the BBL title by beating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals, but more controversy quickly arose during the LKL finals. During the series, Romanov fired coach Maskoliūnas, and Lietuvos Rytas won the controversial series 4–3, leading to speculation that Romanov intentionally tanked the finals, as Lietuvos Rytas qualified to the Euroleague season because of it, while Žalgiris <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> qualified. The season is widely considered as the most controversial in club history.|$|E

With the area secured, Cockburn's forces {{advanced}} on Washington. That afternoon they defeated American troops under General Winder and Commodore Barney at Bladensburg; by 8 o'clock that evening British troops entered Washington. Within twenty four hours, under the direct supervision of Admiral Cockburn, the British force {{set fire to the}} capitol building, the White House, and other structures. With the American forces defeated and in retreat, President James Madison and Secretary Jones had fled the capital and made their way up the Potomac River to remain in hiding in the countryside. Rodgers proceeded to Baltimore, arriving on the 25th. The citizens there were in a panic fearing their city would suffer the same fate as had just befallen Washington. In the panic the Americans burned the Columbia and the Argus which were nearby, ready for service. Upon Rodgers' arrival he immediately took up preparing defensive measures about the area, the actions of which restored order among the citizenry; with the inhabitants' courage somewhat restored, Rodgers combined his command with that of Porter's and secured a small flotilla on the , which flows south-east into Chesapeake Bay at Baltimore. With a force of some thousand sailors and marines Rodgers set up defenses about Baltimore, dividing this force into two regiments, one under the command of Porter, the other under the command of Oliver Hazard Perry, who <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stationed in Baltimore.|$|E
