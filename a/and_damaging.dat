30|$|Scale {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the choice of a working definition of loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> in academic work (UNEP 2016). For example, in local assessments of loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> from climate-related disasters, the reduction of global greenhouse gas emission is not directly relevant. Vice versa, local measures to cope with the impacts of disasters have little impact on global policy dialogues on loss <b>and</b> <b>damage.</b> Due to these differences, the concept of loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> needs to be separately defined for a global and a local context. As this article focusses on a local context, and studies losses <b>and</b> <b>damages</b> for a particular event, it uses the following definition: Loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> refers to adverse effects of climate-related stressors resulting from insufficient capacity to reduce the risks associated with climate-related stressors, to cope with impacts of climate-related events, and to adapt to climatic changes.|$|R

40|$|Pressure {{to support}} {{responses}} to loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has intensified in recent years. Loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> – an issue gaining prominence {{largely due to}} shortfalls of mitigation action and adaptation support – has never been officially defined under the UNFCCC. Here, the term “loss and damage” refers to irreversible losses (e. g. loss of life, species, land) <b>and</b> costly <b>damages</b> (e. g. destroyed infrastructure) caused, at least in part, by climate change. Although loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> has been a subject of debate among Parties to the UNFCCC for years, the agreement reached in Paris {{was the first to}} devote a full article to loss <b>and</b> <b>damage.</b> In that article, Parties agreed to enhance “understanding, action and support” for loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> to strengthen the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss <b>and</b> <b>Damage</b> associated with Climate Change (WIM) (UNFCCC, 2015, Art. 8). In coming years, as climate change advances and Parties work to implement this and other directions from the Paris Agreement, it will prove more crucial than ever to support loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response, especially should efforts to sufficiently scale up mitigation commitments and adaptation capacity fall short. Given mounting pressure to finance effective loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response efforts, understanding of the Warsaw International Mechanism’s activities must be strengthened, and the question of how funding for loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response might be raised and allocated must be widely considered. To these ends, this paper endeavours to answer two questions {{at the core of the}} emergent drive to fund efforts to address loss <b>and</b> <b>damage.</b> First, what do we mean by financing loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response? We examine language relevant to financing efforts in the initial two-year workplan of the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the WIM to answer this question, reviewing the workplan’s listed financing options. Second, what are some possible means for raising predictable funding that will prove adequate to finance loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response? We discuss a number of innovative fundraising mechanisms that have been proposed and assess their adequacy, predictability, technical feasibility, fairness (whether polluters or the most vulnerable pay), indirect effects and link to loss <b>and</b> <b>damage.</b> These criteria provide a framework to evaluate the concepts that underlie each mechanism (such as fairness and links to loss <b>and</b> <b>damage),</b> to assess whether each mechanism can be implemented and become a sufficient, stable source of support for loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response (using criteria of feasibility, adequacy and predictability), and to judge what tangential impacts use of each mechanism might produce (by examining potential indirect effects). We conclude that there are a number of viable proposals for both gathering and effectively using funds to support loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response. Two proposals stand out: a levy on airline travel and risk transfer approaches. However, we also identify a number of outstanding issues in funding loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response, including the ambiguity of relevant UNFCCC texts; the shortfalls of proposed mechanisms in terms of providing for slow onset or high-certainty events and non-economic loss and damage; the lack of an agreed definition of loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> under the UNFCCC; developed countries’ disproportionate (and inadequate) support for risk transfer over other approaches; the large gap that exists between funding made available and funding needed; and the inevitable contention surrounding the question of how finance should be distributed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

3000|$|... “Loss and damage” is an {{emerging}} topic in climate change negotiations, research, policy, and {{the implementation of}} climate change action (Roberts and Pelling 2016). Losses <b>and</b> <b>damages</b> can result from insufficient efforts to achieve disaster risk reduction, inadequate coping and adaptation strategies, and unavoidable impacts (Roberts et al. 2014). Often portrayed as a future threat, loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> is also a present-day reality that vulnerable people {{in many parts of}} the world already face (van der Geest and Warner 2015). The concept of loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> connects the fields of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. It also relates to questions on liability and compensation for climate change-induced losses <b>and</b> <b>damages.</b> With the emergence of loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> in climate negotiations, particularly since the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), the issue of liability and compensation for loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> incurred due to extreme weather events has gained international importance (Boyd et al. 2017).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the study of {{tensegrity}} active control in situations of partially defined loading <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> events. Self-diagnosis <b>and</b> self-repair methodologies are proposed and validated experimentally on a full-scale active tensegrity structure. Selfdiagnosis involves load identification <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> location. The response of the structure to a load <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> is measured <b>and</b> compared with the response of the structure to candidate solutions for load <b>and</b> <b>damage.</b> Self-diagnosis solutions result in sets of candidate solutions for loads <b>and</b> <b>damage.</b> These solutions are employed to compute control commands of shape control and self-repair for the structure. Self-repairing control commands increase stiffness and decrease stresses with respect to the damaged state. Self-repairing control commands are computed using a multiobjective approach. The application of a control command results in self-stress modifications by changing the length of active struts. The proposed methodologies are attractive for tensegrity active control in situations of partially defined loading <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> events...|$|R

40|$|The devotion {{of a full}} {{article in}} the Paris Agreement to loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> was a major {{breakthrough}} for the world’s most vulnerable nations seeing to gain support for climate impacts beyond what can be adapted to. But how will loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> be paid for, and who will pay it? Will ethics {{be part of this}} decision? Here we ask what are the possible means of raising predictable and adequate levels of funding to address loss <b>and</b> <b>damage?</b> Utilizing a framework developed by Marco Grasso (2009, 2010), we argue that making the ethical connections between addressing climate impacts and finance mechanisms could significantly enhance their likelihood of being adopted. We briefly review insurance mechanisms and catastrophe bonds, and then move on to six “innovative finance” approaches to funding loss <b>and</b> <b>damage.</b> We utilize six criteria in assessing them: adequacy, predictability, technical feasibility, fairness, and indirect effects, and whether each has a clear link to loss <b>and</b> <b>damage.</b> Several mechanisms for gathering funds emerged as most promising. Three of the six financial mechanisms we reviewed to raise funding involved airline transport: clearly, there is a huge opportunity to tax this sector in one form or another, in recognition of airline emissions’ role in creating losses <b>and</b> <b>damages</b> in vulnerable nations from sea level rise, droughts, floods or hurricanes. Funding loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> response is a contentious issue that will get only more unwieldy if Parties’ conceptions of loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> are at odds: a common definition of loss <b>and</b> <b>damage</b> needs to be agreed upon under the UNFCCC. Most immediately, to meet any equity criteria, wealthy countries should do more to support the premiums of those who cannot afford insurance. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
