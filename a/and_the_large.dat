5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large,</b> membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Altar 13 {{is another}} early Maya {{monument}} {{dating to the}} Late Preclassic. Like Altar12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it was deliberately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.|$|E
30|$|Inter-porosity flow {{coefficient}} {{is related to}} the density of the fracture network. <b>The</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> inter-porosity {{flow coefficient}} is, the lower the position of pressure curves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> gas rate at the inter-porosity flow stage. Storativity ratio reflects the storage capacity of the fracture network. <b>The</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> storativity ratio is, the lower the position of pressure curves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> gas rate at the early stage.|$|R

5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an {{expensive}} and painstaking process, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop {{consisted of a}} single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, the {{observatory}} had become crowded by {{the rapidly growing}} university. Electrification of the tramways along College Street just to the south, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off the instruments. A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in Agincourt, at that time largely empty fields, leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties.|$|E
5|$|D'Avalos, having {{waited for}} the arrival {{a large body of}} landsknechts {{dispatched}} by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, set off from Asti towards Carignano. His total force included 12,500–18,000 infantry, of which perhaps 4,000 were arquebusiers or musketeers; he was only able to gather about 800–1,000 cavalry, of which less than 200 were gendarmes. D'Avalos recognized the relative weakness of his cavalry, but considered it to be compensated by the experience of his infantry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of arquebusiers in its ranks.|$|E

5|$|Episode {{director}} Neil Affleck {{was praised}} {{by the staff}} for his directing in this episode. In the scene where Chief Wiggum falls {{on his back in}} his bedroom, unable to roll over or get back up, Affleck decided to act out the scene for the staff to showcase how Affleck envisioned Chief Wiggum's predicament. Affleck was also praised for his ability to create three new elaborate settings in the episode: the science museum, the Springfield penitentiary, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> toy store.|$|E
5|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} {{that there is}} serious competition for food between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> numbers of larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E
5|$|In 1834, King Ludwig I {{granted the}} city its old {{coat of arms}} again {{in the form of}} large and small crests. These {{embodied}} the small crest seal of 1304 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> one of 1323. The 1835 coat of arms had a blue background, though this was later corrected to argent under Ludwig II in 1865. The background was rarely changed. One example of its occurrence, however, was when or was used in the 16th century instead.|$|E

5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing bending strength and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending strength, but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American squirrel monkey was just a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American squirrel monkey <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Many notable {{people have}} either lived or {{stayed in the}} Royal Crescent since it was first built over 240 years ago, and some are commemorated on special plaques {{attached}} to the relevant buildings.

5|$|Other {{species that}} prey upon similar food {{resources}} include the caimans and large fish that are themselves piscivores. Gymnotids, {{such as the}} electric eel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> silurid catfish are among aquatic competitors. Two river dolphins, the tucuxi and boto, might potentially compete with the giant otter, but different spatial use and dietary preferences suggest minimal overlap. Furthermore, Defler observed associations between giant otters and the Amazon river dolphins, and suggested that dolphins may benefit by fish fleeing from the otters. The spectacled caiman is another potential competitor, but Duplaix found no conflict with the species in Suriname.|$|E
5|$|Sampson won the {{election}} {{by a majority of}} over 32,000 votes, although every other Republican candidate lost by small margins. In the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat James Breathitt, Jr. defeated Sampson's running mate, E. E. Nelson, by 159 votes out of more than 700,000 cast. It was estimated that the Jockey Club spent half a million dollars to defeat Beckham <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> majority for Sampson versus the close defeat of all other Republican candidates suggested some type of fraud, although none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|Since its nomination, {{numerous}} {{changes and}} renovations have occurred.

5|$|Technical {{difficulties}} {{included the}} very high transistor counts needed to support the wide instruction words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> caches.

Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to.

5|$|The Soviet Army {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German armored vehicles, including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4). Some of them were pressed into temporary service and some others were used for training. Sometimes, captured tanks were used in different temporary units or as single tanks.
