2500|$|The writers {{sometimes}} make jokes at the newsgroup's expense. Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy {{is often used}} to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of alt.tv.simpsons. The first such instance occurred in the seventh season episode [...] "Radioactive Man", in which Comic Book Guy is logging on to his favorite newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive. Comic Book Guy's oft-repeated catchphrase, [...] "Worst episode ever", first appeared on alt.tv.simpsons in an episode review and writer David S. Cohen decided to use this fan response to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans. In the chapter [...] "Who Wants Candy" [...] in the book Leaving Springfield, Robert Sloane finds alt.tv.simpsons an example of an [...] "active audience ... who struggle to make their own meaning out of the show". He mentions that in this context, the fans nitpick the show to an extreme and allow no room for error, where the writers believe that nitpicking leads to an under appreciation of the show's qualities. Turner writes in the book Planet Simpson that The Simpsons appeared tailor-made for a newsgroup in the early 1990s because it includes minor details that reward attentive viewing and can be easily scrutinized. The episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] deals with the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency. When the character Comic Book Guy saw that the television show The Itchy & Scratchy Show added a new character, called Poochie, he immediately goes on the internet and writes [...] "Worst episode ever" [...] on a message board; a commentary on how the <b>active</b> <b>audience</b> nit picks the episode.

In particular, it examines how the rise of Web 2. 0, with its de-territorialised media services and social media, challenges PSB’s relevance as trends towards universal access, a greater participatory culture and <b>active</b> <b>audiences</b> render PSB content increasingly anachronistic...|$|R

40|$|This {{extended}} review highlights {{an increasingly}} {{important aspect of the}} contemporary performance reception of the Odyssey in the UK, with growing numbers of practitioners and companies moving away from the straightforward dramatisation (or revisionist dramatic contestation) of Homer’s epic tale, and towards a deepening engagement with epic storytelling as a distinctive category of performance practice. These projects have increasingly foregrounded the techniques and practices, and the <b>active</b> <b>audiences,</b> of epic storytelling, as well as the tales being told, opening up new landscapes for the exploration of ancient epic in live re-performance. Two productions currently playing in London are here taken as typifying this trend, demonstrating a developing focus on the flexible narrative structures and in-performance composition of Homeric epic, as well as the ripping yarn of the Odyssey’s plot...|$|R

40|$|European Communication Monitor is {{the largest}} {{longitudinal}} research project in public relations practice in the world.

Perception of the importance of various issues for the practice of public relations is largely dependent on the gender, geography (division between Northern and Western vs. Southern and Eastern Europe), and sector in which a practitioner works (corporate, government, NGO or agency). While gender and sectorial differences studied in academic public relations literature, divisions in public relations practice between North-Western and South-Eastern Europe are largely ignored...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to explore para-authorial roles in {{strategic}} mediated communication situations, specifically to study the relationship between author and audience in transmedia mystery narratives. An updated version of Allan Bell 2 ̆ 7 s (1984, 2001) audience design theory illuminates three dimensions of power in author-audience relationships in multi-audienced situations: (1) power over continuance; (2) power over style; and (3) power over reputation. Using an exemplar from a transmedia storytelling experience based in a mystery/slasher television show, the expectations of <b>active</b> <b>audiences</b> in two overlapped para-authorial roles—that of audience detective and of an audience reading a storyworld across media—are brought to light. The ways in which the most <b>active</b> <b>audiences</b> react to their felt stylistic marginalization is investigated, and suggestions for future studies of para-authorial roles and their rhetoric in multi-audienced situations are discussed. ^ Chapter one introduces the study and the concept of para-authorial roles for audiences. Chapter two provides a literature review featuring concepts from rhetorical, sociolinguistic, and media studies. Chapter three discusses in detail the issues of power in mediated situations, particularly relating to audience roles in transmedia and mystery genre situations, before introducing the specific case of the Harper 2 ̆ 7 s Universe, a multimedia (television and web) based mystery event. Chapter four explains the methodology and in chapter five an analysis and discussion of the audience comments are explored in light of three power dimensions: (1) power over continuance; (2) power over style; and (3) power over reputation. The findings illustrate the ways in which the most para-authorial audience of the Harper 2 ̆ 7 s Universe, the transmedial audience detectives, reacted to their felt marginalization in terms of all three power dimensions. Highlighting the expectations this group brought to their para-authorial roles along with their reactions to the perceived audience design raises a wide range of implications for other new forms of participatory audience roles. Chapter six discusses the implications and limitations of the study along with proposing future studies in a variety of scholarly areas. ...|$|R
