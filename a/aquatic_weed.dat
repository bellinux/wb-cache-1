5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another <b>aquatic</b> <b>weed,</b> the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{shoreline}} of Lake Delton {{has been developed}} with summer homes, year-round homes and condominiums. [...] About 20 resorts surround the lake. [...] Prior to the 2008 washout, the lake had poor water quality, which is common to impoundments in southwest Wisconsin. Some of the water quality problems {{may have been due}} to construction site erosion, as well as rural nonpoint source pollution. The lake also had nuisance <b>aquatic</b> <b>weed</b> growth that has required chemical treatment. The fishery of the Lake Delton was northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, channel catfish and panfish.|$|E

As a consequence, inference on where to target control and other management efforts is critical {{in the management of}} <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> (Ibáñez et al., 2009). Notwithstanding, aquatic systems in Uganda in general and in the basins of Lakes Victoria and Kyoga in particular, have fallen victims to <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> invasion and subsequent infestation. If these <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> infestations are to be minimized and their impacts mitigated, management decisions ought to be based on up-to-date data and information in relation to location of infestation hotspots. Aquatic systems in the basins of the two production systems are important sources of livelihoods especially from fish production and trade yet they are prone to infestation by <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds.</b> Thus, the invasion and subsequent infestation of aquatic ecosystems by <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> pose a major conservation threat to various aquatic resources (Catford et al., 2011; Kayanja, 2002).

Cairo city suffers from severe infestation of floating <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> water hyacinth on Nile River. The existence of floating <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> leads to bad influence on Nile scenery, which affect on image of civilization through Nile river. To {{overcome this problem}} investigation and designing process were carried out for constructing specific cylindrical barriers supplied with trash rack in El-Marazik territory south Cairo Governerate and El-Malatia territory south Bane-Sweif governerate respectively. The proposed cylindrical barriers and trash racks will control the floating <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> and prevent water hyacinth from reaching Cairo governerate. To fulfill {{the objectives of the}} study, several field measurements were carried out allover the two studied reaches. The intensity, the percentage of infestation, and the moving trend of the floating <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> were identified in the two studied areas. The detailed designing criterion of the created weed control barriers was developed to establish such <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> control utilities. Using the collected data which based on the analysis of field studies, certain applicable solutions were suggested to prevent floating <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> from reaching Cairo governerate which consequently led to control water hyacinth and improve Nile scenery in Cairo City...|$|R

40|$|Reports of hydrilla (Hydrilla verticilata) {{infestation}} lakes Bisina and Opeta were verbally communicated by {{some members}} of FIRRI who undertook surveys during the LVEMP 1 phase (1997 to 2004) to assess the diversity and stocks of fishes in the Kyoga basin satellite lakes. This issue was taken up by FIRRI and NAARI staff who work on <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> management to ascertain and quantify the presence of H. verticilata and other <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds,</b> with the sole aim of finding ways and means of controlling one of the world's worst <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds,</b> H. verticilata. The survey on Lake Opeta indicated that this weed was rare since only a few small broken pieces were sited at the lake's outflow through an extensive wetland to Lake Bisina. It was therefore concluded {{that it was not}} economically viable to allocate resources for further survey of H. verticilata on Lake Opeta. This finding therefore discredited the previous (informal) reports that H. verticilata was well established on Lake Opeta.

40|$|Submerged {{aquatic plants}} pose {{problems}} in Australian and New Zealand waterways for navigation, flood management, bank erosion, recreation and aesthetics. Among problematic species are: Lagarosiphon (Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss), Egeria (Egeria densa Planch.), Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum L.) and Elodea (Elodea canadensis Michx.). These species prefer clear water, where they form dense stands. The problem in controlling these plants relates to their mode of spread; the smallest viable vegetative fragment can re-establish a population. Left uncontained, these <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> {{are likely to}} fully colonize all available habitats, within {{a short period of}} time. Recent advances in application technology have allowed the safe use of aquatic herbicides in control programs. A new technique for applying the aquatic herbicide- Diquat for the control of submerged aquatics has been developed in New Zealand. This method involves the use of guar gum, and formulating a Diquat gel form (Hydrogelâ), which can then be applied to water. Hydrogel provides a greater degree of control, and allows the targeting of specific areas while significantly reducing offsite herbicide drift. Treatment trials of the formula “Hydrogel”, were undertaken at a number of sites in New Zealand and NSW, against a range of submerged <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds.</b> Results indicate that control can be achieved at significantly less cost than control by mechanical and other means. Water quality monitoring results show negligible herbicide residues downstream of the treatment sites. Future trials will be undertaken to assess the long-term control options for <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> using Hydrogel and other aquatic herbicides. Larger-scale trials will be undertaken to assess the environmental fate of herbicides in water and the wider aquatic ecosystem. The ability to use herbicide for the control of submerged <b>aquatic</b> <b>weeds</b> will significantly improve the cost-effectiveness and environmental effects of river control works, channel clearing and dam maintenance in the future...|$|R
