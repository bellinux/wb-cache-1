5|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} general schemes in which diffusion may take place. Tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion {{differ in the}} level of <b>adsorbate</b> coverage at the surface, while intrinsic diffusion and mass transfer diffusion differ {{in the nature of the}} diffusion environment. Tracer diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogeneous environment, whereas in chemical and mass transfer diffusion adparticles are more strongly affected by their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|In other instances, {{molecular}} {{interactions between}} gas molecules previously adsorbed on a solid surface form significant interactions with gas molecules in the gaseous phases. Hence, adsorption of gas molecules {{to the surface}} {{is more likely to}} occur around gas molecules that are already present on the solid surface, rendering the Langmuir adsorption isotherm ineffective for the purposes of modelling. This effect was studied in a system where nitrogen was the <b>adsorbate</b> and tungsten was the adsorbent by Paul Kisliuk (1922–2008) in 1957. To compensate for the increased probability of adsorption occurring around molecules present on the substrate surface, Kisliuk developed the precursor state theory, whereby molecules would enter a precursor state at the interface between the solid adsorbent and <b>adsorbate</b> in the gaseous phase. From here, <b>adsorbate</b> molecules would either adsorb to the adsorbent or desorb into the gaseous phase. The probability of adsorption occurring from the precursor state is dependent on the adsorbate’s proximity to other <b>adsorbate</b> molecules that have already been adsorbed. If the <b>adsorbate</b> molecule in the precursor state is in close proximity to an <b>adsorbate</b> molecule that has already formed on the surface, it has a sticking probability reflected {{by the size of the}} SE constant and will either be adsorbed from the precursor state at a rate of kEC or will desorb into the gaseous phase at a rate of kES. If an <b>adsorbate</b> molecule enters the precursor state at a location that is remote from any other previously adsorbed <b>adsorbate</b> molecules, the sticking probability is reflected by the size of the SD constant.|$|E

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{surface stress}} {{is caused by}} charge density redistribution of surface atoms due to lacking of nearest neighbor atoms. In case of introduction of <b>adsorbates</b> (atoms that land on surface), charge density would be then modified around these <b>adsorbates,</b> resulting different surface stress state. There are many types of reaction between <b>adsorbates</b> and the surface that cause different stress behavior. Here, two most common behaviors are shown: ...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} <b>adsorbates</b> on {{surfaces}} can form islands {{even if there}} are no attractive interactions. Instead strong repulsion between <b>adsorbates</b> at short distances can lead to islands, because such islands increase the entropy of the <b>adsorbates</b> that {{are not part of the}} islands. We suggest that this mechanism cause the observed island formation in O/Pt(111), but it may be important for many other systems as well. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{physisorption}} where <b>adsorbates</b> {{are simply}} {{sitting on the}} surface, the <b>adsorbates</b> can change the surface, along with its structure. The structure can go through relaxation, where the first few layers change interplanar distances without changing the surface structure, or reconstruction where the surface structure is changed.|$|R

40|$|Two isostructural metal organic {{frameworks}} (MOFs) having micropores of {{the same}} "static aperture size" but different "effective aperture size" have been prepared using 5 -(pyridin- 3 -ylethynl) isophthalic acid as a ligand having {{two different types of}} functional units, an isophthalate (iph) unit and a pyridyl unit, simultaneously in a single ligand. The combination of iph unit and Cu (or Zn) ion led to two-dimensional layers of Kagome (kgm) net topology, the layers being further pillared by the internal auxiliary pyridyl unit to form a three-dimensional microporous framework having two different types of cage-like pores, cage A and cage B, with different aperture sizes and shapes. (1) The MOFs can distinguish the <b>adsorbates</b> (N- 2 /Ar) not based on the widely used kinetic diameters of the <b>adsorbates</b> but based on the minimum diameters of the <b>adsorbates,</b> which are more shape dependent. While cage A with a sufficiently large aperture size compared with the size of the <b>adsorbates</b> does not show any size selectivity, cage B with an approximate size match between the <b>adsorbates</b> and the pore apertures shows shape selectivity for the <b>adsorbates.</b> The smaller but spherically shaped Ar atom is not allowed into the pore with the oval-shaped aperture; however, the larger linear N- 2 molecule is allowed into the pore with the oval-shaped aperture. (2) Even though the two isostructural MOFs have the same static aperture size of cage B, they show different size selectivity for the <b>adsorbates</b> based on the effective aperture size, which reflects the different extents of the framework flexibility. close 251...|$|R

We observe very pronounced current patterns (streamlines) with threefold periodicity in N_C. They arise {{as a consequence}} of quantum confinement in the transverse flow direction. Neighboring streamlines are separated by stripes of almost vanishing flow. As a consequence, the response of the current to functionalizing <b>adsorbates</b> is very sensitive to their placement: <b>adsorbates</b> located within the current filaments lead to strong backscattering, while <b>adsorbates</b> placed in other regions have almost no impact at all.

25|$|Molasses Number is {{a measure}} of the degree of {{decolorization}} of a standard molasses solution that has been diluted and standardized against standardized activated carbon. Due to the size of color bodies, the molasses number represents the potential pore volume available for larger adsorbing species. As all of the pore volume may not be available for adsorption in a particular waste water application, and as some of the <b>adsorbate</b> may enter smaller pores, it is not a good measure of the worth of a particular activated carbon for a specific application. Frequently, this parameter is useful in evaluating a series of active carbons for their rates of adsorption. Given two active carbons with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of <b>adsorbate</b> into the adsorption space.|$|E

25|$|Through its {{slope and}} y-intercept we can obtain vmon and K, which are {{constants}} for each adsorbent/adsorbate pair {{at a given}} temperature. vmon {{is related to the}} number of adsorption sites through the ideal gas law. If we assume that the number of sites is just the whole area of the solid divided into the cross section of the <b>adsorbate</b> molecules, we can easily calculate the surface area of the adsorbent.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption is the {{adhesion}} of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid or {{dissolved solid}} to a surface. This process creates {{a film of}} the <b>adsorbate</b> {{on the surface of}} the adsorbent. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the absorbate) is dissolved by or permeates a liquid or solid (the absorbent), respectively. Adsorption is a surface-based process while absorption involves the whole volume of the material. The term sorption encompasses both processes, while desorption is the reverse of it. Adsorption is a surface phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption can be broadly {{classified}} as {{being one of}} two types: physisorption or chemisorption. Physisorption is characterized by weak van der Waals interactions, and bond enthalpies typically less than 20kJ/mol. Chemisorption, alternatively, is defined by stronger covalent and ionic bonds, with bond enthalpies between 250 and 500kJ/mol. In both cases, the <b>adsorbate</b> atoms or molecules (i.e. the particles which adhere to the surface) are attracted to the adsorbent (solid) surface because of the surface energy that results from unoccupied bonding locations at the surface. The degree of orbital overlap then determines if the interactions will be physisorptive or chemisorptive.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of ammonia}} on platinized platinum {{has been studied}} with cyclic voltammetry and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). These techniques show the surface to be highly covered with <b>adsorbates</b> during the selective oxidation of ammonia to N- 2 at potentials where platinum is free of oxides. These <b>adsorbates</b> are inactive {{in the formation of}} N- 2 and consist of NHx, probably N-ads, whereas no NO <b>adsorbates</b> are present among these adspecies. These <b>adsorbates</b> remain present on the surface after exchange of the ammonia solution for base electrolyte and in a negatively directed potential scan N- 2 and NH 3 are formed. When this potential scan is interrupted by holding the potential at 0. 55 V the current reverses from negative to positive, being accompanied by N- 2 formation. These data support a mechanism in which NHx species, proposedly NHads, are the active intermediates and N-ads acts as a poison. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} nanostructures, because each <b>adsorbate</b> molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold. The terminal group is then modified to attract a specific material like a particular nanoparticle, wire, ribbon, or other nanostructure. In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be nanostructures attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align single wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. Dip pen nanolithography was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was passivated with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The polar solvent that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces. The nanotubes thus line up with the MHA-ODT boundary. Using this technique Chad Mirkin, Schatz and their co-workers were able to make complex two-dimensional shapes, a representation of a shape created is shown to the right.|$|E
