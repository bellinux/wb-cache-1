Whilst the fortune of the field was wholly with the Regicides, nothing was thought of but to follow where it led: and it led to everything. Not so much as a talk of treaty. Laws were laid down with arrogance. The most {{moderate}} politician in their clan[24] was chosen as the organ, not so much for prescribing limits to their claims as to mark what for the present they are content to leave to others. They made, not laws, not conventions, not late possession, but physical Nature and political convenience the sole foundation of their claims. The Rhine, the Mediterranean, and the ocean were the bounds which, for the time, they assigned to the Empire of Regicide. What was the Chamber of Union of Louis the Fourteenth, which astonished and provoked all Europe, compared to this declaration? In truth, with these limits, and their principle, they would not have left even the shadow of liberty or safety to any nation. This plan of empire was not taken up in the first intoxication of unexpected success. You must recollect that it was projected, just as the report has stated it, from the very first revolt of the faction against their monarchy; and it has been uniformly pursued, as a standing maxim of national policy, from that time to this. It is generally in the season of prosperity that men discover their real temper, principles, and designs.

The first of these standards, then, exhibits an increase, according to my former schemes of comparison, from an eleventh to a twentieth part of the whole duty.[50] The Post-Office gives still less consolation to those who are miserable in proportion as the country feels no misery. From the commencement of the war to the month of April, 1796, the gross produce had increased by nearly one sixth of the whole sum which the state now derives from that fund. I find that the year ending 5th of April, 1793, gave 627,592l., and the year ending at the same quarter in 1796, 750,637l., after a fair deduction having been made for the alteration (which, you know, on grounds of policy I never approved) in your privilege of franking. I have seen no formal document subsequent to that period, but I have been credibly informed there is very good ground to believe that the revenue of the Post-Office[51] still continues to be regularly and largely upon the rise.|$|E

The probability and other parameters of this "bankruptcy" outcome depend on the interest rate level and the producer characteristics, such as production costs and the productivity distribution.

It is shown that the possibility to buy government support affects the use of that part of the revenue which might be necessary to service the debt in adverse states of nature. One possible consequence is then a replacement of the equilibrium with zero bankruptcy probability with the one involving bankruptcy under unsuccessful project outcomes.

Among the three categories, life insurance, nonlife insurance and health insurance third one has become more prominent than the two due to the changing global environmental and cultural differences. In India getting minimum health service is still under construction stage. Particularly rural India is suffering a lot. The infrastructural facilities we are having and the per capita spent on health reveals the <b>adverse</b> <b>state</b> of the industry. The maximum amount spent on health is from out of pocket only in India. These circumstances are the best opportunities to the insurer to tap the market.

40|$|The {{collateral}} order {{doctrine is}} perhaps the most significant exception to the general rule that only final judgments are appealable. The doctrine is particularly important in antitrust litigation when a defendant asserts state action immunity, often referred to as Parker immunity. However, the circuit courts have struggled with the question of whether a denial of Parker immunity is immediately appealable as a collateral order.

This Article argues that a governmental entity that is deemed part of a state should be able to use the interlocutory appeal process to obtain review of an order denying Parker immunity.

The food scientists’ response to the chronic nutritional problem has often been subsidized bio-fortification with nutritional supplements or more recently cultivars with higher nutrient levels. Where much {{of the population is}} in this inadequate nutrition category as in highland Ethiopia, the supplements are neither financially feasible nor sustainable. The cultivars can provide a few critical nutrients but are not a comprehensive solution. To improve nutrition, it is necessary to increase income so that an increased quality and quantitative diet can be obtained. Here we evaluate a strategy to introduce new agricultural technologies where a central aspect of evaluation is combining the nutritional and income goals. This analysis is undertaken in the Qobo valley, Amhara state, Ethiopia. Using behavioralist criteria for decision making defined by the farmers, the effects of different potential combinations of technologies and supporting agricultural policies on the household nutritional gaps and farmers’ incomes are analyzed. An integrated approach involving the combined technologies of water harvesting, fertilization and Striga resistance combined with improved credit programs has the potential to increase income by 31 % and to eliminate malnutrition except in the most <b>adverse</b> <b>state</b> of nature (10 % probability).

Circulating adiponectin increases in lean {{states such as}} caloric restriction (CR), but {{the reasons for this}} paradox remain unclear. Unlike white adipose tissue (WAT), bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increases during CR, and both MAT and serum adiponectin increase in many other clinical conditions. Thus, we investigated whether MAT contributes to circulating adiponectin. We find that adiponectin secretion is greater from MAT than WAT. Notably, specific inhibition of MAT formation in mice results in decreased circulating adiponectin during CR despite unaltered adiponectin expression in WAT. Inhibiting MAT formation also alters skeletal muscle adaptation to CR, suggesting that MAT exerts systemic effects. Finally, we reveal that both MAT and serum adiponectin increase during cancer therapy in humans. These observations identify MAT as an endocrine organ that contributes significantly to increased serum adiponectin during CR and perhaps in other <b>adverse</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

This result {{was not nearly}} as surprising as the fact that the Court granted certiorari on a case that turned on an obscure aspect of Florida property law: whether landowners adjacent to a beach had the rights to future accretions of sand and to maintain contact with the water. The Court’s curious interest in the case was piqued by the landowners’ recasting the case from the regulatory taking claim they unsuccessfully pursued in the Florida courts to the judicial taking claim they argued before the Supreme Court. The petitioners contended that the Florida Supreme Court’s interpretation of Florida property law warranted constitutional compensation because the effect was to replace an eroded, hurricane-ravaged private beach with a restored, publicly-accessible beach. Although no member of the Court agreed that the lower court’s opinion amounted to a taking, a four-member plurality, led by Justice Scalia and encouraged by numerous amicus briefs filed by libertarian property groups, gave a ringing endorsement to the concept of judicial takings. Moreover, two other members of the Court, Justices Kennedy and Sotomayor, claimed that state court property law interpretations could be cabined by the Due Process Clause.

40|$|Endocrine and anti-EGFR {{strategies}} {{are used to}} treat breast cancer. Unfortunately, resistance can be acquired. Deciphering resistance mechanisms remains essential to design treatments for this <b>adverse</b> <b>state.</b> Oxidative stress is the cellular imbalance of pro-oxidants (promoting cell death) and antioxidants (facilitating cell survival and chemotherapy/radiotherapy resistance). However, it remains unexplored whether endocrine or anti-EGFR resistance also associates with altered redox balance. In this project, redox balance was examined using in vitro human resistant breast cancer models TAMR, FASR, X-MCF and NEW DUBS, comparing with responsive w/tMCF 7 cells using microarray analysis, PCR, and TAC, ROS, or MTT assays. Pro-oxidant levels increased significantly in all resistant models but this did not impact adversely on growth. Significantly increased antioxidant levels were also observed in all resistant models, perhaps limiting pro-oxidant increases to maintain cell survival. Antioxidants were also significantly induced by antihormones in w/tMCF 7 cells that may limit apoptosis with early treatment. Expression of 15 antioxidant genes increased in resistant cells spanning multiple resistant states. While gefitinib challenge revealed many antioxidant genes were EGFR/kinase signalling-regulated in TAMR cells, gefitinib and further signal transduction inhibitors (STIs) indicated total antioxidant capacity was not. Thus, additional genes/signalling probably drive increased antioxidants in resistant cells future deciphering and depletion of antioxidants could feasibly block cell survival in multiple resistant states. Several STIs further increased pro-oxidants in TAMR cells, indicating oxidative stress was also not EGFR/kinase-promoted since STIs also further increased antioxidant capacity, this may again limit pro-oxidant increases and hence apoptotic effect. Importantly, the thesis revealed resistant cells may be particularly sensitive to agents inducing excessive oxidative stress. Redox balance and feasibility of agents influencing redox remains complex. However, new findings and concepts emerging from this thesis are worthy of future exploration for potential treatments for resistance to endocrine/anti-EGFR agents.

40|$|The {{ability to}} respond to hostile {{environmental}} conditions is critical for the survival of an organism. Oxidative stress is an <b>adverse</b> <b>state</b> in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate to a harmful level and, if left unresolved, can lead to cellular dysfunction and organismal disease. Sophisticated detoxification systems, characterized by a battery of enzymatic antioxidants, are utilized to neutralize ROS thereby reducing stress. However, ROS are also purposefully produced by designated cellular enzymes to facilitate the signaling and regulation of critical physiological processes. Therefore, both the production and neutralization of ROS must be tightly controlled. Indeed, the expression of detoxification enzymes is regulated by major oxidative stress response transcription factors, such as Nrf 2 and SKN- 1 in mammals and the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively. The activity of both Nrf 2 and SKN- 1 is highly regulated and many conserved mechanisms are used to facilitate proper control of these two transcription factors, making C. elegans a powerful tool in which to study the complex regulation of the major oxidative stress response transcription factors. Herein, we uncover a novel mechanism of SKN- 1 regulation, in which a thioredoxin, TRX- 1, negatively impacts the intestinal subcellular localization of this transcription factor in a cell non-autonomous manner from the ASJ neurons. This function of TRX- 1 is specific, as SKN- 1 regulation is not a common role for other C. elegans thioredoxins. Moreover, SKN- 1 regulation is a redox-independent function of TRX- 1 and does not impact transcriptional activation or previously characterized SKN- 1 -dependent protective responses, such as the oxidative or pathogen stress responses. Thioredoxins are understudied in C. elegans, but {{play an important role in}} worm lifespan. RNA Seq was used as an unbiased approach to determine potential physiological role(s) of TRX- 1.

In summary, TRX- 1 regulates SKN- 1 in a manner which dissects subcellular localization and transcriptional activation, emphasizing the importance of strict regulation of SKN- 1 activation...|$|E
40|$|PRELIMINARY VERSION] This paper {{examines}} the e¤ect of debt and limited liability on investment timing in a duopoly with aggregate demand uncertainty and irreversible investment. Two patterns of investment emerge, {{depending on the}} parameter values and debt-levels. If debt levels of the competitors are su¢ciently di¤erent, an increase in debt delays investment. As debt-levels become more homogeneous, a race for market shares begins, as …rms wish to commit to not quitting the market …rst in <b>adverse</b> <b>states.</b> Moreover, …rms may engage in predatory investment, if the competitor has a comparably high debt burden. Therefore, debt has a strategic disadvantage. So this paper can explain both the relative low debt-ratios observed in most industries and the strong investment activities in exceptionally highly leveraged industries. Moreover, the model of this paper can explain predatory behavior of …rms with neither relying on reputational, on network- or learning-e¤ects, nor on de…ning predatory behavior as deviations from tacit collusion...|$|R

While time-of-day itself does not affect guesses, when combined with a trait-level sleepiness measure and previous night sleep, <b>adverse</b> sleep <b>states</b> lead to responses significantly farther from equilibrium. These results have implications for shift workers and others whose constraints or choices lead to adverse sleep parameters. Key Words:...|$|R

It presents a tax-smoothing model of borrowing on international financial markets by a sovereign government that endogenizes the debt limit for the government. Debt repayments can be state contingent, but these are interpreted in terms of renegotiated conventional bond contracts. The main contribution of the model is to show how private debtor information {{can be used to}} motivate the implementation of borrowing through the issuance of conventional bonds that are renegotiated only in <b>adverse</b> <b>states</b> after debt has reached a sufficiently high level. The model is used as a benchmark for considering how opportunistic behavior by individual bondholders can lead to inefficient outcomes. This part of the paper recapitulates how coordination failures arise in {{theoretical models}} of sovereign debt from exogenous enforcement of creditor rights. It also discusses how costly delays due to bondholder rent seeking might be mitigated by contractual 1 The emerging market financial crises of the last decade prompted widespread concern about th...|$|R
