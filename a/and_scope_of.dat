5|$|Following {{a three-month}} course at Staff College, Camberley, Garrett was {{appointed}} commandant of the Staff College, Queenscliff, Victoria, in June 1946. He was posted to Japan in March 1947, becoming Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in July. The size <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the occupation declined considerably during his tour, which finished in October 1949. Approximately 2,400 Australians, {{most from the}} 67th Battalion, remained by late 1948, compared to 11,000 in October 1946. In December 1949, Garrett resumed command of the Staff College, Queenscliff. Promoted temporary major general, he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Western Command, which covered the state of Western Australia, in August 1951. He became Deputy Chief of the General Staff in February 1953.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner quickly {{expanded}} the activities <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> his office, building a parallel state. This soon started {{a conflict with}} Puricelli. Instead of being fired, Kirchner resigned and accused the governor of reducing the funds for social-welfare. He ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987, and won by the slim margin of 110 votes. Kirchner's friend, Rudy Ulloa Igor, helped him to victory by registering some groups of Chilean immigrants to vote (immigrants were allowed to vote in mayoral elections), and persuading them to vote for Kirchner. Julio de Vido and Carlos Zannini began working with Kirchner at this time. Kirchner used the state-owned media to promote his activities. The Peronist Ricardo del Val was elected governor that year, and the province was impacted by inflation in 1989. Kirchner became the main opponent of del Val, who was impeached and removed from office in 1990 due to the inflation crisis.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{explanation}} for the "binding" process in programming languages. Current explanations [6] rely on a run-time search of an environment that consists of # ############ # pairs. The nature of this search and the ordering of the pairs are the critical factors in determining the meanings <b>and</b> <b>scopes</b> <b>of</b> the symbols. Instead of this, we propose explicit operations to perform "binding". Further, these operations are frequently performed at compile time, thus capturing the notion of early binding that characterizes most languages. The sequence in which these operations are performed replaces the previously mentioned searching as the determiner <b>of</b> the meanings <b>and</b> <b>scopes</b> <b>of</b> symbols...|$|R
5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death. Of the nine books he wrote, {{the first was a}} scholarly look at the methodology <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> experimental psychology. The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology could be used to eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front did not produce a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> aboriginal {{assimilation and}} acculturation on Taiwan {{has led to}} three general narratives of Taiwanese ethnic change. The oldest holds that Han migration from Fujian and Guangdong in the 17th century pushed the Plains Aborigines into the mountains, where they became the Highland peoples of today. A more recent view asserts that through widespread intermarriage between Han and aborigines between the 17th and 19th centuries, the aborigines were completely Sinicized. Finally, modern ethnographical and anthropological studies have shown a pattern of cultural shift mutually experienced by both Han and Plains Aborigines, resulting in a hybrid culture. Today people who comprise Taiwan's ethnic Han demonstrate major cultural differences from Han elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} paid {{the salaries of}} the governor, legislature, and judicial council, but did not provide funds for any additional governmental offices.

As the population increased, and revenues grew, so did the size <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the government with new offices being created at different times. The territory's primary source of revenue was from the sale of federal lands; the territory collected 3% of the proceeds of each sale. Property tax and trading ventures with the Native American tribes also provided lesser revenues.|$|E

5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they {{grew up listening to}} his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt {{he was the only one}} who could help them capture the size <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
5|$|The final straw was Henry's {{decision}} {{to give his}} youngest son John three major castles belonging to Young Henry, who first protested and then fled to Paris, followed by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey; Eleanor attempted to join them but was captured by Henry's forces in November. Louis supported Young Henry and war became imminent. Young Henry wrote to the pope, complaining about his father's behaviour, and began to acquire allies, including King William of Scotland and the Counts of Boulogne, Flanders and Blois—all of whom were promised lands if Young Henry won. Major baronial revolts broke out in England, Brittany, Maine, Poitou and Angoulême. In Normandy some of the border barons rose up and, {{although the majority of}} the duchy remained openly loyal, there {{appears to have been a}} wider undercurrent of discontent. Only Anjou proved relatively secure. Despite the size <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the crisis, Henry had several advantages, including his control of a large number of powerful royal castles in strategic areas, control of most of the English ports throughout the war, and his continuing popularity within the towns across his empire.|$|E
5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the size <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that {{because they were not}} worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E
