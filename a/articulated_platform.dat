40|$|At today, small {{tractors}} or (semi) -autonomous robotic systems {{able to move}} nimbly between wine rows on hills and/or in side-slope working {{activities are}} surely not common and still an exception. Indeed, the design of such a kind of versatile robotic platforms is still a challenge. One of the main problems is {{the stability of the}} overall vehicle [1] and the availability of real-time anti-overturning systems able to predict and avoid dangerous configurations. Conventional architectures, wheeled or tracked, have been usually exploited for such kind of attempts but, recently, new attention has been given to articulated-frame configurations [2, 3]. Wheeled articulated vehicles are made of two parts, each one made of an axle with two wheels, linked together through a 2 Degree of Freedom (DoF) universal “articulation joint”. The yaw DoF actively modifies the system steering angle, while the roll DoF is passive allowing the adaptation of the system to uneven terrains. Despite safety concerns and rapid evolution of both tractors and mobile robotic systems, little research has been made on the different stability and steering behaviours of the <b>articulated</b> <b>platforms</b> with respect to the conventional fixed-chassis ones [4]. This work wants to resume our current research stage on the study and development of a non-conventional (semi) -autonomous articulated robotic system suitable for side-slope activities. In particular, a numerical implementation and validation of an effective quasi-static model for the stability analysis of non-conventional <b>articulated</b> <b>platforms</b> has been done. Once the model is available, the analysis of the most critical configurations that can lead to a rollover have been highlighted, a stability index defined, and the locking effect, in terms of increment of the stability margin, of the 2 nd DoF of the articulated joint investigated. Finally, a simple and cheap real-time anti-overturning mechatronic device based on a Microchip microcontroller and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), able to both predict critical configurations and to either alert the user in case of a driven vehicle or to actively react to avoid the possible overturning in case of an autonomous system, has been designed and developed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a principled {{way to think}} about articulated movement for artificial agents and a measurement of platforms that produce such movement. In particular, in human-facing scenarios, the shape evolution of robotic platforms will become essential in creating systems that integrate and communicate with human counterparts. This paper provides a tool to measure the expressive capacity or expressivity of <b>articulated</b> <b>platforms.</b> To do this, it points to the synergistic relationship between computation and mechanization. Importantly, this way of thinking gives an information theoretic basis for measuring and comparing robots of increasing complexity and capability. The paper will provide concrete examples of this measure in application to current robotic platforms. It will also provide a comparison between the computational and mechanical capabilities of robotic platforms and analyze order-of-magnitude trends over the last 15 years. Implications for future work made by the paper are to provide a method by which to quantify movement imitation, outline a way of thinking about designing expressive robotic systems, and contextualize the capabilities of current robotic systems.

A complete mobile integrated system is presented for the inspection and maintenance of concrete surfaces in tunnels. It allows performance of operations with minimum interference on passing traffic. The core of this system resides in a specially designed light-weight robotic tool, which is sensed and automated for processes. Sensing includes vision and a laser telemeter to assure precise inspection, superficial preparation, and composite application. The designed interconnection flange allows simple and robust attachment of the tool to a robotic arm's tip. The robot&-tool set is to be mounted on a standard <b>articulated</b> lift <b>platform.</b> Therefore, an operator can direct the platform and the robot&-tool set's operations from a control station placed at ground-level, in a wheeled vehicle on which the <b>articulated</b> lift <b>platform</b> is mounted.

40|$|While the {{boundaries}} between Reform, Conservative and Orthodox Judaism are as clear today as they have ever been, this was not always the case. My work seeks to understand how Conservative Judaism emerged as its own unified movement, and I argue that it was created by Solomon Schechter's disciples. Solomon Schechter, the charismatic leader of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, believed that he could revitalize and unite traditional American Jewry. His disciples heartily adopted this message, and united by close friendships with Schechter and with each other, made it their life's mission to realize Schechter's dream. Before his death, Schechter and his disciples created the United Synagogue of America. This organization was a big tent, allowing all of Schechter's disciples {{to work together to}} implement his vision in an environment that both acknowledged and respected their differences of opinion. Their ability to work together, however, deceived them into thinking that they could still unite traditional Jewry behind Schechter's message. Orthodox rabbis who did not study under Schechter saw no need for a United Synagogue, though they were welcome to join. They were particularly galled by the presence of rabbis who did not even consider themselves Orthodox, and saw little benefit in sharing power with those more liberal rabbis. It was because the United Synagogue was a big tent, willing to accept diversity of opinion, that non-Seminary rabbis created their own organizations, forcing the United Synagogue to reluctantly create a program of its own. As it became clear to Schechter's disciples that their separate program was becoming a movement, they tried valiantly to <b>articulate</b> a <b>platform.</b> Ironically, the very big tent that forced them to become a movement now prevented them from defining its boundaries. With so many differences of opinion, and united only by their commitment to their teacher and to each other, Schechter's disciples were never able to <b>articulate</b> a <b>platform.</b> They did, however, create the Conservative movement, and left it to future generations to define its boundaries.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} the type {{synthesis}} of two degree-of-freedom (2 -DoF) rotational parallel mechanisms (RPMs) that would be applied as mechanisms actuating the inter-satellite link antenna. Based upon Lie group theory, two steps are necessary to synthesize 2 -DoF RPMs except describing the continuous desired motions of the moving platform. They are respectively generation of required open-loop limbs between the fixed base and the moving platform and definition of assembly principles for these limbs. Firstly, all available displacement subgroups or submanifolds are obtained readily according to that the continuous motion of the moving platform is the intersection of those of all open-loop limbs. These subgroups or submanifolds are used to generate all the topology structures of limbs. By describing {{the characteristics of the}} displacement subgroups and submanifolds intuitively through employing simple geometrical symbols, their intersection and union operations can be carried out easily. Based on this, the assembly principles of two types are defined to synthesize all 2 -DoF RPMs using obtained limbs. Finally, two novel categories of 2 -DoF RPMs are provided by introducing a circular track and an <b>articulated</b> rotating <b>platform,</b> respectively. This work can lay the foundations for analysis and optimal design of 2 -DoF RPMs that actuate the inter-satellite link antenna...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Science is {{becoming}} data-intensive, requiring new software architectures that can exploit resources at all scales: local GPUs for interactive visualization, server-side multi-core machines with fast processors and large memories, and scalable, pay-as-you-go cloud resources. Architectures that seamlessly and flexibly exploit all three platforms are largely unexplored.

We then analyze a variety of candidate architectures spanning all three <b>platforms,</b> <b>articulate</b> their tradeoffs and requirements, and evaluate their performance. We conclude that although “pushing the computation to the data ” is generally the optimal strategy, no one single architecture is optimal in all cases and client-side processing cannot be made obsolete by cloud computing. Rather, rich visual data analytics applications benefit from access to a variety of cross-scale, seamless “client + cloud ” architectures. ...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The responses of an <b>articulated</b> loading <b>platform</b> (ALP) in regular and irregular unidirectional waves (with or without currents) are investigated both in frequency and time domain. The first- and second-order wave diffraction radiation are solved by the ring source boundary integral equation method, and the viscous drag forces are computed from the modified Morison equation. The two-term Volterra series and linearized drag force model are used for the spectral analyses in frequency domain, while the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for the time-domain integration of the nonlinear equation of motion. It is shown that the linear wave-body interaction theory combined with the linearized drag model appears to be satisfactory in computing wave- frequency responses in regular and irregular waves. However, the natural frequency of the ALP pitch motion is typically small, thus the linear theory alone is not adequate to evaluate the resonant slowly-varying pitch responses in random seas, for which the second-order difference-frequency wave loads play the most important role. These low-frequency responses can be greater than the wave-frequency responses depending on the available damping, hence need to be included for the reliable motion analyses of an ALP. Finally, the current effects on the response of the ALP are also investigated. It is seen that the presence of currents significantly increases the mean pitch angle, while tends to decrease both wave- and low-frequency dynamic responses...|$|R
