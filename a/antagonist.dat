5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional <b>antagonist</b> assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an <b>antagonist</b> is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given <b>antagonist</b> by determining the concentration of <b>antagonist</b> needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the <b>antagonist,</b> and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and <b>antagonist</b> of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the <b>antagonist.</b> For some <b>antagonist,</b> {{there may be a}} distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive <b>antagonist</b> drugs, there may be a shift in the log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E
50|$|A histaminergic agent (or drug) is a {{chemical}} which functions to directly modulate the histamine {{system in the}} body or brain. Examples include histamine receptor agonists and histamine receptor <b>antagonists</b> (or antihistamines). Subdivisions of histamine <b>antagonists</b> include H1 receptor <b>antagonists,</b> H2 receptor <b>antagonists,</b> and H3 receptor <b>antagonists.</b>|$|R
5000|$|H2 <b>antagonists</b> are {{a type of}} antihistamine, {{although}} in common use the term [...] "antihistamine" [...] is often reserved for H1 <b>antagonists,</b> which relieve allergic reactions. Like the H1 <b>antagonists,</b> some H2 <b>antagonists</b> function as inverse agonists rather than receptor <b>antagonists,</b> due to the constitutive activity of these receptors.|$|R
25|$|Chemicals that {{deactivate}} the NMDA receptor {{are called}} <b>antagonists.</b> NMDAR <b>antagonists</b> fall into four categories: Competitive <b>antagonists,</b> which bind to and block the binding {{site of the}} neurotransmitter glutamate; glycine <b>antagonists,</b> which bind to and block the glycine site; noncompetitive <b>antagonists,</b> which inhibit NMDARs by binding to allosteric sites; and uncompetitive <b>antagonists,</b> which block the ion channel by binding to a site within it.|$|R

5|$|The {{affinity}} of an <b>antagonist</b> for its {{binding site}} (Ki), i.e. {{its ability to}} bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The affinity of an <b>antagonist</b> can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression {{can be used to}} determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 {{in the presence of a}} competitive <b>antagonist</b> as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of <b>antagonist</b> used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of <b>antagonist</b> for a range of <b>antagonist</b> concentrations. The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, <b>antagonist</b> concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an <b>antagonist)</b> from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.|$|E

50|$|Intense {{efforts have}} been carried out to design both {{competitive}} and non-competitive TRPV1 <b>antagonists.</b> <b>Antagonists</b> that bind to the agonist binding site, and lock the channel in the closed, nonconductive state are competitive <b>antagonists.</b> In contrast, <b>antagonists</b> that interact with additional binding sites on the receptor structure preventing receptor opening by the agonist or blocking its aqueous pore are non-competitive <b>antagonists.</b> Non-competitive <b>antagonists</b> acting as open channel blockers are therapeutically attractive because of their recognition of over-activated TRPV1 channels, which can reduce the potential of unwanted side effects.|$|R

5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an <b>antagonist,</b> but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical <b>antagonist</b> but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E

5000|$|AR <b>antagonists</b> act by {{directly}} binding to and competitively displacing androgens like testosterone and DHT {{from the}} AR, thereby {{preventing them from}} activating the receptor and mediating their biological effects. AR <b>antagonists</b> are classified into two types, based on chemical structure: steroidal and nonsteroidal. Steroidal AR <b>antagonists</b> are structurally related to steroid hormones like testosterone and progesterone, whereas nonsteroidal AR <b>antagonists</b> are not steroids and are structurally distinct. Steroidal AR <b>antagonists</b> tend to have off-target hormonal actions due to their structural similarity to other steroid hormones. In contrast, nonsteroidal AR <b>antagonists</b> are selective for the AR and have no off-target hormonal activity. For this reason, they are sometimes described as [...] "pure" [...] antiandrogens.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe recent {{development}} of selective and highly potent nonpeptide <b>antagonists</b> for peptide receptors has constituted {{a major breakthrough}} {{in the field of}} neuropeptide research. Following the discovery of the first nonpeptide <b>antagonists</b> for peptide receptors ten years ago, numerous other <b>antagonists</b> have been developed for most neuropeptide families. These new, metabolically stable compounds, orally active and capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, offer clear advantages over the previously available peptide <b>antagonists.</b> Nonpeptide <b>antagonists</b> have provided valuable tools to investigate peptide receptors at the molecular, pharmacological and anatomical levels, and have considerably advanced our understanding of the pathophysiological roles of peptides in the CNS and periphery. Evidence from animal and clinical studies suggests that nonpeptide <b>antagonists</b> binding to peptide receptors could be useful for the treatment of disease states associated with high levels of neuropeptides.
