5|$|When Love Was Blind is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on young blind woman, May Read, who is saved from her burning home by Frank Larson. In the act of saving her, Frank is disfigured, but the two fall and love, marry and have a child. Two years later, the family physician offers to restore May's sight through a surgery. Frank consents despite his fears that May will not love him if she gazes upon his disfigured face.

Henderson and starred Lucille Younge, the film was a critical success. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

He comforts her and, as he escorts her back to the hotel, they come across one of the Polish women. He wonders how much she saw. That evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room.

500|$|Three {{months into}} her hiatus in March 2010, Beyoncé began {{recording}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> Jay-Z's Roc the Mic Studios in New York City. One song—"Party"—was recorded {{because she wanted}} to see what working relationship would develop with engineer DJ Swivel. Kanye West assisted the production of [...] "Party" [...] after Beyoncé was impressed by his work on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010). André 3000, the only featured artist on 4, contributed a rap verse to the song, which he recorded in Georgia.|$|E
500|$|The pair's first {{appeared}} together on television at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards, {{in what has}} been described as a [...] "memorable moment". Holding hands, the couple walked onto the stage in New York. In front of a television audience of 250 million, Jackson announced, [...] "Just think, nobody thought this would last", before embracing Presley in a kiss. Afterward, Presley became angered <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> feeling he had used her. The male pop singer reasoned that the liplock, which was dubbed [...] "The Kiss of the Century", would be talked about for decades, with people playing the clip over and over. Jackson's attempts at placating his wife proved futile; she told the singer not to [...] "fucking even come near me" [...] and remained angry for several days.|$|E

The track used Curtis Mayfield's 1972 [...] "Think (Instrumental)", from the Super Fly soundtrack. [...] "Resentment" [...] was first included on a documentary of Victoria and David Beckham, titled The Real Beckhams (2004). The DVD captures {{the family as}} they move to Spain, and features Victoria Beckham launching her newest singles to date. The Sun, noted Victoria Beckham's multiple songs about a possible affair and read into the [...] "poignant lyrics" [...] as a stab <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> David Beckham. [...] "Resentment" [...] along with [...] "Valentine", [...] "Me And You This Time", and [...] "That Dude" [...] {{were meant to be}} on Beckham's third solo-album Come Together, which was later shelved, forcing the song to be included exclusively on the documentary DVD.|$|E

500|$|On September 12, Willkie began a whistle-stop tour by train, {{and between}} then and November 2, he reached 31 of the 48 states. He did not visit the Solid South, though he spoke in Texas, hoping to win it as Hoover had in 1928. Willkie filled the Los Angeles Coliseum with 70,000 middle-class supporters, but reporters saw few working-class people at his rallies, and he {{cancelled}} some appearances at auto plants in the Midwest. [...] Other people in working-class areas booed the candidate, held up signs in support of Roosevelt, or pelted his motorcade with overripe fruit. Although Edith Willkie accompanied her husband on his tour (he had little time for contact with Van Doren), she disliked the media attention and did not give interviews, completing the campaign without ever giving a speech. On one occasion, she looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> and stated, [...] "Politics makes strange bedfellows". The Democrats knew of Willkie's affair with Van Doren, but the Republicans had letters from Henry A. Wallace, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, to his former guru, Russian mystic Nicholas Roerich, and neither issue became {{a factor in the}} campaign.|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen {{writing for}} Vulture {{described}} the song as an [...] "appealing" [...] record {{and one of}} the best collaborations between the duo throughout their careers. He concluded that [...] "Jay's rap is goofy but not embarrassing." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly termed Beyoncé's rap as [...] "truculent" [...] and noted that [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] is one of the few songs of the album that displays scale-busting. Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] finds Beyoncé [...] "rapping lasciviously and making eyes <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> It's about 100 times better than that description allows for." [...] Julia Leconte from Now praised the singer's [...] "perfect" [...] growling vocals. Chris Kelly of FACT magazine dubbed the song as the [...] "requisite duet with Jay Z (whose Ike Turner-referencing verse caps off a year of cringeworthy efforts)". Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan felt that the lines in which Beyoncé ad-libbed [...] "surfboard" [...] were [...] "some of the most infectious snippets of pop music in 2013", elaborating [...] "the single word serving as both shorthand for woman-on-top and a neat summation of an entire era of trends in rap cadence". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described the track as a [...] "frisky reverie". Likewise, Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club wrote: ...|$|E

[...] When her husband grabbed the gun, Mrs. Welsh walked to her husband's pool room near the station where she [...] "smashed in the windows and generally demolished things."

2500|$|It {{is thought}} that the couple are already married because of the woman's headdress. A non-married woman would have her hair down, {{according}} to Margaret Carroll. The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles – the woman stands near the bed and well into the room, symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house, whereas Giovanni stands near the open window, symbolic of {{his role in the}} outside world. [...] Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer, his wife gazes obediently <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> His hand is vertically raised, representing his commanding position of authority, whilst she has her hand in a lower, horizontal, more submissive pose. However, her gaze <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> can also show her equality to him because she is not looking down at the floor as lower class women would. They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal, not his subordinate.|$|E
