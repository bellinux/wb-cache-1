5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure <b>and</b> <b>tension.</b> Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E

5|$|Neither the Ngô family nor the Buddhists {{were happy}} with the agreement, however, and it failed to solve the dispute. Both sides accused the other of failing to uphold their obligations; the {{government}} accused the Buddhists of continuing to vilify them in demonstrations, while the Buddhists accused Diệm of stalling and not acting on his commitments to religious reform, and continuing to detain arrested Buddhist dissidents.

5|$|Originally {{slated for}} a {{theatrical}} release in November 2007, its release date was postponed, and it received a wide theatrical release on May 30, 2008. It grossed $82.4 {{million at the}} box office worldwide. Although a box office hit, it received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere <b>and</b> <b>tension,</b> and others criticizing its script and characters. Contemporary film scholars have interpreted the film as a criticism of the perceived safety of pastoral life, as well as an exploration of stranger-on-stranger violence.|$|E

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume.

Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E

5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, Control Data and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts with cultural {{institutions such as the}} Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, and the Walker Art Center.|$|E
5|$|The de Lacy family {{controlled}} Longtown Castle until Walter de Lacy's {{death in}} 1234. John Fitzgeoffrey then acquired the castle, {{during a period}} of increased conflict <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> between the Welsh princes Llywelyn the Great and Dafydd ap Llywelyn and the English marcher lords. The castle then passed to John Verdon and his sons, who struggled with local lawlessness and the Welsh revolts which continued {{until the end of the}} century. Edward temporarily confiscated the castle and estates from John's son, Theobald Verdon, and in 1316 the castle passed to Bartholomew de Berghersh. The castle continued to be used as a fortification, and in 1317 orders were given to garrison it with 30 men.|$|E
5|$|When Charles had {{announced}} {{that he wanted to}} work on an album of country music in 1961, during a period of racial segregation <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> in the United States, he received generally negative commentary and feedback from his peers, including fellow R musicians and ABC-Paramount executives. The country album concept, however, meant more to Charles as a test of his record label's faith in him and respect for his artistic freedom than as a test of social tolerance among listeners amid racial distinctions of country and R Fueled by his esteem for creative control, Charles pitched the idea of a country album to ABC representatives. Following the successful lobby of the concept and a contract renewal in early 1962, which was linked to the launching of his own Tangerine label, Charles prepared his band for the recording sessions that produced Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.|$|E

5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E
