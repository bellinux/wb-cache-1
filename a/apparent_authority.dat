5|$|Gilli was an eleventh-century Hebridean {{chieftain}} {{whose career}} coincided with {{an era of}} Orcadian overlordship in the Kingdom of the Isles. According to mediaeval saga-tradition, Gilli was a brother-in-law of Sigurðr Hlǫðvisson, Earl of Orkney, having married the latter's sister Hvarflǫð. Traditionally {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful Orcadian earls, Sigurðr appears to have extended his authority into the Isles in the late tenth century. Gilli apparently acted as Sigurðr's viceroy or tributary earl in the region. The time frame of Gilli's <b>apparent</b> <b>authority</b> in the Isles is uncertain, and may date as early as the reign of Guðrøðr Haraldsson, King of the Isles, or as late as the period following the death of this man's eventual successor, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. Gilli's name is probably Gaelic in origin, and he seems to have seated himself on either Coll or Colonsay, islands in the Inner Hebrides. It is possible that Gilli is identical to Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn, an Uí Ímair dynast who was slain at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. If not, another possibility is that he was the father of a certain Conamal/Conmáel who was killed in 980.|$|E
5|$|Ímar's {{probable}} uncle, Sitriuc, ruled Dublin {{for almost}} fifty years between 989 and 1036. There {{is reason to}} suspect that the latter's realm included Mann by the second or third decade of the eleventh century. His reign in Dublin was finally put to an end by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065), who drove Sitriuc from the coastal town and claimed the kingship for himself. Previously, Sitriuc seems to have been closely aligned with Knútr Sveinnsson (died 1035), ruler of the kingdoms of England, Denmark, and Norway. Knútr's <b>apparent</b> <b>authority</b> in the Irish Sea region, coupled with Sitriuc's seemingly close connections with him, could account for the remarkable security enjoyed by Sitriuc during Knútr's reign. It is possible that Echmarcach had been bound from taking action against Sitriuc whilst Knútr held power, and that the confusion caused by the latter's death in 1035 enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation and seize control of the Irish Sea region. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann by this date, Sitriuc {{does not appear to have}} taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This seems to suggest that the island was outside Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E

Per the Court's ruling in Illinois v. Rodriguez (1990), a consent search is still considered valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an [...] "apparent authority", even if that party is later discovered to not have authority over the property in question.

40|$|Abstract. To {{identify}} the critical vector density that potentiates dengue outbreaks in an endemic site {{and to identify}} obstacles to anti-dengue activities, we correlated a series of dengue outbreaks in a Brazilian city with the intensity of its anti-vector source-reduction activities. The proportion of houses infested by vector mosquitoes correlated in-versely with intensity of anti-mosquito interventions, and the vector population developed independently of rainfall. Local periods of drought promoted vector abundance in two ways: residents stored water in which vector mosquitoes could breed, and cholera outbreaks due to contaminated water diverted local health workers from routine anti-vector activities. One dengue outbreak became <b>apparent</b> to <b>authorities</b> {{more than two months}} after it commenced but would have been identified almost immediately had dengue-like disease in indicator hospitals been monitored. Active sur-veillance, therefore, offers a window of opportunity for promptly executed anti-dengue interventions. Source-reduction measures that suppress vector infestations to less than 1 % of houses effectively avert outbreaks of dengue...|$|R
2500|$|Sylvan Barnet {{believes}} {{that in this}} adaptation, [...] "Kate and Petruchio fall in love {{almost as soon as}} they see each other." [...] Barbara Hodgdon has also pointed out that several times, Katherina can be seen gazing longingly at Petruchio. Critics have also noted that Katherina twice consciously makes the decision to go along with Petruchio. The first moment is behind the stained glass window, when she silently decides to marry him. The second is when she follows him after he leaves her at the gates of Padua. In this version, Katherina delivers her final speech seemingly without irony. Zeffirelli and Burton both wanted Elizabeth Taylor to deliver the speech ironically, a la Mary Pickford, but Taylor felt {{it would be better to}} speak seriously, and then undermine that seriousness by leaving the banquet without Petruchio, thus subverting his <b>apparent</b> <b>authority</b> over her. However, Elizabeth Schafer calls the film [...] "intensely conservative," [...] citing the controversial advertising blurb; [...] "A motion picture for every man who ever gave the back of his hand to his beloved...and for every woman who deserved it. Which takes in a lot of people! Russell Jackson argues the film [...] "offers a 1960s liberation more likely to appeal to Lawrentians than present-day feminists." [...] However, Schafer does go on to acknowledge that [...] "because of the sheer power of Taylor's presence, Katherina occupies a far more memorable filmic space than the dramatic space she has in the original play.|$|E

What {{do you think about the}} constitution? Will it work, do you fancy, now-a-days in France? The initiative of the laws, put out of the power of the legislative assembly, seems to me a stupidity; and the senators, in their fine dresses, make me wink a little. Also, I hear that the 'senatorial cardinals' don't please the peasants, who hate the priesthood as much as they hate the 'Cossacks.' On the other hand, Montalembert was certainly in bed the other day with vexation, because 'nobody could do anything with Louis Napoleon--he was obstinate;' 'nous nous en lavons les mains,' and that fact gives me hope that not too much indulgence is intended to the Church. There's to be a ball at the Tuileries with 'court dresses,' which is 'un peu fort' for a republic.

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} {{the ways in}} which the law primarily state law-has significantly redefined the American family in its response to third-party claims against parents for visitation rights with the children of those parents. Part II briefly addresses statutory and case law relating to visitation by grandparents, the most favored group of petitioners for visitation rights, and stepparents who have not fared nearly as well. After placing third-party visitation in its constitutional context, Part II also examines how the courts have treated 2 ̆ 2 coparent 2 ̆ 2 claims of a right to visitation, brought by former companions of natural parents who insist that they are de facto parents, parents by estoppel, psychological parents, and the like. It describes and analyzes the evolving law in this area from the earliest decisions when such coparent claims were routinely rejected, to the most recent cases, several of which have recognized such claims without any readily <b>apparent</b> statutory <b>authority.</b> Part III, summarizes the several opinions in Troxel v. Granville, the first third-party visitation case (in this instance concerning grandparents) that the United States Supreme Court has decided. Finally, Part III also reviews some state court decisions subsequent to Troxel, and assesses whether the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision has had or is likely to have any significant impact on state law in the areas of grandparent or other third-party visitation rights...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} genetic {{contributions}} to intelligence {{has been one}} of the longest-standing controversies in modern science. Although discussions over this issue can be traced back in one form or another to earliest times, the advances in biology in the 19 th century, Darwin ’s theory of evolution and the re discovery of Mendel’s Laws of inheritance at the dawn of the 20 th century add ed weight of <b>apparent</b> scientific <b>authority</b> to the claims of the IQists. Capron et al. show how the types of evidence considered acceptable with in this field of research have undergone constant revision. The field has progressively become more sophisticated in areas such as statistics, in consideration of the role of environment in the development of intelligence, and in modifying the earlier more deterministic representations of genetic influences. It would appear that we have come a long way from Galton’s 19 th century simplistic descriptions of famous successful families to current efforts to detect quantitative trait loci in the search for intelligence genes. Nevertheless, it is clear that the debate is still far from over. While most of those who are involved in research on this issue, largely trained in psycho logy, assert that there is consensus for a large heritability (40 - 80 %) of IQ (Neisser et al., 1996), the claim is received with considerable skepticism in other branches of psychology, among many geneticists and even by the once unquestioning media...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on the literatures of history, sociology, epidemiology, and microbiology, {{this thesis}} compares syphillis with human {{immunodeficiency}} virus, with special {{reference to the}} social and historical factors likely to be relevant to the control or eradication of acquired imune dificiency syndrom (AIDS). The sudden appearance of a new disease causing suffering and death in a community, engenders apprehension and fear which is often manifested as hysteria against, and vilification of, {{those who have the}} disease. This fear is greatly increased should the disease be sexually-transmitted. Syphilis in a venereal form, occured in Europe {{toward the end of the}} 15 th Century. Initially it was an acute, fulminating disease which rapidly spread through Europe and Asia. Attempts to control the disease have gone through periods of either partial successes or massive failures and have ended in frustration for the authorities. When the syndrome of acquired immune deficiency (AIDS) was first reported, it was seen in Western countries in homosexual men. However, as non-homosexual community members and children became infected, it became <b>apparent</b> to <b>authorities</b> that a pandemic was accurring. Within a few years, the disease was identified worldwide. Isolation of the virus (HIV- 1), and development of test for detection of carriers, plus restoration of clean blood and blood-product supplies, have reassured the community to some extent. The history of syphilis shows that neither the epidemiological medical, nor the economic political approaches to disease control work, although there are positive aspects resulting from both. It is social responses that will offer the most hope in the long term for the control of AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases...|$|R
