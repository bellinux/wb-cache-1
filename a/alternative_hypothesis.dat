5|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{suggest that}} lenticulae are {{actually}} small areas of chaos {{and that the}} claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images.

5|$|Complicating {{factors include}} {{claims that the}} {{relationship}} between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, {{particularly}} those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent {{with the ability to}} give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E

5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E
5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's herpetofauna {{consists}} of 25 amphibian species and 61 reptile species. The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade {{is believed to}} have arrived by flotsam dispersion from South America. Little evidence exists to support the <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of proto-Antillean vicariance. Other terrestrial herpetofauna are believed to have arrived to the West Indies (and Puerto Rico) by the same method and subsequently undergone vicarization by banks or islands. As a result, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in general, {{has one of the highest}} percentages of endemism among amphibians and reptiles in the world. Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families: Bufonidae (2 species), Hylidae (3), Leptodactylidae (18) and Ranidae (2). Reptiles include turtles (freshwater and marine), lizards, worm lizards, snakes and a caiman.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Marion Archibald and Valerie Fenwick {{proposed}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> {{based on the}} evidence of East Anglian coins and post-Conquest documents. Acknowledging that Beonna and Beornred were the same person, they suggested that after Ælfwald's death in 749, Æthelwald of Mercia installed Beornred/Beonna to rule northern East Anglia and Alberht (who probably belonged to the Wuffingas dynasty) to rule in the south. According to Archibald and Fenwick, after Æthelbald was murdered in 757, Beornred/Beonna became king of Mercia, during which his coinage was increased in East Anglia, perhaps to meet “military requirements”. Then, after a reign of only a few months, he was deposed by Offa and forced to flee from him back into East Anglia. Alberht, who had attempted to re-establish East Anglia as an independent kingdom and rule alone, and had succeeded for a short time, was deposed by Beornred/Beonna when he arrived as an exile in about 760. Soon afterwards, Offa asserted his authority over the East Angles in around 760-5 and removed Beonna.|$|E

40|$|The {{classical}} {{statistical model}} relates to n {{independent random variables}} having a common distribution. In this paper we consider the situation where the common distribution involves an unknown parameter, and where at time 0 <t < 1 only the first [nt] random variables are observed. The innovation approach is used to derive goodness of fit processes which especially detect alternatives under which the unknown parameter does not remain constant, but varies over time. The behaviour of these processes is investigated under the null hypothesis as well as under <b>alternative</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> Limiting Pitman efficacies of supremum type tests based on these processes are evaluated. Fixed change point <b>alternative</b> <b>hypotheses</b> and smooth <b>alternative</b> <b>hypotheses</b> receive additional treatment.

25|$|Statistical {{hypothesis}} testing {{is a key}} technique of both frequentist inference and Bayesian inference, although {{the two types of}} inference have notable differences. Statistical hypothesis tests define a procedure that controls (fixes) the probability of incorrectly deciding that a default position (null hypothesis) is incorrect. The procedure is based on how likely it would be for a set of observations to occur if the null hypothesis were true. Note that this probability of making an incorrect decision is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor whether any specific <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is true. This contrasts with other possible techniques of decision theory in which the null and <b>alternative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> are treated on a more equal basis.|$|E

However, age determination based on crater counts in high resolution Cassini images showed that Ithaca Chasma is older than Odysseus, making the impact hypothesis unlikely.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, {{the most}} important task in testing of uncertain hypotheses is the formulation of null and <b>alternative</b> <b>hypotheses</b> in a meaningful manner. It has two stages, namely, identifying a suitable uncertainty distribution (e.g., zigzag, normal, and lognormal distributions) for the given situation and the parametric values to be used under the null and <b>alternative</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> This can be accomplished using the works of Liu [3] and Wang and Peng [4] related to estimation of uncertainty distributions.|$|R
