The term 'supplicant' is also used interchangeably {{to refer to the}} software running on the client that provides credentials to the authenticator. The authenticator is a network device, such as an Ethernet switch or wireless access point; and the <b>authentication</b> <b>server</b> is typically a host running software supporting the RADIUS and EAP protocols.

5000|$|Authentication If the <b>authentication</b> <b>server</b> and supplicant {{agree on}} an EAP Method, EAP Requests and Responses are sent between the supplicant and the <b>authentication</b> <b>server</b> (translated by the authenticator) until the <b>authentication</b> <b>server</b> {{responds}} with either an EAP-Success message (encapsulated in a RADIUS Access-Accept packet), or an EAP-Failure message (encapsulated in a RADIUS Access-Reject packet). If authentication is successful, the authenticator sets the port to the [...] "authorized" [...] state and normal traffic is allowed, {{if it is}} unsuccessful the port remains in the [...] "unauthorized" [...] state. When the supplicant logs off, it sends an EAPOL-logoff message to the authenticator, the authenticator then sets the port to the [...] "unauthorized" [...] state, once again blocking all non-EAP traffic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{authentication}} scheme and new protocol for domain-based scenarios with inter-domain authentication. Our protocol is primarily intended for domain-structured Peer-to-Peer systems but is applicable for any domain scenario where clients from different domains wish to authenticate to each other. To this end, we {{make use of}} Trusted Third Parties {{in the form of}} Domain <b>Authentication</b> <b>Servers</b> in each domain. These act on behalf of their clients, resulting in a four-party protocol. If there is a secure channel between the Domain <b>Authentication</b> <b>Servers,</b> our protocol can provide secure authentication. To address the case where domains do not have a secure channel between them, we extend our scheme with the concept of trust-rating. Domain <b>Authentication</b> <b>Servers</b> signal security-relevant information to their clients (pre-existing secure channel or not, trust, [...] .). The clients evaluate this information to decide if it fits the security requirements of their application...|$|R

40|$|We {{revisit the}} problem of cross-domain secure {{communication}} between two users belonging to different security domains within an open and distributed environment. Existing approaches presuppose that either the users are in possession of public key certificates issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA), or the associated domain <b>authentication</b> <b>servers</b> share a long-term secret key. In this paper, we propose a four-party password-based authenticated key exchange (4 PAKE) protocol that takes a different approach from previous work. The users {{are not required to}} have public key certificates, but they simply reuse their login passwords they share with their respective domain <b>authentication</b> <b>servers.</b> On the other hand, the <b>authentication</b> <b>servers,</b> assumed {{to be part of a}} standard PKI, act as ephemeral CAs that “certify ” some key materials that the users can subsequently exchange and agree on a session key. Moreover, we adopt a compositional approach. That is, by treating any secure two-party password-based key exchange protocol and two-party asymmetric-key based key exchange protocol as black boxes, we combine them to obtain a generic and provably secure 4 PAKE protocol.

The user may select to have their computer remember their login: a newly signed-in user has an encrypted time-limited cookie stored on their computer and receives a triple DES encrypted ID-tag that previously has been agreed upon between the <b>authentication</b> <b>server</b> and the Microsoft account-enabled website. This ID-tag is then sent to the website, upon which the website plants another encrypted HTTP cookie in the user's computer, also time-limited.

If the out of sync condition is not a result of normal hardware token clock drift, correcting the synchronization of the <b>Authentication</b> Manager <b>server</b> clock with the out of sync token (or tokens) can be accomplished in several different ways. If the server clock had drifted and the administrator made a change to the system clock, the tokens can either be resynchronized one-by-one, or the stored drift values adjusted manually. The drift can be done on individual tokens or in bulk using a command line utility.|$|R
