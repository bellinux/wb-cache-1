500|$|In a {{commentary}} in the Financial Times entitled [...] "Olympus's deceit was dishonourable", John Gapper noted that [...] "It {{is still possible}} {{to believe that the}} accused trio of directors... thought they were behaving honourably... failure discreetly and not to make their predecessors lose face." [...] He noted that accounting scandals were not uniquely Japanese, but that it was [...] "a nice piece of corporate satire to conceal losses by exploiting the widespread habit of paying too much for acquisitions and writing them down [...] the 'advisory fee' was especially creative". Gapper criticised the weakness in governance, particularly how 12 out of 15 directors were either executives or former executives of the company, and that Hideo Yamada, head of the <b>Audit</b> <b>Board,</b> was complicit in the scam. He also noted that auditors KPMG and Ernst & Young would have to answer tough questions about why the manipulation was never discovered or properly questioned.|$|E

He was an {{excellent}} clerk, and did great credit to the important office {{to which he was}} attached--namely, that of the Episcopal <b>Audit</b> <b>Board.</b> He was much beloved by the other gentlemen who were closely connected with him in that establishment; and may be said, for the first year or two of his service, to have been, not exactly the life and soul, but, we may perhaps say with more propriety, the pervading genius of the room in which he sat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Macassar {{had many}} bosom friends at his office, {{to all of}} whom, one by one, he had confided the tale of his love. For a while he doubted to which of them he should confide the secret of his inspiration; but genius will not hide its head under a bushel; and thus, before long, did Macassar's song become the common {{property}} of the Episcopal <b>Audit</b> <b>Board.</b> Even the Bishops sang it, so Macassar was assured {{by one of his}} brother clerks who was made of a coarser clay than his colleague--even the Bishops sang it when they met in council together on their own peculiar bench.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{the nature}} of this will had been told in {{confidence}} by Macassar to some of his brother clerks, and was consequently well known at the Episcopal <b>Audit</b> <b>Board.</b> It had given rise there to a spirit of speculation against which the senior clerk had protested in vain. Bets were made, some in favour of Macassar, and some in that of the hospital; but of late the odds were going much against our hero. It was well known that in three short months he would attain that disastrous age, which, if it found him a bachelor, would find him also denuded of his legacy. And then how short a margin remained for the second event! The odds were daily rising against Macassar, and as he heard the bets offered and taken at the surrounding desks, his heart quailed within him.|$|E
