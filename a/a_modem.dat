The 'Longbow’ radar is the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows the Apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} radar unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The radar {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. <b>A</b> <b>modem</b> is interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Bandai never {{intended}} to develop a system with Internet connectivity in mind. However, Apple and Bandai received feedback from customers, indicating {{that they were looking}} for a system that could connect to the Internet. To make Internet connectivity possible, Apple had to incorporate <b>a</b> <b>modem</b> into the Pippin design. Two years earlier (1992), Apple had already moved away from the older serial interface with an external Hayes-compatible modem on its Macintosh systems, and switched to a serial interface which included GeoPort – a serial data technology that allowed software to emulate <b>a</b> <b>modem.</b> Implementing GeoPort into the Pippin platform required Apple to make a major change in its design – moving away from the 68030 footprint and to a PowerPC footprint. Apple chose the PowerPC 603 32-bit processor, as it was designed to be a low-cost, low-end processor for embedded use.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} application of <b>a</b> null <b>modem</b> was to connect two teleprinter terminals directly without using <b>modems.</b> <b>As</b> the RS-232 standard {{was adopted by}} other types of equipment, designers needed to decide whether their devices would have DTE-like or DCE-like interfaces.

25|$|The {{main problem}} with {{producing}} such <b>a</b> <b>modem</b> was forwarding commands from the computer. This could {{be addressed in}} internal modems that plugged directly into the computer's motherboard. Such modems {{had access to the}} computer's main memory, and by dedicating certain memory locations (or registers) to various status readouts or commands, software programs running on the computer could control the modem. This was a straightforward and thus a popular solution; the Novation APPLE-CAT II for the Apple II computer was an early programmable modem of this type.|$|E

Satellaview users could download gaming news and specially designed games, which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom titles, and released in installments. In the United States, the relatively short-lived XBAND allowed users to connect to a network via a dial-up modem to compete against other players around the country.|$|E
25|$|Several DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as FrontDoor, Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge {{from the}} early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without <b>a</b> <b>modem,</b> by using the {{freeware}} NetFoss Telnet FOSSIL driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer to dial an IP address or hostname via Telnet, rather than dialing a real POTS phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with DOSEMU (DOS emulator).|$|E

25|$|Prestel was a British information-retrieval {{system based}} on {{teletext}} protocols. However, it was essentially a different system, using <b>a</b> <b>modem</b> and the phone system to transmit and receive the data, comparable to systems such as France's Minitel. The modem was asymmetric, with data sent at 75-bit/s, and received at 1200-bit/s. This two-way nature allowed pages to be served on request, {{in contrast to the}} TV-based systems' sequential rolling method. It also meant that a limited number of extra services were available such as booking event or train tickets and a limited amount of online banking.|$|E

In December 1996, he pleaded guilty to twenty-five charges (the other six were dropped), was ordered to pay reparations of A$2,100 and released on a good behaviour bond, avoiding a heavier penalty resulting from the perceived absence of malicious or mercenary intent and his disrupted childhood.|$|E
