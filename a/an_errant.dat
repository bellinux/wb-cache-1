5|$|In Game 4 of the 2016 National League Division Series {{against the}} San Francisco Giants with the Cubs having a 2-1 series lead, Heyward reached on a bunt force out {{and moved to}} second on <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> throw.

5|$|For the defense, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams {{was the top}} performer. Williams had 10tackles, {{including}} 3.5tackles for loss, and one interception. Tech's Mikal Baaqee {{had eight}} tackles and one fumble recovery, making him the game's second-leading tackler. Auburn defender Derrick Graves was the most prolific tackler for the Tigers, making seven tackles and catching one interception of <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> Bryan Randall pass. Three players had one sack—two for Virginia Tech and one for Auburn.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{reasoned}} that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action but <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> conscience is only blameworthy {{if it is}} the result of culpable or vincible ignorance of factors that one has a duty to have knowledge of. Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from God) which encouraged human flourishing, rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures. In his Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.|$|E

A desert where the poet is <b>an</b> eternal <b>errant,</b> <b>a</b> {{stranger}} in his own language, where the representation is not possible anymore and what remains is multi-idiomatic fragmentation, roars, babbles, cacophonies, cries, screams and inversions.

5|$|On State's {{first play}} after the turnover, Rix was sacked for a four-yard loss. On the next play, Virginia Tech defender Eric Green jumped {{in front of}} <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> Rix pass and intercepted it. Green {{returned}} {{the ball to the}} State 44-yard line, and the Hokies' offense started a drive inside Florida State territory. On the first play of the drive, Tech attempted a reverse pass, but the ball fell incomplete. Two subsequent plays were stopped for no gain, and Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the game.|$|E
5|$|By 1986 the Flames landed {{forwards}} Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald, and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis, and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing {{second in}} the Smythe with a 40–31–9 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points), the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, setting up a showdown with the Oilers. Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games—the only time that the Flames defeated the Oilers in a playoff series during the decade. The series-winning goal came when <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net. The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, DCP Prabhakar and Sub-inspector Chari, who is Ambi's friend, {{investigate}} the murders committed by Anniyan. In disguises, they discover clues {{left behind by}} Anniyan, which are {{the names of the}} punishments he meted out to his victims. Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains the rationale behind them and says that only when every Indian is responsible and sincere will the country prosper on a par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.|$|E

5|$|Some foreign volunteers had no {{military}} experience and {{found themselves in}} a similar situation to the Rhodesian teenagers. These foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti-communist political views, hunger for adventure, turbulent personal lives in their home countries or some combination of these factors. The Canadian Mathew Charles Lamb joined 3 Commando, RLI in 1973, having just spent six years in a psychiatric hospital. In June 1966, aged 18, he had killed two strangers in a shooting spree in his home-town, but avoided the death penalty on a court ruling {{that at the time of}} the incident he had been insane. Keeping his past life a secret, he became a popular and well-regarded soldier in 3 Commando, and eventually rose to the rank of Lance-Corporal, taking command of a Fireforce stick on Operation Thrasher shortly before he was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> shot from one of his own men.|$|E
5|$|After Auburn's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{started its}} first drive {{of the second}} half at its 20-yard line. Down by 16 points, Tech needed to score. The Hokies gained a quick first down, but a five-yard penalty and a sack of Bryan Randall {{prevented}} Tech from gaining another. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Auburn took over at its 44-yard line. Despite having good field position, the Tigers went three and out. Following the punt, Virginia Tech reciprocated by also going three and out. With 3:47 remaining in the quarter, Auburn began an offensive drive from its 35-yard line. From the beginning of the drive, however, the Tigers had problems. The first play of Auburn's drive was a 10-yard penalty against the Tigers. The second resulted in a one-yard loss by Ronnie Brown, who attempted to rush through the middle of the defensive line. On the third play, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams intercepted <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> pass by Jason Campbell. Though Williams was unable to advance the ball, the Hokies still took over on offense, and with 2:38 remaining in the quarter, had their best field position since the first half.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, however, Cincinnati's offense managed to begin moving the ball effectively. On Cincinnati’s first {{play of the}} second half, halfback Roger Stephens broke through the Virginia Tech {{defensive}} line for 26 yards, taking the ball inside Virginia Tech territory. Cincinnati's drive would overcome two 15-yard penalties and one five-yard penalty {{en route to a}} touchdown just a few plays later. On its next possession, Cincinnati's All-American Roger Stephens again broke off another long run, this time for 19 yards, setting up another Bearcats' touchdown. Virginia Tech countered with a long drive that reached the Cincinnati 23-yard line before <b>an</b> <b>errant</b> pass was intercepted by the Bearcats in the end zone. Virginia Tech managed a defensive stop, however, and marched down the field for a touchdown to climb within six points. Cincinnati sealed its victory, however, when Bearcats' halfback Harold Johnson intercepted a Virginia Tech pass late in the fourth quarter, returning {{it all the way to}} the Virginia Tech 25-yard line. That return set up a Cincinnati touchdown and put the Bearcats up by the game's final score, 18–6.|$|E
