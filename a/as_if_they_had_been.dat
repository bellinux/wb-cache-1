5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from NYPD Blue, whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of the photographs were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked with not only creating the photographs that Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken from different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each photo was edited to give the photographs the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E

25|$|The values {{attached}} to experiences, {{and the values}} that {{are a part of}} the self-structure, in some instances, are values experienced directly by the organism, and in some instances are values introjected or taken over from others, but perceived in distorted fashion, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> experienced directly.|$|E

5000|$|In 1995, Victoria Husted Medvec and two colleagues {{reported}} that [...] "athletes {{who had just}} won silver medals tended to be less happy {{than those who had}} just won bronze medals." [...] The researchers explained this as follows: silver medalists felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> just missed out on a gold, while bronze medalists felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> almost not won anything.|$|R

25|$|At {{first he}} lodged with As'ad ibn Zurarah, but later Muhammad {{gave him a}} block of land on which he built his own house. He was made the brother in Islam of Sa'id ibn Zayd. Talhah and Sa'id missed {{fighting}} at the Battle of Badr because Muhammad sent them as scouts to locate Abu Sufyan's caravan. However, both were awarded shares of the plunder, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> present.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the region}} of Samaria was not seized at the very outset by those Jews {{returning}} from the Babylonian exile, the priests of Aaron's descent were still permitted to pass through their country, without fear of contracting defilement in respect to the country of the gentiles. Nonetheless, with respect to fruits and vegetables had in Samaria, there were some places in Samaria that were exempt from tithes, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a foreign land.|$|E
25|$|In some Baroque music neither split-chord nor triple-stop is {{appropriate}} and violinists will arpeggiate all chords (and even {{what appear to}} be regular double stops), playing all notes individually <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> written as a slurred figure. In some musical styles, a sustained open string drone can be played during a passage mainly written on an adjacent string, to provide a basic accompaniment. This is more often seen in folk traditions than in classical music.|$|E

25|$|Some synesthetes often {{report that}} they were unaware their {{experiences}} were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> keeping a secret their entire lives. The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not seem out of the ordinary. This involuntary and consistent nature helps define synesthesia as a real experience. Most synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant or neutral, although, in rare cases, synesthetes report that their experiences {{can lead to a}} degree of sensory overload.|$|E
25|$|Police {{brutality}} {{is measured}} {{based on the}} accounts {{of people who have}} experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases. This is because {{there is no way to}} quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. Because police brutality is relative to a situation, it depends on if the suspected person(s) is(are) resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> resisting. Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.|$|E
25|$|An {{examination}} of the four bodies which were found in May shifted the narrative as to what had occurred during the incident. Three of the ski hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles had major skull damage, and both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures. According to Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high, comparing it to {{the force of a}} car crash. Notably, the bodies had no external wounds related to the bone fractures, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> subjected to a high level of pressure. However, major external injuries were found on Dubinina, who was missing her tongue, eyes, part of the lips, as well as facial tissue and a fragment of skullbone; she also had extensive skin maceration on the hands. It was claimed that Dubinina was found lying face down in a small stream that ran under the snow and that her external injuries were in line with putrefaction in a wet environment, and were unlikely to be related to her death.|$|E

25|$|The {{kernel of}} Craig's monodramatic {{interpretation}} {{lay in the}} staging of the first court scene (1.2). The stage was divided sharply into two areas {{through the use of}} lighting: the background was brightly lit, while the foreground was dark and shadowy. The screens were lined up along the back wall and bathed in diffuse yellow light. From a high throne upon which Claudius and Gertrude sat, which was bathed in a diagonal, bright golden beam, a pyramid descended, representing the feudal hierarchy. The pyramid gave the illusion of a single, unified golden mass, from which the courtier's heads appeared to stick out through slits in the material. In the foreground in dark shadow, Hamlet lay slouched, as if dreaming. A gauze was hung between Hamlet and the court, further emphasising the division. On Claudius' exit-line the figures remained in place while the gauze was loosened, so that the entire court appeared to melt away before the audience's eyes, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a projection of Hamlet's thoughts that now had turned elsewhere. The scene, and the gauze effect in particular, prompted an ovation from the audience, which was unheard of at the MAT.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land {{to the world of}} the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E
25|$|Confederate commanders {{designated}} Enterprise, Mississippi as {{the rendezvous}} point (parole camp) for the Vicksburg parolees {{to report to}} after they got clear of the last Federal control point at Big Black Bridge. Most of the Arkansas units appeared to have bypassed the established parole camps, and possibly with the support or at least by the compliancy of their Union captors, simply crossed the river and returned home. Because {{so many of the}} Vicksburg parolees, especially from Arkansas, simply went home, Major General Pemberton requested Confederate President Davis to grant the men a thirty- to sixty-day furlough. The furloughs were not strictly adhered to so long as the soldier eventually showed up at a parole camp to be declared exchanged and returned to duty. Those who went directly home were treated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> home on furlough if they eventually reported into one of these two parole centers. The exchange declaration reports issued by Colonel Robert Ould in Richmond for various units in the Vicksburg and Port Hudson surrenders began in September 1863 based upon men who actually reported into one of the two parole camps. Pemberton eventually coordinated with the Confederate War Department and Confederate General Kirby Smith, commanding the Department of the Trans-Mississippi to have the Arkansas Vicksburg parolee's rendezvous point established at Camden, Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|Confederate commanders {{designated}} Enterprise, Mississippi as {{the rendezvous}} point (parole camp) for the Vicksburg parolees {{to report to}} after they got clear of the last Federal control point at Big Black Bridge. Most of the Arkansas units, including many survivors of McNally's Battery, appear to have bypassed the established parole camps, and possibly with the support, or at least by the compliancy, of their Union captors, simply crossed the river and returned home.

500|$|The Hollywood Reporter John DeFore {{called the}} film [...] "genuinely moving" [...] and [...] "effortlessly {{balanced}} ... Brett Pawlak's handheld camerawork and Cretton's unsentimental direction have a frankness that acknowledges the dramatic extremes in these lives without needing to parade {{it before the}} audience." [...] Manohla Dargis from The New York Times also praised Cretton's direction, saying he [...] "brings you into this coed group home {{and the lives of}} its inhabitants casually, with images and scenes that, no matter how transparently considered, feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> caught on the fly." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's genesis {{stems from}} the second season entry [...] "The Client", in which the office discovers Michael's {{incomplete}} screenplay for Threat Level Midnight. The episode features the reappearance of several actors and actresses who had not appeared on the show in years. Due {{to the nature of}} Michael's film, scenes were filmed to create the illusion <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shot years prior to the episode. [...] "Threat Level Midnight" [...] was viewed by 6.41 million viewers and received a 3.3 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49. The episode was the highest-rated NBC series of the week that it aired, and received acclaim from critics, many of whom enjoyed the humor and the continuity references to the show's past.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{not using}} the sets, the episode did re-use the Borg costumes from First Contact, which McNeill {{described}} as [...] "the scarier Borg" [...] compared to those seen previously in The Next Generation. This caused some problems with filming as an animatronic Borg arm used for the film was malfunctioning, leading to the production being stalled for several hours. For First Contact, the Borg had been re-designed by Michael Westmore and Deborah Everton. The former and his makeup team had worked on {{the look of the}} heads, which included a variety of different Borg appliances which could be mixed and matched to create an ongoing variety of looks. For example, Westmore's colleague Jake Garber had created ten different eye pieces. Everton, meanwhile, created the costumes for the Borg, and wanted them to be more elaborate than in previous appearances. This has been done with a view that individuals should look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> transformed from the inside out, {{rather than the other way}} around.|$|E
500|$|One of Camouflage's {{first major}} deceptions was the dummy railway at Misheifa. Barkas {{assigned}} the artist Steven Sykes {{to build a}} convincing dummy to divert enemy attention from the real railhead at Capuzzo bringing materiel for Operation Crusader. This complex deception involved [...] of dummy railway, a dummy train, dummy sidings, and a selection of dummy tanks, all made of gerida palm hurdles and other simple materials, to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> delivered by the railway. More than 100 bombs were dropped on the Misheifa railhead, at least halving {{the attacks on the}} real thing at Capuzzo, giving the lie to the jokes about wooden bombs being dropped on wooden railways by an undeceived enemy. Barkas noted that [...] "camouflage men must be among the few otherwise sane beings who yearn to be bombed." [...] The pioneering effort's success was achieved in a few weeks, amidst severe shortages of men and raw materials. The writer Julian Trevelyan recorded that ...|$|E

This is because the Cybermen from [...] "Rise of the Cybermen" [...] originated from a parallel universe, while the prime universe has its own Cybermen from the planet Mondas, as seen in the classic series. As the Cybermen that feature in [...] "Closing Time" [...] were barely surviving, the production team made them look broken down and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> cannibalizing parts to survive. The suits were already worn to an extent, as they had been used so often in the five years since they were made. The Cyber Controller conversion equipment was built around Corden.|$|E
