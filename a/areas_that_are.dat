5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{closer to the}} equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk in <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met.

A nephanalysis, contouring <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs {{have been found to}} be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many old}} buildings, Ordsall Hall has stories of hauntings.

5|$|The species favours lowland <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{seasonally}} wet {{but never}} inundated, {{such as the}} margins of swamps and marshes. For example, in the Yule Brook Botany Reserve, where parallel sand ridges cross a clay flat, B.telmatiaea occurs neither in the lowest parts of the flat, where seasonal inundation occurs; nor {{on the tops of}} the ridges, where the drainage is good; but {{it is one of the}} most abundant plants of intermediate habitats, on ridge slopes and in higher areas of the clay flat.|$|E

5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E
5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game, {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> otherwise locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA {{can be used to}} read e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide useful information such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E

5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even in <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E
5|$|On December 4 (November 21 O.S.), about 2,000 people {{arrived in}} Vilnius; {{half of them}} were officially elected as delegates by their local communities. Because no {{standard}} elections procedures were offered, the process of selecting the representatives varied greatly. Despite irregularities, {{it was the first}} election in the history of Lithuania. People from Aukštaitija were most active, while participation from Samogitia and Suvalkija somewhat lacked. Some of the delegates came from <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> now part of Poland and Latvia, as well as from areas that were then within the lands of the German Empire (Lithuania Minor). As a result, a wide variety of communities, political groups, government layers, social classes, and organizations were represented. This parliament may have been the first in Europe to include women—there were seven female delegates.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs in <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E
