40|$|Sandia National Laboratories and Industrial Solar Technology are cost-sharing {{development}} of advanced parabolic trough technology. As {{part of this}} effort, several configurations of an IST solar collector were tested to determine the collector efficiency and thermal losses with black chrome and black nickel receiver selective coatings, combined with <b>aluminized</b> <b>film</b> and silver film reflectors, using standard Pyrex{reg_sign} and anti-reflective coated Pyrex{reg_sign} glass receiver envelopes. The development effort has been successful, producing an advanced collector with 77 % optical efficiency, using silver-film reflectors, a black nickel receiver coating, and a solgel anti-reflective glass receiver envelope. For each receiver configuration, performance equations were empirically derived relating collector efficiency and thermal losses to the operating temperature. Finally, equations were derived showing collector performance {{as a function of}} input insolation value, incident angle, and operating temperature...|$|E

40|$|A {{combined}} {{analytical and}} experimental study is presented for infrared radiation characteristics of thin plastic films {{with and without}} a metal substrate. On {{the basis of the}} thin-film analysis, a simple analytical technique is developed for determining band-averaged optical constants of thin plastic films from spectral normal transmittance data for two different film thicknesses. Specifically, the band-averaged optical constants of polyethylene terephthalate and polyimide were obtained from transmittance measurements of films with thicknesses in the range of 0. 25 to 3 mil. The spectral normal reflectance and total normal emittance of the film side of singly <b>aluminized</b> <b>films</b> are calculated by use of optical constants; the results compare favorably with measured values...|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{the group}} {{decided on a}} {{cylindrical}} sealed helium balloon made of <b>aluminized</b> PET <b>film,</b> and with a volume of 5,500 cubic meters (196,000 cubic feet). The balloon would rise when heated {{during the day and}} sink as it cooled at night.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} it was {{investigated}} whether the optical density, electrical resistance {{and amount of}} aluminium vacuum-deposited {{can be used as}} indirect measurable variables for barrier properties obtained by vacuum deposition. In addition, the surface properties of the substrate films, structure and chemical composition of the vacuum-deposited aluminium layers as well as flaws in the films were determined and their influence on the permeability properties of the metallized films were investigated. Additionally, it was investigated how mechanical stresses have an effect in the individual film processing steps and in the transport of whole packs as well as climate and products on the permeability properties of <b>aluminized</b> <b>films</b> and composite films produced from them and through which the changes ascertained are caused.

5000|$|Outside a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment, {{pressure}} bladder, {{and restraint}} layer, the TMG for the A7L suit worn on the Moon {{and during the}} Skylab Program began {{with a layer of}} neoprene-coated nylon ripstop. This was the innermost layer of protection from micrometeoroids. Next, thermal radiation protection was provided by five layers of <b>aluminized</b> PET <b>film</b> (Mylar), alternating with four layers of nonwoven Dacron, which provided thermal spacing, followed by two layers of <b>aluminized</b> polyimide Kapton <b>film</b> and Beta cloth [...] laminate. The outermost layer of PTFE (Teflon)-coated filament Beta cloth was non-flammable and provided abrasion protection from the notoriously abrasive lunar dust.

40|$|The {{relatively}} low light yields for tracks {{close to the}} midplane (y= 0) of the SciFi tracker, in particular after radiation damage due to ionizing radiation, suggests to mirror the fibre ends. This note describes a set of tests and measurements {{in order to establish}} a viable mirror technology which combines high reflectivity with simplicity and low cost. The following technologies were evaluated: <b>Aluminized</b> Mylar <b>film</b> glued to the fibre ends, 3 M Enhanced Specular Reflectance film glued to the fibre ends, Thin Film Aluminium vacuum coated on the fibre ends. The tests show that <b>Aluminized</b> Mylar <b>film</b> is a viable solution fulfilling all SciFi requirements. ESR film leads potentially to a higher reflectivity but its usability when glued to fibre ends could not (yet) be demonstrated. The Thin Film Aluminium coating disqualifies for reasons of cost and complexity without any performance gain.

50|$|An {{important}} {{example of}} an evaporative process is the production of <b>aluminized</b> PET <b>film</b> packaging film in a roll-to-roll web system. Often, the aluminum layer in this material is not thick enough to be entirely opaque since a thinner layer can be deposited more cheaply than a thick one. The main purpose of the aluminum is to isolate the product from the external environment by creating a barrier {{to the passage of}} light, oxygen, or water vapor.|$|R
5000|$|Mirrors made of thin <b>aluminized</b> PET <b>film</b> {{could be}} placed in orbit around Mars to {{increase}} the total insolation it receives. This would direct the sunlight onto the surface and could increase Mars's surface temperature directly. The mirror could be positioned as a statite, using its effectiveness as a solar sail to orbit in a stationary position relative to Mars, near the poles, to sublimate the [...] ice sheet {{and contribute to the}} warming greenhouse effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{material}} in current designs {{is a thin}} layer of aluminum coating on a polymer (plastic) sheet, such as aluminized 2 µm Kapton film. The polymer provides mechanical support as well as flexibility, while the thin metal layer provides the reflectivity. Such material resists the heat of a pass close to the Sun and still remains reasonably strong. The aluminum reflecting film is on the Sun side.

50|$|Biaxially {{oriented}} PET film can be metallized by vapor {{deposition of}} {{a thin film}} of evaporated aluminium, gold, or other metal onto it. The result is much less permeable to gases (important in food packaging) and reflects up to 99% of light, including much of the infrared spectrum. For some applications like food packaging, the <b>aluminized</b> boPET <b>film</b> can be laminated {{with a layer of}} polyethylene, which provides sealability and improves puncture resistance.

The accelerated testing indicated more severe degradation than was experienced in the real-time test (1 solar constant).

50|$|Physical vapor {{deposition}} (PVD) {{describes a}} variety of vacuum deposition methods {{which can be used}} to produce thin films and coatings. PVD is characterized by a process in which the material goes from a condensed phase to a vapor phase and then back to a thin film condensed phase. The most common PVD processes are sputtering and evaporation. PVD is used in the manufacture of items which require thin films for mechanical, optical, chemical or electronic functions. Examples include semiconductor devices such as thin <b>film</b> solar panels, <b>aluminized</b> PET <b>film</b> for food packaging and balloons, and coated cutting tools for metalworking. Besides PVD tools for fabrication, special smaller tools (mainly for scientific purposes) have been developed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{issue of the}} record (Colgems #COSO-5008) featured a front cover with a surface of <b>aluminized</b> PET <b>film,</b> meant to reflect the listener's [...] "head" [...] (face) back at them. With the movie having only a limited release (and virtually no publicity), the point was largely lost, and while the cover was innovative for its time, manufacturing was problematic. (Micky Dolenz recalled years later that the cover was ruining the printing presses at RCA.) A March 1985 LP reissue from Rhino Records (RNLP-145) was less problematic by using foil paper instead, the result being less reflective than the original. The Rhino CD reissue from 1994 (R2-71795) has a grey cover that is not reflective at all.|$|R

His mid-1960s New Haven residence, published in Playboy, featured an open, freestanding shower {{in the middle of the}} room, its water nozzled through a giant sunflower. Such design features (historical detail, ornament, fictional treatments, ironic significations) made Moore one of the chief innovators of postmodern architecture, along with Robert Venturi and Michael Graves, among others.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} the flexural rigidity of thin films and laminates is described. The method employs {{the principle of}} the heavy elastica which relates flex-ural rigidity to the deflection of the material under its own weight. Results are presented of tests to determine the stiffness of plastic films and plastic-metal laminates for use in space structures experiments. Tests were performed on untreated and <b>aluminized</b> polyjethylene terephthalatej <b>film,</b> aluminum foil, and laminates of aluminum foil and polyjethylene terephtahlate) film or polypropylene film. The thickness of the materials ranged from 0. 00018 inch (0. 00046 cm) to 0. 00270 inch (0. 00691 cm). The weight effici-ency in flexure is presented, the efficiency of the <b>aluminized</b> polyethylene terephthalate] <b>film</b> (Echo I material) being taken as unity. It has been shown that {{the principle of the}} heavy elastica (including both the heart-loop and the cantilever methods) is valid for such determinations if the material does not have a static electric charge.

30|$|In 2002, Pellegrino [29] {{from the}} University of Cambridge, {{developed}} an elastic ribs driven membrane antenna with {{a diameter of}} 1.5 m, which achieved a surface accuracy of 2.0 mm RMS, as shown in Figure  4. The reflector was composed of 12 elastic ribs, a central hub, and <b>aluminized</b> polyester <b>film.</b> When the antenna was folded, the ribs and film were twisted on the central hub and bound by rope. Once the rope was cut, the ribs released elastic potential energy to drive the membrane reflector deployment. Pellegrino designed the antenna diameter, focal length, surface accuracy, and membrane stress distribution and performed the deployment experiment. However, several elastic ribs were damaged because of an improper folding approach, and, in consequence, the 12 elastic ribs were deployed simultaneously. Therefore, further study is needed in antenna folding approaches.|$|R
