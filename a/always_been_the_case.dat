5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this has not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|Following most {{present day}} {{damaging}} earthquakes, teams of investigators from {{institutions such as}} the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up instruments to capture strong motion records, and to study the damage and other effects of the event. This has not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> and the 1954 report from Steinbrugge and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects (especially to buildings) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written. The strong motion record that was obtained from the 1952 shock, as well as the accelerogram from the 1940 El Centro earthquake, were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.|$|E
5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though {{this has not}} <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E

The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.|$|E

It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy.

25|$|In theory, {{slavery in}} Islamic {{law does not}} have a racial or color component, {{although}} this has not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in practice. Slaves played various social and economic roles, from domestic worker to high-ranking positions in the government like Emir. Moreover, slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, and the army. Some rulers even relied on military and administrative slaves {{to such a degree that}} they seized power. In some cases, the treatment of slaves was so harsh that it led to uprisings, such as the Zanj Rebellion. However, this was an exception rather than the norm, as the vast majority of labor in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. For a variety of reasons, internal growth of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in Muslim society. This resulted in massive importation, which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non-Muslim lands.|$|E
25|$|Brøns Church, {{located in}} Southern Jutland, south of Ribe, {{contains}} two Lutheran frescos, dating from c. 1530, which are probably Denmark's only examples of church frescos with distinctly Lutheran messages. One shows a heavenly castle under siege. An army led by pope and bishops try {{to gain access}} to it by force, while Christ — guarding its city gate — rejects them. Another image shows the pope and a number of bishops presenting a large papal bull, carrying a total of 11 ecclesiastic seals but no text. It is unknown whether this has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> but the presence of two fools, one of them holding a pair of reading glasses, indicates that this is the intention; the Catholic Church is presented as without content. Below, a monk, standing a front of a group of men holding letters of indulgence is confronted by another group of people holding similar letters. This protest scene against the sale of indulgences is inspired by a contemporary woodcarving by Nuremberg artist, Hans Sebald Beham, who was staunchly anti-Catholic.|$|E

25|$|This had not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Most of German {{aviation}} {{had been}} {{concentrated on the}} Stalingrad Front in August, on Hitler's orders. Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps IV was over-stretched for over a month from 28 July. Richthofen had wanted to support Army Group B in the south, but despite the Caucasus oilfields being the primary target for German strategy, the Army Group received poor air support. Richthofen's arm-chair general tactics were important in deciding where air power was to be used, and would be done so only if he rated the army's chances of success as reasonable. He allowed some raids against Grozny's oilfields and close support operations, but the mountain terrain in the region {{made it difficult for}} the Panzer Divisions to exploit the actions of his air units. In a fit of pique at the army's failures, Richthofen refused to provide support for the Caucasus front. This remained the situation until mid-October. For a few days, a concentrated effort was made in the Caucasus. Hitler's realisation that the oilfields at Baku could not be captured meant that he was forced to order the Luftwaffe to eliminate them. The operations had limited success.|$|E
25|$|First {{names are}} {{chosen by the}} child's parents. There are no legal a priori {{constraints}} on the choice of names nowadays, but this has not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The choice of given names, originally limited only by the tradition of naming children after {{a small number of}} popular saints, was restricted by law {{at the end of the}} 18th century, could be accepted. Much later, actually in 1966, a new law permitted a limited number of mythological, regional or foreign names, substantives (Olive, Violette), diminutives, and alternative spellings. Only in 1993 were French parents given the freedom to name their child without any constraint whatsoever. However, if the birth registrar thinks that the chosen names (alone or in association with the last name) may be detrimental to the child's interests, or to the right of other families to protect their own family name, the registrar may refer the matter to the local prosecutor, who may choose to refer the matter to the local court. The court may then refuse the chosen names. Such refusals are rare and mostly concern given names that may expose the child to mockery.|$|E

Gulf petrol was sold using the slogans [...] "Good Gulf Gasoline," [...] and [...] "Gulf – the Gas with Guts." [...] Gulf service stations often supplied customers with pens and key rings bearing these slogans.

500|$|In the 16thcentury, the Tower {{acquired}} an enduring {{reputation as a}} grim, forbidding prison. This had not <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> As a royal castle, it {{was used by the}} monarch to imprison people for various reasons, however these were usually high-status individuals for short periods rather than common citizenry as there were plenty of prisons elsewhere for such people. Contrary to the popular image of the Tower, prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the Lieutenant of the Tower. As holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the Tower– as would have been the case for any castle– there was no purpose-built accommodation for prisoners until 1687 when a brick shed, a [...] "Prison for Soldiers", was built to the north-west of the White Tower. The Tower's reputation for torture and imprisonment derives largely from 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century romanticists. Although much of the Tower's reputation is exaggerated, the 16th and 17thcenturies marked the castle's zenith as a prison, with many religious and political undesirables locked away. The Privy Council had to sanction the use of torture, so it was not often used; between 1540 and 1640, the peak of imprisonment at the Tower, there were 48recorded cases of the use of torture. The three most common forms used were the infamous rack, the Scavenger's daughter, and manacles. The rack was introduced to England in 1447 by the Duke of Exeter, the Constable of the Tower; consequentially it was also known as the Duke of Exeter's daughter. One of those tortured at the Tower was Guy Fawkes, who was brought there on 6 November 1605; after torture he signed a full confession to the Gunpowder Plot.|$|E
