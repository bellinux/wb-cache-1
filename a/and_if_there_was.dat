5|$|Due to his {{resemblance}} to Ventus, video game publications initially thought that Roxas {{would be one}} of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications still discussed how similar they were <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a connection between them. Bob Muir from Destructoid noted that in Birth by Sleep Ventus was the most important character by fans due to his similarities with Roxas.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Athenians had attempted to negotiate with the Persians previously. Plutarch suggests that {{in the aftermath of the}} victory at the Eurymedon, Artaxerxes had agreed a peace treaty with the Greeks, even naming Callias as the Athenian ambassador involved. However, as Plutarch admits, Callisthenes denied that such a peace was made at this point (c. 466 BC). Herodotus also mentions, in passing, an Athenian embassy headed by Callias, which was sent to Susa to negotiate with Artaxerxes. This embassy included some Argive representatives and can probably be therefore dated to c. 461 BC (after an alliance was agreed between Athens and Argos). This embassy may have been an attempt to reach some kind of peace agreement, and it has even been suggested that the failure of these hypothetical negotiations led to the Athenian decision to support the Egyptian revolt. The ancient sources therefore disagree as to whether there was an official peace or not, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> when it was agreed.|$|E
5|$|The Senate-passed bill {{then was}} {{transmitted}} to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, {{asked if there was}} objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted to know if there was anyone present who could give him information about it, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E

5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men do more work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements agricultural income.|$|E
5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E

The District Court utilized the KSM test {{to determine if a}} contempt proceeding was appropriate <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> continuing infringement. The first step of the KSM test was to determine whether there was a “colorable” difference between the infringing and modified products.

Historians {{disagree}} as to whether such a plot existed <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one, its scale.

He was the marshal of Armenian nobility and had special privileges and duties. For example, {{in case of}} king's death <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no inheriting sepuh (crown prince), it was the grand duke who would temporarily take the responsibilities and perform {{the duties of the}} king until the issues of succession to the throne are resolved.

500|$|Due to his {{resemblance}} with Roxas, {{video game}} publications initially thought that Roxas {{would be one}} of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep when seeing one of Ventus' images. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications continued to discuss how similar they were <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a connection between them. GamesRadar particularly thought that there would be an eventual connection between the two of them and Sora. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central also commented on speculations regarding the similarities between both of them, but mentioned that due to the existence of Nobodies in series, it is hard to find them as coincidences. When Jesse McCartney confirmed he was working on the English localization of Birth by Sleep, sites thought that he would voice Ventus, as he also voiced Roxas in previous titles. The character's story and actions shown in the demonstrations were praised for being the [...] "most original take on Kingdom Hearts" [...] and yet [...] "frustratingly traditional". Upon Ventus' introduction in Birth by Sleep, X-Play found the character to be very similar to Sora's due to his friendly attitude. Kevin VanOrd from the same site gave praise to Ventus' character for his [...] "well-meaning" [...] and yet not [...] "annoying" [...] personality. The site also said that the time players spend playing with Ventus would be [...] "rewarding" [...] and commented on the English voice acting. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio of Ventus, Terra and Aqua as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. On the other hand, PALGN found the three characters unappealing, labelling Ventus as [...] "just a Roxas clone, but without his personality." [...] In contrast to 1UP's comments towards Ventus' actions in Cinderella's world, VanOrd commented that such interactions to be [...] "more bothersome than boisterous." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antistaer called Ventus a [...] "Roxas-clone", and did not understand why he was briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II. Bob Muir from Destructoid noted that in Birth by Sleep Ventus was the most important character by fans due to his similarities with Roxas. Additionally, Miur praised Jesse McCartney's work as Ventus' English voice actor that make his story mode more engaging to players.|$|E

2500|$|Since then, Coleman {{has been}} one of the most vocal critics of Nifong's {{handling}} of the case. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Coleman argued that he pandered to the black community in the middle of the election campaign: [...] "I think that he pandered to the community by saying 'I'm gonna go out there and defend your interests in seeing that these hooligans who committed the crime are prosecuted. I'm not gonna let their fathers, with all of their money, buy, you know, big-time lawyers and get them off. I'm doing this for you.'"

[...] As many of Weber's films focused on a moral topic, she [...] "was often mistaken as a Christian fundamentalist, but she was more of a libertarian, opposing censorship and the death penalty and championing birth control. The need for a strong, loving and nurturing home was clearly promoted as well <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a single maxim that underlay each film it was that selfishness and egocentricity erode the individual and community".|$|E

2500|$|As {{early in}} the war as 1793, a major city {{manufacturer}} and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and a doubling of the poor rate. As with many generations of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints on to the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, at which [...] "Citizen Stanhope" [...] spoke. The gathering [...] " [...] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; – <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a people still in England, the event {{might turn out to}} be so." [...] Hayes says that [...] "the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended." ...|$|E

He then took up a place he had won at Downing College, Cambridge, to read Law. He also joined the Cambridge Footlights. He recalled that he went to the Cambridge Guildhall, where each university society had a stall, and went up to the Footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance. He replied [...] "no" [...] as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything worse than his singing, it was his dancing.

In July 2015, water from 132 Moose Creek wells, which serve more than 200 residences, was found to contain perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) above the health advisory level of 0.2 micrograms per liter by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The highest reading in Moose Creek was 2.09 micrograms per liter, and the highest level on Eielson reached 2,000 micrograms per liter {{at the site of}} a KC-135 aircraft fire in 1989.
