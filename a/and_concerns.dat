Recent foreign policy has been mostly about economic relations with its Southeast Asian and Asia-Pacific neighbors.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact <b>and</b> <b>concerns,</b> obesity, and global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E

Roadwork began in the fall on the two-year project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection improvements were also made, this time adding dual left turn lanes to both east–west approaches at Illinois 83 and Buffalo Grove Road.|$|E
5|$|Blade Runner {{continues}} to reflect modern trends <b>and</b> <b>concerns,</b> {{and an increasing}} number of critics consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists. Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E

In 1971, however, the expressway's original routing was canceled due to community opposition in the towns of Barrington and Warren <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> that a new bridge across Upper Narragansett Bay would interfere with aviation traffic at T.

In 1971, RIDOT submitted a new proposed alignment for I-895 that utilized the Jamestown and Newport Bridges in southern Newport County and bypassed Barrington and Warwick altogether, but the interstate was ultimately canceled in 1982.|$|E

The film was eventually aired on other cable channels such as HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel sporadically and without fanfare. It was also infrequently screened at independent film houses and film festivals.|$|E

Regarding the theme of revenge seen throughout The Revenant, Iñárritu has stated that the approach of vengeance seen in the film needs to be significantly tempered by anyone {{who would want to}} see vengeance as either an effective or useful moral to be applied in life. In the end, Iñárritu states, there can only be disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life defining purpose.|$|E
5|$|Increasing costs <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> {{over the}} ships' design {{led to the}} {{cancellation}} of the DDL project. The Department of Defence observed that the DDL's costs were escalating and it was unable to finalise the design. The Navy also reviewed the project {{and found that it}} was unduly expensive, and a Joint Parliamentary committee concluded that a unique Australian design entailed significant technological risks. As a result, the Navy recommended to the Government that the DDL project be cancelled, and this took place in August 1973. The cost of the project to the Navy had been A$1.7 million, most of which was spent on design investigations and management consultancies. The opposition Liberal Party opposed the decision to cancel the DDL project.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} shown that patients’ anxiety and dissatisfaction are {{predictors}} for increased postoperative pain and reduced efficacy of pain treatment. However, it remains to be shown whether patient anxiety <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> are predictors for the perceived quality of treatment and patient reported outcome (PRO). The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether there is a correlation between preoperative anxiety <b>and</b> <b>concern,</b> <b>and</b> the perceived quality of postoperative treatment and outcome. The hypothesis is that anxious <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> patients are less satisfied with treatment and have a poorer outcome. Methods/design This study is designed as a prospective follow-up study and has the aim of investigating the correlation between patient anxiety <b>and</b> <b>concern,</b> patients´ perceived quality of treatment and outcome. This correlation will be detected using five questionnaires: CMD-SQ (Common Mental Disorders Screening Questionnaire), EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ- 5 D), Short form 12 (SF- 12), “What is your evaluation of the patient progress in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery?” (HVOK), Questionnaire for patients who have had hip surgery (RCS) and Oxford Hip Score (OHS) or Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS). The patients will complete the above mentioned questionnaires preoperatively in the outpatient department, and postoperatively just before discharge from the inpatient department, and 12 and 52 [*]weeks after the operation. The study includes a reliability test of CMD-SQ regarding this specific population and tested by means of a Kappa. A total of 500 hip- and shoulder-patients will be included from October 2010 till October 2011. Discussion If a correlation between patient anxiety <b>and</b> <b>concern,</b> patients´ perceived quality of treatment and patient reported outcome is found, it will be recommended to screen all hip- and shoulder-patients for anxiety <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> preoperatively. Besides, it would be relevant to carry out investigations of possible interventions towards anxious <b>and</b> <b>concerned</b> patients.

5|$|On 2 May 1945 {{news was}} {{received}} that all German forces {{west of the}} Isonzo River had surrendered. While this did not officially end the fighting in Italy, it was all but over. Five days later, {{on the night of}} 7 May, the battalion received the news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, and that the war in Europe was over. Nevertheless, tensions remained high <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> about the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of Istria meant that the 28th (Māori) Battalion remained on high alert. This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak sank {{with up to}} 3,000tons of {{fuel oil}} aboard, the precise amount being unknown since such records were lost with the ship. Oil leaked from the {{corroding}} hull at an increased rate during the 1990s <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> about the environmental impact led the Ministry of Defence to consider plans for extracting it. Royal Oaks status as a war grave required that surveys and any proposed techniques for removing the oil be handled sensitively: plans in the 1950s to raise and salvage the wreck had been dropped in response to public opposition. In addition to the ethical concerns, poorly managed efforts could destabilise the wreck, resulting in a mass release of the remaining oil; the ship also contains many tons of unexploded ordnance.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues <b>and</b> <b>concerns,</b> they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E

5|$|The {{backlash}} against the socialist Second Republic brought about the democratic Third Republic under consecutive presidents Albert Zafy (1991), Ratsiraka (1997) and Marc Ravalomanana (2001), followed by a Fourth Republic under Andry Rajoelina, who {{came to power in}} a 2009 coup d'état. Although Dama performed at political rallies in Paris during the eight-month political standoff following the 2001 presidential elections that brought Ravalomanana to power, Mahaleo as a full group has never sided with any particular politician, instead expressing through their lyrics the social and political views <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> of the average Malagasy citizen. They tend to promote collective, grassroots action as the best solution to the country's problems, rather than entrusting the work to politicians and international development partners.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy {{industry}} in the 20th century left Windy Nook with no major employer and there was little {{in terms of economic}} activity. There is no major commercial area and residents usually travel to neighbouring Felling town centre to shop or use the small shopping area at the junction of Windy Nook Road and Carr Hill Road/Albion Street. However, in November 2011, planning permission was approved for conversion of the Black House Inn at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Coldwell lane into a 'Tesco Extra' store. The approval was granted in spite of complaints <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> as to noise and traffic being raised by local residents. This store is now the largest employer in Windy Nook, employing around 20 staff.|$|E
