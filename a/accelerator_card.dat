5000|$|Many current {{supercomputers}} are hybrid architectures {{that use}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>cards</b> with a PCIe interface {{to boost the}} compute performance. In general, server processors support {{only a limited number}} of accelerators due to the limited number of PCIe lanes (typically 40 for the Intel Haswell architecture). The common approach to integrate multiple <b>accelerators</b> <b>cards</b> into the host system is to arrange multiple server processors, typically two or four, as distributed shared memory systems. This approach allows for a higher number of accelerators per compute node due to the higher number of PCIe lanes. However, it also comes with several disadvantages: ...|$|R

50|$|Nallatech's latest {{innovation}} in FPGA acceleration is the 385A FPGA <b>Accelerator</b> <b>Card.</b> Released as of June 17, 2015, the 385A features the Altera Arria 10 / 1150 FPGA, PCI-Express form factor {{and works with}} most major servers, including IBM, HP and Dell.|$|E
50|$|The {{company has}} {{occasionally}} had customized hardware made specifically for its machines.

50|$|Ditto {{internal}} drives {{were connected}} through the floppy drive channel and used MFM encoding to store data (the same method as on older floppy drives).

50|$|The QPACE 2 {{architecture}} addresses these disadvantages by a node {{design in}} which a single low-power Intel Haswell E3 host CPU accommodates four Xeon Phi 7120X <b>accelerator</b> <b>cards</b> for computational power and one dual-port FDR InfiniBand network interface card for external communication. To achieve this, the components within a node are interconnected by a PCIe switch with 96 lanes.|$|R
50|$|Very few {{cards for}} the Amiga {{make use of}} the 68851 {{primarily}} because it can only be used with a small range of processors and most Amigas and <b>accelerator</b> <b>cards</b> use a processor which either has its own MMU or cannot support an MMU. One of the few cards which does use this is the Commodore A2620.|$|R
