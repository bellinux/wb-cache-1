The {{aim of this}} paper is to estimate hunting values for multiple hunted species, by disentangling the role of wildlife harvesting opportunities from other factors which affect hunting <b>lease</b> <b>prices.</b> We examine the determinants of hunting <b>lease</b> <b>prices</b> in Sweden using both spatial and non-spatial econometric techniques. Our analysis confirms considerable hunting values for large ungulates such as moose and fallow deer. Results also suggest that hunters prefer to have a diverse set of ungulate species on their hunting ground. Moreover, the study reveals the presence of spatial spillovers in <b>lease</b> <b>prices,</b> implying that landowners have little scope for exerting monopoly power on the lease market. It also indicate that proximity to urban centers, income, size of the hunting field, and congestion cost are key drivers of hunting <b>lease</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study reviews {{commercial}} real estate leases as one transaction form to finance corporate capital assets. Credit risk is common to leases and debt as substitute transactions; but the two credit forms generate different transaction costs and agency conflicts, and thus differential pricing.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of leases in the US economy, {{and the existence of}} several theoretical <b>lease</b> <b>pricing</b> models, there has been little systematic attempt to estimate these models. This paper proposes a simple no-arbitrage based <b>lease</b> <b>pricing</b> model, and estimates it using a large proprietary data set of leases on several property types. We also define a new measure, the Option-Adjusted Lease Spread, or OALS (analogous to an option’s implied volatility, or a mortgage-backed security’s Option-Adjusted Spread), that allows us to compare leases with different maturities and contract terms on a consistent basis. We find sizeable pricing errors that cannot be explained using interest rates, lease maturity, or information on the options embedded in the contracts. This suggests either that there are significant mispricings in the market for real estate leases, or that lease terms depend heavily on unobservable, property-specific characteristics. ...|$|R

40|$|Though {{there are}} several {{theoretical}} <b>lease</b> <b>pricing</b> models, {{they have not been}} systematically estimated or tested using real data. The existing empirical literature on leases typically tries to explain one period’s lease payment, ignoring how fast those payments are scheduled to grow, or whether the lease contains option features. This paper bridges the gap between the two literatures by providing the first empirical investigation of an internally consistent <b>lease</b> <b>pricing</b> model. We develop a no-arbitrage based valuation model that allows us to calculate each lease’s NPV taking into account both the contractual payment amounts and any embedded options. Using a proprietary data set of several hundred leases from suburban malls in 11 states, we then compare the NPV of each lease with various characteristics of the leases and underlying properties, to see what characteristics are important, and how the underlying valuation model can be improved...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} the present-value asset pricing model to fishing quota markets by applying instrumental variable panel data estimation techniques to 15 years of market transactions from New Zealand’s individual fishing quota market. In addition to the influence of current fishing rents (as measured by <b>lease</b> <b>prices),</b> we explore the effect of market interest rates, risk, and expected changes in future rents on quota asset prices. Controlling for these other factors, the results support a fairly simple relationship between quota asset and contemporaneous <b>lease</b> <b>prices.</b> Consistent with theoretical expectations, the results indicate that quota asset prices are positively related to declines in interest rates, lower levels of risk, expected increases in future fish prices, and expected cost reductions from rationalization under the quota system. However, the magnitude of some interrelationships is muted relative to what theory suggests, possibly due to measurement error. tradable permits, individual transferable fishing quota, asset pricing, fisheries, policy...|$|R

40|$|To remain {{profitable}} under a tight competition, a {{leasing company}} {{has to offer}} a good <b>leasing</b> <b>price.</b> In {{order to determine the}} right price, it is necessary to predict the future price of a second hand car. By knowing the car's value depreciation, the <b>leasing</b> <b>price</b> could be set to cover it. The approach commonly used for a price prediction task is multiple linear regression analysis. However, there are a large number of factors that drive the price, that make this crucial task difficult. The standard regression approach might not be suitable for high dimensional data. A modern data mining technique which is independent of input dimension, namely Support Vector Regression, will be applied to overcome this potential problem. The forecasting accuracy will then be compared against the statistical regression model. In particular, a fully automatic approach for tuning and applying SVR is developed, borrowing ideas from the field of evolutionary search. The whole experiment with the machine learning approach is based upon a real-world data from a leading German car manufacturer...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} process by which consumers decide which automobile to purchase and how to finance their decision. Although prior research of automobile leasing assumed a sequential process in which household's first decided which vehicle to buy and then decided how to pay for it, empirical estimates from this paper indicate the process should be modeled as simultaneous. A nested multinomial logit vehicle type choice model which considers payment options is used to gain insight into why consumers lease cars. Specifically, evidence supports the hypothesis that consumers lease to avoid binding credit constraints which permit them to drive a higher quality car than they otherwise would have chosen and avoid the disposal costs associated with purchasing a new vehicle every three years. Furthermore, accurate survey information enabled the inclusion of previously unexplored vehicle and socioeconomic attributes in the vehicle type choice estimation. For example, it is shown that the residual value of a vehicle, defined as the percentage of MSRP a vehicle is expected to retain after three years of use, does {{have a significant impact on}} the selection of which vehicle to purchase. An endogenous <b>lease</b> <b>pricing</b> model which allows automobile manufacturers to price discriminate depending upon a households choice of financing is then used to develop short term forecasts of the automobile industry. The endogenous pricing model allows for empirical enumeration of two opposing incentives faced by automobile manufacturers. Results indicate that in many cases manufacturers have incentives to charge <b>lease</b> <b>prices</b> higher than the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price would suggest. Automobile demand estimates and endogenous <b>lease</b> <b>pricing</b> results are then used to explain the dramatic increase in consumer leasing over the past fifteen years and predict future leasing trends. As real household income and automobile <b>prices</b> stabilize, consumer <b>leasing</b> is predicted to peak at approximately 30 % of all vehicle purchases...|$|R

40|$|Businesses are {{increasingly}} concerned about water scarcity and its financial impacts, {{as well as}} competing needs of other stakeholders and ecosystems. Industrialized watersheds may be at more serious risk from water scarcity than previously understood because industrial and municipal users have inelastic demand and a high value for water. Previous water risk assessments have failed to sufficiently capture these economic aspects of water risk. We illustrate how hydro-economic modeling {{can be used to}} improve water risk assessments at a basin scale and we apply the methodology to the industrialized Brazos River Basin (85 % municipal and industrial withdrawals) and consider implications for The Dow Chemical Company׳s Freeport Operations in Texas, US. Brazos water right holders pay only operating and maintenance costs for water during normal periods; however, when shortages occur, leasing stored water or reducing production may be the only mitigation option in the short-run. Modeling of water shortages and the theoretical cost of leasing water under nine combined scenarios of demand growth and climate change suggests that water <b>lease</b> <b>prices</b> to industry could increase by 9 – 13 X. At best, a more developed water rights and storage lease market could result in lower <b>lease</b> <b>prices</b> (2 – 3 X); however, given that transactions would be limited {{it is more likely that}} prices would still increase by 4 – 13 X. These results suggest that markets are unlikely to be a robust solution for the Brazos because, in contrast to other watersheds in the Western US, there is little reliable water to trade from low value users (agricultural) to high value users (industry and municipalities). Looking at demand trends across the contiguous US as an indicator of water risk, 2 % of watersheds have municipal and industrial demands that outstrip total surface and ground water supplies and in these watersheds industry has historically paid higher <b>lease</b> <b>prices</b> for water. This study provides new ways for businesses to characterize water risk and forecast water prices that uncovers hidden water risk and highlights the positive but diminished mitigating effects of water markets in a highly industrialized basin...|$|R
