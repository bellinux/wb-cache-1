5|$|After {{his term}} began in 2001, Cheney was {{occasionally}} <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{interested in the}} Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term {{and he did not}} run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator John McCain.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{started the}} 2003 season 4–4, but lost their final eight games. With two games {{remaining}} in the season, Jim Fassel requested a meeting with team management, and <b>asked,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to be fired, that they do so now rather than wait {{until the end of}} the season. Management complied with his request, formally firing Fassel on (or around) December 17, 2003, but allowing him to coach the team's final two games.|$|E
5|$|After {{these changes}} were made, the test {{audience}} became more {{appreciative of the}} series, and GSN announced its development {{to the public at}} an upfront presentation in New York City on March 21, 2012 for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy performing the hosting duties for the show. When first <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs.|$|E

5|$|In November 2005, {{three men}} {{carrying}} guns {{broke into his}} home, removing any valuables. They <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gay, and when he refused to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with murder in the furtherance of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police dropped their murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them {{to life in prison}} with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, {{how did you know}} that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

50|$|Dvorak {{attended}} Providence Catholic High School for {{his freshman}} and sophomore years {{before moving to}} Canada. Although Dvorak <b>is</b> often <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> related to former NHL player Radek Dvorak, they are not related.|$|R
25|$|The {{province}} {{of his birth}} remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest Gallia Belgica, Gallia Narbonensis, or Northern Italy. His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator Gnaeus Julius Agricola implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to Lucius Fabius Justus in the Dialogus may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy. No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint {{that the two men}} had a common background. Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he was <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of June of that year, NASA once again called for {{astronaut}} applications. Collins went through the same process as with his first applications, {{though he did not}} take the psychiatric evaluation. He was at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas on October 14 when Deke Slayton called and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still interested in becoming an astronaut. Charlie Bassett was also accepted in the same group.|$|E
25|$|During {{a lull in}} January 1891, Father I. Moinet visited Ujiji. There {{he found}} Rumaliza flying a German flag and saying {{he was waiting for}} the Germans to arrive so he could hand over to them. In a letter to Joubert in April 1891, Rumaliza <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{employed}} by the missionaries or by the government of the Congo. Joubert was evasive in his reply, pointing out that Rumaliza sometimes flew the German flag, sometimes the flag of Zanzibar and sometimes that of Britain.|$|E

25|$|The {{presidency}} of Laurel understandably {{remains one of}} the most controversial in Philippine history. After the war, he would be denounced by the pro American sectors as a war collaborator or even a traitor, although his indictment for treason was superseded by President Roxas' Amnesty Proclamation. However, despite being one of the most infamous figures in Philippine history, he is also regarded as a Pan-Asianist who supported independence. When <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pro American or pro Japanese, his answer would be pro Filipino.|$|E
25|$|Frank Herbert {{used his}} science fiction novels to explore complex ideas {{involving}} philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust {{of his work}} was a fascination {{with the question of}} human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have tried to read everything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> founding a cult, something he was very much against.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin {{said in a}} 2006 {{interview}} with The New York Times {{that if he did}} become involved in electoral politics, he would prefer to run for Governor of New York. When <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> qualified for the office, Baldwin responded that he considered himself more qualified than California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In June 2011, The Daily reported that Baldwin was mulling over a 2013 run for Mayor of New York City {{in the wake of a}} potential early race shake-up after candidate Congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal. However, on December 21, 2011, Baldwin said he was abandoning plans to run for the office and would instead continue in his role on 30 Rock.|$|E

25|$|As {{time went}} by, Gardner became {{critical}} {{of many of}} the Rosicrucian Order's practices; Sullivan's followers claimed that he was immortal, having formerly been the famous historical figures Pythagoras, Cornelius Agrippa and Francis Bacon. Gardner facetiously <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> also the Wandering Jew, much to the annoyance of Sullivan himself. Another belief held by the group that Gardner found amusing was that a lamp hanging from one of the ceilings was the disguised holy grail of Arthurian legend. Gardner's dissatisfaction with the group grew, particularly when in 1939, one of the group's leaders sent a letter out to all members in which she stated that war would not come. The very next day, Britain declared war on Germany, greatly unimpressing the increasingly cynical Gardner.|$|E
