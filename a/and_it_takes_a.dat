25|$|Unfortunately, Robin unknowingly {{suffers from}} {{postpartum}} depression (PPD). Robin's behavior becomes increasingly erratic <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> {{long time before}} Robin acknowledges {{that she has a}} problem. She starts seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication. But once she starts feeling better, Robin believes that she's cured and throws away her medication without her doctor's knowledge. Patrick finds out and stages an intervention where Robin's confronted by her doctor, family and friends. Robin finally admits that she needs more help and leaves home to get treatment at an inpatient facility.|$|E
500|$|In frogs, male {{territorial}} behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling {{is both an}} announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, {{and this may be}} sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a [...] "home advantage" [...] and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place. Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{the group and}} their exposure through the singles [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome" [...] helped Fear of a Black Planet exceed the sales of their previous two albums, Yo! Bum Rush the Show <b>and</b> <b>It</b> <b>Takes</b> <b>a</b> Nation of Million to Hold Us Back at the time, 500,000 and 1.1 million copies, respectively. The latter single's lyrics were initially viewed by religious groups and the media as anti-semitic upon its release. The album contributed to hip hop's commercial breakthrough {{at the beginning of}} the 1990s, despite its limited radio airplay. Its success made Public Enemy the top-selling act, both domestically and internationally, for Def Jam Recordings at the time. Ruben Rodriguez, Columbia's senior vice president at the time, said in one of the label's press releases, [...] "What's happening with Public Enemy is unbelievable. The album is selling across the board to all demographics and nationalities". In a December 1990 article, Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael Corcoran discussed Public Enemy's commercial success with the album and remarked that [...] "more than half of the 2 million fans who bought [...] are white".|$|E

Ace asks Rimmer to become a defender of the multiverse upon Ace's death. Although initially hesitant, Arnold finds himself rising to the challenge and leaves to start his new life. Lister, for a time, desperately misses him, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> therapeutic song by a simulation of Rimmer (played by Barrie), shown in [...] "Blue" [...] (1997), to remind him what a horrible presence he could be.|$|E

[...] "Fate has an interesting way of working these things out...

2500|$|Suppose {{the trait}} in {{question}} may fall {{into one of}} [...] states, labelled [...] [...] The typical means of modelling evolution of this trait is via a continuous-time Markov chain, which may be briefly described as follows (cf. Figure 2). [...] Each state has associated to it rates of transition to all of the other states. The trait is modelled as stepping between the [...] states; when it reaches a given state, it starts an exponential [...] "clock" [...] for each of the other states that it can step to. [...] It then [...] "races" [...] the clocks against each other, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> step towards the state whose clock is the first to ring. [...] In such a model, the parameters are the transition rates , which can be estimated using, for example, maximum likelihood methods, where one maximizes over the set of all possible configurations of states of the ancestral nodes.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2010, Body Talk Pt. 2 was {{released}} in the UK. It was preceded by the lead single, a dance version of [...] "Hang with Me" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, on 5 September. The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, [...] "U Should Know Better". Robyn performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] with deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC Newsbeat interview, Robyn explained her decision to release three albums in one year: [...] "It was just something I felt like I needed to do. I just never thought about selling records or not, making this decision. I just did it for myself. It's a way of, for me, to stay inspired {{and to be able}} to do the things I like to do". She said that she would not do it again: [...] "When you do 16 or 13 songs in one go, you kind of empty yourself, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> while to fill back up and have new things to talk about, so I think it's good for everyone". Robyn announced the release of the single, [...] "Indestructible", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on Body Talk Pt. 2. The song {{was released}} on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK. Co-written by Klas Ã…hlund, it was described as a [...] "pulsating full power version [...] takes every ounce of that emotion and wraps it up in another exceptional disco-pop record worthy of any dance-floor or passion-laden sing-a-long." [...] Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song, [...] "Time Machine"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the Billboard 100 in 1997. Combined, the Body Talk albums have sold 91,000 copies in the US ...|$|E
