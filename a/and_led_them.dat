5|$|For 1943 and 1944, Clarence Spears was the Maryland head coach. Like Shaughnessy, Spears {{had taken}} an underachieving team and turned them around. In 1925, he took over Minnesota, which had posted a 3–3–2 record the prior season, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to {{a share of the}} 1927 Big Ten championship. However, at Maryland, when Spears {{accumulated}} a record of 5–12–1 after two seasons, he too was replaced.|$|E

He was {{stationed}} stateside and while he could not practice with the team, he did receive permission to play for the Bears on game days during the following seasons. He returned again to the Bears, as a full-time occupation, in 1946 <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to a fifth NFL championship.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|At Panola, Oppong earned all-conference honors <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to {{a fairly}} {{successful}} {{season in the}} NJCAA Region XIV. Entering the next season, he became a high-end Canadian recruit for programs in the NCAA. Oppong ultimately chose to play for Eastern Kentucky under head coach Jeff Neubauer. He was a starter {{from time to time}} as his junior season progressed. However, he suffered a shoulder injury {{in the middle of the}} season that sidelined him for several of his games. He returned to the starting lineup by the postseason. Oppong did not earn any major awards at the Division I level, but was considerably more effective as a senior, as he developed into a bigger scorer for Eastern Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{participated in}} the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. After an initial setback, Washington rallied the American troops <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> in a {{successful}} charge against the British forces. After making a brief stand, the British fell back, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them fire upon the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, and broke it down. The British subsequently put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers {{walked out of the}} building and laid down their arms, thus ending the battle in an American victory.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius the Elder resurfaces a year later, {{under the}} command of Comentiolus, in the Battle of Sisarbanon (autumn 589), in the {{vicinity}} of Nisibis. According to the account of Theophylact, Comentiolus supposedly fled towards Theodosiopolis (modern Ra's al-'Ayn) while the battle was still ongoing. Heraclius the Elder took charge of the remaining troops <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to victory. Theophylact, however, lived and wrote during the reign of Heraclius the Younger, and is strongly biased in favour of his father. His account is thus suspect of exaggerating or even inventing Comentiolus' cowardice with the aim of glorifying Heraclius the Elder. The contemporary Evagrius Scholasticus, for instance, credits Comentiolus with being in the thick of combat, and does not mention Heraclius the Elder at all.|$|E
5|$|Hutchinson, born 16 May 1859 in London, England, was {{the third}} son of General William Nelson Hutchinson (1803–1895). He began his golfing career {{at an early age}} playing at the Royal North Devon golf club—also known as Westward Ho!—a course founded in 1864 and {{designed}} by Old Tom Morris. By the age of sixteen he won the club medal championship. He attended Corpus Christi College for a time where he was a cricket player, then Oxford University from 1878–81 where he made an immediate impression by playing number one on the Oxford golf team <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to victory over arch rival Cambridge in the University Golf Match.|$|E

In the following two years, Friedgen became the only ACC head coach to have led his team to win ten games {{in each of his}} first three seasons. In his ten-year tenure, Friedgen led the Terrapins to seven bowl appearances. Most recently, Maryland concluded the 2010 season with a 9-4 record, a win in the Military Bowl, and a top 25 national ranking.|$|E
5|$|In July, while Fuentes was busied in {{the siege}} of Doullens, Maurice of Nassau, statholder of the Dutch Republic, {{assembled}} a force of 6,000 infantry, some cavalry companies and 16 artillery pieces of the Dutch States Army, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> under the walls of Groenlo, a medium-sized town in the County of Zutphen. Its northern flank defended by the Slinge, a stream of the Berkel river, Groenlo was fortified with five bulwarks and garrisoned by 11 infantry companies from Count Herman van den Bergh's regiment numbering 600 troops under Jan van Stirum, a German officer, and four small artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2004, Fertig {{was called}} up to the SmackDown! brand with vignettes playing on the show announcing his new character, Mordecai, a {{religious}} Zealot-type character, which was partially based on his previous Seven gimmick. During numerous promos, Mordecai claimed {{to be on a}} crusade to rid the world of sin. He consistently wore white and had blonde hair and a beard as a sign of his purity. Mordecai debuted in ring for the SmackDown! brand on May 16, 2004 during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, defeating Scotty 2 Hotty. In later appearances, Mordecai condemned the audience for their sins, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> in prayer.

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1851, Tubman {{returned}} to Dorchester County {{for the first time}} since her escape, this time to find her husband, John. She once again saved money from various jobs, purchased a suit for him, and made her way south. John, meanwhile, had married another woman named Caroline. Tubman sent word that he should join her, but he insisted that he was happy where he was. Tubman at first prepared to storm their house and make a scene, but then decided he was not worth the trouble. Suppressing her anger, she found some slaves who wanted to escape <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to Philadelphia. John and Caroline raised a family together, until he was killed 16 years later in a roadside argument with a white man named Robert Vincent.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than simply}} quell the mutiny however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> {{on a short}} {{campaign}} across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus. Germanicus's forces crossed the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the Teutoburg forest and the reclaiming of Roman standards lost years before by Publius Quinctilius Varus, when three Roman legions and its auxiliary cohorts had been ambushed by Germanic tribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{rescue of}} Bat 21 was a {{watershed}} {{event for the}} military <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> {{to find a new}} approach to high-threat search and rescue. They recognized that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, it should not be attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation, had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E

5|$|The {{sighting}} by Jane Tanner, {{one of the}} Tapas Seven, of a man {{carrying a}} child that night became {{an important part of}} the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.|$|E
5|$|A style more melodic {{and more}} akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally {{represented}} during the NWOBHM. The music of Def Leppard, Praying Mantis, White Spirit, Demon, Shy, Gaskin, Dedringer and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock, included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After {{the peak of the}} movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.|$|E
5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired Tom Coughlin, a {{one-time}} assistant of former Giants' coach Bill Parcells, {{to be the}} Giants new head coach. Coughlin had been the inaugural {{head coach of the}} Jacksonville Jaguars, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>them</b> to the AFC championship game twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history. His stark, disciplinarian methods contrasted with the lax style employed by the departed Fassel. The Giants decided that their primary need was a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted John Elway when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted Manning, and Manning wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on Manning.|$|E
