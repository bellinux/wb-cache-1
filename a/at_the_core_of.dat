5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> M87.|$|E

During the 19thcentury it was enlarged, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.|$|E

The lack of {{very cool}} gas <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> groups and {{clusters}} of galaxies, even where the cooling time is significantly {{shorter than the}} Hubble time, has been interpreted as evidence of sources that re-heat the intergalactic medium. Most studies of rich clusters adopt AGN feedback to be this source of heating. From ongoing GMRT projects involving clusters and groups, we demonstrate how low-frequency GMRT radio observations, together with Chandra/XMM-Newton X-ray data, present a unique insight {{into the nature of}} feedback, and of the energy transfer between the AGN and the IGM. 1...|$|R

5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do {{not contribute to the}} net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E

5|$|When helium is {{exhausted}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> {{a massive}} star, the core contracts {{and the temperature}} and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near {{the end of the}} star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.|$|E

5|$|After {{stalling}} offshore {{for almost}} a day, a mid- to upper-tropospheric trough over the central U.S. slowly pulled Tropical Storm Gordon northward then north-northeastward towards Florida's west coast. The storm made landfall between Ft. Myers and Naples with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. The eastward component of the storm's movement increased, and Gordon moved northeastward onto the Florida Peninsula at 10 mph (17 km/h). The storm barely weakened as it crossed the landmass keeping its 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. Crossing the peninsula in a mere six hours, the storm continued to pick up speed. Early on November 17, back over the open ocean, the storm's central pressure began to fall. Improved organization was not apparent and wind shear was pulling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the deep convection when, on November 17, Gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} fuel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it {{evolved into a}} red giant. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star. That is, it belonged {{to a group of}} stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the core a helium-burning shell formed in addition to {{the hydrogen}}-burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time carbon fusion could begin in the core, producing oxygen, neon and magnesium.|$|E
