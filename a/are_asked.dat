For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game.
