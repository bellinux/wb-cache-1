5|$|The {{main focus}} of digital {{forensics}} investigations is to recover objective evidence of a criminal activity (termed <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> in legal parlance). However, the diverse range of data held in digital devices can help with other areas of inquiry.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E
25|$|In R. v. DeSousa, the Court had {{rejected}} {{the claim that}} there must be symmetry between all <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> and mens rea elements.|$|E
25|$|So if {{legislation}} specifically criminalizes an omission through statute; or a duty {{that would}} normally be expected was omitted and caused injury, an <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> has occurred.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited number}} of offenses require a further element of intent beyond the basic intent (where the mens rea {{is no more than}} the {{intentional}} or reckless commission of the <b>actus</b> <b>reus).</b> This additional element is termed specific intent.|$|E
25|$|Voluntariness {{includes}} omission, for {{implicit in}} omission {{is that the}} actor voluntarily chose to not perform a bodily movement and, consequently, caused an injury. The purposeful, reckless, or negligent absence of an action is considered a voluntary action and fulfills the voluntary requirement of <b>actus</b> <b>reus.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the general}} {{scientific}} {{consensus is that}} hypnosis cannot induce individuals to engage in conduct {{in which they would}} not otherwise engage, the Model Penal Code, as well as the criminal codes of Montana, New York, and Kentucky do provide hypnosis and hypnotic suggestion as negating volition, and consequently, <b>actus</b> <b>reus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Possession holds {{a special}} place in that it has been criminalized but under common law does not {{constitute}} an act. Some countries like the United States have avoided the common law conclusion in Regina v. Dugdale by legally defining possession as a voluntary act. As a voluntary act, it fulfills the requirements to establish <b>actus</b> <b>reus.</b>|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, former Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo Krajišnik {{was found}} guilty of {{multiple}} instances of crimes against humanity, but while the ICTY judges found that there was evidence that crimes committed in Bosnia constituted the criminal act of genocide (<b>actus</b> <b>reus),</b> they did not establish that the accused possessed genocidal intent, or was part of a criminal enterprise that had such an intent (mens rea).|$|E
25|$|In DPP v Harper (1997) it {{was held}} that {{insanity}} is not generally a defense to strict liability offences. In this instance, the accused was driving with excess alcohol. By definition, the accused is sufficiently aware {{of the nature of}} the activity to commit the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of driving and presumably knows that driving while drunk is legally wrong. Any other feature of the accused's knowledge is irrelevant.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{affirmed that}} the mens rea or mental element for {{liability}} was the intentional {{publication of the}} allegedly contemptuous statement. The Court then focused on the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of the offence, and considered the legal principles for identifying the suitable test for liability for scandalizing contempt. In particular, the Court detailed {{the contents of the}} real risk test, the clear and present danger test, and the inherent tendency test. It held that the real risk test was the applicable test for scandalizing contempt in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|A lower {{threshold}} of mens rea is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. It is the mental {{state of mind}} of the person {{at the time the}} <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> was committed. For instance, if C tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning. Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk. Of course, a requirement only that one ought to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing intent as a requirement. In this way, the importance of mens rea has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.|$|E
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, {{a conspiracy}} is {{an agreement between}} two or more persons {{to commit a crime}} at some time in the future. Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act must also have been undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an offense. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare attempts which require proximity to the full offence). For the purposes of concurrence, the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability – unless, in some cases, it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts – but may reduce their sentence.|$|E
25|$|Goran Jelisic, in 1999, {{pleaded guilty}} to the charges of crimes against {{humanity}} and violating the laws and customs of war and {{pleaded not guilty to}} genocide. The Trial Chamber found that, despite discriminatory intent and the commission of acts within the definition of the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of genocide, Jelisić did not have the requisite intent to destroy {{in whole or in part}} the Muslim group from Brčko. He was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. The Appeals Chamber, among other things, held that the Trial Chamber’s erroneous application of the standard under Rule 98 bis(B) led to an incorrect assessment of the evidence as insufficient to sustain a conviction for genocide, but it did not consider it appropriate to reverse the acquittal and to remit the case for further proceedings, since a retrial would only be limited to the question of whether Jelisić possessed the genocidal intent, and thus it affirmed the sentence. On 29 May 2003, Jelisić was transferred to Italy to serve the remainder of his sentence with credit for time served since his arrest on 22 January 1998.|$|E
500|$|Section 1(1) also {{provides}} that the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> must be [...] "more than merely preparatory". In practice, academic Jonathan Herring notes that [...] "there is no {{hard and fast}} rule about when an act {{may be more than}} merely preparatory", although there are several cases which give broad guidance. In R v Geddes, a man entered the toilets in a school in Brighton with a large knife, some rope and a roll of masking tape; it was alleged that he was intending to kidnap a pupil. The Court of Appeal confirmed that this was not enough for a conviction. However, certain general rules have been laid down; if the defendant has committed the last act before completing his offence, it constitutes an attempt, as in R v Jones. This is not, however, necessary in all situations, as in R v Gullefer. The <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of the full offence is also taken into account; in R v Toothill, the defendant was charged with attempted burglary after trespassing into the victim's garden and knocking on their door. He was found guilty, because he had entered the property [...] the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> for burglary [...] and his actions were thus more than merely preparatory. The wording [...] "does an act" [...] prevents liability for omissions, a distinction that the Law Commission has looked to remove, at least in the case of attempted murder.|$|E
500|$|The {{mens rea}} element {{is that of}} [...] "malice", which means either {{intention}} or recklessness. Cunningham recklessness is applied. However, {{for the purposes of}} recklessness, foresight of even minor harm is sufficient [...] it does not require foresight of serious harm. This has been criticised since it breaks the correspondence principle, that the mens rea should match the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of an offence.|$|E
500|$|The <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> is {{the wound}} or infliction of {{grievous bodily harm}} (GBH). A [...] "wound" [...] is {{something}} that breaks all layers of the skin, and must have an external component [...] internal bleeding, however serious, is not a wound. Serious wounds would also fall under grievous bodily harm, but some qualifying wounds (a pin prick, for example) are very minor. Some wounds would therefore not qualify as grievous bodily harm.|$|E
500|$|The case of R v Brown {{established}} a further requirement: hostility. This {{is not easily}} called an <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> nor mens rea requirement. It was not clear what role it played in that case, but could apply to other cases {{as a way of}} clarifying the [...] "everyday behaviour" [...] guidance. It has been strongly criticised by Lord Goff and other judicial and academic writers. It could apply to future cases where the bodily harm was unintended or unforeseen.|$|E
500|$|Murder {{has never}} been statutorily defined, despite being {{recognised}} as either the most serious crime, or certainly among them. The <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> (prohibited act) of murder, unlawfully causing the death of another person, fits the general provisions for homicide. The mens rea (mental element) of murder was long held to be [...] "malice aforethought", which took on a meaning only of the required mental state for murder, since malice aforethought required neither malice (compassionate killing is still murder) nor aforethought (no premeditation is required). It is this mental component that marks murder out from manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|Assault is {{a summary}} offence in England and Wales, {{with the case}} heard only at a Magistrates' Court. Although R v Little {{considered}} assault a statutory offence, none of the statutes referred to contain any definition of assault. The <b>actus</b> <b>reus,</b> endorsed in R v Ireland, is any act by D that causes V to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. The term [...] "force" [...] rather than [...] "violence" [...] {{is used by the}} Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). As a definition, this has proven stable, but its interpretation has varied. The force must be unlawful [...] outside the realm of defensive or preventative force, for example. Consent of the victim may be enough to prevent the commission of a crime. There is to debate as to whether lack of consent is an element of the <b>actus</b> <b>reus,</b> making it inherent to the commission of a crime, or whether consent is a defence. Andrew Simester and Bob Sullivan argue that the former is more correct, since lack on consent is vital to the crime; since the act may not constitute a harm even if enacted. The disregard for the victim's autonomy and privacy is the actionable part of the offence. The victim need not be frightened by the apprehension of violence, merely not want the person concerned to do it.|$|E
500|$|The {{mens rea}} {{requirement}} for battery {{is similar to}} assault. It is the intention to apply unlawful force to another, or be reckless as to whether such force is applied. It employs Cunningham recklessness [...] that the defendant must have foreseen {{the risk of the}} infliction of unlawful force upon V. In theory, at least, combining the mens rea of battery with the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of assault, or vice versa, is not a crime. The Majewski test is applied to cases of voluntary intoxication, as battery is also a crime of [...] "basic intent" [...] in this scenario.|$|E
500|$|Inchoate means [...] "just begun" [...] or [...] "undeveloped", {{and is used}} in English {{criminal}} law to refer to situations where, although a substantial offence has not been committed, the defendant has taken steps to commit it, or encouraged others to do so. These situations are generally divided into three categories; attempts, where the defendant has taken steps [...] "towards carrying out a complete crime", incitement, where the defendant has encouraged others to commit a crime, and conspiracy, where the defendant has agreed with others to commit a crime. In each case, the defendant [...] "has not himself performed the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> but is sufficiently close to doing so, or persuading others to do so, for the law to find it appropriate to punish him".|$|E
500|$|The {{offences}} of [...] "encouraging or assisting a crime" [...] {{under the}} Serious Crime Act 2007 are inchoate offences. In each case, the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> requirement {{is that the}} defendant carry out an act capable of [...] "encouraging or assisting" [...] the commission of another offence. An offence is committed under section 44, if this is done with intent to do the same; under section 45 if it is done [...] "believing that the offence will be committed and that the act will encourage or assist its commission"; or under section 46 where there are multiple possible offences being encouraged or assisted, {{and at least one}} is foreseen. There is no need for the defendant to have successfully communicated his thoughts to anyone else. Since this is very wide, the courts will have to narrow it by some criterion, probably by reference to the remoteness of the encouragement to the crime. Failing to act when under a duty to do so would also qualify.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Actus</b> <b>reus</b> is Latin for [...] "guilty act" [...] {{and is the}} {{physical}} element of committing a crime. [...] It may be accomplished by an action, by threat of action, or exceptionally, by an omission to act, which is a legal duty to act. For example, the act of A striking B might suffice, or a parent's failure to give food to a young child also may provide the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> for a crime.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rationale}} {{for the existence of}} criminal laws is as a deterrent to those who represent a danger to society. If an accused has actually committed the full offence, the reality of the danger has been demonstrated. But, where the commission of the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> is in the future, a clear subjective intention to cause the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of the full offense must be demonstrated. Without this [...] "specific intent", there is insufficient evidence that the accused is the clear danger as feared because, at any time before the commission of the full offense, the accused may change his or her mind and not continue.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} an <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> to be {{committed}} there has {{to have been an}} act. Various common law jurisdictions define act differently but generally, an act is a [...] "bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary." [...] In Robinson v. California, , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a California law making it illegal to be a drug addict was unconstitutional because the mere status of being a drug addict was not an act and thus not criminal. Commentator Dennis Baker asserts: [...] "Although lawyers find the expression <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> convenient, it is misleading in one respect. It means not just the criminal act but all the external elements of an offence. Ordinarily, there is a criminal act, which is what makes the term <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> generally acceptable. But there are crimes without an act, and therefore without an <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> in the obvious meaning of that term. The expression “conduct” is more satisfactory, because wider; it covers not only an act but an omission, and (by a stretch) a bodily position. The conduct must sometimes take place in legally relevant circumstances. The relevant circumstances might include consent in the case of rape. The act of human sexual intercourse becomes a wrongful act if it is committed in circumstances where one party does not consent and/or one or more parties concerned are below the age of consent. Other crimes require the act to produce a legally forbidden consequence. Such crimes are called result crimes. ... All that can truly be said, without exception, is that a crime requires some external state of affairs that can be categorized as criminal. What goes on inside a person’s head is never enough in itself to constitute a crime, even though it might be proved by a confession that is fully believed to be genuine." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{criminal}} law generally prohibits undesirable acts. [...] Thus, {{proof of a}} crime requires proof of some act. [...] Scholars label this the requirement of an <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> or guilty act. [...] Some crimes – particularly modern regulatory offenses – require no more, and they are known as strict liability offenses (E.g. Under the Road traffic Act 1988 it is a strict liability offence to drive a vehicle with an alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit). [...] Nevertheless, because of the potentially severe consequences of criminal conviction, judges at common law also sought proof of an intent to do some bad thing, the mens rea or guilty mind. [...] As to crimes of which both <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> and mens rea are requirements, judges {{have concluded that the}} elements must be present at precisely the same moment and it is not enough that they occurred sequentially at different times.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 July 2007, European Court of Human Rights when {{dismissing the}} appeal by Nikola Jorgić against his {{conviction}} for genocide by a German court (Jorgic v. Germany) {{noted that the}} German courts wider interpretation of genocide has since been rejected by international courts considering similar cases. The ECHR also noted that {{in the 21st century}} [...] "Amongst scholars, the majority have taken the view that ethnic cleansing, {{in the way in which}} it was carried out by the Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to expel Muslims and Croats from their homes, did not constitute genocide. However, there are also a considerable number of scholars who have suggested that these acts did amount to genocide, and the ICTY has found in the Momcilo Krajisnik case that the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of genocide was met in Prijedor [...] "With regard to the charge of genocide, the Chamber found that in spite of evidence of acts perpetrated in the municipalities which constituted the <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> of genocide".|$|E
2500|$|The terms <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> and {{mens rea}} {{developed}} in English Law {{are derived from}} the principle stated by Edward Coke, namely, actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, which means: [...] "an act {{does not make a}} person guilty unless (their) mind is also guilty"; hence, the general test of guilt is one that requires proof of fault, culpability or blameworthiness both in thought and action.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> may be nullified by {{an absence}} of causation. [...] For example, a crime {{involves}} harm to a person, the person's action must be the but for cause and proximate cause of the harm. If more than one cause exists (e.g. harm comes {{at the hands of}} more than one culprit) the act must have [...] "more than a slight or trifling link" [...] to the harm.|$|E
2500|$|Criminal law, {{also known}} as penal law, {{pertains}} to crimes and punishment. It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences {{found to have a}} sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place. Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of criminal procedure. The paradigm case of a crime lies in the proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> (guilty act). Second, the accused must have the requisite malicious intent to do a criminal act, or mens rea (guilty mind). However, for so called [...] "strict liability" [...] crimes, an <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> is enough. Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (dolus directus and dolus eventualis), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.|$|E
2500|$|Under most U.S. laws, for {{a person}} to be convicted of conspiracy, not only must he or she agree to commit a crime, but {{at least one of the}} conspirators must commit an overt act (the <b>actus</b> <b>reus)</b> in {{furtherance}} of the crime. However, in United States v. Shabani the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this [...] "overt act" [...] element is not required under the federal drug conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C. section 846.|$|E
2500|$|For conduct to {{constitute}} an <b>actus</b> <b>reus,</b> {{it must be}} engaged in voluntarily. Few sources enumerate the entirety of what constitutes voluntary and involuntary conduct. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his 1881 book The Common Law, disputed whether {{such a thing as}} an involuntary act exists: [...] " [...] spasm is not an act. The contraction of the muscles must be willed." [...] A few sources, such as the Model Penal Code, provide a more thorough treatment of involuntary conduct: ...|$|E
2500|$|Causation is the [...] "causal {{relationship}} between conduct and result". In other words, causation {{provides a means}} of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury. In criminal law, it {{is defined as the}} <b>actus</b> <b>reus</b> (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with mens rea (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. Causation only applies where a result has been achieved and therefore is immaterial with regard to inchoate offenses.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Actus</b> <b>reus</b> (...) , {{sometimes}} called the external element or the objective element of a crime, is the Latin term for the [...] "guilty act" [...] which, when proved {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} in combination with the mens rea, [...] "guilty mind", produces criminal liability in the common law-based criminal law jurisdictions of England and Wales, Canada, Australia, India, Pakistan, South Africa, New Zealand, Scotland, Nigeria, Ghana, Ireland, Israel and the United States of America. In the United States of America, some crimes also require proof of an attendant circumstance.|$|E
