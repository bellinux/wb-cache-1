40|$|The {{computer}} simulation programs for increasing lumber recovery {{are presented in}} this paper. These programs were created for sawing logs with live <b>sawing,</b> half <b>sawing,</b> <b>and</b> semi-quarter <b>sawing</b> patterns, <b>and</b> convening the <b>sawn</b> limber into blanks using turbo basic language version 1, 1. The log model used was a truncated cylinder to represent the real logs. The best opening first (BOF) of logs is computed by entering data of log factors such as diameter <b>and</b> length, <b>and</b> <b>sawing</b> factors such as saw kerf, sawn limber thickness, allowance for sawing thickness, blank width, <b>and</b> allowance for <b>sawing</b> width. For several runs on computer under any circumtances the program produced nominal lumber and blank recovery ranging 73 - 76 % and 83 - 89 %, respectively, the values of shrinkage allowance, planing allowance <b>and</b> <b>sawing</b> variation {{have been included in}} nominal lumber recovery...|$|R
