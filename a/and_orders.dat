40|$|A {{significant}} {{topic in}} American political discourse {{is that of}} law <b>and</b> <b>order.</b> Politicians, civic leaders, and policy makers often propose a hard-line towards crime so that “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” is maintained. In this essay, I contend that the discourse of “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” has taken on mythic properties in American political discourse, and that the media, in large part, {{has contributed to the}} creation of a “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” myth. The “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” rhetoric of J. Edgar Hoover, Estes Kaufaver, George C. Wallace, and Richard Nixon all have been greatly aided by a media presence that extends the topic of “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” beyond the realm of political discourse and into the realm of political myth. This essay discusses the influence of Hoover, Kefauver’s, Wallace’s, and Nixon’s “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” rhetoric, <b>and</b> points out the media coverage, in each of these cases, aided in creating a powerful cultural and political “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” myth...|$|R

5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions <b>and</b> <b>orders</b> to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions <b>and</b> <b>orders</b> are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E

The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle {{the tens of thousands of}} orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E
