5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead.

Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with <b>awareness</b> of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} plan and strategize, much like {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen in}} the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. <b>Awareness</b> of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, this <b>awareness</b> would have been essential for survival and the {{ability to plan}} subsistence strategies based on this <b>awareness</b> demonstrates an ability to think beyond the present tense and act upon this knowledge.|$|E
