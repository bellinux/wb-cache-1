We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, but it seems like the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E

When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{delivered}} by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and {{were applied to}} the 1,000 or so shots in the film, {{though most of the}} effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements—groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements. Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: [...] "The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real person. You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> they're looking at." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is.

2500|$|Colin Cowdrey {{snapped his}} Achilles tendon and the {{selectors}} made the surprise choice of Ray Illingworth as his replacement. Illingworth was another tough Yorkshireman, but {{had moved to}} Leicestershire as captain in 1969 after a contract dispute. He {{was seen as a}} caretaker captain, but made the job his own and kept it even after the old captain had recovered. He started well, with Snow taking 4/54 when the West Indies crashed to 147 all out at Old Trafford and lost by an innings. At Lord's the West Indies chose to bat and reached 324/5 before Snow took 5/114 to get them out for 380. Illingworth saved the English innings with a century to cement his place as captain and the Test ended in a thrilling draw with England needing 37 runs with 3 wickets in hand. It was here that Snow [...] "penned in verse my feelings and impressions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like to play at the headquarters of world cricket" [...] in his poem Lord's Test. In the Third Test at Headingley there was a problem when Illingworth asked Snow to [...] "give me everything you've got" [...] when the West Indians were 240/7 needing 303 to win, but Snow found the pitch lifeless, changed to medium-paced seamers, failed to take a wicket and Illingworth was not best pleased. England still won the Test by 30 runs and the series 2–0 and Snow was the chief wicket-taker with 15 (27.06) It the last time England would beat the West Indies for 31 years.|$|E
2500|$|Lyle Masaki of AfterElton.com commends the manga for {{illustrating}} [...] "the challenges gay men face in Japanese society", and for {{not following}} the traditional mode of student-teacher romantic relationships in [...] "Boys Love" [...] titles, opting instead for a friendship where both characters discover more <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to be a gay man. Holly Ellingwood at Active Anime commended {{the first volume}} its unique artwork, and praised the plot for its [...] "bittersweet" [...] poignancy, and for showing unrequited love rather than being a simplistic story about [...] "winning the guy". She felt the second volume had [...] "unusual pacing" [...] and came off as [...] "abrupt" [...] peeks {{into the lives of}} many different couples. Mania.com's Danielle Van Gorder praised the manga for its characterization and ability to reflect reality. Erin Finnegan of Pop Culture Shock criticized the story for Ida and Hachizume adopting each other, essentially getting married, before having sex, which she regarded as unrealistic. Comic World News's David Welsh says that Yoshinaga's characters, even in this early work, have layers, and that it is enjoyable to see how the frank student inspires the adult characters to communicate better. Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux criticizes the manga for its inability to focus on one couple. Robin Brenner described the plot as being [...] "an engaging meditation on how crushes are wonderful, but oh, how they can hurt." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the story as having been [...] "padded out", but enjoyed the theme of [...] "love and loss" [...] in the manga. [...] Johanna Draper Carlson felt it was novel for the treatment of sex in the first volume to consist of a character making sure {{they would be able to}} satisfy their partner.
