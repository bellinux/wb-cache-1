5|$|As {{they came}} to the elbow, on the 494-yard run-in to home, Cahervillahow, Romany King, The Committee and Esha Ness {{remained}} tight and vying for position. But it was 50/1 shot Esha Ness, ridden by John White and trained by Jenny Pitman, who crossed the line first, in the second-fastest time in Grand National history. Cahervillahow came home second despite trailing in fourth at the elbow, Romany King was third and The Committee fourth. Givus <b>A</b> <b>Buck</b> completed in fifth, with On The Other Hand and Laura's Beau completing the seven finishers of the National that never was.|$|E
5|$|Paradox was a strongly-built {{bay horse}} bred by the Graham {{brothers}} at the Yardley Stud near Birmingham. He was sired by the 2,000 Guineas runner-up Sterling out of Casuistry, an undistinguished racehorse {{who had been}} sold cheaply {{at the end of}} her racing career by Lord Rosebery. Casuistry became an important broodmare, being the direct female ancestor of notable thoroughbreds such as Humorist, Royal Palace and Spend <b>a</b> <b>Buck.</b> As a yearling Paradox was bought for 700 guineas by the trainer John Porter on behalf of his associate, Captain Bowling. Porter trained the colt at his stable at Kingsclere.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{and goats}} are closely related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and <b>a</b> <b>buck</b> (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E

25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual begins with <b>a</b> <b>buck</b> following a doe, {{waiting for her}} to urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female will lift her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, 19 July, Carey scrambled {{on three}} occasions {{and participated in}} two patrols covering Allied shipping in the Channel. On the fourth sortie he was scrambled at 16:55 to intercept enemy aircraft off Selsey Bill. The squadron engaged Bf 109s from III./Jagdgeschwader 27. During the engagement Carey claimed to have scored hits on two and to have shot down one. It is possible Carey's victim was Leutnant Erbo Graf von Kageneck who was wounded. The battle had been expensive. Two 43 Squadron Hurricanes were lost. Flight Lieutenant John W.C Simpson was wounded and bailed out of Hurricane P3140 with and injured foot. He broke a collar bone as he collided with a garden fence. Sergeant J. <b>A</b> <b>Buck</b> was killed after he baled out. Carey heard him radio that he {{was wounded in the}} leg and intended to parachute out. Buck's body was later washed onto the beach; he had apparently drowned. In his combat report, Carey stated that he followed his victim down through cloud and observed oil and wreckage on the water—but this was probably Simpson's Hurricane. Kageneck was the only loss admitted by the Germans. He managed to return to France wounded. No mention of Kageneck's damaged Bf 109 was made in German records.|$|E
25|$|The {{church was}} {{completed}} in 1886 and it was dedicated and consecrated by Mrs Williams' uncle, The Bishop of Ripon, at Michaelmas, Thursday 29 September. (On {{the afternoon of the}} same day, the bishop consecrated another church also dedicated to St Michael and All Angels at Cottingley, near Bingley.) The church was filled, although Beckwithshaw was at that time just a hamlet with a few surrounding farmhouses. There was a grand procession into the church, headed by the robed choir. Behind them came the churchwardens, one of which was Henry Williams the donor, then the Bishop of Ripon in full vestments. Behind them followed many robed clergymen, including Samuel Owen Madden the Dean of Cork, Henry Stewart the Dean of Dromore, Rev. Canon William Winter Gibbon, MA, vicar of Christ Church, High Harrogate, Rev. Dr <b>A.</b> <b>Buck</b> of St Mary's Church, Stainburn, Rev. Mark Rowntree, MA, of St Robert's Church, Pannal, Rev. G.O. Brownrigg, MA, vicar of St Mary's Harrogate, Rev. R.G. Brownrigg of St Mary's, Harrogate, Rev. A. Robinson of St John the Evangelist Church, Bilton, Rev. T.F. Buckton of Christ Church, High Harrogate, and Rev. H. Kershaw of St Mary's Church, Greenhow Hill. Gibbon, Rowntree and Buck conducted the service, because the church did not yet have its own vicar. The organ was not yet installed, so a Miss Burnley played a harmonium, which may at that time have been placed within the organ arch. The choir was made up of local residents who had been trained by the new choirmaster, Mr Halliwell. The bishop preached the sermon, after which there was a collection amounting to £11 13s., for the Wakefield Bishopric Fund.|$|E

500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me <b>a</b> <b>buck.</b> Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you <b>a</b> <b>buck.</b> We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E

500|$|The crowd became {{steadily}} younger over time. In the 1990s, {{when her}} parents still operated the bar, Barisich {{asked if she could}} sell a case of what was then considered premium beer. She recalled, [...] "I convinced them to let me buy a case of Heineken's, which at that time sold for unheard-of price of <b>a</b> <b>buck</b> a bottle. My dad said that people would never pay that much for a bottle of beer, and they'd only let me buy the case if I promised to drink what didn't sell." [...] Her introduction of premium beer proved to be successful. Lutz would soon be recognized by Blitz-Weinhard for serving more Blitz beer than any other establishment.|$|E

[...] "I've even had cases of teenagers writing to me saying they are contemplating suicide because they don't want to see the world end", Morrison said. [...] "I think when you lie on the internet and scare children to make <b>a</b> <b>buck,</b> that is ethically wrong."

500|$|Mars {{explained}} the meaning behind the album's title {{by saying that}} {{it had become a}} [...] "soulful, experimental, electronic, hard-to-explain" [...] concept. In order to record an album like that, it was—according to him—mandatory to experiment and not follow any known pattern, resulting the guests enlisted for the record to be unexpected. According to the singer, jazz artist Esperanza Spalding and Diplo were among them. Furthermore, the [...] "pop's most innovative producers" [...] (Bhasker, Haynie and Ronson) had to be taken [...] "beyond their comfort zone". While being interviewed for his Billboard Artist of the Year cover story, Mars complimented Ronson and Bhasker by explaining that [...] "it's not about what's hot on the radio or the fastest way to make <b>a</b> <b>buck,</b> these guys are fearless, doing the music they want to do".
