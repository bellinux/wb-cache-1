2500|$|In flash memory, each {{memory cell}} resembles a {{standard}} MOSFET, {{except that the}} transistor has two gates instead of one. On top is the control gate (CG), as in other MOS transistors, but below this there is <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> (FG) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer, electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field (e.g. Applied voltage or UV as in EPROM). Counter-intuitively, placing electrons on the FG sets the transistor to the logical [...] "0" [...] state. Once the FG is charged, the electrons in it screen (partially cancel) the electric field from the CG, thus, increasing the threshold voltage (VT1) of the cell. This means that now a higher voltage(VT2) must {{be applied to the}} CG to make the channel conductive. In order to read a value from the transistor, an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages (VT1 & VT2) is applied to the CG. If the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage, the FG must be uncharged (if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than VT2), and hence, a logical [...] "1" [...] is stored in the gate. If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage, it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical [...] "0" [...] is stored in the gate. The presence of a logical [...] "0" [...] or [...] "1" [...] is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the CG. In a multi-level cell device, which stores more than one bit per cell, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.|$|E

50|$|Both {{floating}} gate flash and charge trapping flash use a stacked gate structure in which <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> or charge trapping layer lies immediately above the channel, and below a control gate.

5000|$|Flash memory {{works by}} {{modulating}} charge (electrons) stored within {{the gate of}} a MOS transistor.

50|$|Compared {{with other}} {{non-volatile}} random-access memory (NVRAM) technologies, NRAM has several advantages. In flash memory, the {{common form of}} NVRAM, each cell resembles a MOSFET transistor with a control gate (CG) modulated by <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> <b>gate</b> (FG) interposed between the CG and the FG. The FG is surrounded by an insulating dielectric, typically an oxide. Since the FG is electrically isolated by the surrounding dielectric, any electrons placed on the FG will be trapped on the FG which screens the CG from the channel of the transistor and modifies the threshold voltage (VT) of the transistor. By writing and controlling the amount of charge placed on the FG, the FG controls the conduction state of the MOSFET flash device depending on the VT of the cell selected. The current flowing through the MOSFET channel is sensed to determine {{the state of the}} cell forming a binary code where a 1 state (current flow) when an appropriate CG voltage is applied and a 0 state (no current flow) when the CG voltage is applied.|$|E
