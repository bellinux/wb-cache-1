40|$|Abstract. We perform critical-point {{analysis}} for three-variable systems that represent essential {{processes of the}} growth of the <b>angiogenic</b> <b>tumor,</b> namely, tumor growth, vascularization, and generation of angiogenic factor (protein) as a function of effective vessel density. Two models that describe tumor growth depending on vascular mass and regulation of new vessel formation through a key angiogenic factor are explored. The first model is formulated in terms of ODEs, while the second assumes delays in this regulation, thus leading to a system of DDEs. In both models, the only nontrivial critical point is always unstable, while one of the trivial critical points is always stable. The models predict unlimited growth, if the initial condition is close enough to the nontrivial critical point, and this growth may be characterized by oscillations in tumor and vascular mass. We suggest that angiogenesis per se does not suffice for explaining the observed stabilization of vascular tumor size. 1. Introduction. Th...|$|E

Regions of abnormal perfusion were determined from peak height and percent recovery maps for each voxel within the spectroscopic imaging volume.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms that}} control the balance between antiangiogenic and proangiogenic factors and initiate the <b>angiogenic</b> switch in <b>tumors</b> remain poorly defined. By combining chemical genetics with multimodal imaging, we have identified an autocrine feed-forward loop in tumor cells in which tumor-derived VEGF stimulates VEGF production via VEGFR 2 -dependent activation of mTOR, substantially amplifying the initial proangiogenic signal. Disruption of this feed-forward loop by chemical perturbation or knockdown of VEGFR 2 in tumor cells dramatically inhibited production of VEGF in vitro and in vivo. This disruption was sufficient to prevent tumor growth in vivo. In patients with lung cancer, we found that this VEGF:VEGFR 2 feed-forward loop was active, {{as the level of}} VEGF/VEGFR 2 binding in tumor cells was highly correlated to tumor angiogenesis. We further demonstrated that inhibition of tumor cell VEGFR 2 induces feedback activation of the IRS/MAPK signaling cascade. Most strikingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR 2 (ZD 6474) and MEK (PD 0325901) in tumor cells resulted in dramatic tumor shrinkage, whereas monotherapy only modestly slowed tumor growth. Thus, a tumor cell-autonomous VEGF:VEGFR 2 feed-forward loop provides signal amplification required for the establishment of fully <b>angiogenic</b> <b>tumors</b> in lung cancer.

We created malignant astrocytes with genetic deletions of the VHL gene and implanted them in subcutaneous and intracranial sites; these sites are respectively vessel poor and vessel-rich tissues. When grown in a vessel poor site, VEGF expression in VHL null cells was important for both vascularization and tumor growth. However, when the same cells are grown in the vessel-rich intracranial environment, loss of VEGF expression reduces vascularization, but does not affect tumor growth. This indicates that antiangiogenic therapies for tumors that express high levels of angiogenic factors such as VEGF may vary in their efficacy, with potentially lowered effectiveness in sites, such as the brain, that are inherently vessel rich. status: publishe...|$|R

Despite these encouraging beneficial effects, patients inevitably develop resistance and frequently fail to demonstrate significantly better overall survival. Unlike chemotherapies, to which tumors exhibit resistance due to genetic mutation of drug targets, emerging evidence suggests that tumors bypass antiangiogenic therapy while VEGF signaling remains inhibited through a variety of mechanisms that are just beginning to be recognized. Because of the indirect nature of resistance to VEGF inhibitors there is promise that strategies combining angiogenesis inhibitors with drugs targeting such evasive resistance pathways will lead to more durable antiangiogenic efficacy and improved patient outcomes.
