40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} athletes’ use of chewing gum <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{ergogenic}} <b>aid</b> in their sports engagements. Descriptive survey design {{was used for}} the study. Four each of research questions and hypotheses were raised to guide the study. A sample of 276 (164 males and 112 females) was purposively drawn from a population of athletes that participated during NUGA preliminaries in 2006. A self-structured validated questionnaire {{was used for the}} collection of data. The data collected were descriptively and inferentially analyzed. The findings revealed that: Athletes perceive chewing gum <b>as</b> <b>an</b> efficacious psychological means of adjusting to sports stress and conditions. The level of use of chewing gum by athletes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> psychogenic <b>aid</b> is dependent upon the importance attached to the sports engagement, the less the importance the less the use. Assorted reasons are projected by athletes for using chewing gum <b>as</b> <b>a</b> psychogenic <b>aid.</b> The use of chewing gum <b>as</b> <b>a</b> psychogenic <b>aid</b> favours female athletes more than their male counterparts. The degree of use of chewing gum by athletes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> psychogenic <b>aid</b> discriminates among various sports types...|$|R

5|$|The {{next most}} common use is <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|Cationized tannins <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{retention}} <b>aid</b> for {{cellulose fibre}} Daniel Bäckström   Abstract The {{purpose of this}} study was to try cationized tannins <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential retention <b>aid</b> for cellulose fibres in papermaking and to compare their potential with starch which already is commonly used. The study also tried to find other advantages with using tannins <b>as</b> <b>a</b> retention <b>aid.</b> Synthetic retention aids like polyacrylamide is also commonly used in papermaking, with good results. Synthetic retention aids are long-lived and their long-term effect on the environment is unkown. Therefore the demands are growing for more bio-degradable products. Measure glass, turbidity removal and COD was used in this study to analyse tannins <b>as</b> <b>a</b> retention <b>aid</b> on cellulose fibres. The results showed very clear water and a higher flocculation compared to the glass without tannins. 500 ppm tannins added to recycled fibres showed the best results for both flocculation and clear water as well as the highest turbidity removal, from 85 to 24 FTU. Different tannins was used in this study, and Tanfloc from the bark of the Acacia tree showed the best results. In the comparison between cationized starch and Tanfloc, Tanfloc showed better results for both flocculation and clearer water. Tannins shows potential <b>as</b> <b>a</b> retention <b>aid</b> for cellulose fibres, but clearer water and higher flocculation is not enough to determine tannins <b>as</b> <b>a</b> retention <b>aid.</b> They also show potential to solve the problem with bacteria in paper making because of their antibacterial effect. However, more tests and other methods needs to be done to show tannins potential <b>as</b> <b>a</b> retention <b>aid...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1976, Shulgin was {{introduced}} to MDMA by {{a student in the}} medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1912 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never explored in its own right. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists around the nation, including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and she had had four children.|$|E
5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} jet streams <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the islands}} have a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is about 400 million years old, and was laid down in the Devonian period.

5|$|The {{kingdom of}} the East Angles was an {{independent}} and long-lived Anglo-Saxon kingdom that was established after migrants arrived in southeast Suffolk from the area now known as Jutland. Rainbird Clarke identified Wehha {{as one of the}} leaders of the new arrivals: the East Angles are tentatively identified with the Geats of the Old English poem Beowulf. Historians have used sources such as the Anglian collection too <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> in calculating a date for the establishment of the kingdom. Collingwood and Myers note the use of literacy sources and archaeological finds as evidence in how the region was settled during and after the 5th century, when various disparate groups arrived in Norfolk and Suffolk from different parts of the coast and the rivers of the Fens.|$|E
