5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E
5|$|In a genome wide {{association}} screen (GWAS), CASS4 {{showed a}} significant correlation with clinical pathological features of AD such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Two additional CASS4 SNPs were reported {{to be associated with}} AD susceptibility: rs6024870, and rs16979934 T/G. Given the likely conserved CAS-family cytoskeletal function of CASS4, it has been speculated that it may have a role in axonal transport and influence the expression of the <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP) and tau, which are pathologically affected in AD. Several possible mechanisms for CASS4 action in AD have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} polyozellin—a chemical {{which can}} be isolated and purified from P.multiplex—inhibits prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), an enzyme that has a role in processing proteins (specifically, <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein)</b> in Alzheimer's disease. Chemicals that inhibit PEP have attracted research interest due to their potential therapeutic effects. Further analyses of extracts from P.multiplex revealed similar dibenzofuranyl derivatives of polyozellin, each with different chemical properties, including kynapcin-12, kynapcin-13 and -28, and -24. A total synthesis of kynapcin-24 was achieved in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E

25|$|Finally, Villa-Komaroff {{contributed to}} the {{discovery}} that a molecule known {{to be associated with}} Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid beta) causes degeneration of brain cells (neurons), work done in conjunction with a postdoctoral fellow in her laboratory, Bruce Yankner. Before this publication, it was unclear whether amyloid beta was a byproduct of neuronal degeneration or a contributor to that degeneration. This paper provided the first direct evidence that a fragment of the <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> could kill neurons, and helped stimulate a very large field dedicated to preventing and treating Alzheimer’s disease by targeting amyloid beta.|$|E
25|$|Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit {{protease}} complex, {{itself an}} integral membrane protein, that cleaves single-pass transmembrane proteins at residues within the transmembrane domain. Proteases {{of this type}} are known as intramembrane proteases. The most well-known substrate of gamma secretase is <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein,</b> a large integral membrane protein that, when cleaved by both gamma and beta secretase, produces a short 42 amino acid peptide called amyloid beta whose abnormally folded fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Gamma secretase is also critical in the related processing of several other type I integral membrane proteins, such as Notch, ErbB4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, ephrin-B2, or CD44.|$|E
50|$|GAB2 {{has been}} {{indicated}} in {{playing a role}} in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via its interaction with tau and <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> GAB2 may prevent neuronal tangle formation characteristic of LOAD by reducing phosphorylation of tau protein via the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway, which activates Akt. Akt inactivates Gsk3, which is responsible for tau phosphorylation. Mutations in GAB2 could affect Gsk3-dependent phosphorylation of tau and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Interactions between GAB2-Grb2 and APP are enhanced in AD brains, suggesting an involvement of this coupling in the neuropathogenesis of AD.|$|R

40|$|Clones for the <b>amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> <b>precursor</b> gene were {{isolated}} from a cDNA library prepared from the frontal cortex {{of a patient}} who had died with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease; {{they were used to}} investigate the tissue and cellular distribution of <b>amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> <b>precursor</b> mRNA in brain tissues from control patients and from Alzheimer's disease patients. <b>Amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> <b>precursor</b> mRNA was expressed in similar amounts in all control human brain regions examined, but a reduction of the mRNA level was observed in the frontal cortex from patients with Alzheimer's disease. By in situ hybridization <b>amyloid</b> beta <b>protein</b> <b>precursor</b> mRNA was present in granule and pyramidal cell bodies in the hippocampal formation and in pyramidal cell bodies in the cerebral cortex. No specific labelling of glial cells or endothelial cells was found. The same qualitative distribution was observed in tissues from control patients and from patients with Alzheimer's disease. Senile plaque amyloid thus probably derives from neurones.

25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma {{membrane transport protein}} known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E

40|$|Background. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging {{abnormalities}} demonstrate neuronal injury during chronic AIDS, but data {{on these}} biomarkers during primary {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection is limited. Methods. We compared CSF concentrations of neurofilament light chain, t-tau, p-tau, <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins,</b> and amyloid-beta 42 in 92 subjects with primary HIV infection and 25 controls. We examined relationships with disease progression and neuroinflammation, neuropsychological testing, and proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) -based metabolites. Results. Neurofilament light chain was elevated in primary HIV infection compared with controls (P =. 0004) and correlated with CSF neopterin (r = 0. 38; P =. 0005), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (r = 0. 39; P =. 002), white blood cells (r = 0. 32; P =. 004), protein (r = 0. 59; P <. 0001), and CSF/plasma albumin ratio (r = 0. 60; P <. 0001). Neurofilament light chain correlated with decreased N-acteylaspartate/ creatine and glutamate/creatine in the anterior cingulate (r =- 0. 35, P =. 02; r =- 0. 40, P =. 009, respectively), frontal white matter (r =- 0. 43, P =. 003; r =- 0. 30, P =. 048, respectively), and parietal gray matter (r =- 0. 43, P =. 003; r =- 0. 47, P =. 001, respectively). Beta-amyloid was elevated in the primary infection group (P =. 0005) and correlated with time infected (r = 0. 34; P =. 003). Neither marker correlated with neuropsychological abnormalities. T-tau and soluble <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> did not differ between groups. Conclusions. Elevated neurofilament light chain and its correlation with MRS-based metabolites suggest early neuronal injury in a subset of participants with primary HIV infection through mechanisms involving central nervous system inflammation. © 2013 The Author...|$|R
2500|$|Gamma secretase is an {{internal}} protease that cleaves within the membrane-spanning domain of its substrate proteins, including <b>amyloid</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP) and Notch.

APLP 2 appears to mature through the same unusual secretory/cleavage pathway as APP. Furthermore, widely utilized antibodies generated against non-overlapping epitopes of APP do not discriminate between APP and APLP 2. Although APLP 2 cannot give rise to Aβ, its near identity to APP outside the Aβ domain confounds the interpretation of previous immunocytochemical and biochemical characterizations of APP biosynthesis and metabolism. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
