40|$|There {{are many}} factors that limit the {{performance}} of the servo system in current magnetic disk drives and prevent significant increases in track density. It is common in present hard disk drives that there exist some vibration modes between 2 kHz and 10 kHz, which involve coupled vibrations of slider, suspension, arm and bearing assembly.

40|$|We have {{implemented}} {{the design of}} a dual-stage <b>actuator</b> tape <b>head</b> for enhanced reduction of lateral tape motion (LTM) disturbance. Our design consists of a conventional voice coil mo-tor (VCM) and a micro-actuator for coarse and fine positioning, respectively. The micro-actuator, which is mounted on the VCM, uses a piezo crystal and allows following LTM up to the kHz regime, while the VCM follows low frequency LTM. Using step response measurements and a realization algorithm, we have created a multi-input discrete-time model of the dual-stage actu-ator. Based on the model, we designed and implemented a dual-stage controller, using a dual-input single-output approach based on a PQ method.

Our method uses step response measurements and a generalized realization algorithm to identify a multivariable discrete-time model of the actuator.

We have designed a dual-stage controller, based on the model, using loop shaping techniques adopted for multivariable control problems. We applied the procedure to the prototype of a dual-stage <b>actuator</b> tape <b>head</b> to reduce the effect of lateral tape motion. The prototype consists of a conventional voice coil motor for coarse positioning and a micro-actuator for fine positioning.

40|$|Lateral tape motion (LTM) is {{the motion}} of a tape {{perpendicular}} to the tape transport direction. It {{is a problem in}} magnetic tape recording technology that limits the track density on a tape. To reduce LTM, it is important to characterize the main sources of LTM in tape transports. In this dissertation, the effect of tape edge contact as well as tape tension transients on LTM is investigated. An optical non-contact tension sensor is developed and a correlation between LTM and tension transients is observed. Additionally, a method based on acoustic emission is established to measure tape edge contact. Tape edge contact is observed to cause high frequency LTM, and the magnitude of the impact is shown to be function of the tape pack size. The dynamics of a tape as it moves over a cylindrical guide are studied theoretically and validated experimentally. Good agreement between theory and experiments is observed. In the experimental analysis, the tape/guide friction coefficient is observed to be function of different operating and design parameters. A model for the friction coefficient between a tape and a cylindrical guide is presented and evaluated with experimental data. Finally, the use of laser surface texturing (LST) for improved tape guiding is proposed and investigated both experimentally and numerically. LST guides are observed to create an air bearing at low tape speeds and thus reduce the transition speed between boundary lubrication and full fluid lubrication.

40|$|Nanoelectromechanical systems, or NEMS, are MEMS scaled to {{submicron}} dimensions. In {{this size}} regime, {{it is possible}} to attain extremely high fundamental frequencies while simultaneously preserving very high mechanical responsivity (small force constants). This powerful combination of attributes translates directly into high force sensitivity, operability at ultralow power, and the ability to induce usable nonlinearity with quite modest control forces. In this overview I shall provide an introduction to NEMS and will outline several of their exciting initial applications. However, a stiff entry fee exists at the threshold to this new domain: new engineering is crucial to realizing the full potential of NEMS. Certain mainstays in the methodology of MEMS will, simply, not scale usefully into the regime of NEMS. The most problematic of issues are the size of the devices compared to their embedding circuitry, their extreme surface-to-volume ratios, and their unconventional "characteristic range of operation". These give rise to some of the principal current challenges in developing NEMS. Most prominent among these are the need for: ultrasensitive, very high bandwidth displacement transducers; an unprecedented control of surface quality and adsorbates; novel modes of efficient actuation at the nanoscale, and precise, robust, and routinely reproducible new approaches to surface and bulk nanomachining.

40|$|High density {{digital tape}} systems provide a {{cost-efficient}} and reliable solution for massive data backup. To maintain a competitive position against other data storage technologies, the tape industry aims to enable higher track densities and shorter data access time. The servomechanisms {{of the tape}} transport system and the head positioning system need to be improved for these purposes. This thesis investigates combined feedforward and feedback control in the tape transport dynamics and the <b>head</b> <b>actuator,</b> respectively. As the tape winds from one reel to the other, the reel radii vary due to the winding of the tape and the reel runouts. These variations can cause tension errors. As the tape is very thin, the variations between two consecutive revolutions can be considered negligible. A feedforward-inspired control scheme is developed {{to take into account}} the time-varying radius to reduce tape tension error caused by the variations in radii. In order to better align the write/read head with the desired data track, a combined feedforward/feedback control scheme to improve the tape head positioning servo system in the presence of lateral tape motion is also developed. Approximate dynamic inversion techniques and model matching methods are investigated to design the feedforward controller. The feedforward control is computed based upon an estimate of the lateral tape motion displacements (LTMDs) at the head that is calculated using measurements of the upstream and downstream lateral tape motion displacements near the head. To find the correlation between successive LTMDs, linear and polynomial regression methods are first studied. The nonlinear partial differential equation modeling tape motion in the lateral direction is then explored to solve the displacements for a short segment of tape surrounding the head using measurements of the upstream and downstream displacements as boundary conditions. The equation is discretized in the spatial domain using the finite element method (FEM) and integrated using the Wilson theta approximation. Performance and effectiveness of the controllers are demonstrated in simulations. Feasibility analysis of implementing the feedforward controller on an actual tape drive is also conducted...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} effects of shock and the disk surface pattern on the head disk interface (HDI) response in hard disk drives (HDDs). A new local adaptive mesh method is proposed at the end to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm to simulate the sliders' steady flying attitudes. Over the past decades, {{there has been an}} increase in the demand of HDDs used in portable devices. In such applications, the work performance of a HDD mainly depends on its ability to withstand external disturbances. Studies of the HDD's responses and failures during external shocks can be very beneficial for improving the HDD's design. A multi-body operational shock (op-shock) model is developed for this purpose in this thesis. The Guyan reduction method is used to model all the components considered in the op-shock model (a disk, a spindle motor, a base plate, a pivot and a <b>head</b> <b>actuator</b> assembly (HAA)). A fluid dynamic bearing (FDB), between the rotating and stationary units in the spindle motor, is simplified as a spring-dashpot system to save computation efforts. The same simplification is applied to a ball bearing (BB) system between the rotating and stationary units in the actuator pivot. Then the reduced models for all the components are assembled to obtain a complete multi-body op-shock model. Four models which include different components are introduced in this thesis to investigate various components' effects on the HDD's operating performance. The HDDs' failure mechanisms are also studied. It is found that different components influence the HDI responses in different ways. The ramp load/unload (LUL) technology has been proved to be a better alternative to the contact start-stop (CSS) approach due to the advantages of increasing areal density and greater durability. However, the application of the LUL ramps in the HDDs increases the possibility of collisions between the disk and the ramps since the ramps sit closely to the disk's outer radius. Therefore, it is important to study the ramp effects on the HDD's response during a shock. A reduced model of a deformable ramp is developed and implemented to the multi-body op-shock model. Numerical analyses using three ramp models (no-ramp model, rigid ramp model and deformable ramp model) are carried out to study the HDD's failure dependence on different ramp models. Bit patterned media (BPM) recording is one of the promising techniques for future disk drives in order to increase the areal density above 4 Tbit/in 2. In patterned media, an individual recorded bit is stored in a distinct magnetic island. Thus, the BPM can change the topography of the disk surface and has an effect on the flying characteristics of the air bearing sliders. Proper designs of sliders and disks in the HDDs are required in order to achieve a stable work performance. So a simulator to model a slider's flying condition over a BPM disk is particularly important. Three methods (the averaging method, the Homogenization method and the Taylor expansion Homogenization methods) are implemented to simulate a slider's flying attitude, and finally an economical accurate method is chosen (the Taylor expansion Homogenization method) to investigate the slider's dynamics on partially planarized patterned media. In modern HDDs, the requirement of small and steady head disk spacing leads to more complicated air bearing surface designs. Thus it is challenging for an air bearing simulator to accurately capture the pressure under a slider's surface. A new local adaptive grid-generating algorithm is developed and is used to simulate the sliders' steady flying attitude. Local finer meshes (mesh's dimension decreases to half) are created on the nodes of the current grids, which have pressure gradients or geometry gradients larger than a pre-defined tolerance. Two sliders are used to demonstrate the applicability of this method. It is found that this new local adaptive grid-generating method improves the stability and efficiency of the simulation scheme...|$|R
