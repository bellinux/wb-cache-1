5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center {{found that women who}} identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
5|$|Exercise is <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> can {{facilitate}} or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience {{better quality of}} sleep {{than those who do}} not, but exercising too late in the day can be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.|$|E
5|$|El Hatillo {{preserves}} {{some of its}} colonial architecture, {{including an}} 18th-century parish church and a unique Romanian Orthodox Church. The municipality also has a rich artistic culture, {{with at least two}} important musical festivals celebrated yearly, and numerous holiday celebrations reflecting the heritage of El Hatillo. The culture, the pleasant temperature, the rural landscape, and the gastronomy of the municipality have made it a place of interest for visitors to the city, and a desirable place to live. The municipality receives a part of its income from tourism, <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> is promoted by the government.|$|E

5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> was centred on the township of Kinderton, {{about a quarter of a}} mile north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but it is more likely that the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still {{takes place in}} Casamance, {{which is one of}} three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are {{an important component of the}} family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.|$|E

25|$|A {{resident}} {{who wishes to}} challenge the validity of an ordinance need not wait until it has been enforced against them (although it may be challenged at that time). Instead, a resident may bring an action for a declaratory judgment alleging that the ordinance is void {{because it was not}} properly noticed, goes beyond the county charter, is arbitrary, discriminatory, or unreasonably vague, or that it is preempted by state or federal law. An ordinance will be deemed preempted if it addresses an activity for which the state has prohibited local regulation altogether, or where it is inconsistent with state law. An ordinance may not permit <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> is expressly prohibited by state law, or prohibits <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> is expressly permitted by state law. However, if some state regulation exists as to an activity, political subdivisions may impose further regulations on that activity so long as it is possible for a resident to comply with both sets of regulations.|$|E

25|$|Douglas {{was educated}} at Wixenford School, Winchester College (1884–88) and Magdalen College, Oxford (1889–93), which he left without obtaining a degree. At Oxford, he edited an {{undergraduate}} journal, The Spirit Lamp (1892–3), <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> intensified the constant conflict {{between him and}} his father. Their relationship had always been a strained one and during the Queensberry-Wilde feud, Douglas sided with Wilde, even encouraging Wilde to prosecute the Marquess for libel. In 1893, Douglas had a brief affair with George Ives.|$|E
25|$|Some tree farms {{offer more}} than just a chance to cut down a live Christmas tree. Outdoor and holiday themed {{activities}} are not uncommon and include wagon rides, offering hot cocoa or cider, Santa Claus visits and holiday crafts. Many tree farms actively encourage schools to sponsor field trips to the farms. One grower in Kansas contended that usual worries for businesses, such as a tight economy, do not affect Christmas tree farms. The grower thought that obtaining a tree from a Christmas tree farm was something that almost nothing could stop; <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> transcended the economy and the weather.|$|E

25|$|A nurse {{working at}} the {{hospital}} in the later years of its operation describes the situation much less critically than Frame, noting that while many patients at Seacliff during her time (1940s) {{would not have been}} confined in modern days, the atmosphere was more like that of a large working community. Patients capable of working were asked to help with various duties, partly because of staff shortages in World War II. Unless considered dangerous, patients were allowed some liberties, such as being allowed to go fishing - <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> provided patients with leisure time, while also helping the fishing business Truby King had long ago established at nearby Karitane.|$|E
25|$|These {{sketches}} {{begin by}} announcing <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> shouldn't be done whilst naked and assigning the activity a number. The sketches then depict {{one of the}} cast members performing the activity. The humour {{comes from the fact}} that the activities are things that shouldn't be done at all, naked or otherwise such as eating a surfboard, towel whipping a bear or impersonating the Crazy Frog ring tone. According to the Season 1 DVD commentary, when Heath Franklin appears in one of these sketches he is the only actor to do his naked scenes in the nude, the rest of the cast wore flesh-coloured underwear.|$|E
25|$|Technology can {{be viewed}} as <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> forms or changes culture. Additionally, {{technology}} is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer. Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.|$|E
