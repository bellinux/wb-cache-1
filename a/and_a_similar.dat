5|$|Bombarding curium-242 with α-particles {{resulted}} in an isotope of californium 245Cf (1950), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> procedure yielded in 1949 berkelium-243 from americium-241. The new elements were named after Berkeley, California, by analogy with its lanthanide homologue terbium, which was named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|September 13 {{represented}} {{the first day}} that Air Group 18 encountered significant resistance in the Pacific skies. From Harris's Strike 2 Able through to the fourth and final strike of the day, Strike 2 Dog, 41 Japanese planes were shot down by Admiral Gerald F. Bogan's Task Group 38.2 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> number were destroyed on the ground by bombing and strafing runs.|$|E
5|$|The village pump {{remained}} in use until December 1914, while the handle was removed in 1921 {{by the local}} council for safe keeping but was never returned.

5|$|A {{manuscript}} {{of the first}} quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (Codex Palatinus), known as P, and its direct and indirect copies. P was written at Lorsch in Caroline minuscule. The text in this manuscript has several lacunae marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between Verus and Alexander, and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> transposition in Carus. P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} {{treaty was}} entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration. These included {{a settlement of}} the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a long-running dispute over seal hunting in the Bering Sea that also involved Japan, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland. The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Although the GWR {{agreed to}} {{contribute}} £175,000 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> sum was {{promised by the}} GNR, sufficient funds to make a start on construction had not been raised {{by the end of}} 1857. Costs were reduced by cutting back part of the route at the western end so that it did not connect directly to the GWR station, and by dropping the line south of Farringdon. In 1858, Pearson arranged a deal between the Met and the City of London Corporation whereby the Met bought land it needed around the new Farringdon Road from the City for £179,000 and the City purchased £200,000 worth of shares. The route changes were approved by Parliament in August 1859, meaning that the Met finally had the funding to match its obligations and construction could begin.|$|E
5|$|As {{business}} {{improved in}} 1904 the enterprise moved to larger premises in Pendleton, where an annual rent of £90 was payable. On 1 January 1906, this operation became a limited company, The Churchill Machine Tool Co, with an authorised share capital of £50,000, split as £20,000 in ordinary shares of £1 and £30,000 in £5 preference shares. To accomplish {{the transfer of}} manufacturing operations, Charles Churchill & Co sold the Pendleton business to the new company for £15,000, of which £7,500 was in cash <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> amount in £1 ordinary shares. The directors were Charles Churchill, J W W Gabriel, Walter Chamberlain and C H Churchill. Herbert Chamberlain had died in 1904.|$|E

5|$|By 1903 {{the synagogue}} was well {{established}} on Rivington Street, and, {{due to its}} capacity and prominence, was often the site of significant or mass meetings. In April 1903 a service to honor the memory of Reform rabbi and Zionist leader Gustav Gottheil was held there, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> service was held for Theodore Herzl the following year. At the latter service, which was boycotted by Orthodox rabbis, Herzl was not eulogized, nor was his name mentioned.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} visit to the West he {{travelled}} to the UK twice, in 1895 and 1896, lecturing successfully there. In November 1895 he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble an Irish woman who would become Sister Nivedita. During his second visit to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met Max Müller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna's first biography in the West. From the UK, Vivekananda visited other European countries. In Germany he met Paul Deussen, another Indologist. Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities (one the chair in Eastern Philosophy at Harvard University <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> position at Columbia University); he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the most}} common {{occupation}} in Juniata County was manufacturing. 23.6% of employed people over 16 years old in the county performed manufacturing jobs. 10.5% of employed people older than 16 worked in health services, 9.5% worked in other services, 9.3% each work in construction and retail, 6.2% worked in public administration, and 6.1% worked in transportation. 5.6% had an occupation {{in the field of}} education, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> number worked in finance, insurance, and real estate. 5.5% worked in agriculture, fishing, forestry, or mining, 3.5% worked in wholesale trade, 1.7% worked in communications, utilities, and related fields.|$|E

5|$|In February 2005, Cyan and Mean Hamster Software {{released}} Myst for the Microsoft Windows Mobile platform; Riven was ported shortly after. In August 2008, Cyan {{announced that}} the company was developing a version of Myst for Apple's iOS. The game was made available to download from the iTunes App Store on May 2, 2009. The original download size was 727 MB, which was considered very large by iPhone standards. An updated version of realMyst was released for iPad 2 and above, with improved graphics over the original PC release, on June 14, 2012. A version for Android devices based on the realMyst version was released on January 26, 2017, produced and published by Noodlecake, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> port for Riven was released on April 26, 2017.|$|E
5|$|It {{was then}} {{believed}} that a Saxon town known as Alvertune developed. In Pierre de Langtoft's history of King Alfred he writes that in 865 it {{was the site of}} a number of battles between King Elfrid and his brother Alfred and five Danish kings <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> number of earls. Later, in the 10th century, Danes settled at Romanby and Brompton. A fine example of English stonecarving from the period, the Brompton Hogbacks, can be found in Brompton Parish Church.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{admitted}} to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying his hand at ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues. Mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts.|$|E
5|$|Otway {{launched}} the assault {{as soon as}} the first glider overshot the battery, ordering the explosives to be detonated to form two paths through the outer perimeter through which the paratroopers attacked. The defenders were alerted by the explosions, and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties; only four attackers survived to reach Casemate Four, which they disabled by firing into apertures and throwing grenades into air vents. The other casemates were cleared with fragmentation and white phosphorus grenades, as the crews had neglected to lock the doors leading into the battery. During the bombing raid, the battery's guns had been moved inside the casemates and the steel doors left open for ventilation. During the battle, 22 Germans were killed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> number made prisoners of war. The rest of the garrison escaped undetected by hiding in the underground bunkers.|$|E
5|$|PD {{invariably}} progresses with time. A severity rating method {{known as}} the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) is {{the most commonly used}} metric for clinical study. A modified version {{known as the}} MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the Hoehn and Yahr scale (originally published in 1967), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.|$|E
