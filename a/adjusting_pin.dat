40|$|The NE 5230 is a {{very low}} voltage {{operational}} amplifier that can perform with a voltage supply as low as 1. 8 V or as high as 15 V. In addition, split or single supplies can be used, and the output will swing to ground when applying the latter. There is a bias <b>adjusting</b> <b>pin</b> which controls the supply current required by the device and thereby controls its power consumption. If the part is operated at ± 0. 9 V supply voltages, the current required is only 110 �A when the current control pin is left open. Even with this low power consumption, the device obtains a typical unity gain bandwidth of 250 kHz. When the bias <b>adjusting</b> <b>pin</b> {{is connected to the}} negative supply, the unity gain bandwidth is typically 600 kHz while the supply current is increased to 600 �A. In this mode, the part will supply full power output beyond the audio range. The NE 5230 also has a unique input stage that allows the common−mode input range to go above the positive and below the negative supply voltages by 250 mV. This provides for the largest possible input voltages for low voltage applications. The part is also internally−compensated to reduce external component count. The NE 5230 has a low input bias current of typically ± 40 nA, and a large open−loop gain of 125 dB. These two specifications are beneficial when using the device in transducer applications. The large open−loop gain gives very accurate signal processing because of the large “excess ” loop gain in a closed−loop system. The output stage is a class AB type that can swing to within 100 mV of the supply voltages for the largest dynamic range that is needed in many applications. The NE 5230 is ideal for portable audio equipment and remote transducers because of its low power consumption, unity gain bandwidth, and 30 nV/√Hz noise specification...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPolar {{transport}} of the phytohormone auxin throughout plants shapes morphogenesis and {{is subject to}} stringent and specific control. Here, we identify basic cellular activities connected to translational control of gene expression as sufficient to specify auxin-mediated development. Mutants in subunits of Arabidopsis Elongator, a protein complex modulating translational efficiency via maturation of tRNAs, exhibit defects in auxin-controlled developmental processes, associated with reduced abundance of PIN-formed (PIN) auxin transport proteins. Similar anomalies are observed upon interference with tRNA splicing by downregulation of RNA ligase (AtRNL), pointing to a general role of tRNA maturation in auxin signaling. Elongator Protein 6 (ELP 6) and AtRNL expression patterns underline an involvement in <b>adjusting</b> <b>PIN</b> protein levels, whereas rescue of mutant defects by auxin indicates rate-limiting activities in auxin-controlled organogenesis. This emphasizes mechanisms in which auxin serves as a bottleneck for plant morphogenesis, translating common cellular activities into defined developmental readouts...|$|E

40|$|Recently Duarte and Young (2009) {{study the}} {{probability}} of informed trading (PIN) proposed by Easley et al. (2002) and decompose it into two parts: the <b>adjusted</b> <b>PIN</b> (APIN) {{as a measure of}} asymmetric information and {{the probability of}} symmetric order-flow shock (PSOS) as a measure of illiquidity. They provide some cross-section estimates of these measures using daily data over annual periods. In this paper we propose a method to estimate daily APIN and PSOS by extending the method in Tay et al. (2009) using high-frequency transaction data. Our empirical results show that while PIN is positively contemporaneously correlated with variance, APIN is not. On the other hand, PSOS is positively correlated with daily average e ective spread and variance, which is consistent with the interpretation of PSOS as a measure of illiquidity. Compared to APIN, PSOS exhibits clustering and sporadic bursts over time...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} 7 months of study, tradeoffs, test design, and {{fabrication}} are presented for {{an effort to}} modify three ground stations {{in support of the}} ATS-F program. As a result of tests on the existing feed system of the Rosman No. 2 85 -foot antenna and on the transportable ground station (TGS) 40 -foot antenna, it was determined that modifications of the existing phase-compensating rotary joints at Rosman are feasible. Other components must be completely replaced. In the TGS antenna feed system, it was found to be feasible to broadband the existing monopulse comparator by adding simple irises and posts; both spare and active comparators were modified. The TGS polarizers can be broadbanded by <b>adjusting</b> existing <b>pins</b> and adding two new pins. These modifications are also directly applicable to the Mojave 40 -foot antenna. Detailed electrical and mechanical characteristics are presented for the new equipment, as well as installation plans to enable NASA and its contractors to determine the adequacy of the designs and to confirm that planned locations are both available and compatible with planned operational concepts...|$|R

40|$|A shorted pin {{circular}} axe-shaped antenna is {{analyzed for}} compact and dual band applications. Removing two symmetric arc-shaped areas {{from a simple}} circular patch lengthens the current path thus reduces the antenna size. Embedding and <b>adjusting</b> a shorting <b>pin</b> further shifts the resonance to a lower frequency and excites another high order mode. The frequency ratio varies between 1. 639 ∼ 2. 616.

This {{is a great}} move to watch, and once {{you put it on}} an opponent, there is almost no coming out of it, as your legs are the strongest parts of your body.

But before you set your grip, throw your legs in on the sides that the leg corresponds to with the hand (you have your right hand on the head, put the right leg on the head, vice versa for the other leg and position).

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) can be {{used for}} joining weld lands that vary in {{thickness}} {{along the length of the}} weld. An adjustable pin tool mechanism {{can be used}} to accomplish this in a single-pass, full-penetration weld by providing for precise changes in the pin length relative to the shoulder face during the weld process. The difficulty with this approach is in accurately <b>adjusting</b> the <b>pin</b> length to provide a consistent penetration ligament throughout the weld. The weld technique, control system, and instrumentation must account for mechanical and thermal compliances of the tooling system to conduct tapered welds successfully. In this study, a combination of static and in-situ measurements, as well as active control, is used to locate the pin accurately and maintain the desired penetration ligament. Frictional forces at the pin/shoulder interface were a source of error that affected accurate pin position. A traditional FSW pin tool design that requires a lead angle was used to join butt weld configurations that included both constant thickness and tapered sections. The pitch axis of the tooling was fixed throughout the weld; therefore, the effective lead angle in the tapered sections was restricted to within the tolerances allowed by the pin tool design. The sensitivity of the FSW process to factors such as thickness offset, joint gap, centerline offset, and taper transition offset were also studied. The joint gap and the thickness offset demonstrated the most adverse affects on the weld quality. Two separate tooling configurations were used to conduct tapered thickness welds successfully. The weld configurations included sections in which the thickness decreased along the weld, as well as sections in which the thickness increased along the weld. The data presented here include weld metallography, strength data, and process load data...|$|R
60|$|So the {{cardinal}} cloth was come to its usefulness at last. It {{was inevitable that}} Sukey Kittredge, the village seamstress, {{should be taken into}} confidence. It was no small thing to take Sukey into confidence, for she was the legitimate successor {{in more ways than one}} of Speedy Bates, and much of Cynthia and the artist's ingenuity was spent upon devising a form of oath which would hold Sukey silent. Sukey, however, got no small consolation from the sense of the greatness of the trust confided in her, and of the uproar she could make in Coniston if she chose. The painter, to do him justice, was the real dressmaker, and did everything except cut the cloth and sew it together. He sent to friends of his in the city for certain paste jewels and ornaments, and one day Cynthia stood in the old tannery shed--hastily transformed into a studio--before a variously moved audience. Sukey, having <b>adjusted</b> the last <b>pin,</b> became hysterical over her handiwork, Millicent Skinner stared openmouthed, words having failed her for once, and Jethro thrust his hands in his pockets in a quiet ecstasy of approbation.|$|R
