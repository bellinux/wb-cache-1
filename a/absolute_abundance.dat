An inter-laboratory calibration exercise {{was set up in}} order to test the comparability of results obtained in different laboratories, each using its own preparation method. Each of the 23 laboratories received the same amount of homogenized splits of four Quaternary sediment samples. The samples originate from different localities and consisted of a variety of lithologies. Dinoflagellate cysts were extracted and counted, and relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> were calculated. The relative abundances proved to be fairly reproducible, notwithstanding a need for taxonomic calibration. By contrast, excessive loss of Lycopodium spores during sample preparation resulted in non-reproducibility of <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances.</b> Use of oxidation, KOH, warm acids, acetolysis, mesh sizes larger than 15 µm and long ultrasonication (> 1 min) must be avoided to determine reproducible <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances.</b> The results of this work therefore indicate that the dinoflagellate cyst worker should make a choice between using the proposed standard method which circumvents critical steps, adding Lycopodium tablets {{at the end of the}} preparation and using an alternative method. <br/...|$|R

30|$|However, {{there is}} a {{discrepancy}} between radiolarian abundance and other primary productivity indicators such as total organic carbon (TOC %) and diatom abundance (Tada et al. 2015; Fig.  9). The TOC and diatom data show that primary productivity at this site did not alter in association with glacial and interglacial cycles; instead, the primary productivity seems to have changed during the time interval between 130 to 220 ka (Fig.  9). This discrepancy {{can be explained by}} considering that two factors control ocean primary productivity: sunlight and nutrients. Radiolarians related to the KC bear algal symbionts because they inhabit oligotrophic waters and thus have to obtain energy from photosynthesis. This fact explains why the <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> of algal-symbiont-bearing radiolarians were higher during interglacial periods, and suggests that the <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> of algal-symbiont-bearing species {{can be used as a}} primary productivity index for interglacial periods. However, this index cannot be used to compare primary productivity between interglacial and glacial periods. Indeed, our data show that the KC did not influence our site during glacial periods; thus, the <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> of algal-symbiont-bearing species decreased. In contrast, the percentage abundances of coastal species increased during glacial periods because of the sea-level drop and consequent southeastward migration of the coastlines and river mouths of the main Chinese rivers, which might have led to a marked increase in the nutrient levels in shallow water. This finding indicates that, although we detected a drastic decrease in the abundances of species that bear algal symbionts, high nutrient levels were available in the shallow water during glacial periods, and thus the ocean primary productivity should have been also high during those times. Therefore, to compare and discuss changes in ocean primary productivity during glacial periods, abundances of coastal species (such as Lithomelissa setosa) should be used.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High {{redshift}} DLA systems {{suggest that}} the relative abundances of elements might be roughly solar, although with <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> {{of more than two}} orders of magnitude below solar. The result comes from observations of the [SII/ZnII] ratio, which is a reliable diagnostic of the true abundance, and from DLA absorbers with small dust depletion and negligible HII contamination. In particular, in two DLA systems nitrogen is detected and at remarkably high levels (Vladilo et al. 1995, Molaro et al. 1996, Green et al. 1995, Kulkarni et al. 1996). Here we compare the predictions from chemical evolution models of galaxies of different morphological type with the abundances and abundance ratios derived for such systems. We conclude that solar ratios and relatively high nitrogen abundances can be obtained in the framework of a chemical evolution model assuming short but intense bursts of star formation, which in turn trigger enriched galactic winds, and a primary origin for nitrogen in massive stars. Such a model is the most successful in describing the chemical abundances of dwarf irregular galaxies and in particular of the peculiar galaxy IZw 18. Thus, solar ratios at very low <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances,</b> if confirmed, seem to favour dwarf galaxies rather than spirals as the progenitors of {{at least some of the}} DLA systems...|$|R

The noble gas contents of Mars, Earth, and Venus clearly show that the <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> of isotopes of gases are directly proportional to the amounts of degassed CO 2 into the planetary atmosphere. Several basic geological units {{can be seen on}} the global geological map of Mars. The enormous size of volcanic and tectonic structures of Mars, despite its smaller size, provide invaluable clues to the degassing history of Mars. Therefore, the collection of samples of Martian atmosphere and soil volatiles is imperative to understand the origin and evolution of the atmosphere and its interaction with the Martian surface. Surface properties of Martian rocks, soils, breccias, and regolith and their chemistry are also generic to any discussion on the origin and evolution of the atmosphere of Mars.

50|$|The {{theoretical}} basis of T-RFLP assumes that peaks at different positions along the horizontal axis represent {{different types of}} organisms (or OTUs). The area under each fluorescence intensity peak is a proxy for relative abundance of each phylotype in the community. However, a number of caveats {{must be taken into}} account. Different types of organisms may share a restriction site in the gene of interest; if that is the case, these organisms would not be distinguished as different peaks on the electropherogram. Furthermore, area under a peak represents relative abundance rather than <b>absolute</b> <b>abundance,</b> and there are biases in abundance measurement and PCR amplification. For example, organisms that are scarce in the original total DNA sample will not be amplified enough to be detected in the final analysis. This leads to underestimation of community diversity. Liu et al. cite other possible factors that may distort results, including “differences in gene copy number between species and biases introduced during cell lysis, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification” (p. 4521). For those who seek detailed technical information, Marsh provides a catalog of potential biases that could be introduced in each step of the T-RFLP process.|$|E

40|$|Quick {{studies on}} {{biodiversity}} are frequently used in conservation assessments. Conclusions from these studies would be consistent if assemblages under consideration are stable over time. The stability of butterfly assemblages in the Picos de Europa in northern Spain was examined at several levels of numerical resolution. The survey {{was carried out}} in 1993 and 1995, which allowed at least one complete turnover of all individuals in each locality. Butterfly assemblages were usually stable at the levels of number of species and total number of individuals, species presence and absence, and <b>abundance</b> rankings.

Assemblages were similar in both study years, judging by similar site ordinations by reciprocal averaging. Overall, these results are in accordance with most studies where stability has been examined at several numerical levels; they also suggest that abundances of individual species do not vary enough to disrupt overall assemblage abundance rankings. Butterfly assemblages at sites at higher altitude tended to be more unstable in terms of <b>abundance</b> rankings and <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances.</b> This agrees with ecological theory predicting less stable assemblages in physically ‘harsh’ environments.

Five depth intervals were sampled from the sea surface down to 500 m. Additionally, sediment surface samples from the same locations were analysed. The ratio between <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> of planktic foraminifera in the open ocean, at the ice margin and in the ice-covered ocean {{was found to be}} approximately 2 : 4 : 1.

Both species had maximum <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> between 0 and 100 m water depth, however, they apparently lived shallower under the ice cover than under ice-free conditions.

A total of 1490 fishes were identified at least to the family level. Notothenioids composed 52. 7 % of <b>absolute</b> <b>abundance</b> and non-notothenioids 47. 3 %.

40|$|Fauna surveys to {{determine}} the species richness, relative abundance and community structure of reptile assemblages are often important first steps in their conservation. Several sampling techniques are commonly used. Most involve trapping and assume a simple relationship between the <b>absolute</b> <b>abundance</b> of a species and the index of abundance obtained by sampling. However, comparing the effectiveness of different trapping techniques reveals biases among techniques. Therefore, without knowing <b>absolute</b> <b>abundance,</b> bias in a trapping technique can only be determined relative to other, biased techniques. To investigate this issue, measures of <b>absolute</b> <b>abundance</b> of reptiles were obtained by intensively searching measured quadrats (total removal plots), usually 5 m by 5 m, in two areas, with results compared with those obtained from pitfall trapping {{in one of these}} areas.

Here, we have tested the accuracy and reproducibility of <b>absolute</b> coccolith <b>abundance</b> estimates obtained with the filtration method in combination with a rotary sample divider. The examination of two different filtration devices, a funnel and an in-line system, analysing a known number of microbeads per weight, revealed that counts obtained with funnel systems are up to Ø 18. 6 % too high. Repeated analyses (15 ×) of a fine-fraction sediment sample revealed {{a standard deviation of}} ± 11. 4 % for the in-line system and ± 15. 2 % for the funnel system, respectively. The comparison between three sub-samples (three splits of 1 / 30) showed a standard deviation of 4. 6 % for the in-line system and 9. 9 % for the funnel system, respectively. Therefore, we assume that the potential split error for the rotary splitter is ? 4. 6 %. The comparison of our results with estimates for the same samples analysed with the random settling and the “spiking with microbeads and spraying method” (SMS method) reveal that only the data obtained with the SMS and in-line filter method are statistically equal. The results obtained with the settling method are too low, whilst the results obtained with funnel filtration are too high in terms of coccolith <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances.</b> Our results confirm that the filtration method, including sample splitting with a rotary splitter, is a suitable method for the analysis of <b>absolute</b> coccolith <b>abundances.</b> However, the use of different filtration devices appears to affect the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, the number of splitting steps should be as small as possible to avoid an increase of error due to error propagation. In order to increase the reliability of the filtration method, we suggest calibrating a filtration device with microbeads as a standard measure. The reported reproducibility of the various preparation techniques may help to compare data sets obtained with different methods. <br/...|$|R

A comparatively better match between <b>absolute</b> <b>abundance,</b> size and oxygen isotopic composition of foraminifera as compared to carbon isotopic composition at all the locations indicates that the abundance and size of G. menardii is more affected by seawater temperature and salinity as compared to productivity changes.

40|$|Estimates of {{the bulk}} metal {{abundance}} of the Sun {{derived from the}} latest generation of model atmospheres are {{significantly lower than the}} earlier standard values. In Paper I we demonstrated that a low solar metallicity is inconsistent with helioseismology if the quoted errors in the atmospheres models (of order 0. 05 dex) are correct. In this paper we undertake a critical analysis of the solar metallicity and its uncertainty from a model atmospheres perspective, focusing on CNO. We argue that the non-LTE corrections for abundances derived from atomic features are overestimated in the recent abundance studies, while systematic errors in the <b>absolute</b> <b>abundances</b> are underestimated. If we adopt the internal consistency between different indicators as a measure of goodness of fit, we obtain intermediate abundances [C/H] = 8. 44 +/- 0. 06, [N/H] = 7. 96 +/- 0. 10 and [O/H] = 8. 75 +/- 0. 08. The errors are too large to conclude that there is a solar abundance problem, and permit both the high and low scales. However, the center-to-limb continuum flux variations predicted in the simulations appear to be inconsistent with solar data, which would favor the traditional thermal structure and lead to high CNO abundances of (8. 52, 7. 96, 8. 80) close to the seismic scale.
