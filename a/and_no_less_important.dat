With its location at Veles, Bylazora commanded the entrance to a long defile <b>and,</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>important,</b> a route southwestwards into Pelagonia via the Babuna Valley, or Raec Valley into Styberra and interior of the Macedonian Kingdom. It can be assumed that Bylazora, as the largest Paeonian town, must have been in Dardanian possession when Philip V captured it in 217 BC, with the aim of garrisoning it and ending Dardanian raids. Bylazora is also mentioned by Livy in his [...] "The History of Rome" [...] when Perseus in 168 BC arranged military support from the Gauls who were campaigning in Desudaba, Maedica, requesting the Gaulish army to shift their camp to Bylazora, a place in Paeonia, and their officers to go in a body to him at Almana on the River Axius.The geographic dominance over the surrounding valley has determined the communications significance of the city in ancient times. It was situated between the states (or sometimes provinces) of the Dardani, and of Thrace and Macedonia. Ancient Bylazora was the largest and most significant city of Paionia, mentioned in the records of Polybius and Titus Livius. They emphasize its strategic geographic position as a frontier of the northern border of Macedonia against the Dardanians.|$|E
5000|$|For MRP-based {{manufacturing}} industries, {{the predominant}} cost-saving methodology in category management (CM) involves {{the integration of}} market intelligence with leveraged spending (for a given category of product or service). In industries where asset operation and preservation bear more significance to the procurement process than do product manufacturing - such as in an MRO environment - demonstrable benefit can still be achieved with category management but is best approached with some manner of adjustment to CM‚Äôs usual processes for analysis and strategy development. The first challenge becomes incorporating analytical processes and value drivers that are largely indigenous to the MRP world {{in a manner that}} makes sense to an MRO environment. The second (<b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>important)</b> challenge becomes avoiding a trap where the CM processes are perceived to be more important than their outcome - a scenario that can result in significant analytical delay, and even complete process paralysis. An excellent example of an MRO environment warranting adjustment to classical category management is nuclear power generation in the United States, where the adjusted approach to category management has been coined [...] "MCM" [...] - standing for MRO-based Category Management or Modified Category Management. Not only does electricity generation epitomize an MRO-driven environment, the nuclear energy source adds numerous dimensions of supply and procurement complexity - including federal and state regulatory compliance, nuclear industry standards compliance, nuclear-unique system and component design, and a tightly-audited (and very small) supply base, amongst others. Due to the nature and quantity of discrete characteristics native to nuclear power generation, it can easily be argued that nuclear power generation, in and of itself, should be a distinct category of procurement within a category management project. The fundamental adjustment made between the classical category management approach and the nuclear MCM approach is a shift from procurement strategies focused on leveraged spending to procurement strategies embracing nuclear value drivers, technology innovation, risk management, and strategic sourcing.|$|E

40|$|Throughout history, {{given the}} lack of {{understanding}} of schizophrenia and lack of effective treatment options, patients were often committed to asylums and later psychiatric institutions, often for prolonged periods of time.

Data on hospitalization of patients in University Psychiatric Hospital Vrapƒçe from the mid- 1990 s, as well as data on national level, suggests a trend of drop in hospitalization of schizophrenia patients.
