Newsom was a left-handed pitcher for Santa Clara, but he threw his <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> after two years and hasn't thrown a baseball since. He lived in the Alameda Apartments, which he later compared to living in a hotel. He later reflected on his education fondly, crediting the Jesuit approach of Santa Clara that he said has helped him become an independent thinker who questions orthodoxy. Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome.|$|E

25|$|Shoulder (Glenohumeral joint) (shoulder) – Several weaker {{functions}} {{occur at}} the glenohumeral, or shoulder, joint. The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> to the side) when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding {{the head of the}} humerus in the glenoid cavity.|$|E

25|$|According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder {{from the}} Center for Responsible Nanotechnology {{as well as}} Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute {{molecular}} manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant global catastrophic risk. Several nanotechnology researchers state {{that the bulk of}} risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government. Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> of caution or to launch preemptive strikes; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade, a potential peace-promoting factor; (5) wars of aggression may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.|$|E
500|$|The Silk Pavilion, an {{installation}} designed in 2013, was {{noted for its}} fabrication method as much as its final form. [...] It was woven by 6,500 free-ranging silkworms on a nylon-frame dome. [...] Experiments with the silkworms identified how they would respond to different surfaces, and what would encourage them to spin onto an existing structure rather than spinning a cocoon. [...] The frame of a large polyhedral dome was loosely woven by a robotic <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> of thin nylon threads, and suspended in an open room. [...] The dome was designed with gaps {{where it would be}} warmest. [...] Silkworms were released onto the frame in waves, where they added layers of silk before being removed. [...] This involved engineering, sericulture, and modelling sun in the room. [...] The resulting installation art was hung so that people could stand inside it.|$|E
500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{received}} everyday {{playing time}} in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, {{and in the}} outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I told myself to start using my legs so I didn't blow my <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> or anything like that. But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E

2500|$|The bowler's end umpire {{initially}} {{signals a}} foot-fault No ball by holding one <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> horizontally and calling [...] "No Ball", which may give the batsman some {{warning that the}} ball is an illegal delivery. Depending on {{the reason for the}} call (and hence its timing), the speed of the delivery and the batsman's reactions, the batsman may then be able to play a more aggressive shot at the delivery, safe in the knowledge that he cannot be dismissed. Other reasons for a No ball, e.g. illegal position of fielder, throwing the ball, or height of delivery, are initially judged by the square leg umpire, who indicates his judgement to the bowler's end umpire.|$|E

2500|$|The Wii Zapper is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote.

According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding your <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> like that can get your arm somewhat tired." [...] The Zapper is useful for most games primarily involving gun-style weapons, such as light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters.|$|E
2500|$|Either umpire may call, and signal, No Ball, for a ball {{which is}} {{illegally}} delivered (bowled), although each umpire has unique jurisdictions. The most usual causes for No Balls are foot faults or a ball passing above a batsman's waist, {{each of these}} being under the bowler's end umpire's jurisdiction. The square-leg umpire will rarely have to call a No Ball, as his jurisdiction is limited to infringements which very rarely occur. The signal is to hold one <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> horizontally and shout [...] "no-ball"; the idea being that the batsman {{is aware of the}} no-ball being bowled[...] In matches {{under the auspices of the}} ICC, it may also be a no-ball if the umpire feels that the bowler's arm is bent more than 15 degrees (Throwing rather than bowling). The ICC have chosen to amend Law 21.3 (Definition of Fair Delivery – the arm) as a result of controversy concerning the legality or otherwise of bowling actions of certain prominent bowlers. The no-ball doesn't count as one of the six in the over, and severely reduces the ways in which a batsman may be out (from 11 to 5), with the most common forms of dismissal all being removed, except for Run Out. The batsman may attempt to score runs from the 'extra' ball, however, and any runs scored as a result are recorded in addition to the penalty run for the no-ball itself (ex. a no-ball that reaches the boundary is assessed as five no-ball runs) and are therefore considered extras.|$|E
