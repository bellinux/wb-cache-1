5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and focuses on the player using their units to attack Japanese forces in order to capture the island. The player assumes control of the Marine Corps and must eliminate all Japanese forces by ground, air, or naval combat. The game received mixed reviews upon release. Critics praised the game's value for money and easy difficulty for novice gamers; however, many criticised the graphics <b>and</b> <b>mechanics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} to positive critical reception; critics particularly praised its simplicity, competition, <b>and</b> <b>mechanics,</b> while criticism targeted its repetitive gameplay. Largely due to {{word of mouth}} on social networks, it was a quick success, {{becoming one of the}} most popular web and mobile games in its first year. A Steam version was announced on 3 May 2015, and the mobile version of Agar.io for iOS and Android was released on 24 July 2015 by Miniclip.|$|E
5|$|The game's initial success led to Rare {{developing}} various sequels {{which would}} later {{become part of the}} Battletoads franchise. A spin-off game for the Game Boy, also titled Battletoads, was first released in November 1991.

5|$|The player guides Agent 47, {{protagonist of}} the Hitman franchise, {{through a series}} of grid-based levels. Levels are {{composed}} of nodes and lines, and presented like a board game with characters modelled as miniature figures. Enemy characters can be dispatched by moving onto the node they occupy during a turn, similar to chess. As the player advances through levels, new enemy types <b>and</b> <b>mechanics</b> are introduced to increase the complexity of puzzle solutions.|$|E
5|$|With this decision, {{development}} proceeded swiftly. The team quickly {{decided the}} setting would be islands in an ocean, determining {{it would provide}} interesting visuals <b>and</b> <b>mechanics</b> in the cel-shaded style. This in turn inspired the central sailing feature. Some features drew skepticism; for instance producers Miyamoto and Tezuka requested {{an explanation for the}} characters' exaggeratedly large eyes. The team jokingly suggested having Link shoot beams from his eyes before deciding to have him focus his gaze on significant objects nearby, giving hints to observant players about what to do next.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers <b>and</b> <b>mechanics</b> who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

5|$|Corythosaurus casuarius is {{widespread}} throughout the lower {{unit of the}} Dinosaur Park Formation. In it, Corythosaurus {{was found to be}} closely associated with the ceratopsid Centrosaurus apertus. Their associating was found in the Dinosaur Park, Judith River, and Mesaverde formations, and also in the Wind River Basin and the Wheatland County area. Corythosaurus lived alongside numerous other giant herbivores, such as the hadrosaurids Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, the ceratopsids Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, and ankylosaurids Scolosaurus, Edmontonia and Dyoplosaurus in the earliest stages of the formation, Dyoplosaurus, Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus in the middle age, and Euoplocephalus alone in later stages of the formation. Studies of the jaw anatomy <b>and</b> <b>mechanics</b> of these dinosaurs suggests they probably all occupied slightly different ecological niches in order to avoid direct competition for food in such a crowded eco-space. The only large predators known from the same levels of the formation as Corythosaurus are the tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus libratus and an unnamed species of Daspletosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules <b>and</b> <b>mechanics.</b> The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points {{in the general direction}} of the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.|$|E

5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws <b>and</b> <b>mechanics.</b> At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|Deathrow {{received}} largely favorable reviews. Reviewers {{praised the}} game's fast-paced action, and surround sound, but complained {{of its high}} difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some critics felt the game's use of profanity was excessive, while others {{thought it was a}} highlight. Reviewers considered the game's concept <b>and</b> <b>mechanics</b> similar to other series, specifically Speedball. IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers <b>and</b> <b>mechanics</b> in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939.|$|E
