25|$|With its capture, Phan Rang Air Base {{became a}} Vietnam People's Air Force base. It is unclear {{to what extent}} the former USAF {{facilities}} were used, although aerial imagery shows that a large amount of the station was torn down over the years, the large base simply being too big for the VPAF, in addition the 04L/22R runway was inactivated, and today is almost obliterated. A few of the hangars remain standing, others have been torn down. The large <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramp</b> and concrete aircraft shelters remain, although the shelters appear to have been left unused. Steel and sand revetments also remain on the ramp.|$|E
25|$|To support {{rescue and}} relief {{operations}} in New Orleans, the Air National Guard used Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River's West Bank. Within {{five hours of}} its orders, the 136th Airlift Wing of the Texas Air National Guard deployed 41 Air National Guardsmen to Belle Chasse. Less than 24 hours later, a C-130H landed at the air station {{with members of the}} Louisiana Air National Guard's 159th Fighter Wing. Soon more aircraft arrived, delivering troops and supplies for New Orleans; offloaded pallets were stacked 10 deep on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramp.</b> Instead of heading into the flooded city, the 136th team remained at Belle Chasse and, within 36 hours of arriving, it established a fully functioning Air Terminal Operations Center and was keeping pace with the demanding mission schedule. That Aerial Port team, augmented by U.S. Navy cargo handlers and members of the 133d Aerial Port Squadron, 133d Airlift Wing of the Minnesota Air National Guard, handled over 124 missions with 1.5 million pounds of cargo and 974 passengers in one day. As one of its most crucial tasks, the Texas squadron downloaded the German pump system used to drain the city of New Orleans because its own pumps were inundated. It also uploaded two KC-135s with 140 kennels filled with rescued dogs bound for adoption in Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|On August 18, 2011 {{the airport}} {{opened a new}} 72,000 square foot {{terminal}} {{to add to the}} single story terminal built by United Airlines in 1942. The new facility was built next to the existing terminal and cost approximately $63 million. [...] Additions to the historic terminal made in 1967 and 1976 were removed and the original building was restored. [...] It then was raised to meet modern flood plain regulations and moved and incorporated into the new terminal. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramp</b> was redesigned and a new loop road and short term parking lot were constructed. [...] The new terminal building features many environmentally sustainable elements and is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).|$|E
50|$|In 1922 Weaver was {{assigned}} to command of Mitchel Field, New York. This site had become rundown {{as the result of}} budget cutbacks and force reductions following the war. Weaver supervised an overhaul, and within a year, buildings had been repaired, hangars had floors installed, and <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramps</b> and aprons had been paved.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airfield}} had two 4000' (2000m) {{parallel runways}} aligned approximately NW/SE, with two adjacent taxiways of about 40 hardstands each, and {{large areas of}} Pierced Steel Planking (PSP) for <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramps</b> (total 180-200 <b>aircraft</b> capacity). A blister-type hangar, a temporary steel control tower and a rudimentary tent containment area northwest of the operational airfield was also constructed. Its last known use was by the United States Army Air Force Fifteenth Air Force in 1945 during the Italian campaign ...|$|R
50|$|Steve {{was born}} to parents Bruce and Sharon Butler and has three sisters Linda, Laura, and Melanie. Due to Bruce’s career as an USAF pilot, the family lived in England for four years shortly after Steve’s birth. Bruce loved all things mechanical—especially those that involve speed. He {{repaired}} and modified cars in his free-time and also owned a go-kart that he would drive on remote parts of the British <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramps,</b> often allowing young Steve to ride in his lap.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the seizure}} of the base by the North Vietnamese in 1975, the {{captured}} South Vietnamese military aircraft were either destroyed or flown out to other airfields and Pleiku Air Base was abandoned, apparently remaining so for many years. Today, a small airport terminal building has been erected on the pad {{of one of the}} former USAF hangars. The former base facility has been torn down and a few streets remain, the land now being used for agriculture; none of the former base buildings remain. [...] The large <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramp</b> remains but is largely abandoned, along with the jet taxiway which is unused. The former USAF control tower and large fire department building with garages for the large fire engines on the flightline remains standing; their current use is undetermined.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} was an auxiliary airfield, {{consisting of a}} 10,000 foot runway and a small <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramp.</b> It was abandoned after March 2003.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the day of}} the accident, about 500 paratroopers from {{adjacent}} Fort Bragg were in the pax shed, {{the concrete}} mock-ups or resting in the grassy area. [...] The personnel came from three division units, the First Brigade Combat Team, 504th Infantry Regiment, and 505th Infantry Regiment. [...] While the jumpers prepared to board several Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Lockheed C-141 Starlifter <b>aircraft</b> <b>parked</b> on Green <b>Ramp,</b> the sky was filled with General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, and C-130 aircraft conducting training.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the former}} Air Force {{facilities}} remain. Sections of the World War II airfield remain {{as well as the}} wartime <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> apron. Those facilities were used by Air Defense Command interceptors, with the ADC alert sheds remaining and a section of the Wartime NW/SE runway being converted into a taxiway for the interceptors to use for alert launches. ADC control and maintenance buildings remain intact, albeit unused. The Wurtsmith Air Museum is housed in the old ADC alert facility. The SAC B-52 alert facility and alert pads remain and are unused. The large <b>parking</b> <b>ramp</b> built by SAC for B-52s and KC-135s now is utilized by the Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport as <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> space, and some of the old SAC hangars also appear to be in use.|$|R
50|$|Gary Municipal Airport, Indiana - Redeveloped area at {{the north}} tip of the airport.

2500|$|On 16 January, the Japanese-held Clark Field was {{attacked}} by the squadron. After being captured in 1942, Clark Field became the main Japanese air base in the Philippines. [...] That day, four Air Commando P-51D Mustangs caught a group of enemy <b>aircraft</b> on the <b>parking</b> <b>ramp,</b> with their propellers turning over slowly. Four Nakajima Ki-44s were struck by a 500-pound bomb and were destroyed. Five more enemy fighters were destroyed in strafing runs, and no squadron aircraft were damaged. The same day on Negros Island, other 3d Fighter Squadron Mustangs discovered some camouflaged enemy aircraft on a landing strip. [...] They were also obliterated by strafing fire, but one Mustang was hit by 20-mm antiaircraft fire {{and was forced to}} bail out over the sea. [...] The pilot, Capt. Charles B. Adams, was picked up safely by a Consolidated PBY Catalina the next day and he was returned to the squadron. Shortly afterwards, the squadron moved up from Leyte to Lingayen Airfield on Luzon. The squadron's last mission from Tanaunan hit Baguio, the prewar summer capital of the Philippine Government. [...] It had become the Japanese Commander in the Philippines, General Yamashita's headquarters. Sixteen Mustangs, along with Consolidated B-24 Liberators from the 22d Bombardment Group attacked the Headquarters. [...] The target was obliterated with direct hits on administration buildings, the message center, warehouses, barracks and officer's quarters.|$|R

50|$|The Air Force {{also built}} a runway and other {{facilities}} at Sampson and converted the base to its needs. By 1953, a single paved 5000 foot north/south runway (Rwwy 17/35) was completed and a control tower, fire station and <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramp</b> {{was built on the}} west side, with B-25 Mitchell, C-47 Skytrain, and C-45 Expeditor aircraft assigned.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the airport}} is a modern, fully {{equipped}} facility with two additional parallel grass runways available for use. A large <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramp</b> along with a hangar and support buildings are available. In addition, several hangars appear {{to be used by}} the French Air Force, with a separate parking area for military aircraft and support area.|$|E
50|$|The runway was 5200 feet but was {{lengthened}} to 6500 feet, {{enough for}} Boeing 727s. In 1995 the <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>ramp</b> was completely replaced, allowing larger planes, and 13 hangars were added. Fixed-Base Operator (FBO) services and car rentals are available. There are two FBOs at the airport: Cook Aviation (owned by Cook Group) and BMG Aviation.|$|E
