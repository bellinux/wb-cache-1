40|$|Thermo{{acoustic}} engines convert {{thermal energy}} into acoustic energy with {{few or no}} moving parts, thus they require little maintenance, are highly reliable, and are inexpensive to produce. These traits make them attractive for applications in remote or portable power generation, where a linear alternator converts the acoustic power into electric power. Their primary application, however, is in driving thermoacoustic refrigerators, which use acoustic power to provide cooling at potentially cryogenic temperatures, also without moving parts. This dissertation examines the feasibility of {{a new type of}} thermoacoustic engine, where mean flow and an internal pulse combustion process replace the hot heat exchanger in a traditional closed cycle thermoacoustic engine, thereby eliminating the heat exchangers cost, inefficiency, and thermal expansion stresses. The theory developed in this work reveals that a large temperature difference must exist between the hot face of the regenerator and the hot combustion products flowing into it, and that much of the convective thermal energy input from the combustion process is converted into conductive and thermoacoustic losses in the regenerator. The development of the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine, as described in this study, is designed to recover most of this lost thermal energy by routing the inlet pipes through the regenerator to preheat the combustion reactants. Further, the developed theory shows that the pulse combustion process has the potential to add up to 7 % to the engines acoustic power output for an acoustic pressure ratio of 10 %, with linearly increasing contributions for increasing acoustic pressure ratios. Computational modeling and optimization of the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine yield thermal efficiencies of about 20 % for atmospheric mean operating pressures, though higher mean engine pressures increase this efficiency considerably by increasing the <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>density</b> relative to the thermal losses. However, permissible mean engine pressures are limited by the need to avoid fouling the regenerator with condensation of water vapor out of the cold combustion products. Despite lower acoustic power densities, the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine is shown to be well suited to portable refrigeration and power generation applications, due to its reasonable efficiency and inherent simplicity and compactness.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006 Fouling is {{a serious}} problem in {{membrane}} filtration, caused by pore plugging and adsorption of rejected macromolecules or other solutes in the membrane system. This requires periodic cleaning of membranes, which can add considerably to the overall cost of plant operation owing to lost productivity related to down-time, the cost of the chemicals used in cleaning, higher pressures and associated pumping costs to maintain membrane productivity, as well as reduced lifetime of the membranes. Ultrasound has recently been suggested as a promising approach to combating fouling in membranes. In principle it can be used on-line and may even eliminate the use of chemical cleaning or alternative measures completely, which could lead to major advances in {{the development and implementation of}} membrane technology. The objective of this investigation was therefore to assess the feasibility of using ultrasound to mitigate fouling in capillary ultrafiltration systems applied to water containing natural organic matter. Experimental work was conducted with a small laboratory-scale capillary membrane module. Ultrasound was introduced into the system by means of an ultrasonic probe operating at a fixed frequency of approximately 30 kHz, generating a maximum <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>density</b> of 130 W/cm 2 with a nominal power output of 50 W (IKA Labortechnik Staufen, United Kingdom, U 50). Five systems were investigated, viz. aqueous solution of Congo Red dye, ultrapure water, coloured ground water from the George region, water from the Steenbras dam, as well as an aqueous solution of dextran. In most cases, ultrasonication resulted in an increase in the permeate flux. This increase could partly be attributed to an increase in the temperature and thus a decrease in the viscosity of the fluid and partly to enhanced mass and energy transfer due to sonication. Based on experiments done with the Congo Red dye and ultrapure water, no damage as a result of ultrasonication could be discerned in the membrane filter, except when there was direct contact between the ultrasonic probe and the membrane materials. Permeate quality analyses confirmed that sonication does not damage the membrane material – no degradation of permeate quality was found specifically during sonication intervals. In conclusion, ultrasound indeed appeared to be an effective approach to remove foulants associated with natural organic matter from membranes. However, an issue not addressed by this study, but apparent from the literature, is that the effect of ultrasound is strictly local and this has major implications for the scaleup of such ultrasound systems...|$|E
40|$|Although strict {{practices}} for controlling {{the safety of}} leafy green produce have been implemented in the produce industry, current commercial operations rely on a wash treatment with an antimicrobial agent as the only step for reducing microbial populations on fresh produce. However, washing with a sanitizer has been demonstrated to achieve no more than 1 - 2 log reduction in pathogen populations. In recent years, much research effort has been put into the development of multiple-hurdle techniques to enhance produce safety. Ultrasonic waves ranging from 20 to 100 kHz in frequency have been successfully used as a surface cleaning technique in the medical and precision processing industries {{for a number of}} years. The use of ultrasound in fresh produce sanitation as a hurdle technique is a relatively recent endeavor, however. The reported studies have been sporadic and inconsistent, and have only dealt with batch operations. There are few reports documenting the effects of ultrasound and washing tank operational parameters on the efficacy of combined treatments of ultrasound and sanitizer, or on the removal of bacteria from fresh or fresh-cut vegetable surfaces. In this study, a systematic approach, starting from understanding the interactions among acoustic energy, produce, sanitizers, and bacteria, as well as the distribution of the ultrasonic field in the treatment channel, was employed to find the answer to the important question: "Can an ultrasound-assisted treatment indeed enhance microbial reduction in a continuous-flow pilot-scale produce washing system?" The first question that has to be answered for any ultrasound-assisted produce wash is if ultrasound as a form of physical energy will cause produce quality degradation. To address this issue, a determination was made of the threshold of <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>density</b> (APD) in an ultrasound treatment allowable without causing unacceptable produce damage immediately after sonication. All subsequent produce wash tests were performed with an APD below this threshold. Next, the effect of ultrasound on the reduction of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 inoculated on the surfaces of selected produce was measured. The interactions between ultrasound and sanitizers were examined by monitoring the concentration changes of the sanitizers in washing solutions used for fresh-cut lettuce washes. The effects of ultrasound parameters and operational conditions on the uniformity of the acoustic field in the ultrasonic channel, and on surface decontamination of leafy green produce, were also examined. A continuous-flow pilot scale ultrasonic washing system was designed, fabricated, and tested in this study. Further, produce surface characteristics and infiltration pathways were studied. Finally, the application of ultrasonication for surface decontamination of lettuce coring knives was also investigated. The overall quality scores of baby spinach, lollo rosso, loose leaf lettuce, iceberg lettuce, and romaine lettuce remained unchanged during a 2 -week storage period when sonicated at an APD of less than 100 W/L for less than 2 min., and were above the acceptable level as determined by a sensory panel. The electro-conductivity rate of all four of these salad leaves increased over the treatment time. The ultrasound treatment significantly enhanced the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 cells from the spinach surfaces in all of the sanitation treatments, and the enhancement of the ultrasound increased with the treatment time and APD. Ultrasonication accelerated the degradation of free chlorine and total chlorine during a 4 -min treatment, compared to a wash without ultrasound, while concentrations of acidified sodium chlorite and peroxyacetic acid remained unchanged. An ultrasound treatment at 75 kHz was significantly less effective in the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from spinach leaves than treatments at 25 and 40 kHz (p < 0. 05). The removal of microbes from baby spinach leaves by ultrasonication decreased when the ultrasonic channel width increased from 304. 8 to 609. 6 mm. The blockage of ultrasound due to the overlapping of spinach leaves dramatically decreased the decontamination efficacy, and hence care should be taken to avoid the overlapping of produce leaves. A 20 -min degassing prior to ultrasonication only resulted in a marginal increase (0. 16 log cycle) in the E. coli count reduction. In the tests with the pilot-scale ultrasonic produce washer, ultrasound in combination with chlorine enhanced the reduction of E. coli inoculated on spinach by a 0. 53 log cycle for batch-leaf washes. Additionally, batch-leaf washes with chlorinated water enhanced the reduction of aerobic plate count by a 0. 50 log cycle over a chlorine-only wash. No significant effect of ultrasound was observed for yeast and mold reduction. Ultrasonication enhanced the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from baby carrots by 1. 24 log cycles and 0. 65 log cycle when treated for 1 min and 3 min, respectively. A batch wash with ultrasound also significantly (p < 0. 05) increased the aerobic plate count reduction for roma tomato surfaces by a 0. 75 log cycle over a sanitizer-only wash, while there was only a marginal enhancement in yeast and mold reduction. A number of new techniques were developed or applied to elucidate the relationships between produce surface characteristics and microbial attachment and removal. In the inactivation tests, the underside of spinach leaves (rough side) was found to provide a better shelter for E. coli O 157 :H 7 than the upside. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical profiler mapping were used to provide some insight into this observation. The SEM images and surface profiles of a spinach leaf showed valleys, deeper in the underside than in the upside, harboring and even protecting the cells attached in them. In the effort to quantify the surface roughness of produce, a freeze-drying sample preparation method for confocal laser scanning microscopy was developed which worked well. There {{were no significant differences in}} surface roughness among selected vegetables. Moreover, the surface hydrophobicity of the inner surface of spinach leaves was not significantly different from that of the outer surface, and was not affected by ultrasonication. For the first time, the MicroXCT technique was employed in this study to examine the internal structure of a produce sample on the micrometer scale. The MicroXCT images provided a detailed view of the potential infiltration pathways inside a produce tissue that may be used by human pathogens to penetrate fresh and fresh-cut produce. In the test to examine the interactions of ultrasound with a hard metal surface, the ultrasound treatment reduced the E. coli O 157 :H 7 count to below the detection limit on coring knives on both the blade and welding joint when treated for 30 s in 1 mg/L chlorinated water. The two newly designed prototype knives harbored significantly fewer E. coli cells than the current commercially used ones, enabling high disinfection efficacy. In summary, prerequisites for the application of acoustic energy for produce surface decontamination are a good understanding of the underlying physics of acoustics, as well as of the interactions among ultrasound, sanitizers, produce, and bacteria. The operational parameters of both the ultrasound generator and produce washer are also critical in improving the washing efficacy. With a carefully designed ultrasound system and a uniform acoustic field distribution in the washer and on each side of a produce sample, a significantly enhanced reduction in microbial count over that of a sanitizer-only wash can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|Various {{industrial}} {{processes such as}} sonochemical processing and ultrasonic cleaning strongly rely on the phenomenon of acoustic cavitation. As the occurrence of acoustic cavitation is incorporating a multitude of interdependent effects, the amount of cavitation activity in a vessel is strongly depending on the ultrasonic process conditions. It is therefore crucial to quantify cavitation activity {{as a function of}} the process parameters. At 1 MHz, the active cavitation bubbles are so small that it is becoming difficult to observe them in a direct way. Hence, another metrology based on secondary effects of acoustic cavitation is more suitable to study cavitation activity. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of acoustic cavitation phenomena at 1 MHz ultrasound by means of time-resolved measurements of sonoluminescence, cavitation noise, and synchronized high-speed stroboscopic Schlieren imaging. It is shown that a correlation exists between sonoluminescence, and the ultraharmonic and broadband signals extracted from the cavitation noise spectra. The signals can be utilized to characterize different regimes of cavitation activity at different <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>densities.</b> When cavitation activity sets on, the aforementioned signals correlate to fluctuations in the Schlieren contrast as well as the number of nucleated bubbles extracted from the Schlieren Images. This additionally proves that signals extracted from cavitation noise spectra truly represent a measure for cavitation activity. The cyclic behavior of cavitation activity is investigated and related to the evolution of the bubble populations in the ultrasonic tank. It is shown that cavitation activity is strongly linked to the occurrence of fast-moving bubbles. The origin of this ‘‘bubble streamers’’ is investigated and their role in the initialization and propagation of cavitation activity throughout the sonicated liquid is discussed. Finally, it is shown that bubble activity can be stabilized and enhanced by the use of pulsed ultrasound by conserving and recycling active bubbles between subsequent pulsing cycles. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} finding that dissolved carbon dioxide is a potent inhibitor of sonoluminescence and describes {{the implications of the}} finding in the development of improved megasonic cleaning formulations. Megasonic cleaning, or the removal of contaminants particles from wafer surfaces using sound-irradiated cleaning fluids, has been traditionally used in the semiconductor industry for cleaning of wafers. Recently however, advancing technology and miniaturization has made wafer features increasingly susceptible to damage by megasonic energy. International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) 2011 predicts the critical particle diameter, critical particle count and killer defect numbers to be 22 nm, 113 #/wafer and 4. 3 #/mm², respectively, on a 300 mm wafer for 45 nm technology node. A critical challenge in the field, therefore, is to achieve removal of small particles (22 nm to 200 nm) without causing damage to fine wafer features. The work described here addresses this challenge by identifying sonoluminescence and solution pH as two key factors affecting damage and cleaning efficiency, respectively and establishing novel means to control them using CO₂(aq) release compounds in the presence of acids and bases. Sonoluminescence (SL) behavior of the major dissolved gases such as Ar, Air, N₂, O₂ and CO₂ was determined using a newly designed Cavitation Threshold Cell (CT Cell). SL, which is the phenomenon of release of light in sound-irradiated liquids, is a sensitive indicator of cavitation, primarily transient cavitation. It was found that all the tested dissolved gases such as Ar, Air, N₂ and O₂, generated SL signal efficiently. However, dissolved CO₂ was found to be completely incapable of generating SL signal. Based on this interesting result, gradual suppression of SL signal was demonstrated using CO₂(aq). It was further demonstrated that CO₂(aq) is not only incapable but is also a potent inhibitor of SL. The inhibitory role of CO₂(aq) was established using a novel method of controlled in-situ release of CO₂ from NH₄HCO₃. ~ 130 ppm CO₂(aq) was shown to be necessary and sufficient for complete suppression of SL generation in air saturated DI water. The method however required acidification of solution for significant release of CO₂, making it unsuitable for the design of cleaning solutions at high pH. Analysis of the underlying ionic equilibria revealed that the loss of released CO₂(aq) upon increase in pH can be compensated by moderate increase in added NH₄HCO₃. Using this method, simultaneous control of SL and solution pH was demonstrated in two systems, NH₄HCO₃/HCl and NH₄OH/CO₂, at two nominal pH values; 5. 7 and 7. 0. Damage studies were performed on wafer samples with line/space patterns donated by IMEC and FSI International bearing Si/metal/a-Si gate stacks of thickness ~ 36 nm and Si/Poly-Si gate stacks of thickness ~ 67 nm, respectively. A single wafer spin cleaning tool MegPie® was used for the generation of megasonic energy for inducing damage to the structures. It was demonstrated that CO₂ dissolution in DI water suppresses damage to the gate stacks in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these studies establish a systematic and strong correlation between CO₂(aq) concentration, SL suppression and damage suppression. Significant damage reduction (~ 50 % to ~ 90 %) was observed at [CO₂(aq) ] > ~ 300 ppm. It was also demonstrated that CO₂(aq) suppresses damage under alkaline pH condition too. This demonstration was made possible by the successful design of two new cleaning systems NH₄HCO₃/NH₄OH and CO₂/NH 4 OH that could generate CO₂(aq) under alkaline conditions. Damage suppressing ability of the newly designed cleaning systems were compared to the standard cleaning system NH₄OH at pH 8. 2 and it was found that NH₄HCO₃/NH₄OH and CO₂/NH₄OH systems were 80 % more efficient in suppressing damage compared to the standard NH₄OH cleaning system. Finally, megasonic cleaning studies were conducted in the same single wafer spin cleaning tool MegPie®, using SiO₂ particles (size 185 nm) deposited on 200 mm oxide Si wafers, as the contaminant. It was found that the standard cleaning chemical, NH₄OH, pH 8. 2, was effective in achieving > 95 % particle removal for 2 min irradiation of megasonic energy at <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> > 0. 7 W/cm². Based on these results, a new system, NH₄HCO₃/NH₄OH, was designed with an aim to release ~ 300 ppm CO₂ at pH 8. 2.

40|$|Most spatial audio {{reproduction}} {{systems have}} the constraint that all loudspeakers must be equidistant from the listener, a property which {{is difficult to}} achieve in real rooms. In traditional Ambisonics this arises because the spherical harmonic functions, which are used to encode the spatial sound-field, are orthonormal over a sphere and because loudspeaker proximity is not fully addressed. Recently, significant progress to lift this restriction has been made through the theory of sound field synthesis, which formalizes various spatial audio systems in a math-ematical framework based on the single layer potential. This approach has shown many benefits but the theory, which treats audio rendering as a sound-soft scattering problem, can appear one step removed from the physical reality and also possesses frequencies where the solution is non-unique. In the time-domain Boundary Element Method approaches to address such non-uniqueness amount to statements which test the flow of acoustic energy rather than considering pressure alone. This paper applies that notion to spatial audio rendering by re-examining the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral equation as a wave-matching metric, and suggests a physical interpretation of its kernel in terms of common <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> flux <b>density</b> between waves.

40|$|A new {{configuration}} (“a looped-tube with a bypass pipe”) {{was recently}} proposed for low temperature travelling wave thermoacoustic engines and a prototype using atmospheric air as the working gas achieved an onset temperature difference {{as low as}} 65 °C. However, no further research has been reported about this new configuration to reveal its advantages and disadvantages. This paper aims to analyse this type of engine through a comprehensive numerical research. An engine of this type having dimensions similar to the reported prototype was firstly modelled. The calculated results were then qualitatively compared with the reported experimental data, showing a good agreement. The working principle of the engine was demonstrated and analysed. The research results show that an engine with such a bypass configuration essentially operates on the same thermodynamic principle as other travelling wave thermoacoustic engines, differing only {{in the design of}} the acoustic resonator. Both extremely short regenerators and a near-travelling wave resonator minimise the engine’s acoustic losses, and thus significantly reduce its onset temperature difference. However, such short regenerators likely cause severe heat conduction losses, especially if the engine is applied to heat sources with higher temperatures. Furthermore, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> flowing back to the engine core is relatively low, while a large stream of <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> has to propagate within its resonator to maintain an acoustic resonance, potentially leading to low <b>power</b> <b>density.</b> The model was then applied to design an engine with a much longer regenerator and higher mean pressure to increase its <b>power</b> <b>density.</b> A thermoacoustic cooler was also added to the engine to utilise its <b>acoustic</b> <b>power,</b> allowing the evaluation of thermal efficiency.

The efficacies of these HIFU procedures depend on various operational parameters such as total <b>acoustic</b> <b>power,</b> pulse duration and transducer dimensions. In this study, the effect of total <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> on the tissue temperature rise is studied both experimentally and numerically. Experimentally, HIFU ablations, at different <b>acoustic</b> <b>powers,</b> were carried out in a tissue mimicking material embedded with thermocouples. Temperature rise measured from the in-vitro experiments were then validated with the numerical computations. Results show that experimental and numerical temperature rise match accurately. Our numerical model was able to predict the peak temperature rise within ~ 12 % of the experimental results. Results also show that the tissue temperature rise is linearly proportional to the input <b>acoustic</b> <b>power.</b> For the <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> levels considered in this study, {{the results suggest that}} acoustic non-linearity does not play a major role on the tumor ablation procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{structural}} damping and wavenuwmber ratio on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> radiated by point-excited damped infinite beams and simply supported finite beams with same cross sections have been studied. The numerical calculations of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> {{were carried out}} using Keltie's equations based on the Heckl's <b>power</b> integral.

Non-dimensional <b>acoustic</b> <b>power,</b> sound radiation efficiency, and <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> conversion efficiencies are presented as functions of wavenumber ratio and beam loss factors. It is shown that the power conversion efficiency of the infinite beam is inversely proportional to the wavenumber ratio and independent of the loss factor below coincidence, and is approximately proportional in inverse to the loss factor above coincidence. The power conversion efficiency of the finite beam has dull peaks with values roughly inverse-proportional to the loss factor at nonresonant frequencies. The similarity of <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> radiation between infinite beams and finite beams has been observed when the length and loss factor of beams is increased...|$|R
40|$|For laser {{ablation}} solid sampling, {{the quantity of}} material ablated (removed) influences the sensitivity of chemical analysis. The mass removal rate depends strongly on the laser <b>power</b> <b>density,</b> which is the main controllable parameter for a given material and wavelength parameter using laser solid sampling for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). For {{a wide variety of}} materials, a decrease in the rate of change, or roll-off, in mass removed is observed with increasing incident laser <b>power</b> <b>density.</b> The roll-off results from a change in the efficiency of material removed by the laser beam, primarily due to shielding of the target from the incident laser energy by a laser-vapor plume interaction. Several analytical technologies were employed to study the quantity of mass removed versus laser <b>power</b> <b>density.</b> Data for mass ablation behavior versus laser <b>power</b> <b>density</b> are reported using ICP-AES, atomic emission from a laser-induced plasma near the sample surface, <b>acoustic</b> stress <b>power</b> in the target, and measurements of crater volumes. This research demonstrates that the change in ICP-AES intensity with laser <b>power</b> <b>density</b> is due to changes in the mass removal. The roll-off in mass ablation is not due to a change in particle size distribution of the ablated species, fractionation of the sample, or a change in transport efficiency to the ICP torch. Accurate tracking of the ICP-AES with the {{laser ablation}} process justifies the use of internal and external standardization. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} report presents {{a method to}} achieve multi target tracking using <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> measurements obtained from an acoustic sensor net- work. We rst present a novel concept called emitted <b>power</b> <b>density</b> (EPD) which is an aggregate information state that holds emitted power distribution of all targets in the scene over the target state space. It is possible tond prediction and measurement update formulas for an EPD which is con- ceptually similar to a probability hypothesis density (PHD). We propose a Gaussian process based representation for making the related EPD updates using Kalman lter formulas. These updates constitute a recursive EPD-lter {{which is based on}} the discretization of the position component of the target state space. The results are illustrated on a real data scenario where experiments are done with two targets constrained to a road segment...|$|R

Duty cycle and <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> (total power delivered to sample) {{were found to be}} the key elements influencing the release of enzyme during this process. Maximum enzyme activity 82 IU mL– 1 was obtained when cells of Erwinia were sonicated at 50 % duty cycle and 50 W <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> for 4 minutes.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{different}} characterization methods in order to evaluate the sonochemical efficiency of a cavitational reactor. The selected characterization methods were calorimetry and dosimetry based on potassium iodide oxidation or nitrite and nitrate ion formation. The effects of experimental parameters on physical and chemical effects of ultrasound were quantified with two transducers at a frequency of 366 kHz. The studied factors comprised temperature (16 - 28 °C), <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> (6 - 38 W), <b>power</b> <b>density</b> (4 - 61 WL- 1) and reactor configuration (Dreactor 1 = 65 mm, Dreactor 2 = 102 mm). Spectrophotometry was compared to ionic chromatography as a method to quantify nitrite and nitrate ions. Spectrometry was shown to be as representative as ionic chromatography. The reaction system based on the formation of both nitrite and nitrate ions was demonstrated to be as reliable as a potassium iodide dosimeter. The representativity of calorimetry was limited since part of acoustic energy was assumed to be used in the chemical reactions observed by dosimetry. Similar sonochemical efficiencies resulted from an increase of sonified surface (Dreactor 1 = 65 mm vs. Dreactor 2 = 102 mm) coupled to a 2 -time decrease in <b>power</b> <b>density</b> at a constant emitting surface. The effect of emitting-to-sonified surface area ratio on the acoustic field was apparently limited by the height of the liquid...|$|R
