5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical backdrop to tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status.</b> While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status</b> in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E

50|$|The {{interpersonal}} metafunction relates to a text's aspects of tenor or interactivity. Like field, tenor comprises three component areas: the speaker/writer persona, <b>social</b> distance, <b>and</b> relative <b>social</b> <b>status.</b> <b>Social</b> distance <b>and</b> relative <b>social</b> <b>status</b> are applicable only to spoken texts, although a {{case has been}} made that these two factors can also apply to written text.|$|R

5|$|Jewish {{feminism}} {{is a movement}} that seeks to improve the religious, legal, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status</b> of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.|$|E
5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status.</b> They argue that economic success {{can not be measured}} only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status.</b> Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as spur-marking.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the number of}} low <b>social</b> <b>status</b> users is high and the second meeting {{participant}} is very likely a low <b>social</b> <b>status</b> user. Thus, our expectation {{is that we will}} observe many meetings with one high <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> one low <b>social</b> <b>status</b> user. This increases the communication intensity between low <b>and</b> high <b>social</b> <b>status</b> users <b>and</b> this leads to increased opinion fluctuations for high <b>social</b> <b>status</b> users. This in turn can slow down the consensus building process.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{focus on}} a {{hypothesized}} mechanism that may underlie the well-documented link between <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> health–behavioral health risks. Methods. We use longitudinal data from representative samples of 6, 106 middle-aged and 3, 636 older adults from the Health and Retirement Study to examine the relationships between social status—including early life <b>social</b> <b>status</b> (e. g., parental schooling), ascribed <b>social</b> <b>status</b> (e. g., sex, race–ethnicity), <b>and</b> achieved <b>social</b> <b>status</b> (e. g., schooling, economic resources) —and behavioral health risks (e. g., weight, smoking, drinking, physical activity) to (1) assess how early life <b>and</b> ascribed <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> are linked to behavioral health risks, (2) investigate the role of achieved factors in behavioral health risks, (3) test whether achieved status explains the contributions of early life and ascribed status, and (4) examine whether the <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> health risk relationships differ at midlife and older age. Results. We find that early life, achieved, <b>and</b> ascribed <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> strongly predict behavioral health risks, although the effects are stronger in midlife {{than they are in}} older age. Discussion. Ascribed <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> (<b>and</b> interactions of sex and race–ethnicity), which are important pre-dictors of behavioral health risks even net of early life <b>and</b> achieved <b>social</b> <b>status,</b> should be explored in future research.

5|$|While Rastignac desires wealth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status,</b> Goriot longs {{only for}} the love of his daughters: a longing that borders on idolatry. Because he {{represents}} bourgeois wealth acquired through trade– and not aristocratic primitive accumulation– his daughters are happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of the}} book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.|$|E
5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status</b> and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even more acute in developing countries where women are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E
5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status</b> during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, as {{men and women}} in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use of knots was in Norigae, {{traditional}} Korean ornaments worn by women to decorate clothing. Norigae {{were used by}} all ages <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> to emphasize the beauty of Korean traditional costume, as well as decorate pockets carried separately. Though these knots were used across all <b>social</b> <b>statuses,</b> there were also cases when only specific people were allowed to use them. For example, only high government officials were allowed to use knots for decorating fans.|$|R

5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status</b> and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century Bani Zeid was officially ruled by Sheikh Salih al-Barghouti, {{although}} he struggled to maintain full authority over the sheikdom, having to contend with his Abwein-based rival Sheikh Musa and his family, al-Sahwil. The latter controlled seven villages in the eastern part of the sheikdom, while the Barghouti maintained control over twelve villages in the western part. The two domains were separated by a wadi (seasonal stream). Nonetheless, Sheikh Salih enjoyed high political <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status,</b> holding the official title of sheikh al-nahiya (chief of the subdistrict) and was also referred to locally as sheikh al-mashayikh (chief of the chieftains). The title ceased to be recognized by the Istanbul-based central government in 1864, but locally the title continued to demonstrate the guise of official authority. As sheikh al-nahiya, Sheikh Salih was tasked with the nomination and dismissal of makhatir (village headmen) and maintaining order through local custom. He also served as the multazim (tax collector) of the Bani Zeid sheikdom on behalf of the Ottoman authorities, despite the ban on tax-farming in 1853. This role in particular enabled the Barghouti clan to acquire vast wealth and property either forcefully or through legal transfer. During previous inter-family disputes, members of the clan had begun to settle in the surrounding villages of Beit Rima, Kobar and Deir Nidham.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>status,</b> prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

30|$|The {{contributions}} {{of our work}} are twofold. First, we extend the Naming Game model with an interaction mechanism {{that is based on}} user similarities <b>and</b> their <b>social</b> <b>status.</b> With this extension, we conduct experiments on empirical collaboration networks and contribute in this way to the limited line of research on opinion dynamics in empirical networks. Second, our experimental results reveal interesting and non-trivial findings, namely, that user similarity <b>and</b> user <b>social</b> <b>status</b> are opposing forces with respect to consensus building. Whereas user <b>social</b> <b>status</b> may speed up the emergence of consensus, user similarities typically hinder that process. Thus, for an efficient consensus building the negative effect of similarity needs to be carefully compensated by the positive effect of <b>social</b> <b>status.</b>|$|R
