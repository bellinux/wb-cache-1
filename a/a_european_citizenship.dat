Drawing a distinction between membership and identity, we contend that a definition of the citizenship in terms of membership overlooks the specific dynamics of identity formation in the contemporary world, in particular the dimension of individuation and reflexivity underlying identification processes, seen primarily as communicational acts. Rather than a logic of memberships, a truly political citizenship requires a logic of identities within a common communication space. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|While {{the notion}} of <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>{{citizenship}}</b> {{in the sense of}} a formal mode of citizenship that is specific to the EU has a certain reality today, a significant development has been the Europeanization of national regimes. This has occurred under the impact of the broader context of the rise of cosmopolitan forms of citizenship. A historical contextualization of the transformation of citizenship in Europe points to two major traditions, the republican and the cosmopolitan. An analysis of the current situation suggests that both of these have become mutually implicated in each other, but the resulting situation has led to a deficit in the values of solidarity and social justice leading to a major crisis at the heart of the European project...|$|E

40|$|Often {{associated}} with the expression "citizenship of residence", the establishment of European citizenship brought new rights {{to the citizens of}} the European Union, particularly the right to vote in a foreign country. This chapter will focus on the role of social actors in shaping the evolving concept of "European citizenship" by focusing on the specific campaigns dedicated to the cause of voting rights for third country nationals. First it provides a brief overview of the history of voting rights in the European Union, which culminated in the inclusion of European citizenship in the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992. On which models did this concept of citizenship draw? And why was this model adopted over all other competing models?

Although the Bologna Process highlights that development (relating it to mobility, employability and lifelong learning), language education {{does not seem to be}} a priority in the agenda of higher education institutions (Tudor 2006). In the context of curricular restructuring required by the Bologna Process, this article presents a case study of the University of Aveiro (UA), Portugal, which set out to describe institutional practices and discourses concerning the use and function of languages in undergraduate and postgraduate education in two academic years (2002 – 2003 and 2007 – 2008, before and after the restructuring). In order to identify practices, we analysed the programmes of all language courses. This allowed us to identify the languages and language courses offered, as well as the degree programmes into which they are integrated. In order to access institutional discourses, we interviewed seven actors responsible for training and management at the UA (Rectors, Vice-Rectors, the Head of the Department of Languages and Cultures, The Erasmus Programme Coordinator, and the President of the Students’ Union). The results show that the Bologna Process has had a limiting effect on language education: fewer language courses are offered and fewer degree programmes include them. This converges with the institutional actors’ discourses, since they do not recognize the institution’s responsibility to develop students’ plurilingual competences and tend to value only the instrumental role of English...|$|E

40|$|Fostering {{dialogue}} between researchers, policymakers and citizens The European Union is undergoing radical {{changes in its}} social, economic, political, technological, demographic, cultural and institutional structure. These changes range from {{the establishment of a}} common currency to the introduction of <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>citizenship,</b> from new family structures to new ways of working, all this while Europe is enlarging and acting in a global context. Research can play a constructive role in understanding those changes, identifying opportunities and risks, assessing the feasibility, acceptability and impacts of different policy options. Such constructive role however can only be played if research enters in sustained dialogue with those who are at the same time potential users of research, actors of change, and holders of important forms of practical knowledge. In other words, research should not only aim at ‘communicating its results ’ to the people ‘outside ’ the research system, but should also ‘listen to and learn from ’ the experience and concerns of the various social actors or- as it is often said- the various ‘stakeholders’. The ‘dialogue workshops ’ series organised within the Key Action ‘Improving the socio-economic knowledge base ’ intends therefore to improve multidirectional communication –as opposed to unidirectional diffusion of information- in relation to a number of different but related issues and functions. Namely in view of supporting policy formulation and implementation, formulating research, providing evidence and arguments for informed public debate.

40|$|Citizenship Education is {{currently}} a consolidated issue within several European curricula. It has been integrated in national educational laws in different ways: as cross-curricular education (UK, Italy), as a subject (France, Spain) or as a skill (Ireland). Despite these differences, {{there is a common}} agreement on the ethical value of Citizenship Education and on its main aim: to foster students’ sense of local, national and European citizenship. In some ways this goal has been inspired by Morin’s path to a “plural” education and a planetary citizenship (Morin, 2000). Social sciences, and in particular Geography and History, keep the function of giving tools able to show how a dialogue among the different scales is possible. Nevertheless European citizenship is undergoing a constant redefinition due to the European enlargement process, the role of Europe inside national jurisdictions and to the changes in national curricula. This evolution directly affects the guiding function conferred to school in terms of skills, aims and themes; therefore competences and methods adopted by teachers may have to be reconsidered. This essay presents the first results of the updating {{of the state of the}} art of this issue that has been carried out by the Citizenship Education Research Group of the VOICEs Comenius network (The Voice of European Teachers). The main aim of this international research group is to face the challenge of building <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> by developing a comparative analysis of teachers’ practices and strategies in different local, regional and national contexts, aiming to contribute, with renewed ideas, to the debate on this promising field of research...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the right to respect for family life, and {{especially}} on family reunification. In recent years, family reunification has become a fundamental channel of immigration and, at the same time, family {{has proved to be a}} major instrument of eligibility to welfare benefits. The right of immigrants to family life reveals interesting – and often neglected – connections between individual, social, cultural and political rights and at the same time has proved to be an arena for multiple cleavages of discrimination. Growing socio-cultural diversity in Europe, which is to some extent due to the migration flows reaching our continent, tells us that if this right is to be effective it must not be considered as gender-neutral, or culture-neutral. In fact, family life reflects different cultures and views about family, work, genderization of social roles and of relationships among individuals and groups, between parents and children, and between institutions and normative codes in the religious and public spheres. With regard to this, the paper briefly examines recent developments involving family life that have characterized the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and of the European Court of Justice. I believe that they may shed some light on important current trends in the building of <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and on the European mechanisms of multilevel protection of rights: these trends directly affect many sensitive problems of discrimination. Finally, the paper focus on the challenges posed by immigration to European citizenship, especially if the aim is that of promoting a citizenship capable of tackling the ethnic and gender discrimination that has historically marked the national development of citizenship...|$|E
40|$|<b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{establishes}} <b>a</b> precedent {{whereby the}} exercise {{and protection of}} rights - the practice of citizenship - is no longer contingent on residency within the jurisdiction of national citizenship. Free movement rights have allowed European citizens to cross borders and participate more nearly as political and legal equals within the host society. At the same time, however, <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> has largely failed {{to account for the}} past or future migration of third-country nationals (TCNs) - those who are not citizens of any Member State - into or within the <b>European</b> Union. <b>As</b> a result, the creation of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> has arguably had the unfortunate side effect of further distinguishing and excluding TCNs from the emerging European society.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{distinguish}} two rival theories {{on the relationship}} between <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{in the sense of a}} legal construct on the one hand and <b>a</b> <b>European</b> collective identity on the other hand. According to the first theory a collective identity is a necessary condition for the development of <b>a</b> legitimate <b>European</b> political community. The second theory claims that there is indeed an empirical relationship between these two concepts, but the causal sequence is not necessarily unidirectional. Once a political community is established it can breed a sense of community. In this paper we test the hypothesis that formal citizenship breeds both <b>a</b> sense of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and <b>a</b> sense of <b>European</b> community. Our analyses do not offer firm evidence in support of the hypothesis in either case. The time of entry of the Union rather than the length of membership as such explains differences in the sense of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> <b>A</b> similar conclusion applies to the development of <b>a</b> sense of <b>European</b> community.

The issue is also what we should understand by <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and, in relation to this, how <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> can be promoted and advanced. These questions are first of all considered to be important in relation to the democratic legitimacy of the European Union {{on the assumption that the}} legitimacy of democratic governance crucially depends on the extent to which it is supported and ‘owned’ by its citizens. But they are also considered to be important in relation to wider questions about social cohesion and integration and the emergence of something like a sense of <b>a</b> <b>European</b> identity...|$|R
40|$|The {{freedom of}} {{movement}} within the European Union {{is one of the}} pillars in which the EU is built and is encouraged as a mean to create <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> Even though economic reasons for moving within the union are most common, other reasons such as family or education is important in migration decisions. As immigration from member states of the Union have raised since the Swedish accession, many also returns to their country of origin and emigration rates from Sweden are high. Besides economic reasons for leaving Sweden, the family context also {{plays an important role in}} immigrants’ decision to emigrate. The aim of this study is to explore what impact family life and especially the presence of children might have on out-migration but also to look into socio-economic determinants of emigration. To analyze this, I use longitudinal population register data on EU- 15 migrants in Sweden to apply an event-history analysis. The results suggest that economic integration in Sweden plays an important part as unemployed and having a low income means higher emigration propensities. Having no partner or a partner not born in Sweden means a higher risk of leaving compared to those with a Swedish-born partner, but when information about children is included, having children or not seems to matter more than being in a relationship or not. A closer look at the country of birth of the children shows that having Swedish-born children inhibits emigration while having foreign born children increases the probability to emigrate. The results indicate that having a Swedish born child provides motives to stay on in Sweden...|$|E

The Olympic torch relay was conceived by the organizers of the Beijing Olympic Games as a global media event. The reference frame was ready-made for the media, besides stakeholders of the Games. The outbreak of the civil society on the media stage, widely supported in the European countries by the public opinions, imposed another reading of the event. The Olympic torch relay, as a prelude to the Beijing Games, indeed crystallized the criticisms towards the Chinese regime.

As a consequence, for the European media, it was all the less possible not to report recurring demonstrations during the relay, so that the networks of citizens invested the Web to spread them widely. This exceptional configuration contributed, the transit time of the torch relay, to the representation in the media of a public European sphere and <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> all the more legitimate that they were facing a Power and its institutions of control, embodied in the " Men In Blue ".

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} and analyze how the European union relates to the different dimensions of abortion. What kind of problem is abortion and whose right is it? Does difference framings of the problem enable different solutions? By analyzing debates from the European parliament through Carol Lee Bacchis method “What’s the problem approach” I have come to see that different representations of a problem changes the problem it self. This emphasis that a problem is a problem in one context, but not in an other. Depending on the work of, among others, Barbara Hobson and Ailbhe Smyth I have focused upon the European union as a economical project, leaving social issues to national competence. This makes the EU a patriarchal project that fails to guarantee women’s rights. By not being able to assure women the right of abortion, the women of Europe is treated as second class citizens. Through the eyes of the European union my material has shown that abortion is not only a conflict between the woman’s right to choose and the child’s right to live, but also a conflict of democracy. National sovereignty is challenged by <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> of women. The right to information and the right to freedom of movement within the EU puts the European question of abortion in a new focus. By framing the problem of abortion as a problem of mobility it enables a way of placing women’s right in the free market system. A Europe that allows women to choose where to perform an abortion, and also provide them with information on contraceptives and the morning-after pill, is a Europe that falls within the idea of the EU as a economical project...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{formulate}} a constructive proposal for the ongoing establishment of <b>a</b> post-national <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> in the <b>European</b> Union. To the extent that the proposal is post-national, the ambition is to re-conceptualise the idea and ideal of citizenship in a new historical setting. To the extent that the proposal is constructive, the ambition is to develop and employ a methodology which combines normative and empirical analysis. The aim of the thesis is to make a contribution in each of these fields?with particular emphasis on the first. To achieve this, the thesis is focused on two questions. First, what should post-national citizenship mean? Second, to what extent can the European Union provide the conditions for such a post-national citizenship? The answer to the first question is based on the elaboration of a neo-republican norm and the analysis of the changing empirical conditions and organization of citizenship. The result is a trans-national model of citizenship, which diverges from both the cosmopolitan and the multicultural models that have attracted substantial attention in academic debates. Trans-national citizenship is a citizenship inspired by the Habermasian idea of constitutional patriotism, yet recognizes the continuing predominance of national citizenship and the complementary status of post-national citizenship. The answer to the second question is rooted in an empirical analysis of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and the application of the trans-national citizenship model to the existing realities of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The first part of the constructive proposal is based on <b>a</b> critique of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> as it stands with respect to its functionalism, its continued exclusivity, and its statist bias. The second part of the proposal is an extrapolation and subsequent comparison of three future-oriented principles for the evolution of European citizenship: free movement, identity, and residence. For each of these principles a metaphorical scenario is outlined: the market-oriented vision which basically reduces European citizens to customers of <b>a</b> mall; the <b>European</b> pan-national vision which reduces citizenship to an instrument for cultural reproduction; and the place-oriented vision of <b>a</b> <b>European</b> neighbourhood where all permanent residents are treated as equal subjects and sovereigns of the European polity. Having considered the intrinsic advantages and disadvantages of each scenario, the eventual proposal will comprise a defence of the third principle...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} and progressive acknowledgment of youth rights at international level has affected {{in a positive}} way the transformation of youth policies in Italy. The European integration process and the introduction of new Title V of the Italian Constitution have required new forms of coordination between different supranational and domestic levels of government. These trajectories of change have involved the whole domain of social policies and especially those areas of welfare policies where welfare programmes should be strengthened, such as youth policies. Even if over the last decade youth policies have been institutionalized as a specific domain of public policy – a specific Ministry of Youth has been established only in the 2006 – the transformations underway still require a legislative recognition and a reconfiguration of these programmes into a comprehensive national policy. Italian guidelines concerning youth, as a consequence, have mainly followed the communitarian policy with the incorporation of a multilevel governance. Territorial and inter-institutional cooperation has been identified as a major aspect of achieving visibility and representativeness among institutional actors. Participatory decision making processes are crucial steps in the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> Young people, previously considered as a vulnerable social group, are now a resource. Inclusion and empowerment policies replace now prevention and protection programmes. Youth policy changes in Italy according to a number of common dynamics found in most European countries.

Although these groups are neither citizens nor residents of EU member states, and hence not in possession of EU citizenship as a legal status, they routinely engage in acts of European citizenship as they demand the extension and full implementation of their citizenship rights in Turkey. Their acts of European citizenship include petitioning the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR); contacting EU officials and politicians; mobilising campaigns that target EU institutions and the European public writ large; invocation of European norms as shared principles; and the attribution of political and moral responsibility to European institutions. The fact that Turkish citizens can, and routinely do, engage in acts of European citizenship attests to Europe being an ultimately open and dynamic assemblage, constituted by both those who are deemed to be ‘in and of’ its historically specific incarnation and those who are left out and excluded. The chapter begins by providing a detailed account of a number of episodes where different groups in Turkey have engaged in multi-layered citizenship acts which embody <b>a</b> <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> dimension in addition to the national and, possibly, the sub-national. The following sections of the chapter build on these rich empirical accounts derived from in-depth interviews with activists and analysis of published accounts and news articles. Firstly, we outline the ways in which European-level political activism by Turkish citizens redefines and extends the scope of European citizenship beyond the formal institutions of the EU into associated institutions in the broader European order and into informal networks. Secondly, we analyse the meanings that Turkish citizens ascribe to their European-level political practices, and contend that they are embedded in a broader discourse on Europe as a shared identity and normative order...|$|E
40|$|The social {{dimension}} of the EU 2020 strategy poses some major issues regarding {{the role played by}} the citizens in the policy-making process. The analysis of the link between the EU 2020 and the social economy is crucial in the current context of the economic and political crisis of the EU. The article's main goal is to demonstrate the implications of the social economy policies in constructing the <b>European</b> agenda. <b>A</b> theoretical approach on social economy and an overview on the EU 2020 can reveal how political and non-political actors at the EU level operate with elements that mark common social policy goals. The instruments used by institutions are validated through specific values that are meant to target <b>an</b> active <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The neoliberal perspective behind the social economy system leads to <b>a</b> particular <b>European</b> construct...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether the}} development of European rights for workers implies <b>a</b> <b>European</b> social <b>citizenship.</b> It analyses the debate during the preparation and adoption of the EU Directive on part-time work in 1997, which guarantees part-time workers (who are primarily women) the same pay and working conditions as full-time workers. Was the concept of social citizenship discussed during its preparation and adoption? What kind of gender equality was involved: are women granted equal access to the European market or equal outcomes? We conclude that the Directive involves industrial rather than social citizenship, but ideals of social citizenship were nevertheless at stake during its preparation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhile Europe {{is celebrating}} the fiftieth {{anniversary of the}} signing of the Rome Treaty, there is much doubt about the extent of citizens' {{emotional}} attachment to Europe. In this article we examine whether young Belgians show <b>a</b> sense of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship,</b> using <b>a</b> range of questions about the European Union (EU) from a survey administered to more than 6000 secondary school students. We show that a genuine identification with Europe — one that is not purely based on a positive evaluation of the EU from a utilitarian point of view — is related to higher levels of tolerance towards ethnic minorities, Muslims and immigrants. In addition, we will provide an overview of the literature on <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and its potential connection to a higher degree of tolerance towards different cultures...|$|R
