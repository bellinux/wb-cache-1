5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

25|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> for the NATO mission after 2014 {{was what}} level of the Afghan {{military}} hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, because that would require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail more risk than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed {{it would make the}} Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers would be likely to accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|During a {{literary}} luncheon she is attending, Mrs Ariadne Oliver finds herself {{approached by a}} woman called Mrs Burton-Cox, whose son is engaged to Oliver's godchild, Celia Ravenscroft. During their conversation, Mrs Burton-Cox askes her <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> regarding the deaths of Celia's parents - {{was one of them}} murdered, and if so, who killed who? Ten years earlier, the bodies of Margaret Ravenscroft, a close school friend of Oliver, and General Alistair Ravenscroft, Margaret's husband, were found near their manor house in Overcliffe. The original investigation into their deaths revealed that both had bullet wounds, and that a revolver found between their bodies bore the fingerprints of the married couples, making it impossible to prove whether {{it was a case of}} double suicide or if it was a murder/suicide and who then was the victim and the other the murderer. The death of the Ravenscrofts left both Celia and another of their children orphaned.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> {{regarding}} {{public goods}} {{is whether they}} should be owned by the public or the private sector. Economic theorists such as Hart (1995) argue that ownership matters for investment incentives when contracts are incomplete. The incomplete contracting paradigm {{has been applied to}} public goods by Besley and Ghatak (2001). They consider the government and a non-governmental organization (NGO) who can both make investments to provide a public good. Who should be the owner of the public good, the government or the NGO? Besley and Ghatak show that the party who has a larger valuation for the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, more recently {{it has been shown that}} the investment technology matters also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} sexual {{partners}} people have had in their lifetimes varies widely within a population. A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above (see Pareto principle). About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes. Studies of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases consistently demonstrate {{a small percentage of the}} studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random (with sexual partners from throughout a population) or within their social groups (assortative mixing).|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> {{that remains}} to be {{answered}} is what language or languages were spoken by the people and rulers of the empire of Teotihuacan. During {{the first part of the}} Classic period Teotihuacan achieved dominance over central Mexico and far into the Maya area. Possible candidates for the language of Teotihuacan have been Nahuatl, Totonac or Mixe–Zoque. Terrence Kaufman has argued that Nahuatl is an unlikely candidate because Proto-Nahuan did not enter Mesoamerica until around the time of the fall of Teotihuacan (c. 600 AD), and that Totonac or Mixe–Zoque are likely candidates because many Mesoamerican languages have borrowed from these two languages during the Classic period. Others find Mixe–Zoque an unlikely candidate because no current Mixe–Zoque settlements are found in central Mexico. Around 500–600 CE a new language family entered Mesoamerica when speakers of Proto-Nahuan, a southern Uto-Aztecan language, moved south into central Mexico. Their arrival, which coincides with the decline of Teotihuacan and a period of general turmoil and mass migration in Mesoamerica, has led scientists to speculate that they might have been involved somehow in the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.|$|E

We give {{the conditions under which}} a Markov process has a cutoff time, in the sense of Reyni’s divergence measure; which can be considered as a generalization of the well known Kullback distance. For illustration, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. 1...|$|R
