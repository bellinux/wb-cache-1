It marked Doink's final match as a heel, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> on Jerry Lawler shortly after the match. In addition, Matt Osborne, who had portrayed Doink since the character's creation, was fired that fall because of drug problems.|$|E
5|$|Moore's {{signature}} form is a reclining figure. Moore's {{exploration of}} this form, {{under the influence}} of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms with openings.|$|E
5|$|Within an hour, White {{called his}} wife {{from a nearby}} diner; she met him at a church and was with him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> himself in. Many left flowers {{on the steps of}} City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a {{spontaneous}} candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at St. Mary's Cathedral. Two memorials were held for Milk; a small one at Temple Emanu-El and a more boisterous one at the Opera House.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the restart, Liverpool had the first attack. Striker Michael Owen went past United defender Brown, but {{he was unable to}} shoot when the ball got stuck in between his feet. A minute later, Liverpool had an appeal for a penalty after striker Emile Heskey went down in the United penalty area, but referee Paul Durkin did not award a penalty. They had another chance in the 52nd minute after an exchange of passes between Murphy and Heskey, but Murphy's shot went over the bar. United began to exert more pressure on Liverpool after this. A minute later a shot by Keane was blocked by Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä. The ball went out for a United, which resulted in a throw-in, that was headed into the arms of Dudek. Five minutes later, Van Nistelrooy had a chance to score <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> and shot at the Liverpool goal, but it was saved by Dudek. Heskey was replaced by striker Milan Baroš following an injury.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Ray {{released}} {{what would}} be commercially the most successful of his films.

Goopy the singer and Bagha the drummer, endowed with three gifts by the King of Ghosts, {{set out on a}} fantastic journey. They try to stop an impending war between two neighboring kingdoms. Among his most expensive enterprises, the film project was difficult to finance. Ray abandoned his desire to shoot it in color, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> down an offer that would have forced him to cast a certain Hindi film actor as the lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Randy Orton faced Kurt Angle. In {{the early stages}} both superstars took the advantage over one another. Angle controlled most of the match, as Orton tried to avoid Angle's assaults. Angle tried to perform a suplex on Orton off the ring apron, but did not perform the move. This was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor. Mid-way in the match, Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle's head to drive it over his shoulders, but he countered by pushing Orton to the turnbuckle. Orton took the padding off the turnbuckle, leaving it exposed. Following this, Angle began performing a series of German suplexes on Orton. Angle then applied the ankle lock hold. Orton, however, flipped over and sent Angle face-first into the exposed turnbuckle. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> around, Orton performed the RKO, and covered Angle to gain the pinfall victory.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Harith's death, Ghassanid {{territory}} {{was attacked}} by Qabus ibn al-Mundhir, the new Lakhmid ruler, who sought {{to take advantage of}} the situation. Qabus's forces were repulsed and Mundhir invaded Lakhmid territory in turn, seizing much plunder. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> back, the Lakhmids again confronted the Ghassanid army, but suffered a heavy defeat. After this success, Mundhir wrote to the Byzantine emperor Justin II (r. 565–578) asking for gold for his men. This request reportedly angered Justin, who sent instructions to his local commander to lure the Ghassanid ruler into a trap and have him killed. But the letter fell into Mundhir's hands, who then severed his relations with the Empire and refused to commit his forces during the war with Persia that began in 572.|$|E

25|$|Caragiale {{also contributed}} to the Arad-based journal Românul, {{becoming}} friends with other Romanian activists—Aurel Popovici, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Vasile Goldiş. His articles expressed support for the National Romanian Party, calling for its adversaries at Tribuna to abandon their dissident politics. In August 1911, he was present in Blaj, where the cultural association ASTRA was celebrating its 50th year. Caragiale also witnessed one of the first aviation flights, that of the Romanian Transylvanian pioneer Aurel Vlaicu. In January 1912, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> 60, Caragiale declined taking part in the formal celebration organized by Emil Gârleanu's Romanian Writers' Society.

25|$|The Senators {{knew from}} {{observation}} that Chára {{would be a}} reliable defender, and were also {{aware that he was}} growing into his body and improving his skills each year. However, Chára grew in ways that exceeded all expectations. In 2001–02, during his first year in Ottawa, he recorded new career highs in goals (10) and points (23) <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> into a bona fide two-way defenseman. His powerful slapshot continued to improve, and Ottawa began to deploy him on the power play to use it, something the Islanders had rarely done. It resulted in four of Chára's goals being scored with the man advantage that season. The following year, in 2002–03, Chára began to blossom into an elite NHL defenseman. He posted new career highs with 30 assists and 39 points and became one of Ottawa's top two defenders, along with Wade Redden. He also earned his first All-Star Game appearance, where he recorded the second-hardest shot behind Al MacInnis in the Skills Competition.|$|E
25|$|The next season, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> 16 {{during the}} summer, Määttä was {{automatically}} promoted to JYP under-18 team, but was swiftly promoted after only one game to the under-20 team. While splitting {{his time between}} JYP U20 and the D Team in the Mestis (second division) classification—the second-highest level of ice hockey in Finland—Määttä once again found time to participate on Finland's national teams, playing for both the under-18 and -20 teams. At the under-18 tournament, he led all Finnish defenceman in scoring with four points and helped Finland to a fifth-place finish. Määttä did not perform nearly as well at the 2011 World Junior Championships, however, going pointless in six games, though he became the youngest player ever to play for Finland's World Junior team, a record that has since been broken by Aleksander Barkov. At {{the end of the}} season, Määttä returned to JYP's U20 team en route to an eventual league championship. Määttä finished with five points in 12 games.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Mero began wrestling for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) reprising his Johnny B. Badd character. He {{debuted in}} TNA on the October 2, 2004 episode of Xplosion, where he participated {{as a fan}} {{favorite}} in a tag team match with Russ Rollins against Rod Steele and Bruce Steele, which Badd's team won. After the match, Badd smashed Jeff Jarrett's guitar on Rollins' head, thus turning into a villain. However, his villainous turn was short-lived <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> back into a fan favorite during his Impact! debut on November 5, where he defeated Vito Thomaselli. He appeared with the company sporadically throughout late 2004 and early 2005. He competed at the company's first monthly pay-per-view Victory Road, where he participated in an eight-man tag team match, which his team won. Badd's most notable moment during his TNA career {{took place on the}} November 19 episode of Impact!, when he defeated Raven, with the help of Diamond Dallas Page. Badd then appeared at the Turning Point pay-per-view in December, where he teamed with Pat Kenney against Glen Gilberti and Johnny Swinger in a tag team match, which Mero's team won. His last televised match in TNA was a six-man tag team match on the December 31 episode of Impact!, where his team was victorious. He made his last appearance in TNA at the pre-show of the Final Resolution pay-per-view on January 16, 2005, where he was paired with Sonny Siaki in a tag team match against The Naturals, which Naturals won.|$|E
25|$|Halák was {{assigned}} to the Bulldogs {{for the majority of the}} 2007–08 season. However, after the Canadiens traded Huet on 26 February 2008, Halák took over full-time as the Canadiens back-up goaltender. He started his first playoff game on 30 April 2008 against the Philadelphia Flyers (a 4–2 loss) after sub-par performances from newly appointed starter Carey Price, who once again took over in the following game. He fulfilled back-up duties for the Canadiens into the following season. However, Halák's strong play coupled with inconsistent performances from Price led to an opportunity for Halák to step into a larger role. Ultimately, based on his strong play for the Canadiens and for Slovakia at the Vancouver Olympics, there was a strong internal push to designate Halák the team's starting goaltender. Halák went on to be named the Canadiens' Molson Cup Player of the Year for the season and was designated the starter heading into their first-round playoff match-up against the President's Trophy-winning Washington Capitals. In the sixth game of the series, Halák stopped 53 shots to set a club record for a playoff game (in regulation-time), leading the Canadiens to a 4–1 victory. Ultimately, the Canadiens overcame a 3–1 series deficit to win the series in seven games, marking one of the biggest upsets in NHL history. The win was attributed largely to Halák's play <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> aside 131 of Washington's 134 shots in games 5 through 7, frustrating the league's top scoring team from the regular season. After defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games, the Canadiens fell to the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference Final with a 4–1 series loss.|$|E
