5|$|A {{member of}} the Breckinridge {{political}} family, in 1849 John C. Breckinridge became the first Democrat to represent Fayette County in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and in 1851, {{he was the first}} Democrat to represent Kentucky's 8th congressional district in over 20 years. A champion of strict constructionism, states' rights, and popular sovereignty, he supported Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the Mexican–American War. Considering his re-election to the House of Representatives unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, and although he <b>and</b> <b>Buchanan</b> won the election, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration.|$|E

5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge <b>and</b> <b>Buchanan</b> endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{with the}} United Kingdom were tense due to {{disputes}} over American fishing rights in Canada and U.S. and British ambitions in Central America. Marcy completed a trade reciprocity agreement with British minister to Washington, John Crampton, which {{would reduce the}} need for aggressive British naval patrols in Canadian waters. The treaty ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada. While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada–US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Britain from expanding its influence. Pierce convinced former Secretary of State Buchanan to become the U.S. minister to Britain, <b>and</b> <b>Buchanan</b> sought to persuade Britain to relinquish their territories in Central America.

25|$|Retired Garda Detective Sergeant Sean Gethins {{told the}} Tribunal that the IRA team at Jonesborough had {{initially}} planned to kidnap and interrogate Breen. He {{was to be}} questioned about internal security leaks {{that led to the}} May 1987 Loughgall Ambush of an IRA active service unit (ASU) by the Special Air Service which had resulted in the deaths of eight IRA volunteers and a civilian. According to Gethins, Breen was targeted by the IRA after he had given television interviews in the days following the ambush. Kevin Fulton suggested British agents {{who took part in the}} ambush at Jonesborough had shot Breen <b>and</b> <b>Buchanan</b> lest they reveal the names of informants whilst under torture. Ian Hurst, in his statement confirmed that the IRA's original plan had been to kidnap the two RUC officers and interrogate them at a secure location in the Republic. Once the IRA unit had extracted all possible information from the two men, they would have killed them. Hurst claimed to have received the information from agent Stakeknife's long-term handler. He also added that sanction for the ambush and killing of such high-ranking RUC officers as Breen <b>and</b> <b>Buchanan</b> would have come from the highest echelons of the IRA's Northern Command.|$|E
25|$|For his part, Lincoln criticized Douglas for {{his moral}} {{indifference}} to slavery, but denied {{any intention of}} interference with slavery in the South.

Taney worked together to extend and perpetuate slavery. Lincoln disclaimed the radical views on racial equality attributed to him by Douglas, arguing only for the right of negroes to personal liberty and to earn their own livings.|$|E
