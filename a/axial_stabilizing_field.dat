We proceed in two different approaches: in the first approach, the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>field</b> potential is directly appeared in the Friedmann equation and the resulting scenario is effectively a two-field inflation. In the second approach the stabilization mechanism is considered {{in the context of}} a warp factor so that there is just one field present that plays the roles of both inflaton and stabilizer.

30|$|As {{the channel}} {{registration}} holds {{at one point}} in time and at one image plane, throughout the relatively long PALM image acquisition, the registration precision is challenged by the interplay of a variation of the sample axial position and a mechanical displacement of the imaging optics of one channel with respect to the other one. Furthermore, it was demonstrated (Engelhardt et al. 2011) that, in the presence of molecular dipoles that are not free to rotate, axial offsets can result into sizable lateral offsets. This phenomenon can result in up to 2.8 nm lateral offset for 10 nm axial displacement. To alleviate these two problems an axial stabilization system was put in place. The <b>axial</b> <b>stabilized</b> system is based on a feedback system using the total internal reflection of a near-infrared laser line, a concept originally proposed by Huang et al. (Huang et al. 2008) and Pertsinidis et al. (Pertsinidis et al. 2010), and it is described in the Equipment and Settings section. As Figure 1 (b) displays, the sensitivity of this setup allows not only to avoid defocus and macroscopic blurring of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of individual emitters, but also to maintain the axial position of the sample stable to the nm-level with a 5 nm accuracy for extended periods of time.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a five dimensional AdS warped spacetime in {{presence of a}} massive scalar field in the bulk. The scalar field potential fulfills the requirement of modulus stabilization even when the effect of backreaction of the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>field</b> is taken into account. In such a scenario, we investigate the possible role of modulus field on a compact stellar structure {{from the perspective of}} four dimensional effective theory. Our result reveals that {{in the presence of the}} modulus field, the upper bound of mass-radius ratio (generally known as Buchdahl's limit) of a star can go beyond the general relativity prediction. Interestingly this provides a natural testbed for the existence of such higher dimensional modulus field. Comment: 17 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a five dimensional AdS warped spacetime in {{presence of a}} massive scalar field in the bulk. The scalar field potential fulfills the requirement of modulus stabilization even when the effect of backreaction of the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>field</b> is taken into account. In such a scenario, we explore the role of backreaction on the localization of bulk fermions which in turn determines the effective radion-fermion coupling on the brane. Our result reveals that both the chiral modes of the zeroth Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermions get localized near TeV brane as the backreaction of the scalar field increases. We also show that the profile of massive KK fermions shifts towards the Planck brane with increasing backreaction parameter. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|We study a five-dimensional supergravity {{model with}} boundary-localized visible sector exhibiting anomaly-mediated {{supersymmetry}} breaking, {{in which the}} central requirements of sequestering and radius stabilization are achieved perturbatively. This {{makes it possible to}} understand these various mechanisms in a more integrated and transparent fashion, mostly from the higher-dimensional viewpoint. Local supersymmetry, in the presence of visible sector quantum effects, is enforced by the formalism of the five-dimensional superconformal tensor calculus. The construction results in only mild warping, which allows a natural supersymmetry-breaking mediation mechanism of (finite) boundary-to-boundary gravity loops to co-dominate with anomaly-mediation, thereby solving the latter’s tachyonic slepton problem. We make the non-trivial check that this can occur while dangerous loops of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>fields</b> remain highly suppressed.

In adverse convection {{we find a}} transition from forward to backward bifurcation with increasing vertical (<b>stabilizing)</b> <b>field.</b> The stability analysis of roll solutions explains the experimentally observed transition between roll and square patterns for weak horizontal (destabilizing) fields. In a range of high vertical magnetic fields two steady convective modes with different wavelengths and symmetries become critical at nearly the same threshold giving rise to competition and resonant interaction.

It turns out that the critical shear rate and wave vector at RI threshold decrease with increasing destabilizing field but do not approach zero at the Freedericksz transition. However calculations show that beyond the Freedericksz threshold HI may be favourable over a range of destabilizing field with shear in the stabilizing role. For plane Poiseuille flow a similar analysis points to the existence of a HI threshold in the presence of destabilizing field beyond the Freedericksz threshold again with shear acting as a <b>stabilizing</b> <b>field.</b> These results are compared with theoretical results obtained previously for MBB...|$|R

40|$|Constructing {{models of}} {{inflation}} and/or baryogenesis {{in the context}} of N= 1 supergravity is known to be difficult as the finite energy density during inflation typically generates large (order the Hubble scale) mass terms. This is the well-known eta problem in inflation. The same effect gives masses along low energy flat directions of the scalar potential thus potentially preventing Affleck-Dine baryogenesis to occur. It has been shown that adding a chiral multiplet S coupled to the inflaton (with a shift symmetry) can serve to stabilize the inflationary potential and allows one to derive simple inflationary potentials without an eta problem. Here, we show that by coupling the same <b>stabilizing</b> <b>field</b> S to the flat direction, may naturally lead to a negative mass-squared contribution to the flat direction thus generating the necessarily large vacuum expectation value needed to realize Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. We trace the evolution of the inflaton, stabilizer, and flat direction field, as well as a Polonyi-like modulus responsible for soft supersymmetry breaking. Comment: 29 pages, 28 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{appearance}} of the radion field, which {{is associated with the}} spin- 0 metric fluctuations combined in some manner with the scalar <b>stabilizing</b> <b>field,</b> and of the radion, the corresponding lowest Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode, is a generic prediction of stabilized brane world models. In such models the radion plays the role of the dilaton, and its mass may be somewhat smaller than that of all the KK modes of other particles propagating in the multidimensional bulk. Due to its origin, the radion couples to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the Standard Model, the interaction Lagrangian of the radion and the Standard Model fermions being {{similar to that of the}} SM Higgs-fermion interactions except for additional terms, which come into play only in the case of off-shell fermions. In the present paper it is shown that all the contributions to perturbative amplitudes of physical processes due to these additional terms are canceled out for both massless and massive off-shell fermions. Thus the additional fermion-radion terms in the interaction Lagrangian do not alter any production and decay properties of the radion compared to those of the Higgs boson.

40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of three stabilization mechanisms of unstable states of physical systems {{is presented in}} this review. These mechanisms are: the quantum Zeno effect, the stabilization of unstable states in an external fast oscillating field (i. e. the Kapitza pendulum), and the mechanism named as the spinning top mechanism. The common features of these mechanisms, {{as well as the}} differences between them, are analyzed in the paper. In particular, it is shown that the stabilization of quantum systems is possible without involvement of such concept as the collapse of wave function. For stabilization it is sufficient to have a stabilizing radiation flow with the Rabi frequency of transitions exceeding some frequency. This frequency is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state under stabilization. It is shown that the Top principle allows stabilizing unstable systems using affecting only those states to which these systems must go over. It is shown that stabilization of unstable states by impact of rapidly oscillating forces occurs by non-self-consistent exposure, i. e. the dynamics of <b>stabilizing</b> <b>field</b> is independent on the dynamics of the stabilized state. Stabilization using the spinning top principle involves self-consistent forces, and thus, in many cases can be the most effective mechanism of stabilization. Comment: 47 pages; 10 figure...|$|R

Recent {{theoretical}} {{studies on}} the relative occurrence of field induced static periodic domains (PD) and homogeneous deformation (HD) are reviewed for different sample and field configurations. Apart from energetics the related language of torques can be employed to obtain a qualitative explanation of the destabilizing positive feedback mechanism (PFM) which causes PD to develop in materials having high elastic anisotropy. PD may be suppressed by a proper choice of field direction, initial director orientation or director anchoring strengths at the boundaries; simultaneous application of an orthogonal <b>stabilizing</b> <b>field</b> may also quench PD. In a simple twisted nematic, PD may occur as one of two independent modes associated with orthogonal directions of periodicity. Solutions reminiscent of PD result for biaxial nematics though in this case PD may have a more complex form. When the sample is cylindrical and the field radial PD may result, depending upon the initial director orientation, either as a static Taylor instability or as a distortion whose azimuthal variation is governed by a dimensioniess wavevector taking integral values.
