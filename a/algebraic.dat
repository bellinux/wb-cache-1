5|$|A {{field is}} thus a {{fundamental}} <b>algebraic</b> structure, which is widely used in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Algebraic</b> {{solutions}} to Apollonius' problem were pioneered in the 17th century by René Descartes and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, although their solutions were rather complex. Practical <b>algebraic</b> methods {{were developed in}} the late 18th and 19th centuries by several mathematicians, including Leonhard Euler, Nicolas Fuss, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Lazare Carnot, and Augustin Louis Cauchy.|$|E
5|$|Boykett {{used this}} <b>algebraic</b> {{formulation}} {{as the basis}} for algorithms that exhaustively list all possible inequivalent reversible cellular automata.|$|E
5|$|Classically, <b>algebraic</b> {{functions}} {{are defined by}} an <b>algebraic</b> equation, and transcendental functions (including those discussed above) are defined by some property that holds for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.|$|E
5|$|Commutative algebra makes great use of {{rings of}} polynomials {{in one or}} several variables, {{introduced}} above. Their multiplication is both commutative and associative. These rings and their quotients {{form the basis of}} <b>algebraic</b> geometry, because they are rings of functions of <b>algebraic</b> geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|Global {{fields are}} in the limelight in <b>algebraic</b> number theory and {{arithmetic}} geometry.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} <b>algebraic</b> topology and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence is}} an <b>algebraic</b> tool to help compute <b>algebraic</b> invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of <b>algebraic</b> topology, the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They {{are examples of}} topological invariants, which reflect, in <b>algebraic</b> terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute.|$|E
5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} <b>algebraic</b> methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into <b>algebraic</b> equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for <b>algebraic</b> methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E
5|$|Many number systems, {{such as the}} {{integers}} and the rationals enjoy {{a naturally}} given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general <b>algebraic</b> structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract <b>algebraic</b> concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.|$|E

5|$|The {{best known}} fields are {{the field of}} {{rational}} numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also {{in many areas of}} science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, <b>algebraic</b> function fields, <b>algebraic</b> number fields, and p-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and <b>algebraic</b> geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.|$|E
5|$|The derived {{category}} of coherent sheaves is constructed using tools from complex geometry, {{a branch of}} mathematics that describes geometric curves in <b>algebraic</b> terms and solves geometric problems using <b>algebraic</b> equations. On the other hand, the Fukaya category is constructed using symplectic geometry, a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of classical physics. Symplectic geometry studies spaces equipped with a symplectic form, a mathematical tool {{that can be used}} to compute area in two-dimensional examples.|$|E
5|$|The text-based Portable Game Notation (PGN), {{which is}} {{understood}} by chess software, {{is based on}} short form English language <b>algebraic</b> notation.|$|E
25|$|In <b>algebraic</b> geometry, an <b>algebraic</b> {{curve is}} an <b>algebraic</b> variety of {{dimension}} one.|$|E
25|$|An <b>algebraic</b> set {{is called}} {{irreducible}} if it cannot be written as {{the union of}} two smaller <b>algebraic</b> sets. Any <b>algebraic</b> set is a finite union of irreducible <b>algebraic</b> sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the irreducible components of the <b>algebraic</b> set. An irreducible <b>algebraic</b> set is also called a variety. It turns out that an <b>algebraic</b> set is a variety {{if and only if}} it may be defined as the vanishing set of a prime ideal of the polynomial ring.|$|E
25|$|The <b>algebraic</b> matroids are matroids defined from sets of {{elements}} of a field extension using the notion of <b>algebraic</b> independence. Every linear matroid is <b>algebraic,</b> and for fields of characteristic zero (such as the real numbers) linear and <b>algebraic</b> matroids coincide, but for other fields there may exist <b>algebraic</b> matroids that are not linear.|$|E
25|$|In <b>algebraic</b> topology, the cup {{product is}} a {{far-reaching}} <b>algebraic</b> generalization of the linking number, with the Massey products being the <b>algebraic</b> analogs for the Milnor invariants.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} in <b>algebraic</b> geometry, complex analysis and number theory, an abelian variety is a projective <b>algebraic</b> variety {{that is also}} an <b>algebraic</b> group, i.e., has a group law that can be defined by regular functions. Abelian varieties are {{at the same time}} among the most studied objects in <b>algebraic</b> geometry and indispensable tools for much research on other topics in <b>algebraic</b> geometry and number theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} <b>algebraic</b> number fields, and, more generally, of <b>algebraic</b> {{extensions}} {{of the field of}} rational numbers, is the central topic of <b>algebraic</b> number theory.|$|E
25|$|Conventions {{regarding}} {{the definition of}} an <b>algebraic</b> variety differ slightly. For example, some definitions provide that <b>algebraic</b> variety is irreducible, which means {{that it is not}} the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology. Under this definition, non-irreducible <b>algebraic</b> varieties are called <b>algebraic</b> sets. Other conventions do not require irreducibility.|$|E
25|$|<b>Algebraic</b> combinatorics, {{in which}} <b>algebraic</b> methods {{are used to}} study {{combinatorial}} questions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Algebraic</b> {{numbers are}} those that are a {{solution}} to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. Complex numbers which are not <b>algebraic</b> are called transcendental numbers. The <b>algebraic</b> numbers that are solutions of a monic polynomial equation with integer coefficients are called <b>algebraic</b> integers.|$|E
25|$|Another formal {{generalization}} {{is possible}} to universal <b>algebraic</b> geometry in which every variety of algebras has its own <b>algebraic</b> geometry. The term variety of algebras {{should not be confused}} with <b>algebraic</b> variety.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes other <b>algebraic</b> sites {{replace the}} {{category}} of affine schemes. For example, Nikolai Durov has introduced commutative <b>algebraic</b> monads as a generalization of local objects in a generalized <b>algebraic</b> geometry. Versions of a tropical geometry, of an absolute geometry over a field of one element and an <b>algebraic</b> analogue of Arakelov's geometry were realized in this setup.|$|E
25|$|Commutative {{rings are}} much better {{understood}} than noncommutative ones. <b>Algebraic</b> geometry and <b>algebraic</b> number theory, which provide many natural examples of commutative rings, have driven much {{of the development of}} commutative ring theory, which is now, under the name of commutative algebra, a major area of modern mathematics. Because these three fields (<b>algebraic</b> geometry, <b>algebraic</b> number theory and commutative algebra) are so intimately connected it is usually difficult and meaningless to decide which field a particular result belongs to. For example, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is a theorem which is fundamental for <b>algebraic</b> geometry, and is stated and proved in terms of commutative algebra. Similarly, Fermat's last theorem is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, which is a part of commutative algebra, but its proof involves deep results of both <b>algebraic</b> number theory and <b>algebraic</b> geometry.|$|E
25|$|The {{two-dimensional}} complex tori {{include the}} abelian surfaces. One-dimensional complex tori are just elliptic curves and are all <b>algebraic,</b> but Riemann discovered that most complex tori of dimension 2 are not <b>algebraic.</b> The <b>algebraic</b> ones {{are exactly the}} 2-dimensional abelian varieties.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>algebraic</b> {{topology}} primarily uses algebra {{to study}} topological problems, using topology to solve <b>algebraic</b> problems is sometimes also possible. <b>Algebraic</b> topology, for example, {{allows for a}} convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.|$|E
25|$|An <b>algebraic</b> lattice is a {{complete}} lattice that is <b>algebraic</b> as a poset.|$|E

25|$|Real <b>algebraic</b> {{geometry}} is {{the study}} of the real points of <b>algebraic</b> geometry.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rise}} of the computers, a {{computational}} <b>algebraic</b> geometry area has emerged, which lies at the intersection of <b>algebraic</b> geometry and computer algebra. It consists essentially in developing algorithms and software for studying and finding the properties of explicitly given <b>algebraic</b> varieties.|$|E
25|$|Commutative algebra is {{essentially}} {{the study of the}} rings occurring in <b>algebraic</b> number theory and <b>algebraic</b> geometry.|$|E
25|$|In <b>algebraic</b> geometry, {{a surface}} of general type is an <b>algebraic</b> surface with Kodaira dimension2. Because of Chow's theorem any compact complex {{manifold}} of dimension 2 and with Kodaira dimension 2 {{will actually be}} an <b>algebraic</b> surface, and in some sense most surfaces are in this class.|$|E
