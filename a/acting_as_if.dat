Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of <b>acting</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> only he had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In a {{nationwide}} Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit {{was involved in}} Levy's disappearance and 27 percent felt that he should resign.

A poll sample taken from Condit's congressional district held a more favorable view of Condit. On March 5, 2002, Condit lost the Democratic primary election for his Congressional seat to his former aide, then-Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, with the Levy controversy being cited as a contributing factor. He was subpoenaed to appear on April 1, 2002, before a District of Columbia grand jury investigating the disappearance. The date was kept a carefully guarded secret to avoid further leaks.

Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon {{does not need to}} know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila.

500|$|In Stanley Kubrick's 1968 {{science fiction}} film , {{astronaut}} David Bowman slowly disassembles {{the mind of}} an artificial intelligence named HAL by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr likened the emotions of despair expressed by HAL as its mind is disassembled to his own, at the time, cognitive difficulties in engaging with long texts. He felt as if someone was [...] "tinkering with [...] brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory". HAL had also {{been used as a}} metaphor for the [...] "ultimate search engine" [...] in a PBS interview with Google co-founder Sergey Brin as noted in Carr's book The Big Switch, and also Brin's TED talk. Brin was comparing Google's ambitions of building an artificial intelligence to HAL, while dismissing the possibility that a bug like the one that led HAL to murder the occupants of the fictional spacecraft Discovery One could occur in a Google-based artificial intelligence. Carr observed in his essay that throughout history technological advances have often necessitated new metaphors, such as the mechanical clock engendering the simile [...] "like clockwork" [...] and the age of the computer engendering the simile [...] "like computers". Carr concluded his essay with an explanation as to why he believed HAL was an appropriate metaphor for his essay's argument. He observed that HAL showed genuine emotion as his mind was disassembled while, throughout the film, the humans onboard the space station appeared to be automatons, thinking and <b>acting</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were following the steps of an algorithm. Carr believed that the film's prophetic message was that as individuals increasingly rely on computers for an understanding of their world their intelligence may become more machinelike than human.|$|E
500|$|Practising {{throughout}} 1899 and 1900, Bosanquet {{began to}} use the googly in minor matches before using it in important cricket. His first use of the new delivery in first-class cricket came in the match against Leicestershire in 1900 in which he scored two centuries. In the second innings, Samuel Coe had scored 98 when Bosanquet, still known as a fast-bowler, bowled his off break; the ball bounced four times and the batsman was stumped (although, writing in 1925, Bosanquet recalled Coe had been bowled). Bosanquet later wrote that the wicket [...] "was rightly treated as a joke, and {{was the subject of}} ribald comment". Middlesex captains permitted him to try googlies if there was little pressure on, but he later wrote: [...] "Though I could claim some five or six wickets before the close of the season, my efforts produced far more laughter than dismay in the hearts of opposing batsmen". But Bosanquet persisted with the delivery and soon began to be noticed by influential cricketers who recognised the potential of the googly. Previously, some bowlers occasionally bowled unintended googlies, but were unable to control them. Although batsmen were accustomed to off break or leg break bowlers, it was an unprecedented problem to face a bowler who could bowl both types of delivery at will, disguising which one he bowled. Bosanquet persuaded teammates to remain silent as he wished to maintain the impression that his off break was an accident so that batsmen were not expecting it. He further tried to play down his successes: he feigned surprise, <b>acting</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were similarly accidental.|$|E
500|$|Augustus Jones {{had learned}} of the band's {{troubles}} and ventured into the interior to bring Peter and John {{to live with him}} at his farm in Saltfleet Township, with their stepmother and halfsiblings. [...] As he knew only a few words of English, Peter was enrolled in a one-room school in Stoney Creek. With the help of the local teacher, George Hughes, Peter learned English. The next year, the family moved to Brantford, where Augustus took Peter out of school and began to instruct him in farming. [...] Sarah Tekarihogan's Iroquois tribe had settled in the Grand River valley in and around Brantford. [...] Here Jones was inducted into the Iroquois tribe and given the Mohawk name [...] "Desagondensta", meaning [...] "he stands people on their feet". [...] Jones was baptised Anglican by Reverend Ralph Leeming at the request of his father in 1820, but internally he did not accept Christianity. [...] Jones would later say that although the instruction he received in Christianity from his father, his stepmother and his old schoolteacher George Hughes had attracted him to the religion, the conduct of the white Christian settlers [...] "drunk, quarreling, fighting and cheating the poor Indians, and <b>acting</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there was no God" [...] convinced him there could be no truth in their religion. [...] He allowed himself to be baptised primarily to become a full member of the white society of Upper Canada, with all the privileges it entailed. [...] Given the behaviour of others who had been baptised, Jones expected it to have no effect upon him. [...] Jones worked with his father farming until the summer of 1822, when he found employment as a brickmaker working for his brother-in-law Archibald Russell to raise money so he might resume his schooling. [...] He attended school in Fairchild's Creek during the winter of 18223 studying arithmetic and writing, hoping to obtain work as a clerk in the fur trade.

40|$|Abstract – When {{communication}} fails, {{our ability}} to reconvene depends on previous planning. Rally points are often used {{as a way of}} establishing a communication hub {{in the event of an}} emergency. But mobile ad hoc networks give us new capabilities. What is ultimately important is the time it takes to re-establish communication, which is a function of location, mobility, and the available connectivity. Some heuristics will work better than others, and certain situations favor the use of robots to facilitate communication, by forming an ad hoc bridge between isolated areas, or by <b>acting</b> <b>as</b> couriers. <b>If</b> softwaredefined radios are available, then strategies can be developed that periodically help recalibrate paths toward a rally point.

This paper introduces mobility aware agents in ad-hoc network nodes and modifies HELLO packets of the AODV protocol to enhance mobility awareness. Mobility aware agent can update its awareness through inquiry and reply to inquiries about neighbors on quasi-periodic bases. On receiving the HELLO packet with GPS coordinates of the originator, agent compares them with previous ones and hence has awareness about the mobility of the originator with reference to itself. The enhancements in the throughput of the network are studied through simulation in OPNET that has shown optimistic results...|$|R
