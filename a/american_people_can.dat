40|$|Abstract This minor thesis {{discussed}} {{about one}} of American popular literature, that was written by John Grisam. The researcher was interested so much in exploring the American myth of success which was reflected by John Grisham in his novel The Firm. The research {{took the form of}} library research that utilizing the descriptive technique. The approaches used in this thesis to analize the main data, Grisham’s The Firm, were sociology and cultural anthropology. These approaches were useful to elaborate and and comprehend the American myth of success phenomenon which was revealed in The Firm. Based on analysis, {{it was found that the}} American myth of success had inspired some characters in the novel (lawyers, law firm and FBI agents) to work hard and realize their dreams. The myth of success had played roles in shaping some of <b>American</b> modern <b>people</b> habit, opinion and way of life. Also it was found that to some people’s opinion myth of success was connoted with the attaining of material objects but not to the others’. Finnally it can be concluded that American myth of success was seen differently by some of <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> It <b>can</b> also be pointed that some of <b>American</b> <b>people</b> applied different way to achieve success...|$|R

They have stumbled in their running, and are lying hurt upon the ground; while they who have heard their boastings turn upon them with ridicule, and laugh at them in their discomforture. They are rolling in the mire, and cannot take the hand of any man to help them. Though {{the hand of the}} by-stander may be stretched to them, his face is scornful and his voice full of reproaches. Who has not known that hour of misery when in the sullenness of the heart all help has been refused, and misfortune has been made welcome to do her worst? So is it now with those once United States.

60|$|Of dirt of {{all kinds}} it behoves Washington and those {{concerned}} in Washington to make themselves free. It is the Augean stables through which some American Hercules must turn a purifying river before the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> justly boast either of their capital or of their government. As to the material mud, enough has been said. The presence of the army perhaps caused it, and the excessive quantity of rain which had fallen may also {{be taken as a}} fair plea. But what excuse shall we find for that other dirt? It also had been caused by the presence of the army, and by that long-continued down- pouring of contracts which had fallen like Danae's golden shower into the laps of those who understood how to avail themselves of such heavenly waters. The leaders of the rebellion are hated in the North. The names of Jefferson Davis, of Cobb, Toombs, and Floyd are mentioned with execration by the very children. This has sprung from a true and noble feeling; from a patriotic love of national greatness and a hatred of those who, for small party purposes, have been willing to lessen the name of the United States. I have reverenced the feeling even when I have not shared it. But, in addition to this, the names of those also should be execrated who have robbed their country when pretending to serve it; who have taken its wages in the days of its great struggle, {{and at the same time}} have filched from its coffers; who have undertaken the task of steering the ship through the storm in order that their hands might be deep in the meal-tub and the bread-basket, and that they might stuff their own sacks with the ship's provisions. These are the men who must be loathed by the nation--whose fate must be held up as a warning to others before good can come! Northern men and women talk of hanging Davis and his accomplices. I myself trust that there will be no hanging when the war is over. I believe there will be none, for the Americans are not a blood-thirsty people. But if punishment of any kind be meted out, the men of the North should understand that they have worse offenders among them than Davis and Floyd.|$|E

50|$|Washington {{goes on to}} {{warn the}} <b>American</b> <b>people</b> to {{question}} the ulterior motives of any person or group who argue that the land within {{the borders of the}} United States is too large to be ruled as a republic, an argument made by many during the debate on the proposed purchase of the Louisiana Territory, calling on the people to give the experiment of a large republic a chance to work before deciding that it cannot be done. He then offers strong warnings on the dangers of sectionalism, arguing that the true motives of a sectionalist are to create distrust or rivalries between regions and people to gain power and take control of the government. Washington points to two treaties acquired by his administration, the Jay Treaty and Pinckney's Treaty, which established the borders of the United States' western territories between Spanish Mexico and British Canada, and secured the rights of western farmers to ship goods along the Mississippi River to New Orleans. He holds up these treaties as proof that the eastern states along the Atlantic Coast and the federal government are looking out for the welfare of all the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> and <b>can</b> win fair treatment from foreign countries as a united nation.|$|R
40|$|The Ku Klux Klan {{has been}} active in North America for 139 years and {{organizations}} like the Klan have existed in North America since before the United States and Canada became independent nations. The white supremacy advocated by the Klan mimics the justifications used by colonial powers, and though the United States and Canada have espoused egalitarian ideals for quite some time, the Klan continues to attract members. Mircea Eliade and Claude Levi-Strauss have argued that history and myth share many characteristics, and that sometimes history can act as myth. Understanding how North American history can be a mythic model for the religious formation of North <b>American</b> <b>people</b> one <b>can</b> better explain the long-term viability of the Klan and its ability not only to inspire violence, but to articulate a particular kind of white North American identity.

40|$|In {{cases with}} no claims or {{defenses}} concerning sports, the Supreme Court and lower {{federal and state}} courts frequently publish opinions that draw analogies to the rules or terminology of sports familiar to broad segments of the <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> Sports analogies <b>can</b> help the court explain factual or legal points because today’s generation, including the lawyers and litigants who comprise the prime audience for written opinions, grew into adulthood amid an unprecedented saturation of professional and amateur sports in the broadcast and print media, and more recently on the Internet. This article surveys the broad array of sports whose references now lace written judicial opinions, and then discusses the use and misuse of these references. Sports references can help courts explain and resolve complexity, but may also implicate Rule 1. 3 of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct by detracting unacceptably from the prestige indispensable to the judicial role.

No pragmatic, realistic step-by-step plan has been pursued to end this scourge on the <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> The solution <b>can</b> be found in the problem. Net imports of oil account for approximately 50 percent of the oil the U. S. consumes. Likewise, 50 percent of oil consumed in the U. S. is consumed as motor gasoline. If overnight the U. S. stopped using oil to power its vehicles, if overnight drivers switched to electric vehicles, then overnight the U. S. would become energy independent. Using historical data to establish the effect of gasoline price changes on consumer vehicle choice, a predictive model has been created showing the expected switch to electric vehicles if the price of gasoline increases and the cost of electric vehicles decreases. There is a cost to energy independence: two to five dollars per gallon of retail gasoline sold. If monies raised from the tax are used to lower the price of electric vehicles, build recharge infrastructure, and dampen the regressive nature of the tax, energy independence is a few short years away.

40|$|African American {{children}} are the proxy for what ails American education in general. And so, as we fashion solutions which help African American children, we fashion solutions which help all children. —Honorable Augustus F. Hawkins 1 This article is a discussion of significant incidents and issues that pertain to recent efforts to infuse Afrocentric content into the U. S. public school curriculum. 2 The focus here is on developments within the past decade, as highlighted by {{a case study of}} the School District of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Two distinct historical developments among African <b>American</b> <b>people</b> inform what <b>can</b> be called a movement for Afrocentric content infusion. The first is the late 1960 s mass call by parents and community leaders for more control over their schools. The second development is the popular-ization of the Afrocentric idea and the embracing of African culture by African Americans. In addition, the seemingly increasing sever-ity of social problems confronting African American youths is an alarming development that has lent urgency to this movement. Carpenter-Huffman, Hall, and Sumner (1974) provide a useful method by which any attempt to introduce a school reform can be evaluated. This method is used here applied to the Afrocentric cur-riculum movement. An examination of the efforts to infuse Afrocentric content into the curriculum of Philadelphia’s publi...|$|R
