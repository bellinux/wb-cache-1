5|$|Public {{interest}} in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited {{by members of the}} upper class. This attitude reached its climax a few years later when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas.|$|E
5|$|Abolition of Titles: Article 18 of the {{constitution}} prohibits the State from conferring any titles. Citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign State. The British government had created <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> class known as Rai Bahadurs and Khan Bahadurs in India – these titles were also abolished. However, Military and academic distinctions can be conferred on the citizens of India. The awards of Bharat Ratna and Padma Vibhushan cannot {{be used by the}} recipient as a title and do not, accordingly, come within {{the constitution}}al prohibition". The Supreme Court, on 15 December 1995, upheld the validity of such awards.|$|E

5|$|Although Hall's author's note disclaims any {{real-world}} {{basis for}} the ambulance unit that Stephen joins, she drew heavily on the wartime experiences of her friend Toupie Lowther, co-commander of the only women's unit {{to serve on the}} front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, came from <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> family, adopted a masculine style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E
5|$|Born in Caen, Normandy to <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> family, Michel-Guillaume Hector St. John de Crèvecœur {{received}} a Jesuit {{education at the}} Jesuit Collège Royal de Bourbon. In 1754, having left school, Crèvecœur visited relatives in England where he became engaged; this visit would {{mark the beginning of}} a lifelong admiration for the culture and politics of the country. Shortly after this, possibly due to the death of his fiancée, he joined a French regiment in Canada engaged in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). After being wounded in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), Crèvecœur resigned his commission and began traveling widely across Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19thcentury, other aristocratic women {{began to turn}} away from refined society life and focused on feminist reform. Among them was Anna Pavlovna Filosofova, a woman from <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> Moscow family married to a {{high-ranking}} bureaucrat, who devoted her energy to various societies and projects to benefit the poor and underprivileged in Russian society, including women. Together with Maria Trubnikova, Nadezhda Stasova and Evgenia Konradi, she lobbied the Emperor to create and fund higher education courses for women. She was also {{a founding member of the}} Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society and responsible for helping to organize the All-Women's Congress of 1908.|$|E
5|$|The Quwatlis were {{a family}} of merchants, who became wealthy from trading with Arabia, and moved to Damascus from Baghdad in the 18th-century. The family {{established}} itself {{in the district of}} al-Shaghour in Damascus, and by 1860, some of the family's wealth was invested in buying large tracts of land in the Ghouta farms surrounding Damascus. The family's notable status was owed to their wealth, rather than <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> or religious lineage, and their traditional spheres of activity were commerce and the Ottoman civil service.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation is}} the earldom hypothesis.

This version of events is essentially as told by the Norse sagas and is supported by some archaeological evidence although it has been criticised for exaggerating Orcadian influence in the Suðreyar.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they {{saw no reason to}} join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> rule.|$|E
5|$|Born into <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> Bengali {{family of}} Calcutta, Vivekananda was {{inclined}} towards spirituality.

After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds {{of public and private}} lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson counts Þorgerðr and Irpa as {{examples}} of guardian goddesses in Germanic paganism, and compares their roles {{to that of the}} dísir and valkyries. Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of Hålogaland, it would explain Þorgerðr's last name ("bride of Helgi") and that, subsequently, she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn. Substantially the same argument has been advanced by McKinnell. Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age, that the idea of a guardian goddess welcoming kings was essentially <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> concept, and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries welcoming dead kings into the after life, using the poem Hákonarmál as an example.|$|E

The union was {{contrary}} to the wishes of the bride's mother, who saw Luís Alves and his family as upstarts. Newspapers connected to political enemies of his family took advantage of this disagreement to level serious, but unfounded, accusations against him, including that he had kidnapped Ana Luísa.

5|$|Pope Clement VIII {{wanted to}} persuade Sigismund {{to join the}} Holy League that the pope had {{organized}} against the Ottoman Empire. After Rudolph's troops defeated the Ottomans {{in a series of}} battles in the autumn of 1593, Sigismund decided to join the Holy League, provided that Rudolph acknowledged the independence of Transylvania from the Hungarian Crown. However, the delegates of the Three Nations refused to declare war against the Ottoman Empire at three consecutive Diets between May and July. Sigismund abdicated, tasking Balthasar Báthory with the government in late July. Balthasar wanted to seize the throne, but Kovacsóczy, Kendi, and the other leading officials decided to set up <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> council to administer Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|When the Song dynasty was founded, the {{political}} elites consisted of officials (and their sons) {{who had served}} in the Five Dynasties era, {{as well as those who}} came from prominent families which boasted <b>an</b> <b>aristocratic</b> ancestry and had provided officials for generations. Since the first Song emperors wished to avoid domination of government by military strongmen such as the jiedushi of the previous era, they limited the power of military officers and focused on building a powerful civilian establishment. During the 11th century, the expansion of schools and local academies nurtured a nationwide gentry class which provided most if not all officials. By the late 11th century, the elite marriage strategies of prominent families eroded due to the intense partisan politics surrounding the New Policies (新法; xin fa) of Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086). These great families were replaced by officials representing diverse local gentry lineages throughout the country.|$|E
