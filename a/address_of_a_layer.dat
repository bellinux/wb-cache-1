40|$|We {{present the}} results <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{extensive}} series <b>of</b> experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and models that <b>address</b> horizontal shaking <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> granular material. The goal of this work was {{to better understand the}} transition between the &# 8220;fluid&# 8221; and &# 8220;solid&# 8221; states of granular materials. In the experiments, the material&# 8212;consisting of glass spheres, smooth and rough sand&# 8212;was contained in <b>a</b> container <b>of</b> rectangular cross section, and subjected to horizontal shaking of the form x=Asin(&# 0969;t). The base of the container was porous, so {{that it was possible to}} reduce the effective weight of the sample by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vertical gas flow. The acceleration of the shaking could be precisely controlled by means <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accelerometer mounted onboard the shaker, plus feedback control and lockin detection. The relevant control parameter for this system was the dimensionless acceleration, &# 0915;=A&# 0969; 2 /g, where g was the acceleration <b>of</b> gravity. <b>As</b> &# 0915; was varied, the <b>layer</b> underwent <b>a</b> backward bifurcation between a solidlike state that was stationary in the frame of the shaker and a fluidlike state that typically consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sloshing <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> maximum depth H riding on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solid <b>layer.</b> That is, with increasing &# 0915;, the solid state made a transition to the fluid state at &# 0915;cu and once the system was in the fluid state, a decrease in &# 0915; left the system in the fluidized state until &# 0915; reached &# 0915;cd<&# 0915;cu. In the fluidized state, the flow consisted of back and forth sloshing at the shaker frequency, plus a slower convective flow along the shaking direction and additionally in the horizontal direction transverse to the shaking direction. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the last of these flows is associated with shear and dilation at the vertical sidewalls. For &# 0915;<&# 0915;cu and in the solid state, there was a &# 8220;gas&# 8221; of free particles sliding on the surface of the material. These constituted much less than one layer&# 8217;s worth of particles in all cases. If these &# 8220;sliders&# 8221; were suppressed by placing <b>a</b> thin strip <b>of</b> plastic on the surface, the hysteresis was removed, and the transition to fluidization occurred at a slightly lower value than &# 0915;cd for the free surface case. The hysteresis was also suppressed if a vertical gas flow from the base was sufficient to support roughly 40 % of the weight of the sample. Both the transition to the fluid state from the solid and the reverse transition from the fluid to the solid were characterized by similar divergent time scales. If &# 0915; was increased above &# 0915;cu by a fractional amount &# 0949;=(&# 0915;&# 8722;&# 0915;cu) /&# 0915;cu, where &# 0949; was small, there was a characteristic time &# 0964;=A&# 0949;&# 8722;&# 0946; for the transition from solid to fluid to occur, where &# 0946; is 1. 00 &# 0177; 0. 06. Similarly, if &# 0915; was decreased below &# 0915;cd in the fluidized state by an amount &# 0949;=(&# 0915;&# 8722;&# 0915;cd) /&# 0915;cd, there was also a transient time &# 0964;=B&# 0949;&# 8722;&# 0946;, where &# 0946; is again indistinguishable from 1. 00. In addition, the amplitudes A and B are essentially identical. By placing a small &# 8220;impurity&# 8221; on top of the <b>layer,</b> consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavier particle, we found that the exponent &# 0946; varied as the impurity mass squared and changed by <b>a</b> factor <b>of</b> 3. <b>A</b> simple Coulomb friction model with friction coefficients &# 0956;k<&# 0956;s for the fluid and solid states predicts a reversible rather than hysteretic transition to the fluid state, similar to what we observe with the addition of the small overload from a plastic strip. In an improved model, we provide a relaxational mechanism that allows the friction coefficient to change continuously between the low and high values. This model produces the hysteresis seen in experiments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{method of}} {{calculation}} of wave fields in media with curvilinear interfaces is proposed. After integral transformations, the solution in the explicit form is obtained. For solving the problem, we introduce {{the notion of the}} generalized thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer.</b> This value becomes real in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plane boundary and coincides with <b>an</b> “ordinary” thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer.</b> If the boundary is curvilinear, the generalized thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> becomes <b>a</b> complex value. The use of the generalized thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> brings about the fact that conditions on infinity (Sommerfeld’s conditions) are automatically fulfilled.

40|$|AbstractThe {{instability}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fluid confined {{between two}} horizontal parallel planes and heated from {{above or below}} under the action <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gravitational field varying with height is investigated analytically. It is found that if gravity remains downward (upward) throughout the flow domain, neutral modes do not exist. A sufficient condition for stability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> heated from above is that gravity remain directed downward over a sufficiently {{large part of the}} flow domain. A circle theorem limiting the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> arbitrary oscillatory mode (whether stable, neutral or unstable) is established. A sufficient condition for instability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> heated from below is found to be that gravity remain directed downward and the gravity profile have concave curvature throughout most of the flow domain. For a linearly varying gravity field with the downward gravitational acceleration increasing with height or decreasing with height slowly, (i) <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> heated from above is stable, (ii) <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> heated from below is unstable, and (iii) the circle theorem is modified depending on whether the gravitational acceleration is increasing or decreasing with height...|$|R
