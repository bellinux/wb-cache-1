2500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, Boeing {{considered}} replacement aircraft programs as {{sales of the}} 767 and 747-400 slowed. Two new aircraft were proposed, the 747X, which would have lengthened the 747-400 and improved efficiency, and the Sonic Cruiser, which would have achieved 15% higher speeds (approximately Mach 0.98) while burning fuel {{at the same rate}} as the 767. [...] Market interest for the 747X was tepid, however several major American airlines, including Continental Airlines, showed initial enthusiasm for the Sonic Cruiser, although concerns about the operating cost were also expressed. The global airline market was disrupted by the September 11, 2001 attacks and increased petroleum prices, making airlines more interested in efficiency than speed. The worst-affected airlines, those in the United States, had been considered the most likely customers of the Sonic Cruiser; thus the Sonic Cruiser was officially cancelled on December 20, 2002. On January 29, 2003 Boeing announced an <b>alternative</b> <b>product,</b> the 7E7, using Sonic Cruiser technology in a more conventional configuration. The emphasis on a smaller midsize twinjet rather than a large 747-size aircraft represented a shift from hub-and-spoke theory towards the point-to-point theory, in response to analysis of focus groups.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1994, Bischoff {{declared}} open war on McMahon's WWF {{and aggressively}} recruited high-profile former WWF superstars such as Hulk Hogan and [...] "Macho Man" [...] Randy Savage {{to work for}} WCW. Using Turner's monetary resources, Bischoff placed his faith in established stars with proven track records. Due to their high profiles, however, Hogan and Savage were able to demand concessions, such as multi-year, multimillion-dollar contracts and creative control over their characters. This would later become a problem during subsequent years of competition with the WWF, as other wrestlers {{were able to make}} similar demands, and contract values soared out of control. Hogan in particular was able to gain considerable influence through a friendship with Bischoff. Hogan's considerably hefty fee of $700,000 per pay-per-view appearance plus 25% of the gross revenue from the pay-per-view would cost the company dearly in future years. He was paid this amount whether the pay-per-view was successful or not. Hogan's creative control would later prove to be a large hindrance during WCW's future success (see Starrcade '97). Another thing Bischoff may have failed to consider was the fact that many WCW fans (especially those who had followed the company since its NWA days) watched it as an <b>alternative</b> <b>product</b> to the WWF that focused on in-ring action as opposed to cartoonish characters and storylines. As such, these fans viewed Bischoff's signing of former WWF talent as an attempt to copy its success instead of remaining true to the idea of WCW being an alternative to the WWF.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the number of}} uses, the number of available <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> must be taken into account. The broader the spectrum, the higher will be the workload for comparatively assessing all products that are available for a given use. As a further workload indicator, we therefore derived the product of all three factors: The number of potential candidate products × the average number of uses for which alternatives are potentially available × the average number of <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> that is available for each of these uses. This results in roughly 18, 500 cases. This figure is the number of all possible pairwise comparisons of candidate <b>products</b> with <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> for all common uses of two products. For the sub-fraction of potential candidate products that contain CFS identified by environmental hazard criteria, the figure is roughly 20 % smaller.|$|R

30|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the potential number of cases for which a comparative assessment {{will need to be}} carried out, in terms of (i) the number of CFS-containing candidate products, (ii) the number of different uses of such candidate products, (iii) the number of uses of candidate <b>products</b> for which <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> are available, and (iv) the possible number of pairwise comparisons of candidate and <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> for all common uses. For the purpose of this study, we assumed that candidate products are only compared to <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> that do not contain any CFS. In principle, neither the legal text nor the available draft of the EU Guidance Document excludes the possibility of a substitution of a candidate product by another candidate product, if a significant risk reduction would result. However, we assumed {{that this would be a}} rare situation and excluded it from further consideration.|$|R

30|$|In Germany, the {{requirement}} for comparative assessments may affect up to 25 % of all PPPs and around 50 % of all uses of PPPs. In absolute terms, these are around 350 candidate products with 1, 850 different uses. <b>Alternative</b> <b>products</b> without CFS may be available for around 40 % of these uses. On average, a candidate product is authorised for around 18 different uses. For 11 of these uses, no alternatives are authorised. For the remaining seven uses, slightly more than seven alternatives are available on average. Multiplication of these factors gives an indicative figure of around 18, 500 possible pairwise comparisons of candidate <b>products</b> with <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> for every common use.|$|R
