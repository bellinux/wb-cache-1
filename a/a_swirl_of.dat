5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} crossed Central America organized and {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become a remnant low, which was observed as <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> clouds {{for a few more}} days before dissipating.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. <b>A</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama {{drifted to}} a location south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 9. It moved westward through {{a hostile environment}} of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked on July 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> clouds on July 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.|$|E
5|$|Hernan {{continued}} to intensify {{and became the}} first major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherof the season on August 9. After reaching major hurricane status, Hernan steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane. The weakening continued, and Hernan was further downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11. As Hernan moved over cold waters, the convection associated with the storm dissipated, leaving only <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> clouds. By the morning of August 12, almost all of the convection associated with Hernan had dissipated and the system was declared a remnant low-pressure area. The remnants of the hurricane caused light rain to Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around {{the center of}} the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E

5|$|On June 22, showers {{increased}} {{associated with}} a tropical wave several hundred miles away from land. Three days later, deep convection became more concentrated, and the system became a tropical depression. It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined. As it moved west, convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water. Shortly thereafter, increased wind shear took its toll on Carlos as the low-level center became exposed from the deep convection. Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27, and dissipated June 28. However, <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> clouds remained {{for a couple of}} days. Except for Socorro Island, which the system passed close to, Carlos never threatened land. No indications of casualties or damage were reported.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, Darby {{moved over}} coolers waters {{and began to}} deteriorate. The eye became less {{well-defined}} and the associated convection started weakening. Increasingly colder waters and growing wind shear continued to affect Darby, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on July 30. The low-level center of circulation became exposed from the thunderstorm activity, and the storm quickly degenerated into <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> clouds, although it maintained tropical storm strength. On July 31, it weakened to a tropical depression. Darby soon crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, and it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 1. However, its remnants continued westward under the low-level trade winds, and dropped heavy rainfall on Hawaii several days after the cyclone dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} began {{a movement}} to the northwest upon formation and {{on the night of}} October 31, the depression ran into a newly-forming upper-level low near the Yucatan Peninsula. The interaction with the upper-level low caused shearing in the depression, and broke apart the previous low-level circulation that was developing. By the morning of November 1, the depression was nothing more than <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> low-level clouds near the center of circulation. After this, the depression could no longer attain the circulation it had previously developed. During the period of November 2 and 3, the depression moved to the northeast, crossing over the islands of Jamaica, Cayman and Cuba and then entering the southern parts of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{effects from}} the strong wind shear, a large, deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of Josephine. The center {{was found to have}} shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5-day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, mostly {{to the north of the}} circulation, due to the strong southerly wind shear. By mid-morning, Josephine re-intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on Josephine by late morning. The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly.|$|E
25|$|Adrian {{weakened}} throughout June 10 to June 12 {{as increased}} vertical wind shear persisted around its vicinity. It was downgraded into {{a tropical storm}} on June 11 as the once organized structure deteriorated, further so into a tropical depression the following day. Adrian subsequently decayed into a remnant low-pressure area with very little convection, all dislocated to the northeast of the low-level center. Degeneration continued and Adrian disintegrated into <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> low clouds, drifting due to the northwest. Since Adrian stayed at sea, its effects along coastlines were limited. Damages, if any, remains unknown, and no fatalities were reported {{as a result of}} the Adrian.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} air system targeted high reduction. In 1954 CE moved their secondary air from about 1 m below the liquor guns to about 2 m above them. The air ratios and temperatures remained the same, but to increase mixing 50m/s secondary air velocities were used. CE changed their frontwall/backwall secondary to tangential firing at that time. In tangential air system the air nozzles {{are in the}} furnace corners. The preferred method is to create <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> almost the total furnace width. In large units the swirl caused left and right imbalances. This kind of air system with increased dry solids managed to increase lower furnace temperatures and achieve reasonable reduction. B had already adopted the three-level air feeding by then.|$|E

25|$|A Committee of Organisation for Forming a Provisional Government put {{placards}} {{around the}} streets of Glasgow late on Saturday 1 April, calling for an immediate national strike. On Monday 3 April work stopped in a wide area of central Scotland and in <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> disorderly events a small group marched towards the Carron Company ironworks to seize weapons, but while stopped at Bonnymuir they were attacked by Hussars.

500|$|Shortly thereafter, Madeline {{attained}} peak {{winds of}} [...] about [...] southwest of San Blas, Nayarit. The hurricane maintained peak winds for about 18hours while curving {{again to the}} northwest. With evidence of southern wind shear, only a small area of deep thunderstorm activity existed on October 19, and the system began to appear ill-defined of satellite imagery. The hurricane quickly weakened into a tropical storm, and by later that day, the storm became void of convection due to strong wind shear. On October 19, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression, leaving just <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> low clouds midway between {{the southern tip of}} Baja California and mainland Mexico. By 0600UTC on October 20, the remnants of Madeline had completely dissipated.|$|E

500|$|While at peak intensity, {{the storm}} {{maintained}} a well-organized and [...] "impressive" [...] convective pattern.

The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1800UTC on September9 and continued to weaken as wind shear increased in association with an approaching trough and a related cold front. By late on September9, all of the already limited convective activity was confined to the eastern semicircle, leaving the low-level center exposed. The storm was reduced to <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> low-level clouds just hours later.
