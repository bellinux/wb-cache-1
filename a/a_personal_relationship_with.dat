5|$|Kagame {{spent most}} of his {{childhood}} and young adult years living in Uganda, and has <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> President Yoweri Museveni dating back to the late 1970s; they fought together in the Ugandan Bush War, and Kagame was appointed head of military intelligence in Museveni's national army following the NRA victory in 1986. When the RPF soldiers abandoned the Ugandan army and invaded Rwanda in 1990, Museveni did not explicitly support them, but according to Prunier it is likely that he had prior knowledge of the plan. Museveni also allowed the RPF safe passage through Ugandan territory to the Virunga mountains after their early defeats in the war, and revealed in a 1998 heads of state meeting that Uganda had helped the RPF materially during the Rwandan Civil War. Following the RPF victory, the two countries enjoyed a close political and trade relationship.|$|E

25|$|He already carried great {{influence}} in the LDP, despite his lack of seniority: this was partly because of his friendship with future prime minister Eisaku Satō, and partly because his stepdaughter had married future prime minister Hayato Ikeda's nephew, giving him <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> both key heads of the party.|$|E
25|$|Lewinsky was a {{graduate}} of Lewis & Clark College.

Some researchers believe that German's rejection of Oswald's marriage proposal may have {{had much to do with}} his disillusionment with life in the Soviet Union and his decision to return to the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{black church}} in the United States {{developed}} out of the creolization of African spirituality and European-American Christianity; early members of the churches made certain stories their own. During the antebellum years, the idea of deliverance out of slavery, as {{in the story of}} Exodus, was especially important. After Reconstruction and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses. They found much to respond to in the idea of <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Jesus, and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a pecuniary interest, other forms of personal interest that an adjudicator has in a decision may {{give the impression that}} he or she is biased. As the High Court stated in Re Singh Kalpanath (1992), a likelihood of bias may arise because an adjudicator (1) has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable to the parties before him; (2) has made known his views about the merits of the very issue or issues of a similar nature in such a way as to suggest prejudgment; or (3) has <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the party or there is close kinship between the adjudicator and a party.|$|E

25|$|Many of the Cylons {{also share}} a religion. It differs greatly from the humans' religion; it is monotheistic and shares many beliefs of Abrahamic monotheistic {{religions}} (God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, {{that he will}} one day deliver divine retribution and that he intervenes in the world). Much like Evangelical Christianity, the Cylon religion encourages <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> God. Despite being man-made, Cylons believe that they were created by God. The different Cylon models have varying degrees of faith; at least one, Cavil, does not subscribe to any religion. Some humans have come to follow the Cylon religion, mostly by way of Gaius Baltar, who himself grew {{to believe in the}} Cylon religion through the efforts of Caprica Six.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his career, Gallatin pursued an {{interest}} in Native American language and culture. He drew upon government contacts in his research, gathering information through Lewis Cass, explorer William Clark, and Thomas McKenney of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Gallatin developed <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Cherokee tribal leader John Ridge, who provided him with information on the vocabulary {{and the structure of}} the Cherokee language. Gallatin's research resulted in two published works: A Table of Indian Languages of the United States (1826) and Synopsis of the Indian Tribes of North America (1836). His research led him to conclude that the natives of North and South America were linguistically and culturally related and that their common ancestors had migrated from Asia in prehistoric times.|$|E
25|$|The Charismatic {{element of}} the Church is seen as being evident {{today as it was}} in the early days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic {{communities}} conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in , this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|Like many {{intellectuals in}} Mexico, her {{focus is on}} human rights issues and {{defending}} various social groups, especially those she considers to be oppressed by those in power, which include women, the poor and others. She speaks and writes about them even though she herself {{is a member of}} Mexico's elite, using her contacts as such on others’ behalf. She is not an impartial writer as she acts as an advocate for those who she feels have no voice. She feels that <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> her subjects is vital. She stated to La Jornada that the student movement of 1968 left a profound mark on her life and caused her consciousness to change as students were murdered by their own police. It was after this that she was clear that the purpose of her writing was to change Mexico. She has visited political and other prisoners in jail, especially strikers and the student protestors of 1968. According to one biography, her house was watched around the clock. She was arrested twice (one in jail for twelve hours and once detained for two) when observing demonstrations. However, she has never written about this.|$|E

(See [...] and [...]) Introducing various mandatory taxes on peasant-owned land, Chikka Devaraja, however, exempted his soldiers' land from these payments.

500|$|The {{second part}} {{consists}} of five chapters {{and focuses on}} the rise, development, and fall of civilizations. Rifkin connects the qualitative changes in energy regimes and communication techniques with changes in how people understand and organize reality. Hunter-gatherer societies were all oral cultures and thus only existed in geographically-limited small groups and identified themselves symbiotically {{in terms of that}} group. Spiritually, these societies believed in local gods who were only known to others through oral tales. The development of writing, as well as hydraulics and irrigation, allowed agricultural societies to better organize themselves so that a larger geographic area and a larger population could be controlled. Hydraulic power was labour-intensive, requiring large populations of subservient people. With scripts, there was a shift from [...] a mythological consciousness to a theological consciousness; individuals thought of themselves less in terms of a small, local group and more with a monotheistic religion which included <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> a god.|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{considered}} Providence his {{guide in}} life and referred to scripture constantly; he knew large sections of the Bible by heart. He understood the biblical texts literally and inferred from them that the Earth was flat, a belief he retained firmly to his dying day. At mealtimes he said grace twice, at length and in formal Dutch rather than the South African dialect that was to become Afrikaans. In late 1858, {{when he returned to}} Waterkloof, he was mentally and physically drained following the exertions {{of the past few years}} and in the midst of a spiritual crisis. Hoping to establish <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> God, he ventured into the Magaliesberg and spent several days without food or water. A search party found him [...] "nearly dead from hunger and thirst", Davenport records. The experience reinvigorated him and greatly intensified his faith, which for the rest of his life was unshakeable and, according to Meintjes, perceived by some of his contemporaries as like that of a child.|$|E
