5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating {{a new era in}} history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit became part of the giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue for <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> to show off their products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E
25|$|The American <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> {{approached}} Congress to ask {{for roughly}} $15billion in loans to keep them operational into 2009. Bachmann criticized that bill, fearing that the initial sum of money would be followed by subsequent ones without the companies making changes to revive their business. Bachmann supported an alternative rescue for the American <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> {{and the rest of}} the auto industry rather than the plan that passed. Bachmann's alternative would have set benchmarks for reducing their debt and renegotiating labor deals and would set up the financial assistance as interim insurance instead of a taxpayer-financed bailout.|$|E

Responses to the crisis included the $700 billion TARP program to bailout damaged financial institutions, loans to help bailout the auto industry crisis, and bank debt guarantees. The vast majority of these funds were later recovered, as banks and <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> paid back the government.|$|E

25|$|In February 2011, Matt Blunt was {{selected}} {{as president of the}} American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC). The AAPC is a policy association created by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. The council, is a bipartisan 501(c)6 based in Washington, D.C. and its mission is to promote the unique and significant economic contribution of the U.S.-based <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> to the American economy. Blunt’s leadership at one of the United States' top automobile and component-producing states is a major reason he was chosen to lead the policy initiatives of General Motors, Ford, Chrysler.|$|E
25|$|American <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> in the 1920s {{expected}} {{they would}} soon sell six million cars a year, but {{did not do so}} until 1955. Numerous companies disappeared. Between 1922 and 1925, the number of U.S. passenger car builders decreased from 175 to 70. H. A. Tarantous, managing editor of MoToR Member Society of Automotive Engineers, in a New York Times article from 1925, suggested many were unable to raise production and cope with falling prices (due to assembly line production), especially for low-priced cars. The new pyroxylin-based paints, eight cylinder engine, four wheel brakes, and balloon tires as the biggest trends for 1925.|$|E
25|$|While not overtly political, {{the film}} {{documents}} {{that the federal}} government of the United States under the Presidency of George W. Bush joined the auto-industry suit against California in 2002. This pushed California to abandon its ZEV mandate regulation. The film notes that Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card had recently been head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the White House with Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and <b>auto</b> <b>companies.</b> By failing to increase mileage standards in a meaningful way since the 1970s and now interfering in California, the federal government had again served short-term industry interests at the expense of long-range leadership on issues of oil dependency and cleaner cars.|$|E

500|$|The United States economy {{went into}} a {{recession}} in the early 1920s and automobile sales decreased. Coupled with increasing competition, Haynes Automobile Company began running into debt problems. Haynes had to use [...] his personal savings to rescue the company in 1921 and pay off some outstanding accounts. A bond drive was launched to raise $1million to help fund the company through the period, but it fell significantly short of raising enough money. Haynes [...] was the primary purchaser of the bonds. Unlike the other large <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> like Ford and General Motors, Haynes Auto {{did not have the}} widespread dealership agreements that were able to sustain their companies through the hard times; his company relied on customer's ordering directly from the factory. Haynes Auto sales quickly began to slip from a peak of nearly 6,000 cars sold in 1922. In 1923 sales dropped to 4,300, and 1,500 in 1924. The situation continued to be bleak for the company, and it was forced to declare bankruptcy in October 1924. Haynes sought a merger with multiple other <b>auto</b> <b>companies,</b> including Henry Ford, but partners were not forthcoming and Haynes was forced to agree to a liquidation in 1925. He was held personally responsible for about $95,000 of the company's debt. In addition, he lost $335,700 in stock he held in the company and a substantial amount in investment bonds. In total, the loss cost Haynes an estimated quarter of his net worth.|$|E

50|$|Hart <b>Auto</b> <b>Company</b> / Kunkle Manufacturing Co. (multiple dates, 1914 - 1929) This two-story, block long {{building}} {{located at}} 112 East Main Street {{was constructed in}} four parts. The oldest part was constructed in 1914 to house Hart <b>Auto</b> <b>Company's</b> Ford Service Garage. The building has corbelled and sawtooth brickwork, along with first floor storefront windows and five segmental arch-head second-story windows. An extension to the Hart <b>Auto</b> <b>Company</b> building was added in 1926, containing similar corbelled and sawtooth brickwork, as well as industrial windows. In about 1929 the Kunkle Manufacturing <b>Company,</b> an <b>auto</b> parts manufacturer, demolished a store {{on the other side}} of the block and built a factory with two and three-section windows on the front facade. Some time later a gable-roofed connector was constructed between the 1914 Hart building and the 1929 Kunkle building.|$|R

2500|$|The film explores some of {{the motives}} that may have pushed the auto and oil {{industries}} to kill off the electric car. Wally Rippel offers, for example, that the oil companies were afraid of losing their monopoly on transportation fuel over the coming decades; while the <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> feared short-term costs for EV development and long-term revenue loss because EVs require little maintenance and no tuneups. [...] Others explained the killing differently. GM spokesman Dave Barthmuss argued it was lack of consumer interest due to the maximum range of 80–100 miles per charge, and the relatively high price.|$|E
2500|$|President Roosevelt quickly disavowed the Board's {{exclusive}} representation rule. [...] The United Auto Workers {{had organized}} more than 50,000 {{workers in the}} automobile industry in 1933. But the <b>auto</b> <b>companies</b> rejected the union's demand for recognition, set up company unions and refused to allow the NLB to mediate. Roosevelt intervened personally in the dispute. On March 25, 1934, Roosevelt announced a settlement that provided for proportional, rather than exclusive, representation—thus giving the company unions equal footing with the Auto Workers. The agreement also stripped the NLB of its jurisdiction over the auto industry. Worse, the agreement provided no authority for holding elections, and thus no means of determining which organizations truly represented workers.|$|E
2500|$|Gradually, perhaps {{since the}} mid-1960s, the {{importance}} of promotionals began to dwindle. [...] AMT produced their last dealer promos for the 1972 model year and by the late 1970s, plastic promos were mostly {{a thing of the}} past (Anderson 2003). AMT, along with MPC and Jo-Han, continued to produce promotionals until the 1980s, but it was not the enterprise it once was. Eventually models were offered only for the most sporty or prestigious cars and sold in dealerships for steep prices and not given away, so the term “promotional” hardly applied any longer. Also, the <b>auto</b> <b>companies,</b> which earlier had seen promotional models as easy and free advertising, began to charge fees to modeling companies in the late 1980s for the use of their names and designs (Clor 1990). Thus smaller companies had a more difficult time affording manufacturing licensing.|$|E
5000|$|After the Parry <b>Auto</b> <b>Company</b> {{passed into}} {{receivership}} in 1910, the Motor Car Manufacturing Company {{was created by}} its creditors.

Indeed the New Parry continued to be produced until a little after the new Pathfinder was introduced in 1912. Board members included former or then-current officials from the Parry <b>Auto</b> <b>Company,</b> Dayton Motor Car Company, American Ball Bearing Company, and Standard Oil.
