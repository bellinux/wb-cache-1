Fabric is recognized as the #1 most popular crash reporting and also the #1 mobile analytics solution among the top 200 iOS apps, beating out Google Analytics, Flurry, and MixPanel.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{aimed to}} have Windows 10 {{installed}} {{on at least}} one billion devices in the two to three years following its release. , Windows 10 usage was increasing, with it then plateauing, and with previous versions of Windows declining in their share of total usage as measured by web traffic. The operating system is running on more than 400 million <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> and has an estimated usage share of 27.72% on traditional PCs and 12.53% across all platforms (PC, mobile, tablet, and console). Windows 10 use now exceeds Windows 7 globally on weekends, and has already become more popular overall in some regions including in Europe and North America, i.e. most developed countries, such as first in Iceland and later, Japan, Australia and the US.|$|E

Participants’ heart rates were compared at times when the <b>active</b> <b>device</b> of the equipment for the above procedure was attached to their body and when the <b>active</b> <b>device</b> was detached. Although typical response patterns emerged across the participants results demonstrated that heart rates were lower when the <b>active</b> <b>device</b> was attached, tentatively supporting the notion that anxiety and stress may be collateral to participants’ SIB...|$|R

25|$|IoT's {{amorphous}} computing {{nature is}} also a problem for security, since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices. One set of researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87% of <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Continuous wave - In {{these the}} {{transformer}} {{is driven by}} a feedback oscillator, which applies a sinusoidal current to the transformer. The primary tuned circuit serves as the tank circuit of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a radio transmitter. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous sine wave output. Power vacuum tubes are often used as <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> instead of transistors {{because they are more}} robust and tolerant of overloads. In general, continuous excitation produces lower output voltages from a given input power than pulsed excitation.|$|E
50|$|This {{approximate}} result {{also applies}} to oscillators employing different <b>active</b> <b>device,</b> such as MOSFETs and vacuum tubes.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} a noted {{shortcoming}} ultimately considered insignificant was an enemies ability to detect {{the reflection of the}} AN/PVS-4 objective lens using an active infrared night vision device. The IR device needed to detect the AN/PVS-4 required a straight-on unobstructed view, and AN/PVS-4 detection only occurred using an <b>active</b> <b>device</b> (as opposed to passive). The IR light emitted from the enemy's <b>active</b> <b>device</b> would be clearly observable to a anyone employing an AN/PVS-4, making the enemies position easily known.|$|R
25|$|Different {{power supply}} types result in many {{different}} methods of bias. Bias is a technique by which <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class-A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide {{both positive and negative}} voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class-C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.|$|E
25|$|IC design can {{be divided}} into the broad {{categories}} of digital and analog IC design. Digital IC design is to produce components such as microprocessors, FPGAs, memories (RAM, ROM, and flash) and digital ASICs. Digital design focuses on logical correctness, maximizing circuit density, and placing circuits so that clock and timing signals are routed efficiently. Analog IC design also has specializations in power IC design and RF IC design. Analog IC design is used in the design of op-amps, linear regulators, phase locked loops, oscillators and active filters. Analog design is more concerned with the physics of the semiconductor devices such as gain, matching, power dissipation, and resistance. Fidelity of analog signal amplification and filtering is usually critical and as a result, analog ICs use larger area <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> than digital designs and are usually less dense in circuitry.|$|E

50|$|Resonant-cavity-enhanced photo {{detectors}} (or, RCE photo detectors) enable {{improved performance}} over their predecessors {{by placing the}} <b>active</b> <b>device</b> structure inside a Fabry-Pérot resonant cavity. Though the <b>active</b> <b>device</b> structure of the RCE detectors remains close to other conventional photodetectors, {{the effect of the}} optical cavity, which allows wavelength selectivity and an enhancement of the optical field due to resonance, allows the photo detectors to be made thinner and therefore faster, while simultaneously increasing the quantum efficiency at the resonant wavelengths.|$|R
40|$|High speed TSV signals can {{penetrate}} {{through the}} dielectric liner material, transfer in the silicon substrate and degrade {{the performance of}} FEOL devices. In this paper we investigate TSV noise coupling to <b>active</b> <b>device</b> including both FinFET and planar transistors. Calibrated TCAD models are used to perform time domain analysis and understand the mechanisms of substrate noise interaction with <b>active</b> <b>device.</b> Parametric simulations are performed {{in order to understand}} the tradeoffs among different design parameters. The results demonstrate superior substrate noise immunity of FinFETs over equivalent planar transistors. In addition we show that a scaled TSV diameter, a novel TSV architecture with thick polymer liner, placing the substrate contact closer to <b>active</b> <b>device</b> and a TSV guard ring helps to mitigate the TSV noise. Finally the importance of electromagnetic coupling effects on Keep Out Zone (KOZ) extraction is illustrated...|$|R
40|$|High {{frequency}} class F and inverse class F {{power amplifiers}} obtain high efficiency of dc to ac power conversion, {{by reducing the}} overlap of voltage and current waveforms at {{the output of the}} <b>active</b> <b>device,</b> to ensure that the power dissipated in the resistance Ron of the <b>active</b> <b>device</b> is minimised. In this paper the <b>active</b> <b>device</b> is modelled as a switch in series with resistance Ron 0 to 5 Ω. For ideal switch voltage / current waveforms and equal dc input power for both amplifiers the efficiency of power conversion is compared. To confirm the predicted results ideal lossless load harmonic networks using lumped elements were designed to meet all frequency conditions of the two amplifiers. These networks were done used in Advanced Design System (ADS) software for Ron= 0, 2 and 4 Ω. The predicted efficiency for 2 Ω and 4 Ω were 80...|$|R

2500|$|It is {{the slope}} of the line (chord) from the origin through the point on the curve. [...] Static {{resistance}} determines the power dissipation in an electrical component. [...] Points on the IV curve located in the 2nd or 4th quadrants, for which {{the slope of}} the chordal line is negative, have negative static resistance. [...] Passive devices, which have no source of energy, cannot have negative static resistance. [...] However <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> such as transistors or op-amps can synthesize negative static resistance with feedback, and it is used in some circuits such as gyrators.|$|E

For an oscillator employing a bipolar transistor, the emitter {{is connected to}} a series resonant capacitor-crystal network and the base is connected to an L-C tank circuit with the transistor being operated in the roll-off region of its gain versus frequency curve.

The M1 and M3 infrared night sighting devices, {{also known as the}} [...] "sniperscope" [...] or [...] "snooperscope", were introduced by the US Army in World War II, and also used in the Korean War, to assist snipers. These were <b>active</b> <b>devices,</b> using a large infrared light source to illuminate targets. Their image intensifier tubes used an anode and an S-1 photocathode, made primarily of silver, cesium, and oxygen, and electrostatic inversion with electron acceleration was used to achieve gain.|$|E
2500|$|Analog meters {{can measure}} {{voltage and current}} by using power from the test circuit, but require a {{supplementary}} internal voltage source for resistance testing, while electronic meters always require an internal power supply to run their internal circuitry. [...] Hand-held meters use batteries, while bench meters usually use mains power; either arrangement allows the meter to test devices. Testing often requires that the component under test be isolated from the circuit {{in which they are}} mounted, as otherwise stray or leakage current paths may distort measurements. [...] In some cases, the voltage from the multimeter may turn <b>active</b> <b>devices</b> on, distorting a measurement, or in extreme cases even damage an element in the circuit being investigated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{focus of}} {{preventive}} measures {{to date has}} been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness [...] of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. <b>Active</b> <b>devices</b> move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.|$|E
