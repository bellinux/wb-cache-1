40|$|Seed priming is a {{physiological}} seed enhancement method. Hydro- or osmotic priming can <b>advance</b> <b>germination</b> under adequate moisture conditions. During direct seeding on well-drained paddy and upland fields, rice seeds occasionally encounter low soil moisture conditions. Under these conditions, rice seeds need to undergo rapid germination and se cure emergence through improved {{water absorption capacity}} and seed bioactive. This study aims to clarify the effects of seed hydropriming on germination and seedling vigor in rice under different soil moisture conditions. The study em ployed three hydration conditions such as priming, soaking, and control. The seeds to be primed and soaked were sub merged in tap water at 30 ℃ for 12 h. For priming, the seeds were subsequently dried to attain their initial seed weight, but the seeds for soaking were not dried before sowing, and the control seeds were untreated. In addition, different soil moisture conditions, such as 3 %, 6 %, 8 %, 11 %, 15 %, and 20 %, were set. Therefore, emergence time shortened with seed priming at 3 % - 11 % soil moisture contents. In particular, at 8 % soil moisture content, priming and soaking de creased emergence time by 26. 8 h and 21. 7 h, respectively {{compared with that of}} the control. At 8 % - 15 % soil moisture contents, shoot elongation rate obtained with the priming seeds increased > 1. 2 times compared with that obtained with the control and soaking seeds. At > 8 % soil moisture content, shoot dry weight obtained with the priming seeds in creased > 1. 3 times compared with that obtained with the soaking seeds. Furthermore, at declining soil moisture condi tions, the increase in root dry weight is promoted by seed priming compared with that in the control seeds. These results suggest that increased root growth affects plant water absorption under low soil moisture conditions due to priming. This study demonstrates that seed priming facilitates rapid emergence and seedling vigor, unless extremely dry or flooded soil moisture conditions are present at seeding. </p...|$|E
40|$|Araucaria angustifolia {{seeds are}} recalcitrant, and their {{metabolism}} remains high during storage. This research aimed {{to describe the}} initiation of germination in A. angustifolia seeds during storage in order to standardize the assessment of physiological quality and to promote seed conservation. Seeds were collected from two populations and stored for 270 days in the natural laboratory environment and cold chamber. Seeds were classified according to four early developmental stages: I - mature seeds; II - seeds with elongation along the embryonic axis; III - beginning of root protrusion; IV - <b>advanced</b> <b>germination</b> stage, with seedling shoots. After categorization, physical and physiological quality was assessed. In freshly collected seeds, only category I was observed. At 270 days, approximately 40 % of seeds were in category III in laboratory conditions, while the maintenance in a cold chamber delayed germinative metabolism. Viability tests showed that seeds in categories III and IV were more susceptible to damage caused by storage. In conclusion, the percentage of viable A. angustifolia seeds depends on the development stage after collection. Seeds that have reached early developmental category III should be prioritized for propagation, while those remaining in categories I and II should be longer stored with periodic assessment for reduction in physiological quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of wheat (Triticum aestivum) seed osmo-priming for post-germinative osmo-stress resistance was evaluated. Further, for comparative evaluation of seed osmo-priming and plant stress-acclimation, {{a set of}} plants was stress-acclimated prior to osmo-stress treatment. Under osmo-stress at the post-germination stage, plants from osmo-primed seeds produced 2. 3 % higher root biomass, 21. 6 % longer roots, accumulated 15. 1 % higher soluble sugar content and respectively, 10. 4 and 12. 8 % higher activity of SOD and POD in the roots compared with plants from unprimed seeds. At the post-seedling establishment stage, seed-osmo-primed plants produced 29. 9 % higher root biomass, 15. 2 % longer roots, accumulated 32. 7 % higher soluble sugar content and 31. 2 % higher proline content in the roots, while the activity of SOD and POD was respectively, 19. 6 and 13. 1 % higher than the unprimed plants. Plant stress-acclimation induced osmo-stress tolerance was exemplified by 6. 9 % higher root biomass, 4. 6 % longer roots, 52. 7 % higher soluble sugar content in roots, 23. 9 % higher proline content in the roots and 27. 0 % higher activity of SOD in the roots under osmo-stress {{when compared with the}} unprimed plants. The data of seedling morphology and physiological activity under control conditions showed adverse effects of stress acclimation whereas seed osmo-priming-induced stress resistance resulted in <b>advanced</b> <b>germination</b> and higher osmolyte accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} upslope {{shifts in}} subalpine tree ranges with warming requires understanding how future forest populations {{will be affected}} by climate change, as these are the seed sources for new tree line and alpine populations. Early life history stages are particularly sensitive to climate and are also influenced by genetic variation among populations. We tested the climate sensitivity of germination and initial development for two widely distributed subalpine conifers, using controlled-environment growth chambers with one temperature regime from subalpine forest in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and one 5 °C warmer, and two soil moisture levels. We tracked germination rate and timing, rate of seedling development, and seedling morphology for two seed provenances separated by ~ 300 m elevation. Warming <b>advanced</b> <b>germination</b> timing and initial seedling development by a total of ~ 2 weeks, advances comparable to mean differences between provenances. Advances were similar for both provenances and species; however, warming reduced the overall germination rate, as did low soil moisture, only for Picea engelmannii. A three-year field warming and watering experiment planted with the same species and provenances yielded responses qualitatively consistent with the lab trials. Together these experiments indicate that in a warmer, drier climate, P. engelmannii germination, and thus regeneration, could decline, which could lead to declining subalpine forest populations, while Pinus flexilis forest populations could remain robust as a seed source for upslope range shifts...|$|R
40|$|Póster presentado en the XIV MEDECOS & XIII AEET meeting, Seville, Spain, 31 st January - 4 th February 2017 Natural tree populations consist on {{individuals}} that exhibit intra- and inter-specific variation at different geographic scales, {{as a result}} of the balance between gene flow and selection. The extent and magnitude of such variation will influence the adaptive capacity of trees under forthcoming changing environmental conditions. Scots pine in Scotland is the iconic species of the remnant Caledonian forest and appear in a relatively narrow geographic area with a steep East-West environmental gradient, increasing in rainfall and temperature. We hypothesised that western populations could be better adapted to warmer conditions and, as a consequence, could perform differently to predicted increased temperature. We performed an experiment under strictly-controlled conditions with a nested hierarchical design including region (East vs. West), population and families. We used two temperature scenarios, current temperature and increased temperature, and analysed germination and growth of above and below-ground traits. The largest amount of variation occurred at the family level. Nevertheless, regional and population differences were detected, where eastern populations invested more in roots and western populations had a greater number of stomata rows and thicker roots. In addition, increased temperature had strong effects on early growth similar in the two regions, with <b>advanced</b> <b>germination,</b> enhanced growth and biomass about 10 times, but it was not accompanied by shifts in biomass partitioning. Despite the intra-specific variation found in Scots pine populations, our results reveal consistent effects of increased temperature on growth and germination. N...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} effects of irradiances of 920 and 1200 mW m− 2 (weighted irradiance) on the conidia and germinants of the entomopathogenic Hyphomycete Metarhizium anisopliae. The conidia {{were exposed to the}} two irradiances for 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 or 8 h. Increased {{exposure}} decreased relative percent culturability. The inactivation provoked by the irradiance of 1200 mW m− 2 was higher than for the 920 mW m− 2, with a reduction in the 50 % lethal time (LT 50) from 6 h 40 min to 4 h 26 min. Reciprocity was not observed when conidia in water suspension and germinants in different stages of the germinative process were exposed to a 17. 3 kJ m− 2 total dose at both irradiance levels. Although nonreciprocity was observed in all situations, its magnitude varied as a function of metabolic state and/or cell-cycle phase in which the conidia were at the exposure time. The least difference between {{the effects of}} the two irradiance levels was observed when nongerminating conidia in suspension were exposed, and the greatest was observed when conidia were exposed during an <b>advanced</b> <b>germination</b> phase. Doses of 6. 6 and 17. 3 kJ m− 2 supplied through the two irradiance levels delayed the germination of the surviving conidia. At both doses, delay was greater during exposure to the higher irradiance. Nonreciprocity was higher for the 17. 3 kJ m− 2 dose. Nonreciprocity magnitude, in addition to depending on the conidial physiological state, also depended on dose. The results demonstrate the importance of evaluating the impact of the increase in irradiance during the different stages of the fungal life cycle, especially during the stages which are more sensitive to UV, and not simply in dormant conidia...|$|R
40|$|On-farm {{seed priming}} of maize (i. e. soaking seed in water overnight, 17 h) in the {{semi-arid}} tropics {{has been shown}} to improve crop establishment and yield but the benefits can be variable. In previous work, this variation was thought to result from the interaction between primed seeds and conditions in the seedbed following sowing. To investigate this interaction, experiments were carried out under controlled temperature conditions that represented those of seedbeds in the semi-arid tropics. The conditions during seed priming and during subsequent germination and emergence were investigated as potential causes of variable seedling emergence relative to that of untreated seeds. Priming advanced emergence from moist sand cores at 30 degreesC/ 20 degreesC (day/night), reduced emergence at 35 degreesC/ 28 degreesC and delayed and reduced emergence at 40 degreesC/ 28 degreesC. In drier cores (drained 8 days) at 35 degreesC/ 28 degreesC, priming <b>advanced</b> <b>germination</b> time and did not decrease final percentage emergence. These results confirmed earlier field observations that the effect of priming in maize can vary and lead to positive, neutral or negative effects. Priming decreased the optimum and ceiling temperatures for germination, and unlike untreated seeds, the relationship between germination rate and sub-optimal temperature was not linear in all cases. Pre-humidifying seeds did not enhance the effect of priming, but aerating the soak water did. These results indicate that variable results from priming recorded in the field were not due to imbibitional damage, but may result from the negative effects of hypoxia during soaking exacerbated by moist conditions and high temperatures at sowing. These effects differed between seedlots of different cultivars, indicating the importance of selecting more tolerant maize hybrids to reduce variation in response to priming following sowing in the field. The implications of these findings for the use of primed seeds in the field are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Factors {{controlling}} {{the establishment and}} removal of secondary dormancy in Chenopodium bonus-henricus L. seeds were investigated. Unchilled seeds required light for germination. A moist-chilling treatment at 4 C for 28 to 30 days removed this primary dormancy. Chilled seeds now germinated in the dark. When chilled seeds were held in the dark in − 8. 6 bars polyethylene glycol 6000 solution at 15 C or in water at 29 C a secondary dormancy was induced which increased progressively with time as determined by subsequent germination. These seeds now failed to germinate under the condition (darkness) which previously allowed their germination. Continuous light or daily brief red light irradiations during prolonged imbibition in polyethylene glycol solution at 15 C or in water at 29 C prevented {{the establishment of the}} secondary dormancy and caused an advancement of subsequent germination. Far red irradiations immediately following red irradiation reestablished the secondary dormancy indicating phytochrome participation in “pregerminative” processes. The growth regulator combination, kinetin + ethephon + gibberellin A 4 +A 7 (GA 4 + 7), and to a relatively lesser extent GA 4 + 7, was effective in preventing the establishment of the secondary dormancy and in <b>advancing</b> the <b>germination</b> or emergence time. Following the establishment of the secondary dormancy by osmotic or high temperature treatments the regulator combination was relatively more active than light or GA 4 + 7 in removing the dormancy. Prolonged dark treatment at 29 C seemed to induce changes that were partially independent of light or GA 4 + 7 control. The data presented here indicate that changes during germination preventing dark treatment determine whether the seed will germinate, show an advancement effect, or will become secondarily dormant. These changes appear to be modulated by light and hormones...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of field, field enclosure, and germination chamber studies {{was used to}} evaluate the effects of methiocarb [3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -(methylthio) phenol methylcarbamate] and thiram (tetramethylthiuram disulfide) repellent seed treatments on early corn performance. The thiram treatments used (0. 08, 0. 4, 0. 8, 0. 5, 1. 25, and 2. 5 % active ingredient by corn seed weight) had negligible effects on germination/emergence time or on com plant heights. The thiram treatments never reduced stand counts in comparison to controls, but apparently increased stand counts in some trials, particularly under wet conditions. The methiocarb treatments evaluated (0. 5, 1. 25, 2. 5, and 5. 0 % active ingredient by corn seed weight) had only occasional effects on early corn performance. However, certain methiocarb treatments <b>advanced</b> or retarded <b>germination</b> in some trials and increased plant heights in three trials. Methiocarb treatments did not affect corn stand counts in most trials, but increased or reduced stand counts in some.

Crop Science, 31 (3), 822 - 826. Three pre-sowing hydration-dehydration treatments were evaluated for {{their capacity to}} protect or repair wheat seeds stored under two different sets of artificial ageing conditions (accelerated ageing at 1 0 0 % RH, 40 °C or controlled deterioration at 1 5 % SMC, 3 5 ° C). Although similar losses in germination capacity and decreases in radicle emergence rates occurred under both ageing conditions, differences {{with respect to the}} physiology of ageing were highlighted by changes in seedling growth and seed leakage. For example, increases in seed leakage observed during storage at 1 5 % SMC were not found at 100 % RH. Longer hydration treatments (either 24 h at l 5 °C in water or 20 h at 20 °C in - 0. 37 MPa PEG solution, followed by drying) improved the vigour of unaged seeds, but treated material deteriorated rapidly in storage compared to untreated controls. In contrast short hydration treatments (2 h at 25 ° C followed by drying) offered some protection of germinability during subsequent storage but did not affect the vigour of unaged seeds. When seeds were treated after storage, longer hydration periods were effective in producing substantial invigoration of viable deteriorated seeds (measured by evaluating T 50 or seedling growth) compared to little or no improvement by short hydration treatments. These results support earlier suggestions from work on tomato seeds that losses in seed vigour and viability are not necessarily a continuum of the same deteriorative sequence. The mechanisms of protection of germinability by short hydration treatments were not clear. Small decreases in T 50 's of unaged or aged seeds {{as a result of these}} treatments were due to leakage of germination inhibitory substances. However, the rapid germination of unaged and improved responses from aged seeds caused by longer hydration treatments suggested <b>advances</b> in <b>germination</b> processes and repair activity under these conditions. This aspect was pursued in further detail by studying changes in the hydrolytic metabolism of wheat seeds using the 20 h PEG treatment. Although the starchy endosperm of treated seeds showed some indications of protein degradation, there were no changes in proteolytic activity (determined as 'Azocoll' hydrolysing activity at pH 6. 8) as a result of ageing or pre-sowing treatment after storage. However, there were some indications of loss of control over proteolytic activity in seeds subjected to treatment before storage. Severe damage to m embrane permeability in these seeds appears to be a post-mortem event as this was only found in samples showing drastic losses in seed germinability. Pre-sowing treatment caused a buildup of germinative a-amylase activity in unaged but not in aged seeds, although both showed similar radicle emergence rates. Quick resumption of a-amylase production during subsequent imbibition by treated seeds, irrespective of ageing, suggests that components involved in de novo enzyme synthesis are tolerant to desiccation in wheat seeds. Increased a-amylase activity in treated seeds or its m aintenance during subsequent storage, surprisingly did not cause damage to stored starch. There was no relationship between increased a-amylase activity and early radicle emergence. The ageing-induced delay in germinative a-amylase production appeared to be due to delayed gibberellin synthesis by the aged embryo. Pre-sowing treatment of seeds after storage effectively decreased the lag period for enzyme production in deteriorated seeds. Ageing effects on aleurone were characterised by investigating changes in the responsiveness of embryoless half seeds to gibberellic acid with respect to a-amylase production in vitro. Ageing of seeds caused a significant reduction in aleurone enzyme production. These changes were at least in part, reversed by pre-sowing treatment of aged seeds.
