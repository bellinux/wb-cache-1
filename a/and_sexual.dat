5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of contemporary research publications acknowledge the influence of religion <b>and</b> culture on <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive behavior and health-care utilization.

This review reveals that knowledge about devout Muslims' own experience of <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health-care matters is limited, thus providing weak evidence for modeling of efficient practical guidelines for <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health care directed at Muslim patients. Successful outcomes in <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health of Muslims require both researchers and practitioners to acknowledge religious heterogeneity and variability, and individuals' possibilities to negotiate Islamic edicts. Failure to do so could lead to inadequate health-care provision and, in the worst case, to suboptimal encounters between migrants with Muslim background and the health-care providers in the receiving country...|$|R

According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at {{a moment in time}} before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to set out the conceptual linkage between <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproduction health promotion for human capital development. It provides a two-stage conceptual framework which shows the linkage between adolescent <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health promotion and human capital development. The paper is a critical review of the concepts of adolescent <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health and its implication for human capital development. It reviews the conceptual framework of Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on factors that promote adolescent <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health; and constructs a framework that presents mechanisms through which socioeconomic development is achieved through improved human capital development. The analysis in this paper apparently indicates that <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health promotion is fundamental to the development of human capital. The inextricable link between <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health promotion and development of human capital is shown in the conceptual frameworks. First, individual, social and environmental factors lead to the promotion of <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health. Second, investments that promote adolescent <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health improve human capital by contributing to knowledge, skills, health, self-esteem and moral values. The paper advocates that sustainable investments that promote <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive health improve human capital development in the long run...|$|R
