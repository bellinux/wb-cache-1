In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted <b>a</b> <b>parliamentary</b> annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that <b>a</b> <b>parliamentary</b> grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E

5|$|In 1837 Euston {{railway station}} opened, the first railway station {{connecting}} London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by <b>a</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> commission from operating in London itself, {{and thus the}} station was built on {{what was then the}} northern boundary of the city. Other main line termini north of London soon followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were built outside the built-up area of the city, making them inconvenient to reach. Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had proposed the idea of an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant London main line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 to promote the scheme he commissioned the first ever traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City of London, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 travelled in private carriages. <b>A</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes.|$|E
