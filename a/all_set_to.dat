The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E

Micky, having warmed to Arabella, and moved by Paige's story of her accident, not to mention fear of his getting hurt too when Rudi returns, offers to take Arabella home in Rudi's favourite car, thereby setting Paige free. Justin gives Paige some money to get on her way, but by now he wants an escape from his own life. He persuades Paige to take him with her. They leave together, and the play ends just as Rudi's gangsters are trying to force their way through the door to a surprised Derek and Dee.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1990s, popular hosts Ed Coleman and Dave Sims {{had their}} show cancelled.

The show seemed <b>all</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> go when, {{at the last}} minute, Berman decided {{to back out of}} the show. He cited {{that he would have to}} work a near 14-hour day, combining his 10 a.m. start on radio with his WNBC-TV duties, which consisted of him appearing on all three of the station's evening newscasts. WFAN would not let Berman out of his contract, and as a result, the slot was split into two shows: Lupica hosted from 10 a.m. to noon, while Berman hosted from noon to 2 p.m. The split format did not work, and eventually Berman's show would be cancelled and Lupica's show soon followed.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Sigismund saw {{his enemies}} {{expanding}} {{in almost every}} direction. The Ottoman Empire in the east, Italian republics in south, the Hussite threat in north. However, the pact with Albert II of Germany {{that was supposed to}} marry Elisabeth of Bohemia, the daughter and heiress of Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg, and the pact with the Clan of Ostoja was protecting north side of the Kingdom. And through marriage between Katarina of Beckov and the Duke Przemyslaw of the Piast dynasty, the Kingdom could count on more support in the battle against Hussite side. It was <b>all</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> form powerful coalition. As Albert II would be the successor on the Hungarian throne and the Clan of Ostoja would hold the position in Upper Hungary and south of Poland together with the Piast dynasty, the focus could then be to stop Ottoman Empire to expand more in west direction.|$|E

The same year jam band Phish made their own overt case against the president, sung as a letter to the first lady. Originally titled [...] "Memo to Ronnie Reagan", the song [...] "Dear Mrs. Reagan" [...] mimics Bob Dylan's protest music of the 1960s but rails against Mrs. Reagan's Just Say No anti-drug campaign. The band continued to perform it until Reagan left office in January 1989.|$|E

Salim-Suleiman have done a wonderful job as composers and have brought out the essence of the movie in a remarkable way. Irfan has come out with great lyrics and every singer has given his or her best shot". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama described the album as [...] "a winner all the way", and said, [...] "Madhur Bhandarkar films haven't been known for their music, even though the albums of Corporate and Page 3 still saw some sales on the stands.

It premiered on February 4, 2014 by Vice's electronic music channel Thump, who advertised it as [...] "a really good video. It's got zombies. It's got a funny exorcist. It's got old people looking like they're about to poop their Depends. People (and things) fly through the air. It's neat, and it's <b>all</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> an extremely catchy beat."

500|$|Zinta next {{acted in}} two Telugu films, Premante Idera (1998), {{opposite}} Venkatesh; and Raja Kumarudu (1999), opposite Mahesh Babu. She followed with {{the leading role}} alongside Akshay Kumar in Sangharsh, a thriller directed by Tanuja Chandra and written by Mahesh Bhatt. Zinta portrayed the character of Reet Oberoi, a CBI officer {{who falls in love}} with a captured killer played by Kumar. Having been impressed with Zinta's work in Dil Se, Chandra approached her for the part after several leading actresses had refused the offer, which Zinta viewed as an opportunity to expand her range. Sangharsh was not a box office success, although Zinta's performance received favourable comments by critics. An article published by The Tribune upon the film's release described her performance as [...] "an amazing act" [...] in an [...] "intense film", documenting her career path thus far with the observation, [...] "She wowed the audiences with her cameo in Dil Se, then she zapped the viewers with her sensuality in Soldier and now Preity Zinta is <b>all</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> shock everybody with her stark performance [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Homer and {{the others}} are placed on a nuclear {{submarine}}. When the captain goes to check on a problem in the torpedo hatch, Homer is left in charge. An enemy submarine approaches, and Homer gives the order to fire a torpedo. However, the captain is in the torpedo tube and is fired at the other submarine. The other sub fires back at them and Homer gives the order to retreat. The submarine ends up in Russian waters and is seen by the United States government as an attempt to defect. This event creates a political schism between the USA and Russia, leading to the revelation that the Soviet Union in fact never truly dissolved. Out of nowhere the Berlin Wall rises from the ground, Soviet troops and tanks take their positions and Vladimir Lenin rises from Lenin's tomb in Moscow à la Frankenstein's Monster [...] "to crush capitalism", <b>all</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> Alexander Borodin's 'Boyar chorus' from Prince Igor. Nuclear war is anticipated until the US Navy drops depth charges on Homer's sub, aiming either to destroy it or force it to surface. The consequent explosion causes a pinhole leak in the submarine's hull. Homer uses Bart's earring to plug the leak and saves the submarine.|$|E

500|$|One day, {{the protagonists}} {{seek out a}} dervish known as a great philosopher of the land. Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish {{responds}} by asking rhetorically why Pangloss {{is concerned about the}} existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a Turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them [...] "free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty."

500|$|The filmmakers made {{extensive}} use of macro photography. Production designer Shepherd Frankel said, [...] "It's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant-Man's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective. But we wanted a realistic realization, not Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with its oversized set pieces." [...] Rebecca Baehler served {{as the director of}} macro photography, taking cues from Carpenter. Carpenter said vibration became [...] "a tremendous problem" [...] when moving the camera during the macro photography because [...] "one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an ant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a football field!" [...] The solution required the filmmakers to search for a creative solution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial [...] "tabletop" [...] photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in the macro world, a Centroid facial capture set up was used, with a five-camera array of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, [...] "One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, <b>all</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [...] Paul's performance." [...] Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing [...] "facial expressions that would later be composited on a CG Ant-Man." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{definition}} of the cardinality of a set as the equivalence class of <b>all</b> <b>sets</b> equinumerous <b>to</b> it is problematic in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, the standard form of axiomatic set theory, because the equivalence class of a non-empty set is too large to be a set: it is a proper class. Within the framework of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory relations are by definition restricted <b>to</b> <b>sets</b> (a binary relation on a set A is {{a subset of the}} Cartesian product A × A), and there is no <b>set</b> of <b>all</b> <b>sets</b> in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, instead of defining the cardinality of a set as the equivalence class of <b>all</b> <b>sets</b> equinumerous <b>to</b> it one tries to assign a representative <b>set</b> <b>to</b> each equivalence class (cardinal assignment). In some other systems of axiomatic set theory, e.g. Von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory and Morse-Kelley set theory, relations are extended to classes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{notation}} V is not {{a tribute}} to the name of von Neumann.

Peano's notation V was adopted also by Whitehead and Russell for the class of <b>all</b> <b>sets</b> in 1910. The V notation (for the class of <b>all</b> <b>sets)</b> was not used by von Neumann in his 1920s papers about ordinal numbers and transfinite induction. Paul Cohen explicitly attributes his use of the letter V (for the class of <b>all</b> <b>sets)</b> <b>to</b> a 1940 paper by Gödel, although Gödel most likely obtained the notation from earlier sources such as Whitehead and Russell.|$|R
