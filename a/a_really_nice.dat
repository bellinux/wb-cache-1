5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, {{he thought she was}} <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

And she's a legend, and it's an awesome {{opportunity}} to work with someone like Madonna who's literally shaped the careers of so many artists that I've wanted to work with and that I look up to. She's the queen!.|$|E

5000|$|Adam Tyner, {{writing for}} DVD Talk, said [...] "It's kind of {{interesting}} seeing some of the familiar faces in the cast, and Night of the Scarecrow does trot out <b>a</b> few <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> looking setpieces, but none of that's enough to salvage this limp, lifeless, uninspired, instantly forgettable slasher flick. Skip It." ...|$|R

500|$|Hetrick {{thought that}} if she {{returned}} to DS9 as Vash, then something could be built around the Vash-Quark relationship: [...] "That would be <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> pairing, because you have these two different backgrounds but they're both after the same thing." [...] Towards {{the end of the}} , the producers inquired about Hetrick's availability. The actress was ready to appear on another DS9 episode, but the writers changed direction and there were no further plans for the Vash character. [...] "Q-Less" [...] was the final Star Trek appearance for Hetrick, and the only appearance in DS9 for John de Lancie.|$|E
500|$|Over 2014, Maroon 5 {{continued}} their collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Max Martin {{and others to}} release their fifth studio album, entitled V. Levine acknowledged that they followed the same song-writing process that they tried with Overexposed, saying: [...] "We developed <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> system on the last record — we found songs we were passionate about, developed them and put our stamp on them [...] this time we kept it going but looked for different types of songs." [...] Five singles were released from it. In support of the album, the band undertook the Maroon 5 World Tour 2015, which kicked off with a show in Dallas in February 2015.|$|E
500|$|He {{was made}} club captain {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season, and {{continued}} to play regularly during {{the early months of}} the new campaign. He opened his goalscoring account courtesy of free-kick in a 3–3 home draw against Stockport County in October 2012. Shortly after, Nutter admitted that his family struggled relocating to Lincolnshire, and a move down south was a much more suitable location given his personal circumstances. He scored three times in 66 appearances for Lincoln. On his time at Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "Lincoln is <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> friendly club with very patient and loyal supporters. But with my personal circumstances, {{it was time to move}} on – I wish them well".|$|E

500|$|The {{first issue}} was {{released}} November 26, 2002, with a January 2003 cover date. It premiered with five series: Dragon Ball Z, Sand Land, Yu-Gi-Oh!, YuYu Hakusho, and One Piece. With {{the launch of}} the magazine considered successful, Thompson was offered an opportunity to intern in Japan with Shueisha's editors, but declined, {{due to a lack of}} interest in the management aspects of the business and a desire to work on his own projects. After six issues had been released, Thompson desired to work on authoring and illustrating his own comic The Stiff. Reflecting back later, he states in an interview with The Comics Journal that [...] "I basically told Viz that I wanted to work part time or I'd quit. It probably wasn't <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> thing to do." [...] He eventually stepped down as editor-in-chief, being replaced by his former boss Yumi Hoashi.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of Back to the Future was {{finished}} in February 1981 and presented to Columbia, who put the film in turnaround. [...] "They thought it was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> cute, warm film, but not sexual enough," [...] Gale said. [...] "They suggested that we take it to Disney, but we decided {{to see if any}} other of the major studios wanted a piece of us." [...] Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light. Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney. [...] "They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner," [...] Gale said.|$|E
500|$|The {{score was}} {{composed}} and conducted by John Williams and orchestrated by John Neufeld, with vocals by Deborah Dietrich. Williams normally enters Spielberg productions {{at an early}} stage, well before the movie starts shooting. For Minority Report however, his entry was delayed due to his work on , and he joined the film when it was nearly completed, leaving him scant production time. The soundtrack takes inspiration from Bernard Herrmann's work. Williams decided not {{to focus on the}} science fiction elements, and made a score suitable for film noir. He included traditional noir elements such as a female singer in the Anne Lively scenes, but the [...] "sentimental scenes", which Williams considered unusual for that genre, led to soothing themes for Anderton's ex-wife Lara and son Sean. The track [...] "Sean's Theme" [...] is described as the only one [...] "instantly recognizable as one of Williams'" [...] by music critic Andrew Granade. Spielberg typified it as [...] "a black and white score" [...] and said, [...] "I think Johnny Williams does <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> bit of homage to Benny Herrmann." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the words}} of one account, [...] "Most of the time she drew what looked like the short straw, playing the [...] "good girl" [...] in films that revelled in the {{exploits}} of her wicked opposite number, and it says much for her talent and charisma {{that she was able to}} hold attention in what must have seemed thankless parts - she herself acknowledged that [...] "I do think it is much more difficult to establish <b>a</b> <b>really</b> charming, <b>nice</b> person than a wicked one - and make it real"." ...|$|R
500|$|Before {{the second}} season was announced, Fazekas said that [...] "We've {{certainly}} been talking about what a second season would look like...what's great about the structure of this show is, you can tell so many different stories and go so many different directions." [...] Thus, Butters said of the first season storyline featuring Leviathan, [...] "we wrapped up that story" [...] already, with Toby Jones' cameo as Arnim Zola in the first season finale just [...] "a fun tie-in" [...] rather than {{something that would be}} followed up on in {{the second season}}. Series creators Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely revealed they [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> story about who Peggy is and where she came from" [...] that did not make it into the first season, but they hoped could be explored in a second, while Fazekas and Butters also revealed {{that there had been a}} story about Carter having [...] "a night out with the girls" [...] to explore her personal life, as well as more material for the character Angie, that they felt would both be easier to tell in a second season.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{described}} the episode as [...] "a great end to {{what may have}} been my favorite season of The Office to date." [...] He said the episode included great laughs and sublime dramatic moments, including Michael's moment with Holly after the sketch and the silent moment in which Jim learns Pam is pregnant. Sepinwall said Jim's moment of composing himself in the hallway after calling Dwight in that scene was, [...] "Maybe Krasinski's single best moment on the series to date." [...] Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said she had [...] "some mixed feelings" [...] about the episode and wished it had more from Ryan, Creed and Kelly, but she especially praised the ending scene with Jim and Pam, which she said she did not expect. Dan Hooper of VH1's Best Week Ever said, [...] "Office finale was awesome, as we expected, capping about seven straight weeks of just top-notch episodes with great character moments, a legitimately interesting plot, and just laugh line after laugh line, reminding us all [...] we spent time talking about this show every week." [...] Hooper also praised NBC for not advertising the twist ending: [...] "They didn’t stupidly dramatize it, and it ended up being <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> really fitting end" [...] to the season.|$|E
500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> way." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] sum up the evolution of their relationship with the line [...] "After all that we've been through, I know we're cool".|$|E
6000|$|... "When I have my {{photograph}} taken," [...] said my uncle, [...] "I {{always like}} to think of the retoucher. I idealise her; I fancy her with the sweetest eyes I have ever seen, and an expression infinitely soft and tender. And she looks closely into my face, and her little pencil goes gently and lovingly over my features. Tickle, tickle. In that way, George, I get <b>a</b> <b>really</b> very <b>nice</b> expression indeed." [...] My uncle turned to his own presentment, and mused pleasantly for a space. Then he looked again at Mrs Harborough as if inadvertently, and asked her name.|$|R

Forest is voiced by Kenji Nomura.|$|R
500|$|In 2008, Beckinsale {{appeared}} in Winged Creatures, {{a film about}} how six different witnesses cope with {{the aftermath of a}} shooting. Beckinsale played a waitressing single mother in an ensemble cast which included Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, and Forest Whitaker. [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>really,</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> experience but it was quick," [...] said Beckinsale of the filming process. [...] "I just felt a bit like I was shot through a cannon." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she played the role [...] "with a white trash verve" [...] and found her character's [...] "raw ache for that someone with money and respectability is palpable." [...] However, Dargis felt that Beckinsale and her cast mates have a [...] "tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just clichés." [...] The film received a very limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles; it was released simultaneously on DVD.|$|R
500|$|In April2011, it was {{reported}} that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E
500|$|In another interview, Ehrich {{expressed}} more of {{his opinions}} on the storyline, stating: [...] "It’s so relevant now and it’s such an epidemic. Just {{for it to be}} out there to show that it happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and I know many friends who have. Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." [...] Of the character's [...] "dark side", Ehrich stated: [...] "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both players {{said that}} the trouble was not {{something}} they had witnessed before; and Economidis condemned his supporters, saying that, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> atmosphere until this moment. I am really unhappy." [...] Some witnesses have implicated Cypriot and Serbian supporters in the trouble.|$|E
50|$|West Germany, 1988. Yasemin and Jan are in {{the same}} judo club. Yasemin is a modern young Turkish woman. Jan is an old-fashioned womaniser. When his friends bet he cannot have Yasemin he sees this as a welcome challenge. He plays his best tricks on Yasemin who {{eventually}} takes to him because she is led to believe he was no macho but <b>a</b> <b>really</b> modern <b>nice</b> guy. That way she does play his heartstrings. He feels ashamed to have approached her just to impress his friends. Unfortunately this truth is eventually disclosed to her, and when it is, he is dismayed by the harm he has done. However, since this is a classic romantic movie, a happy end is inevitable after all.|$|R

60|$|Madison was {{foremost}} in the field, of course. Madison was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> fellow, and quite deserved all Mrs. Hill's encomiums. He was good-looking and well groomed--could {{sing and dance}} divinely and play the violin to perfection. The other M.P.s were all jealous of him, and more so than ever when Violet Thayer came.

2500|$|Guthrie {{received}} religious {{training for}} his bar mitzvah from Rabbi Meir Kahane, {{who would go}} on to form the Jewish Defense League. [...] "Rabbi Kahane was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> patient teacher," [...] Guthrie later recalled, [...] "but shortly after he started giving me my lessons, he started going haywire. Maybe I was responsible." [...] Guthrie converted to Catholicism in 1977, before embracing interfaith beliefs later in his life.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Vincent {{spent some}} time in a {{domestic}} abuse shelter in Haringey and worked as a cleaner in a budget hotel. During this period, she became estranged from her family. A source involved in the investigation said: [...] "She detached herself from her family but there was no bust up. They are <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> family. We understand she was in a relationship and there was a history of domestic violence." [...] It has been speculated that she was ashamed to be a victim of domestic abuse or {{did not want to be}} traced by her abuser.|$|E
2500|$|The album closes {{with two}} {{similarly}} sounding tracks titled [...] "Pain on Pain" [...] and [...] "Dove Grey Sands". Grant stated {{he wanted the}} album to end so the listener wanted the album to last longer, but also leave the listener with the feeling that [...] "you have been on <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> journey" [...] and that it [...] "felt like the perfect outro". It also [...] "evolves round the acoustic guitar". [...] "Pain on Pain" [...] {{on the other hand}} was seen as [...] "quite a different track" [...] for the band and [...] "felt very uplifting". The music has no guitars in it but [...] "just a few little odd bits" [...] and was also described by Grant as having [...] "a real sell out vocal".|$|E
50|$|The series starred Don Rickles as U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer Otto Sharkey, an abrasive, sharp-tongued veteran {{in charge}} of a company of new seaman {{recruits}} on a San Diego naval base. Rickles (who in real-life served in the Navy during World War II) is famous for his jokes about various ethnicities, and the program provided him with a vehicle for his politically incorrect humor.

60|$|Thoughts {{something}} in this manner ran through Aaron's subconscious mind as he sat still in the strange house. He could not have fired it all off at any listener, as these pages are fired off at any chance reader. Nevertheless there it was, risen to half consciousness in him. All his life he had hated knowing what he felt. He had wilfully, if not consciously, kept a gulf between his passional soul and his open mind. In his mind was pinned up a nice description of himself, and a description of Lottie, sort of authentic passports {{to be used in}} the conscious world. These authentic passports, self-describing: nose short, mouth normal, etc.; he had insisted that they should do all the duty of the man himself. This ready-made and very banal idea of himself as <b>a</b> <b>really</b> quite <b>nice</b> individual: eyes blue, nose short, mouth normal, chin normal; this he had insisted was really himself.
