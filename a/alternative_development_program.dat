40|$|This paper covers <b>alternative</b> <b>development</b> (AD) <b>programs</b> in Bolivia {{from the}} mid- 1980 s {{to the present}} day. Though the War on Drugs is highly complex, this paper argues that in certain {{situations}} <b>alternative</b> <b>development</b> <b>programs,</b> despite their imperfections, offer a longer-term solution that should be emphasized and coupled with eradication. The major programs implemented by the U. S., the UN and the EU and their impacts are explained in detail. Recommendations for improvement of <b>alternative</b> <b>development</b> <b>programs</b> include: making programs more participatory, having less stringent conditionality requirements, improving upfront planning about crops and markets, and {{increasing the number of}} cooperatives that are able to offer loans to farmers to improve long-term sustainability of programs. The need for government control of an area before AD programs can be effectively implemented and the need to work with the local populations are two of the lessons that can be derived from the Bolivian experience and applied to other locations. <b>Alternative</b> <b>Development</b> in Bolivia “Those of us who defend our coca…have grown it for 3, 000 years.

But sanctions do not only alter people s perception of risks and costs; they also affect how people view their state and its legitimacy, unleashing a series of non-economic factors that determine compliance with the law. In fact, when a sanction is perceived as unjust it may be inefficient in reducing law violations and could crowd-out legality in other aspects of life. Law scholars warn against violating the principle of proportionality by exerting extreme punishment {{in comparison with the}} magnitude of the crime, as it may result in the loss of citizen cooperation with the law. I take one of Colombia s drug-reducing policies, aerial spraying of coca crops and study the effect of its disproportionate use on legal crops. My results point to a non-linear effect of punishment on legality: spraying shocks or extreme spraying in relation to the amount of illegal crops found reduce engagement in legal crops, where as proportional levels of spraying induce legality. I use four different sources of data to test this relationship: macro data on all coca growing municipalities in Colombia, and micro data of three very different sets of farmers, namely coca growers surveyed by the UNODC, farmers that are beneficiaries of Colombia s biggest <b>alternative</b> <b>development</b> <b>Program</b> (Forest Warden Families) and coffee growers in municipalities that have had coca.

Methods: Data sources were summary demographic and risk factor data from the major type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes studies, including ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT, RECORD, PROactive, ADOPT, and BARI 2 D. Patients in these studies spanned a wide spectrum of disease, from drug-naïve to insulin-dependent. Cardiovascular events/major adverse coronary events (CVE/MACE) were primary or safety end points. Overall observed rates for cardiovascular events/MACE were summarized, and the observed annualized event rates were calculated using linear approximation. Simulation studies were then conducted using original (cardiovascular history excluded) and modified (cardiovascular history included) United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) models; the predicted event rates were then compared with the observed event rates for all studies. The consistency of the predicted rates derived from each model was then evaluated using descriptive statistics and linear regression. Results: The original UKPDS model tended to overestimate event rates across studies. The ratio of predicted events versus observed MACE ranged from 0. 9 to 2. 0, with mean of 1. 5 ± 0. 4 and a coefficient of variation of 26 % (R 2 = 0. 80). However, cardiovascular risk predictions were more precise using a modified UKPDS model; the ratio of predicted versus observed MACE events ranged from 1. 8 to 2. 4, with a mean of 2. 1 ± 0. 25 and a coefficient of variation of 13 % (R 2 = 0. 94). Conclusion: A modified UKPDS model which includes adjustments for prior cardiovascular history has the potential for use as a tool for benchmarking and may be useful for predicting cardiovascular rates in clinical studies. This modification could be further evaluated, recalibrated, and validated using patient-level information derived from prospective clinical studies to yield greater predictability.

40|$|At the {{national}} level, drug {{policy is a}} resource allocation problem. Resources are allocated to programs to reduce the demand for, and supply of, illegal drugs. Supply-side programs have traditionally garnered the largest share of the federal drug control budget. In recent years, emphasis within supply-side programs has shifted to efforts to control cocaine at the source—the reduction of coca cultivation and cocaine processing in the Andean countries of Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. Despite the emphasis, no significant reduction in productivity has occurred. This thesis develops a mathematical model of the interactions between government intervention measures and cocaine industry response. The suppression model consists of a static suppression environment and production system sub-model, and a dynamic industry response model that simulates the effects of expansion and fragmentation within the cocaine production system. The suppression environment sub-model relates government resource decisions to production system output. Resources are allocated to <b>alternative</b> <b>development,</b> law enforcement, and eradication programs. The production system sub-model computes realizations of cocaine export quantities. The dynamic model facilitates the long-term resource allocation process by computing industry responses in centers of cultivation and production. The measure of effectiveness is a 10 -year sum of cocaine export quantities. The model is {{used to examine the}} impact on long run system output of various resource allocation schemes under three different scenarios. The scenarios include a steady state scenario, which is also used to examine sensitivity of model output to variations in input parameters. Results indicate a robust preference for enforcement emphasis in the supplier region (Bolivia and Peru) through continued funding of enforcement related programs at high levels and maintenance of moderate levels of <b>alternative</b> <b>development</b> <b>programs.</b> Given that the U.

Whereas AD can only obtain results over the long term, the political push to demonstrate immediate successful results has led to an imbalance in United States anti-drug aid, which is strongly weighted towards aerial fumigation. Despite the short-term success of aerial spraying, the key question of the political, social, and economic sustainability of the results obtained through the use of forceful eradication remains open. AD policies have suffered from changes in their focus over time. Today they are fixated on the idea that the sole purpose of illicit crops is to finance terrorist groups.

The data revealed distinct teaching personalities based on the individual's beliefs and background in the domains of knowledge and sense of mathematics as a field and as a school subject, major beliefs concerning {{the teaching and learning}} of mathematics, perceptions of the teacher and student roles, views on student assessment in mathematics, and other perceived influences on the teaching and learning of mathematics particular to the individual teacher. Findings revealed teachers who are generally under tension from various segments of the population and are torn between trying to satisfy all holding to their own values and beliefs in regard to mathematics teaching and learning. Changes that occurred, self-reported and observed, were most often particular to the teacher and flowed from a relation to a previously-held belief, rather than a change {{in the form of a}} complete turn-around. The study may be helpful as evidence for the need to construct support systems for teachers of mathematics. Time for teachers, not only to reflect on their beliefs, but also to dialogue and be exposed to alternatives, is necessary if current goals in mathematics education are to be personally achievable...|$|R
