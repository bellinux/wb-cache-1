It points to the era way back to 13th−14th century which says about the asylum of a minister and his men from a local kingdom in the bank of river Kaveri of then Cholamandalam - to the king of Calicut (Kozhikkode) - The dispute arose from the decision of local king to marry the clever daughter of the minister who had found out a solution for a challenging problem which was haunting the king for days together. The legend - The challenge was to make a necklace within 41 days, using a bowl of peculiar pearls which was gifted by some foreign traders to the king. Being curved holes inside, many famous brilliant pandits had tried and failed to make a pearl necklace. However the intelligent teenage daughter of the minister could succeed in finding a solution for the challenge and making the necklace with the help of some ants by using a ghee <b>applied</b> <b>thread</b> making it a pearl necklace.Impressed up on the extraordinary intelligence of the girl who made the pearl necklace the ruling king wanted to marry her. But as the king was inferior in caste, the minister and his related families disagreed. The angry king gave ultimatum for accepting the marriage or all vaishyas to leave the kingdom. Due to this the entire vaishya population in the desom consisting of many sections, around 7200 families, had to travel away from chola-desam and were segregated in groups. Some of the groups traveled towards west to Cheranaadu (presently Keralam).|$|E

The normal/superconducting phase boundary T_c(H) of these structures shows a quite different behavior in low and high fields. In the low magnetic field regime fluxoid quantization around each antidot leads to oscillations in T_c(H), expected from the specific sample geometry, and reminiscent of the network behavior.

40|$|Introduction. Inguinal hernia (IH) — one of {{the most}} common {{childhood}} diseases that requires surgical treatment. The main indication for surgical treatment of IH is a risk of its strangulation. Among the methods of laparoscopic herniorrhaphy, PIRS (percutaneous internal ring suturing) is especially promising one. Objective of the study — to analyze our own clinical material of surgical treatment for IH in children using PIRS. Materials and methods. The study included 62 children with IH aged 2 months to 7 years, who were operated in 2012 – 2015 using PIRS method with suturing the internal inguinal ring. Among patients, there were 48 (77. 4 %) boys and 14 (22. 6 %) girls. Right-sided hernia was diagnosed in 45 (72. 6 %) patients, and left-sided one — in 10 (16. 1 %). Bilateral IH before surgery was diagnosed in 7 (11. 3 %) children. For surgical interventions, we have used straight or 30 ° 5 -mm laparoscope. Results and discussion. Among the advantages of laparoscopic techniques, and particularly PIRS method, there is the ability to detect failure of closure of the processus vaginalis with contralateral side. Thus, in 6 (9. 7 %) patients, the expansion of the internal inguinal ring on the opposite side was visualized intraoperatively. Also, the advantage of this method is using a single optical port with the diameter of 3 – 5 mm and no need for laying on intracorporeal suturing. None of operated patients, when <b>applying</b> <b>thread</b> Ethibond* Excel 2 – 0, complained about postoperative discomfort in the area of postoperative node, which was placed subcutaneously in the inguinal area. In the study, IH recurrence was detected in 2 (3. 2 %) boys. These patients also underwent reintervention using the PIRS technique. Conclusions. PIRS — a simple and efficient minimally invasive method for surgical correction of IH, which has a good cosmetic result. The application of laparoscopic method in the treatment of IH in children allows us to carefully examine the internal inguinal rings and, if necessary, to correct defects on both sides. The use of thread Ethibond* Excel 2 – 0 for suturing the inner ring of the inguinal canal is effective and provides optimal functional results. The risk of IH recurrence after surgery by PIRS method is a comparative in terms of risk of relapse after classical method surgery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Thread {{management}} {{is an essential}} functionality in OS kernels. However, verification of thread management remains a challenge, due to two conflicting requirements: on the one hand, a thread manager—operating below the thread abstraction layer–should hide its implementation details and be verified independently from the threads being managed; on the other hand, the thread management code in many real-world systems is concurrent, which might be executed by the threads being managed, so it seems inappropriate to abstract threads away in the verification of thread managers. Previous approaches on kernel verification view thread managers as sequential code, thus cannot be <b>applied</b> to <b>thread</b> management in realistic kernels. In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer framework to verify concurrent thread management. We choose a lower abstraction level than the previous approaches, where we abstract away the context switch routine only, and allow {{the rest of the}} thread management code to run concurrently in the upper level. We also treat thread management data as abstract resources so that threads in the environment can be specified in assertions and be reasoned about in a proof system similar to concurrent separation logic. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{computation}} of {{the tropical}} prevariety {{is the first step}} in the application of polyhedral methods to compute positive dimensional solution sets of polynomial systems. In particular, pretropisms are candidate leading exponents for the power series developments of the solutions.

We present a parallel implementation of dynamic enumeration. Our first distributed memory implementation with forked processes achieved good speedups, but quite often resulted in large variations in the execution times of the processes. The shared memory multithreaded version applies work stealing to reduce the variability of the run time. Our implementation <b>applies</b> the <b>thread</b> safe Parma Polyhedral Library (PPL), in exact arithmetic with the GNU Multiprecision Arithmetic Library (GMP), aided by the fast memory allocations of TCMalloc.
