40|$|During {{their service}} lives, {{asphalts}} in traffic area pavements {{are subjected to}} loadings from the weather and traffic. In jointless asphalt pavements, at low temperatures, so-called cryogenic tensile stresses due to cooling occur. Not taking account of these leads to fundamental errors in the prediction of the conjectured service life. The estimation of the cryogenic tensile stresses in asphalts by mathematical methods presupposes knowledge of the temperature, the modulus of elasticity, the one-dimensional {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and also the tensile viscosity. Within the framework of the research project under discussion, which was assisted by the Federal Ministry of Transport and performed at the Institute of Highway Engineering of the Technical University Braunschweig, it was proved that, using process-controlled testing machines, it is possible to examine the thermo-rheological behaviour of different asphalts by means of tensile retardation and tensile relaxation tests. It was shown that the tensile viscosities and the moduli of elasticity of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concretes,</b> mastic asphalts and stone mastic asphalts are influenced to a high degree by the temperature and the tensile stress. The correlations between the material characteristic quantities referred to and the testing temperature T and the tensile stress #sigma#_z as influencing quantities were described mathematically with the aid of exponential functions, and represented nomographically. In addition, a proposal was made for a compact testing device for performing tensile retardation tests. (orig.)

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the suitability of utilizing dune sand as a paving construction material in hot desert-like areas of the world, where regions of sand dunes exist. The high availability, low cost, and excellent physical properties of the current surplus of elemental sulfur and the benefits given to asphaltic binders by sulfur raises the possibility of using sulfur in asphalt mixes to produce stable mixtures with locally obtainable dune sand. Characterization of various sulfur-asphalt-dune sand mixtures for highway construction were made. The materials used in this investigation were elemental sulfur, AR- 4000 (60 - 70 pen.) asphalt, and dune sand from Yuma, Arizona. The main variables include (a) proportion of sulfur and asphalt in the binder, (b) amount of binder in the mixture, (c) curing temperature, (d) test temperature, and (e) mixing techniques. The various mixtures were prepared by the one-wet mixing cycle technique. Similar dune sand mixtures with asphalt only were evaluated for comparison purposes. The different mixes were evaluated by the Marshall method, tensile strength tests (double punch), compression tests (standard and immersion), flexural tests (standard), dynamic modulus tests (double punch), and microscopic examinations of sulfur-asphalt binders and sulfur-asphalt-dune sand mixtures (thin sections). Preliminary characterizations of the various mixes were made on the basis of their Marshall stability, flow, density, and air void contents. Other engineering properties such as tensile strength, compressive strength, modulus of rupture, dynamic modulus, and microscopic studies were determined for selected mixes. The results consistently indicated that the sulfur-asphalt-dune sand mixes exhibited superior engineering characteristics and performance as compared to similar mixes without sulfur. The overall conclusion drawn from this study is that the dune sand which is not normally accepted for use as aggregate in asphaltic mixtures, can be used with the utilization of sulfur-asphalt binder systems to produce paving mixtures with compatible or better engineering properties in comparison to conventional <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concretes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} work {{undertaken in}} the demonstration of a low-cost Automatic Weight and Classification System (AWACS). An AWACS procurement specification and details {{of the results of}} the project are also included. The intent of the project is to support and encourage transferring research knowledge to state and local agencies and manufacturers through field demonstrations. Presently available, Weigh-in-Motion and Classification Systems are typically too expensive to permit the wide deployment necessary to obtain representative vehicle data. Piezo electric technology has been used in the United Kingdom and Europe and is believed to be the basic element in a low-cost AWACS. Low-cost systems have been installed at two sites, one in Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement in Iowa and the other in <b>Asphaltic</b> Cement <b>Concrete</b> (ACC) pavement in Minnesota to provide experience with both types of pavement. The systems provide axle weights, gross vehicle weight, axle spacing, vehicle classification, vehicle speed, vehicle count, and time of arrival. In addition, system self-calibration and a method to predict contact tire pressure is included in the system design. The study has shown that in the PCC pavement, the AWACS is capable of meeting the needs of state and federal highway agencies, producing accuracies comparable to many current commercial WIM devices. This is being achieved at a procurement cost of substantially less than currently available equipment. In the ACC pavement the accuracies were less than those observed in the PCC pavement which is concluded to result from a low pavement rigidity at this site. Further work is needed to assess the AWACS performance at a range of sites in ACC pavements...|$|R

With h= 0. 5 m, a good assessment of the top layers of both the present chosen asphaltic and the cement concrete pavements, including soil subgrade, can be made.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{research}} reports FA 07. 101 G 82 B and FA 07. 136 G 87 B, an investigation was subsequently carried out to determine to what extent the binder characteristics of the asphalt surfaces have further changed after 12 to 15 years of lifetime and whether these results can be reached using the laboratory forecast methods 'Modelltopf' (model pot). For this purpose test cores from 30 asphalt layers were investigated to determine their binding characteristics. Tests were carried out on asphalt <b>concrete,</b> <b>asphaltic</b> mastic and asphalt bearing courses with bitumen B 80, B 65 or B 45. The ageing of the bitumen was directly dependent on the type of bitumen in a magnitude which covers more than two types (#DELTA# Ep. R. u. K. #approx# 20 C). It was obvious here that the cavity content played a particular role in the binder ageing. The fact that, despite strong binder ageing also in the case of harder types of bitumen (B 45), damage to roads does not necessarily occur, {{can be seen as a}} positive finding of the investigation results. Hence, the findings allow the conclusion to be made that the use of harder binders certainly is worthwhile in practice. This can minimise the problem of deformations without anticipating the formation of cracks due to binder ageing. The respective climatic conditions certainly have to be taken into consideration in choosing the binder. The ageing forecasts in the laboratory cannot, without further knowledge, be applied to behaviour in practice. On the contrary, practice shows that the combined effects of many circumstances always shapes the binder ageing in the course of a road being exposed and leads to great fluctuations, which makes a laboratory forecast difficult.

50|$|Because airport {{pavement}} {{construction is}} so expensive, manufacturers aim to minimize aircraft stresses on the pavement. Manufacturers {{of the larger}} planes design landing gear so that {{the weight of the}} plane is supported on larger and more numerous tires. Attention is also paid to the characteristics of the landing gear itself, so that adverse effects on the pavement are minimized. Sometimes it is possible to reinforce a pavement for higher loading by applying an overlay of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>concrete</b> or portland cement concrete that is bonded to the original slab. Post-tensioning concrete has been developed for the runway surface. This permits the use of thinner pavements and should result in longer concrete pavement life.
