2500|$|The Day After (1983) was a [...] "made for TV" [...] {{movie that}} became fodder for {{talk shows and}} {{commentary}} by politicians at the time due to its depiction of the runup to a nuclear war between the US and the Soviets with graphic explosions on American soil, {{the aftermath of the}} attack and alleged political causes. Testament (1983), another postwar vision of survival in a small California town after WWIII; WarGames (1983), features a young computer hacker who nearly starts World War Three when he inadvertently breaks into a fictional NORAD supercomputer named WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) to play the latest video games; The Terminator (4 films, 1984, 1991, 2003, 2009) features a post-apocalyptic future in which artificial intelligence has become self-aware, identifies all humans as a threat and uses the worlds nuclear arsenal to destroy mankind.(all James Cameron films from 1986 through 1994 deal with nuclear explosions); [...] Red Dawn (film, directed by John Milius) a Soviet/Nicaraguan/Cuban invasion and occupation follows a surprise limited nuclear strike on the US (1984), Mad Max (4 films, 1979–2015), a loner Australian highway patrolman wanders a bleak violent post apocalyptic wasteland. Countdown to Looking Glass, (1984) a 'docudrama,' shows an international incident, the breakdown in diplomacy, the escalation in international tensions leading up to a nuclear crisis, the breakout of ground and naval combat overseas, and ends with the president taking off in the airborne E-4 command post ("Looking Glass") and the activation of the Emergency Broadcast System and air raid sirens. [...] Manhattan Project (1986), is not about the actual The Manhattan Project but how, using stolen plutonium, a high school student builds an atomic bomb for a science class project. Threads (BBC TV production made 1984, shown 1985), based on British government exercise Square Leg, shows the effects of an <b>all-out</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> on the town of Sheffield, England, UK. Project X (1987) deals with testing of lethal exposures to nuclear radiation on how specially-trained chimpanzees perform in computerized flight simulators (based on an actual US Air Force biomedical research program). [...] In Miracle Mile (1988) a musician visiting the [...] "Miracle Mile" [...] area of Los Angeles receives a wrong number phone call and hears a conversation in the background saying that a nuclear attack on the United States is imminent. Denial, confusion, fear and panic ensue before the attack as the protagonist scrambles to save himself and a woman he met earlier in the day. [...] By Dawn's Early Light (1990) portrays an accidental limited nuclear exchange between the US and the Soviet Union after a [...] "false-flag" [...] attack on Soviet territory by Russian ultra nationalist terrorists seemingly launched from a US base in Turkey, and attempts to stop hostilities before they spiral into an <b>all-out</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war.</b> Broken Arrow (1996) depicts the theft of two thermonuclear weapons by a rogue US bomber pilot. (" [...] Broken Arrow" [...] is military jargon for an accidental nuclear event which does not create the risk of a nuclear war; the theft of working nuclear weapons depicted in the film would actually be classified as an [...] " [...] Empty Quiver" [...] by the US Department of Defense.).|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "cold" [...] is {{used because}} there was no {{large-scale}} fighting directly between the two sides involved in the conflict, although there were major regional wars, known as proxy wars, supported by the two sides. The Cold War split the temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences. The USSR was a Marxist-Leninist state led by its Communist Party of the Soviet Union, who in turn were led by a leader, with different titles over time, and a small committee called the Politburo. The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and many organizations. It also controlled the other states in the Eastern Bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the West, staunchly democratic and capitalist with a free press and independent organizations.

2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{alternate}} {{history has}} often shown how <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> could have arisen for certain crises. In the 1998 German-American mockumentary Der dritte Weltkrieg, Mikhail Gorbachev is ousted during his October 1989 visit to East Germany, after which the new hard-line government violently suppresses or preempts the Revolutions of 1989, and starts a seemingly contained conventional war which leads to an accidental nuclear exchange; the film then rewinds to show Gorbachev in East Berlin and ends with jubilant scenes from the [...] "different path" [...] of recorded history. [...] In 2013's What If...Armageddon 1962, John F. Kennedy is assassinated before becoming President (killed by an actual would-be assassin who lost his nerve after realizing his attack would also kill Kennedy's wife and children), and under Lyndon B. Johnson's leadership, the Cuban Missile Crisis leads to an <b>all-out</b> <b>nuclear</b> attack on the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|Two films {{released}} in 1983, WarGames and The Day After, dealt with potential <b>all-out</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> between the US and the Soviet Union.

He revised his posture toward nuclear war in favor of eventual nuclear abolition, at least in part due to his experience watching the film.|$|E
50|$|The {{rationale}} behind countervalue targeting {{is that when}} two sides have both achieved assured destruction capability—that is, when the nuclear arsenals of each side have the apparent ability to survive {{a wide range of}} counterforce attacks, and carry out a second strike in response—then, in an <b>all-out</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war,</b> the value of targeting the opponent's nuclear arsenal diminishes, and the value of targeting the opponent's cities and civilians increases. This line of reasoning, however, assumes that the opponent values its civilians over its military forces.|$|E
50|$|An {{escalation}} into <b>all-out</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> was avoided {{only with}} difficulty, and though things have calmed {{down a bit}} by 1989 when the plot takes place, the Cold War {{is still very much}} on, and the Soviet Union is still very much a dictatorship keeping its citizens (even cosmonauts millions of miles from home) on a short leash. Mikhail Gorbachev had led for only nine months, and barely got started on Glasnost, before dying from a stroke (though there are rumors of a secret assassination, which Soviet characters prudently avoid discussing too loudly).|$|E
50|$|During the Cold War, Ball {{was invited}} to {{critique}} US nuclear defence plans—his analysis persuading the US that its plan to destroy selected Soviet targets in a limited strike would not work in practice and would lead to <b>all-out</b> <b>nuclear</b> escalation.

However {{at the time when}} massive retaliation became policy, there was no MAD, because the Soviet Union lacked a second strike capability throughout the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Weed escalates the {{situation}} further, threatening a limited nuclear strike on the Chinese.

Seeing his own government crumbling and no sign of concessions from Russia or China, Weed finally backs down and sues for peace.|$|E
5000|$|The Cold War was {{all about}} gaining the {{advantage}} {{of information about the}} enemies’ atomic weaponry. The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II led by the United States (and the Western Bloc) and the Soviet Union ( [...] and the Eastern Bloc). Although the two powers never engaged in a full out war, both countries were constantly preparing for an <b>all-out</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war.</b> Thus the use of spies to gain insight into the knowledge of how far their enemies were advancing.|$|E

In 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed Presidential Directive 59 which endorsed the NUTS strategic posture committed to fight and win a nuclear war, and accepted escalation dominance and flexible response. The Soviets, however, were skeptical of limited options or the possibility of controlling escalation. While Soviet deterrence doctrine posited massive responses to any nuclear use ("all against any"), military officials considered the possibility of proportionate responses to a limited US attack, although they [...] "doubted that nuclear war could remain limited for long." ...|$|E

The counterforce proposal stood {{in contrast to the}} massive retaliation approach advocated by United States Air Force General Curtis LeMay at Strategic Air Command in which the U.S. response to a Soviet invasion, even if they did not use nuclear weapons, would consist of nuclear attacks on all major military and civilian sites in the Soviet Union and its allies that could have resulted in hundreds of millions of deaths.|$|E
