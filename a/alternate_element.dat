40|$|The {{formation}} of amyloid-like aggregates by expanded polyglutamine (polyGln) sequences is suspected {{to play a}} critical role in the neuropathology of Huntington's disease and other expanded CAG-repeat diseases. To probe the folding of the polyGln sequence in the aggregate, we replaced Gln–Gln pairs at different sequence intervals with Pro–Gly pairs, elements that are compatible with β-turn formation and incompatible with β-extended chain. We find that PGQ 9 and PGQ 10, peptides consisting of four Q 9 or Q 10 elements interspersed with PG elements, undergo spontaneous aggregation as efficiently as a Q 45 sequence, whereas the corresponding PGQ 7 and PGQ 8 peptides aggregate much less readily. Furthermore, a PDGQ 9 sequence containing d-prolines aggregates more efficiently than the peptide with l-prolines, consistent with β-turn formation in aggregate structure. Introduction of one additional Pro residue in the center of a Q 9 element within PGQ 9 completely blocks the peptide's ability to aggregate. This strongly suggests that the Q 9 elements are required to be in extended chain for efficient aggregation to occur. We determined the critical nucleus for aggregation nucleation of the PGQ 9 peptide to be one, a result identical to that for unbroken polyGln sequences. The PGQN peptide aggregates are structurally quite similar to Q 45 aggregates, as judged by heterologous seeding aggregation kinetics, recognition by an anti-polyGln aggregate antibody, and electron microscopy. The results suggest that polyGln aggregate structure consists of <b>alternating</b> <b>elements</b> of extended chain and turn. In the future it should be possible to conduct detailed and interpretable mutational studies in the PGQ 9 background...|$|R
40|$|The {{setting up}} of bonded structures, e. g. micromechanical sensors and actuators, using wafer bonding {{techniques}} {{is becoming more}} important. Today's most used technologies for wafer level packaging are silicon direct bonding and anodic bonding as well as glass frit, eutectic, and adhesive bonding. In addition to further developments of these procedures new technologies with low process temperatures (< 350 deg C), or local heat sources have been focused increasingly. Especially, technologies using local and controllable heat sources have been developed recently. With these internal heat sources the required thermal bonding energy acts directly on the join, so that temperature sensitive components would not be damaged. One example for that heat sources {{is the use of}} nanostructured reactive multilayers. These systems consist of numerous nanometer thick layers <b>alternating</b> between two <b>elements</b> that react exothermically during intermixing. Once the reaction is initiated by a pulse of energy the reaction can be self-propagating. Self-propagating exothermic reactions or self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) have been observed in a variety of compacted powders, e. g. Ni/Ti or Ti/Co, and nanostructured multilayer systems, such as Ni/Al. The properties of the powder-based SHS reactions depend strongly on the particle size, shape, processing, and purity as described in different reviews. In comparison to the powder compacts the reactants in multilayered samples are placed in intimate contact and the interface impurities are reduced so that the reaction velocities could be largely increased. Nanoscaled reactive multilayer systems typically consist of two <b>alternating</b> <b>elements.</b> During deposition process the materials undergo partial intermixing which can have dramatic effects on the reaction parameters. To minimize this fact the substrates are usually cooled. The driving force in such a system to self-propagate is the reduction in chemical bond energy. In A-B multilayer systems compounds A(x) B(y) are formed when the constituents, A and B, intermix due to thermally induced atomic diffusion. This local intermixing produces a large amount of heat which is transmitted down to the neighboured constituents and so continues further intermixing. Experimental studies of nanoscaled reactive multilayer systems showed that the enthalpy of formation of A(x) B(y) should be greater than - 30 kJ/mole-atom to become self-propagating...|$|R
