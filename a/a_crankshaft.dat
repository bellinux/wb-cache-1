5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{opened a}} gap of 6.1 seconds over Barrichello by his {{one and only}} pit stop on lap 35 and rejoined in fourth. de la Rosa was the last {{one-stop}} driver to pit on lap 36 from fifth, which he maintained upon rejoining the track. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop on lap 40, and dropped behind Ralf Schumacher. Montoya moved back into the lead position when Barrichello made a pit stop on lap 41 and rejoined right behind Ralf Schumacher. At the completion of lap 42, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the order was Montoya, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, de la Rosa, Villeneuve, Räikkönen, Alesi, Panis, Fisichella, Heidfeld, Bernoldi, Enge, Alonso and Yoong. Further down the field, Enge passed Bernoldi for twelfth on lap 43. Barrichello ran in the slipstream of Ralf Schumacher down the start/finish straight and Schumacher cut the Variante Goodyear chicane after attempting to defend his position, allowing Barrichello to take over second on lap 47. Yoong retired from the race on the same lap after he spun his car into a gravel trap. Bernoldi became the final retirement of the race when his car developed <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> sensor problem on the same lap.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{announced}} that the 1983 season would be his final year in Grand Prix competition. Yamaha team manager Giacomo Agostini {{had been unable to}} agree on a contract with rider Graeme Crosby, so AMA Superbike champion Eddie Lawson was brought in as Roberts' new teammate. The 1983 battle for the championship between Roberts and Honda's Spencer would be considered one of the greatest seasons in motorcycle Grand Prix history, along with the 1967 500cc duel between Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostini. Roberts began the season with his YZR500 having problems with overheating and rear suspension, while Spencer started strongly, winning the first three races and five out of the first seven. Roberts was leading the second race in France, when his Yamaha split an expansion chamber causing it to lose power as Spencer won, with Roberts falling to fourth place. In Round 3 at Monza, Roberts crashed while leading Spencer three laps from the finish. Roberts came back to win the German Grand Prix, but then finished second to Spencer in Spain in a race Spencer called one of the toughest of his career. Things began to go Roberts' way at the Austrian Grand Prix as Roberts won while Spencer's Honda suffered <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> failure. In the Yugoslavian Grand Prix, Roberts' Yamaha failed to start immediately, while Spencer charged to an early lead, leaving Roberts to fight through the field to finish in fourth place. Roberts then went on a three-race winning streak with victories in the Netherlands, Belgium and England, while Spencer stayed close with a third place and two second-place finishes.|$|E

25|$|The non-manual crank {{appears in}} several of the {{hydraulic}} devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices. These automatically operated cranks appear in several devices, two of which contain an action which approximates to that of <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft,</b> anticipating Al-Jazari's invention by several centuries and its first appearance in Europe by over five centuries. However, the automatic crank described by the Banu Musa would not have allowed a full rotation, but only a small modification was required to convert it to <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|Al-Jazari (11361206) {{described}} a crank and connecting rod {{system in a}} rotating machine in two of his water-raising machines. His twin-cylinder pump incorporated <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft,</b> including both the crank and shaft mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The alpha {{configuration}} has two power pistons, {{one in a}} hot cylinder, one in a cold cylinder, and the gas {{is driven}} between the two by the pistons; it is typically in a V-formation with the pistons joined {{at the same point}} on <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|By 1929, the Indian 402 {{would have}} a {{stronger}} twin-downtube frame based on that of the 101 Scout and <b>a</b> sturdier five-bearing <b>crankshaft</b> than the Ace, which had <b>a</b> three-bearing <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{exception}} is the Yankee, which had <b>a</b> 360° <b>crankshaft.</b> The Yankee's configuration, which had separate combustion chambers for the two cylinders, {{should not be confused}} with that of a split-single.

25|$|The crank {{appears in}} the mid-9th century {{in several of the}} {{hydraulic}} devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices. These devices, however, made only partial rotations and could not transmit much power, although only a small modification would have been required to convert it to <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|The gamma {{configuration}} has two cylinders: one {{containing a}} displacer, {{with a hot}} and a cold end, {{and one for the}} power piston; they are joined to form a single space with the same pressure in both cylinders; the pistons are typically in parallel and joined 90 degrees out of phase on <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|The beta {{configuration}} has {{a single}} cylinder with a hot end and a cold end, containing a power piston and a 'displacer' that drives the gas between the hot and cold ends. It is typically used with a rhombic drive to achieve the phase difference between the displacer and power pistons, {{but they can be}} joined 90 degrees out of phase on <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1929, the Indian 401 was {{replaced}} by the Indian 402 which received a stronger twin-downtube frame based on the 101 Scout frame and <b>a</b> sturdier five-bearing <b>crankshaft</b> than the Ace, which only had <b>a</b> three-bearing <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{diaphragm}} compressor (also {{known as a}} membrane compressor) is {{a variant of the}} conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{machinery}} differs if the windmill is {{used for}} other applications than milling grain. A drainage mill uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or Archimedes' screw. Sawmills use <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills {{have been used to}} power many other industrial processes, including papermills, threshing mills, and to process oil seeds, wool, paints and stone products.|$|E
25|$|A Wilkinson engine weighed about eleven tons, carried 160 {{gallons of}} water and had a bunker capable of {{carrying}} nine cubic feet of coke. It was a vertical engine with a vertical boiler. The cylinders were of small bore and acted upon <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> through which motion was communicated to the four coupled wheels by cog-wheel gears. Exhaust steam was not condensed but was superheated in a patent contrivance in the firebox whence it escaped to the atmosphere through the chimney.|$|E

25|$|In 1813, William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth {{designed}} a locomotive (Puffing Billy) {{for use on}} the tramway between Stockton and Darlington. Puffing Billy featured piston rods extending upwards to pivoting beams, connected in turn by rods to <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> beneath the frames which, in turn, drove the gears attached to the wheels. This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction. A year later, George Stephenson improved on that design with his first locomotive Blücher, {{which was the first}} locomotive to use single-flanged wheels.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the Engerth system was devised by Pius Fink. This entailed having the rear wheels also driven by coupling rods from <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft,</b> thus making the locomotive an 0-6-4-0T. One locomotive was built by the Staats Eisenbahn Gesellschaft, Vienna in 1861 carried No. 500 and was named Steyerdorf. It was used on the Reschtiza - Orawicza line. Three more were built, the last in 1867. These included No. 501 Krassova and No. 502 Gerliste. One of these four locomotives survived until 1891, becoming Hungarian State Railways No.4270.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge was}} damaged during floods in March 1936 when water {{infiltrated}} and caused shorts in the bridge's electrical equipment. Repairs {{were made in}} late 1938 and early 1939. The Electrical Underground Construction Co. of New York City received $9,245 to replace damaged electrical equipment and wiring, install new electrical conduits, and install two sump pumps. In October 1936, a gear and <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> in the drawbridge broke. The bridge was closed for nine hours while crews rushed to repair the span, which was open and unable to permit traffic. The closing, the Washington Post reported, was the longest since the bridge opened.|$|E

25|$|The proprietors of Wylam Colliery, near Newcastle upon Tyne {{wanted to}} replace horse-drawn trains with steam. In 1804, William Hedley, {{a manager at}} the colliery, {{employed}} Trevithick to build a steam locomotive. However, it proved too heavy for the wooden track {{to allow it to}} be used. William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth (another colliery employee) designed a locomotive in 1813 which became known as Puffing Billy. Puffing Billy featured piston rods extending upwards to pivoting beams, connected in turn by rods to <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> beneath the frames, which in turn drove the gears attached to the wheels.

25|$|Neither car ran in {{the next}} two rounds, and only Ludwig competed in the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen; this time, <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft</b> failure after 17 laps saw him finish 51st overall, and 18th in the GTP category. The Portland Grand Prix saw Ludwig's Mustang GTP last 24 laps, before he retired, and was {{classified}} 29th overall, and 18th in class. At the Grand Prix of Sonoma, Ludwig (with sponsorship from 7-Eleven) was finally able to finish a race with the Mustang GTP; he took fifth, and was the last car on the lead lap. Rahal partnered with Ludwig at the Road America 500, but the team's 1983 victory would not be repeated; a retirement after 83 laps saw them classified 33rd overall, and 16th in the GTP category. Having skipped the fourteenth round of the season, Zakspeed then entered the Michigan Grand Prix with two cars; Rahal did not even complete the first lap, and Ludwig retired after 54 laps, resulting in the drivers being classified 33rd and 24th overall, 22nd and 16th in the GTP category. Zakspeed did not compete in the 16th round of the season, but did enter the Daytona Finale. Here, Brabham's engine blew after 15 laps, restricting him to 69th overall (and 30th in class), but Ludwig and Tom Gloy's Mustang GTP held together well enough for them to finish fifth overall, and in class.|$|E
500|$|Structural {{studies of}} termetallocene systems have shown they {{typically}} adopt an [...] "eclipsed double transoid" [...] "crankshaft" [...] geometry. Taking {{as an example}} the 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene cation shown above, {{this means that the}} cobaltocenyl and rhodocenyl moieties are eclipsed, and thus carbon atoms 1 and 1' on the central ferrocene core are as close to vertically aligned as is possible given the staggered conformation of the cyclopentadienyl rings within each metallocene unit. Viewed from side-on, this means termetallocenes resemble the down–up–down pattern of <b>a</b> <b>crankshaft.</b> The synthesis of this termetallocene involves the combining of rhodocenium and cobaltocenium solutions with 1,1'-dilithioferrocene. This produces an uncharged intermediate with linked cyclopentadienyl–cyclopentadiene ligands whose bonding resembles that found in the rhodocene dimer. These ligands then react with the triphenylmethyl carbocation to generate the termetallocene salt, (PF6)2. This synthetic pathway is illustrated below: ...|$|E
