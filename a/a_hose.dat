5|$|The {{chemical}} apparatus {{was only}} suitable for small fires, and was supplemented in 1902 with a steam-operated pumper and <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> wagon, both horse-drawn. The {{two pieces of}} equipment were purchased by Walter Law's Briarcliff Realty Company and were loaned to the fire company without charge. At the time, the fire company housed its equipment and horses at the Briarcliff Farms' Barn A (present-day St. Theresa's School) and used the Wheelwright shop as a meeting room and for social events.|$|E
5|$|This {{fire had}} more {{troubles}} {{due to the}} age and condition of the bridge; the wood trusses on the bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale, due to the fire on the bridge ten years before. Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters {{were not to be}} sent onto the bridge; a boat from the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used to put out the fire, as Louisville's fire boat did not have <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> that could reach the blaze on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|When Engine Co. 22 arrived, it {{was ordered}} to pump water on the {{warehouse}}. The company's firefighters entered the warehouse and dragged <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> up a staircase to direct water onto the fourth floor. When heavy black smoke began coming down the stairway, Foreman Garrett B. Lane ordered his firemen to evacuate. Fireman Francis Hart, Jr., became trapped while trying to collect the hose {{and was forced to}} flee to the roof and escape over neighboring rooftops.|$|E

50|$|A Denver {{firefighter}} {{known as}} Merriman invented <b>an</b> early <b>hose</b> mask that {{was featured in}} the January 7, 1892 issue of Fireman's Herald. This respirator featured a tube like that of an elephant trunk connected to <b>an</b> air <b>hose</b> that ran parallel to the firefighter's water hose.|$|R
5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through <b>a</b> <b>hose.</b> When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with <b>a</b> <b>hose,</b> Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> fire <b>hose</b> (or firehose) is <b>a</b> {{high-pressure}} <b>hose</b> {{that carries}} water or other fire retardant (such as foam) to a fire to extinguish it. Outdoors, it attaches either to a fire engine or a fire hydrant. Indoors, it can permanently attach to a building's standpipe or plumbing system.|$|R
5|$|Homer and Bart {{arrive at}} the school during the school-dance to steal the grease in the school's kitchen which Bart told him about. They sneak {{into the kitchen and}} plants <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> in the fryer to suck it into the car, but Willie spots them and {{attempts}} to stop them, claiming the grease to be his retirement plan. Homer tries to escape, but Willie grabs his legs and strangles him with the hose sucking the grease, which explodes due to the increased pressure, causing the grease to flood into the dance hall. A grease fight begins among the students, where Alex eventually joins in after being told by Lisa to act her own age.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft, so the B.1/1A aircraft, now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to B(K).1A standard (later redesignated B.1A (K2P)), receiving a two-point system with <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> and drogue carried under each wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.|$|E
25|$|Some divers use {{a primary}} {{regulator}} on <b>a</b> 7-foot <b>hose</b> and <b>a</b> secondary on a necklace, {{this is useful}} when {{it may be necessary}} for the divers to swim in single file. the reason for the primary being on <b>a</b> long <b>hose</b> is to ensure the donated regulator is known to be working.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> fire <b>hose</b> vacuum is <b>a</b> small {{pneumatic}} {{device that}} removes residue {{air from the}} inside of <b>a</b> fire <b>hose,</b> thereby making it smaller and somewhat rigid, thus allowing more hose or other equipment to be stored on a fire apparatus as well as making loads or packs deploy with increased ease.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> drench <b>hose</b> is {{equipment}} that can spray {{water to a}} specific spot of the chemical exposure on individual's body. The benefit of <b>a</b> drench <b>hose</b> {{is that it can}} be applied to an individual who cannot reach a normal eyewash or shower station or where the eyewash and shower station is unavailable.|$|R
5|$|A giant {{meteoroid}} {{approaches the}} earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the Aurora, is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the Aurora, but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> from Chester's ship, Sirius, to the Aurora, and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E
25|$|Water for anal {{cleansing}} can {{be supplied}} via <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> or spigot fed by a pressurized water delivery system or a gravity fed system supplied by a rainwater tank located overhead {{or from a}} water bottle or jug that the user carries into the toilet cubicle.|$|E
25|$|The gas may be {{provided}} {{directly to the}} diver, or to a rebreather circuit, {{to make up for}} used gas and volume changes due to depth variations. Gas supply may be from a high-pressure scuba cylinder carried by the diver, or from a surface supply through <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> connected to a compressor or storage system.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduation}} from high school, Bannon attended Virginia Tech {{and served as}} the president of the student government association. During the summers, when Bannon was attending Virginia Tech, he took a job working at a local junk yard, often coming home so dirty his mother made him rinse off with <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> before being allowed into the house.|$|E
25|$|Hot water suits provide active warming {{which is}} {{particularly}} {{suitable for use}} with helium based breathing gases. Heated water is provided from the surface through <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> in the umbilical, and water flow can be adjusted to suit the diver's needs. Heated water continuously flows into the suit and is distributed by perforated internal tubes down {{the front and back}} of the torso and along the limbs.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other 4x4s {{such as the}} Jeep Wagoneer, the {{original}} Range Rover was not designed as a luxury-type vehicle. While certainly up-market compared to preceding Land Rover models, the early Range Rovers had fairly basic, utilitarian interiors with vinyl seats and plastic dashboards that were designed to be washed down with <b>a</b> <b>hose.</b> Convenience features such as power steering, carpeted floors, air conditioning, cloth/leather seats, and wooden interior trim were fitted later.|$|E

25|$|Overnight on 30 November, {{there were}} violent clashes between police and protesters in Admiralty after the Federation of Students and Scholarism called upon {{the crowd to}} {{surround}} the Central Government Offices. The police used <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> to splash protesters for the first time. The entrance to the Admiralty Centre was also blocked. Most of the violence occurred near Admiralty MTR station. Also, Joshua Wong and two other Scholarism members began an indefinite hunger strike.|$|E
25|$|Phosgene can be {{released}} during building fires. In one instance, a deputy fire chief was killed {{ten days after}} inhaling fumes that wafted down outside a burning restaurant. After a two-day hospitalization he had appeared to recover, but ultimately suffered cardiac arrest at home following tracheobronchial inflammation, alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema. The phosgene was produced by decomposing Freon-22 after flames ducted up from a grease fire heated an air-conditioning unit {{on the roof and}} ruptured <b>a</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|E
25|$|Farncomb was {{deployed}} to Hawaii {{to participate in}} the 2012 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) multinational exercise. On 22 July, the submarine fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the former ammunition ship , breaking the ship in two and sinking her. A few days later, <b>a</b> <b>hose</b> in the submarine's weight compensation system split while the boat was recharging her batteries, causing flooding. Farncomb surfaced from periscope depth without major incident and sailed to Pearl Harbor for repairs.|$|E
