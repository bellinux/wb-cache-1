Porter said he simultaneously loved both Lowe's over-the-top performance while sick, and Poehler's more subtle performance. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic said the way Chris has become so well integrated into the show demonstrates how well the writers keep seemingly ridiculous characters grounded. Richenthal said Poehler made her sick scenes seem like strong character moments rather than just slapstick comedy, and praised the scenes with Ron and Andy, as well as Tom's scenes at the spa. Joel Keller of TV Squad said the episode strongly developed the characters Ben and Chris, and served as a showcase for the comedic talents of Poehler, who he complimented for not going too over the top.

Whereas Kiss was developed in a acquiescent manner as Jepsen was simply grateful for the opportunity, Emotion was spurred by her desire to take more creative control. Jepsen commented that much of the album is about [...] "trying to get some power back" [...] after a recent break up and subsequent move to New York. She sought to channel a [...] "heart-on-your-sleeve sensibility" [...] reminiscent of the 1980s era after attending a Cyndi Lauper concert in Japan: [...] " [...] this is when pop was <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>finest.</b> [...] I would put out 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' today and I wouldn’t change a bloody thing." [...] These themes were further explored through [...] "old-school" [...] Prince and Madonna records on morning runs before Cinderella rehearsals. An epiphany came to Jepsen after finishing [...] "Emotion", the album's title track, where she realized that the 1980s pop sound combined with a more [...] "alternative" [...] production was what she had been seeking. This fashioned the album's direction entirely, which developed as the midway point between the [...] "pure" [...] pop she recorded in Los Angeles and the indie folk effort that was scrapped in New York.

Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects praised the episode, describing it as [...] "very joke hits, every line was sweet, every emotion is true, every visual was eye popping, this episode is Futurama <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>finest.</b> If there is any complaint, it's that it took this long for the show to regain this level of quality."

Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 9.4 out of 10, writing: [...] "'Late' was definitely the best episode of the season so far, and ranks with the best the show's ever done.
