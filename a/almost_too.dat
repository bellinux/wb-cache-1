5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; he was <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> ill {{to participate in}} the battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, and not in the respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} social thinker and {{art critic}} John Ruskin, who had many associations with Keswick, {{once said that}} the town was a place <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> beautiful to live in. In October 1900, mainly {{through the efforts of}} Rawnsley, a simple memorial of Borrowdale slate was erected to Ruskin at Friars Crag. The monument is a now a Grade II listed structure.|$|E
5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{largely the}} {{fighting}} went {{in favour of}} the Allies, and finally the Japanese assault ground to a halt. Despite forcing a contraction of the Australian forces defending the beachhead, on 21 October the Japanese withdrew from Siki Cove, although the fighting around Katika continued for four more days as the Japanese attempted to retake it. Fierce resistance from the 2/28th halted them and eventually the attack was called off on 24 October, with the Japanese having suffered heavily due to tactical deficiencies, poor co-ordination and operational security, {{and a lack of}} artillery. Meanwhile, the Allied response was hampered by poor working relationships at some of the highest levels between Australian and US commanders– particularly between I Corps commander Lieutenant General Edmund Herring and the VII Amphibious Force commander Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey– the lack of a unified command structure, over cautiousness amongst naval staff, and a poor appreciation of overall Japanese strength and intentions by the highest level of the Allied command who failed to send reinforcements until it was <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> late. Casualties during the attack amounted to at least 679 Japanese killed with another 821 estimated as wounded, while the Australians lost 49 killed and 179 wounded.|$|E
25|$|After age thirty-two, {{she did not}} sit for {{any more}} portraits, and would not allow any {{photographs}} of her to be taken, so that her public image of the eternal beauty would not be challenged. The few photographs that were taken without her knowledge show {{a woman who was}} “graceful, but <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> slender”.|$|E
25|$|Architectural {{ideas of}} the mid-19th century {{advanced}} by such architects as Pugin, and still adhered to by the recently deceased prominent New Zealand architect Benjamin Mountfort, decreed that only Gothic was suitable for Christian worship. Ignoring these old-fashioned and now expensive rules, Petre designed the new church in the Palladian style, which in this country {{had only a few}} years before been considered <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> heretical for worship.|$|E

25|$|Herbert {{never again}} equalled the {{critical}} acclaim he received for Dune. Neither his sequels to Dune {{nor any of}} his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although {{almost all of them}} were New York Times Best Sellers. Some felt that Children of Dune was <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> literary and too dark to get the recognition it may have deserved; others felt that The Dosadi Experiment lacked an epic quality that fans had come to expect.|$|E
25|$|In this scene, Mussorgsky is hailed to {{be ahead}} of his time musically. His use of the whole tone scale, which uses only whole steps, made the Coronation scene stand out. This {{technique}} was replicated by impressionistic composers about 20 years later who noted his success. Mussorgsky also combined different two-beat and three-beat meters to create a unique sound for his composition called polymeters. These techniques were uncommon during this era and were believed to be <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> overwhelming for the public. This led to his rejection on two different occasions by the Imperial Opera before they decided to perform.|$|E
25|$|While {{retaining}} his WBC and WBA super flyweight belts, Darchinyan vacated his IBF belt {{in order}} to move up to bantamweight to fight IBF champion Joseph Agbeko in Sunrise, Florida on 11 July 2009. He lost a unanimous decision in a fight he looked <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> overly aggressive in and couldn't seem to cope with the Ghanan's style and repeatedly walked into straight right hands. Agbeko spoiled Darchinyan's goal of winning his third world title in a different division. Two judges scored the bout 114-113 for Agbeko, while the third had it for the Ghanaian Agbeko, 116-111. Despite the defeat at bantamweight, Darchinyan was still recognized as super flyweight champion by both the WBC and WBA.|$|E

25|$|While {{attending}} George Washington, Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at Vogue magazine; she {{had been}} selected from several hundred women nationwide. The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris. Before beginning the job, Bouvier celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer. The trip {{was the subject of}} her only autobiography, One Special Summer, co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline's drawings. On her first day at Vogue, the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara Leaming, the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects, as at the age of 22 she was already considered <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> old to be single in her social circles. Following the advice, she left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

40|$|Kolmogorov {{has defined}} the {{complexity}} of a sequence of bits to be the minimal size of (the description of) a Turing machine which can regenerate the given sequence. This paper contains two notes on possible applications of this complexity notion to philosophy {{in general and the}} philosophy of science in particular. The first presents simplicism [...] a theory prescribing that people would tend to choose the simplest theory to explain observations, where "simple" is defined by (a version of) Kolmogorov's measure. The second suggests a reinterpretation of a simple observation, saying that reality is <b>almost</b> surely <b>too</b> complex to understand, terms such as "good" and "evil" <b>almost</b> surely <b>too</b> complex to define, and so forth. ...|$|R

500|$|Rogan was the {{greatest}} pitcher that ever threw a ball. He had not only an arm to pitch with but a head to think with. Rogan was a smart pitcher with a wonderful memory.

500|$|In a rare comedy turn, she {{starred in}} The Baxter {{alongside}} writer/director Michael Showalter. The film received mostly negative reviews, but critics praised Williams. [...] "Only when Williams is around does the movie seem human, true, and funny: Even in her slapstick there's pain," [...] wrote The Boston Globe reporter Wesley Morris. [...] "She's <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> good: It's not until she's left {{a scene that}} you realize the movie isn't working." [...] Released on August 26, 2005, Showalter's movie made $37,000 opening weekend before going on to gross over $180,000 domestically.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} round Arsenal faced Stoke City of the Second Division at home. They made light {{work of the}} opposition, winning by three goals and once more set a unique record: David O'Leary's strike meant all 10 regular outfield players each had scored for Arsenal during the season. In his match report for The Times, Stuart Jones assessed: [...] "Having {{experienced}} northing but victory {{since the end of}} August, Arsenal are walking around with <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> much belief," [...] and felt complacency was the only issue preventing the club from reaching the quarter-finals.|$|E

[...] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive. Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.
