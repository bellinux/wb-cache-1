5|$|At {{the request}} of the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, a panel of former justices and {{selected}} MPs was tasked with sorting through the documents, and determining the need to release or withhold them. To date, only about 4,000 out of the estimated 40,000 documents have been released, A final report released in June 2012 found no wrongdoing by Canadian Forces members, but did issue recommendations related to improving military policing and MPCC access to information and witnesses. The Canadian public generally held views that there was knowledge of detainee <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> military or government officials. The issue has also led to scrutiny on detainee treatment by other Canadian departments and the armed forces of other nations.|$|E
5|$|Dworkin {{later wrote}} that she {{eventually}} {{agreed to help}} smuggle a briefcase of heroin through customs in return for $1,000 and an airplane ticket, thinking that if she was successful she could return home with the ticket and the money, and if caught she would at least escape her ex-husband's <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> going to prison.

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of parental support for child sexual abuse victims is well documented, the nature of parental support for victims sexually <b>abused</b> <b>by</b> adolescents is less understood. In this exploratory study, we examine whether parents differ in their levels of blame or doubt for their child when sexually <b>abused</b> <b>by</b> adolescents versus adults. Data included 161 reports of child sexual abuse. Parental blame toward their child was higher when sexually <b>abused</b> <b>by</b> an adolescent versus an adult suspect. In the bivariate and multivariate analysis, parental blame was significantly higher as victim age increased, for Black, non-Hispanic children, and when there was an adolescent suspect. Practitioners {{need to recognize that}} high levels of blame and doubt could exist for adolescent victims of sexual abuse and when children are sexually <b>abused</b> <b>by</b> adolescents...|$|R

5|$|The {{principle}} of individual freedom in society was already {{one of the}} central points in the FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting tax reduction, less state intervention and more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, the party has taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for the welfare state. It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> immigrants which, it said, threatened the welfare state and pensioners' benefits.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but {{his inability to}} find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon {{in and out of}} foster care, they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela, 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} of child sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> Evan Chandler, {{on behalf of his}} then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Mido {{was signed}} by Tottenham on an 18-month loan deal on 28 January 2005. He scored two goals on his Tottenham debut against Portsmouth on 5 February 2005. He scored 3 goals in 11 {{appearances}} during the 2004–05 season for Tottenham. Mido announced plans in July 2005 to launch his own football academy in Egypt, which had the aim of nurturing the country's young talent. In January 2006, he expressed {{that he did not}} wish to return to Roma {{at the end of the}} 2005–06 season, but rather sign permanently with Tottenham. Tottenham manager Martin Jol said that the club were confident of signing Mido on a permanent deal due to his good performances, but later admitted Tottenham may be defeated in keeping Mido, with other clubs interested in signing him. His permanent move was further put into doubt in April 2006, after he suffered a new injury problem. He suffered abuse from a small section of the Southampton and West Ham United fans in 2005. West Ham manager Alan Pardew apologised to Mido for the <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> the fans. He finished the 2005–06 season with 11 goals in 27 games, meaning he was Tottenham's second highest goalscorer. Tottenham confirmed in May 2006 that Mido would be returning to Roma.|$|E
