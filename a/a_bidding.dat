5|$|After {{meeting with}} the Cowboys and Kansas City Chiefs, it was {{reported}} that Vlasic signed a two-year deal with the Chiefs in March, with Vlasic's agent confirming but Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson denying it. The Cowboys stated that they would not enter <b>a</b> <b>bidding</b> war, and the signing was confirmed shortly afterward. Vlasic spent the 1991 preseason competing with Steve Pelluer and Mike Elkins for the backup quarterback job. By the end of the preseason, both Pelluer and Elkins were cut, leaving Vlasic as the backup behind Steve DeBerg. He spent most of the season backing up DeBerg and getting occasional action.

He completed nine of 20 passes for 124 yards and threw four interceptions in a 3714 blowout that marked the end of the Chiefs' playoff run. Vlasic's stats for 1991 were 28 completions in 44 attempts, 316 yards, two touchdowns, and a passer rating of 100.2.|$|E
