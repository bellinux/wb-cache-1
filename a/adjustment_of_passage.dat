5000|$|Rites <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are diverse, and {{are found}} {{throughout}} many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals {{may look like}} rites <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional Rites <b>of</b> <b>Passage</b> programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as Man Up Global. Typically the missing piece is the societal recognition and reincorporation phase. Adventure Education programs, such as Outward Bound, have often been described as potential rites <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> Pamela Cushing researched the rites <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> impact upon adolescent youth at the Canadian Outward Bound School and found the rite <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> impact was lessened by the missing reincorporation phase. Bell (2003) presented more evidence of this lacking third stage and described the [...] "Contemporary Adventure Model of a Rites of Passage" [...] as a modern and weaker version of the rites <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> typically used by outdoor adventure programs. For non-religious people, Rites <b>of</b> <b>Passage</b> are important as well. They mark important changes {{in their lives and}} they help to guide them.|$|R

If we combine ritual, rite <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> and action, it is natural to say that all of these actions are rites <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> and that they can be naturally analyzed in three steps. When we generalize the transition ritual pattern to the analysis of all behaviors, we announce the end of ritual analysis.

40|$|The {{majority}} of philosophers of time hold that the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time is objective change in A-series properties. On this “traditional” view <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> {{there is an}} objective, non-relative present moment (or set of simultaneous events) and the moment or set of simultaneous events that is present continuously changes. That the traditional view construes passage in these A-theoretic terms makes the existence <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> depend on the truth {{of one of the}} A-theoretic views of the ontology of time. The {{majority of}} B-theorists deny that time passes because they reject the A-theoretic views. I defend a “revisionist” B-theoretic view <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time, wherein <b>passage</b> is the temporally successive occurrence of events. Time passes in that one moment occurs after another in a B-series of equally existing events. I begin by defending the viability of the revisionist view as a view <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time. Then I argue that since both the revisionist and traditional views <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are viable views <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> whether passage is really objective change in A-series properties or the temporally successive occurrence of equally existing events depends on which view of the ontology of time is correct. I argue that the B-theory is the correct view of the ontology of time, first by showing that there are several arguments that sink the A-theoretic views, then by showing that the B-theory escapes its main objection: that it is incompatible with temporal experience, particularly with the experiences of the present and <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time. Since the revisionist B-theoretic view <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> is a viable view <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> and since the B-theory is the correct view of the ontology <b>of</b> time, the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time is the temporally successive occurrence of equally existing events. Finally, I argue that events only occur in temporal succession if they are time-like related to each other and there are multiple series of time-like related events. The <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time is not a uniform process across the universe because the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time does not span across events that are space-like separated...|$|R

When changes happen in life, many {{people are more likely}} to feel distressed and confused as they do not have time anymore to conduct rites <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> to help them focus through the changes. Therefore, this study is conducted to reintroduce the archetypal process <b>of</b> rites <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> Rise <b>of</b> the Guardians is one of literary works that feature the archetypal process <b>of</b> rites <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> Jack Frost’s rites <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> to join the Guardians in Rise of the Guardians film are analyzed in this study since film is the manifestation of social consciousness and constitutes a reflection of reality and therefore can be subjected to an academic study.

Archetypal approach is used in this study as the process <b>of</b> rites <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> is universal. This study mainly uses Arnold van Gennep’s and William Bridges’ theories to identify the archetypal pattern of the process <b>of</b> rites <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> experienced by Jack Frost.

I argue that, if ontological change is needed to account for our experiences as <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> then there are other features of our experiences as <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> that a purely topological view does not have the resources to explain.
