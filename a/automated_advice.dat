The chapters yield a division in parts, and subdivisions in sections and subsections occur if necessary. Such a textbook can be modeled by a graph by taking the chapters, sections, and the other parts as nodes and the inclusions of one part in another as edges. In fact this graph is a tree, as each section can only appear in one chapter. However, in many cases the structure is more complicated than that of a tree. For instance, it might be that a particular section should be mastered before some other section in dierent chapter. So the latter depends on the rst, and we will encounter this dependency as a reference in the textbook. So we have in fact a seco [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Future {{air traffic}} control will {{have to rely on}} more {{advanced}} automation to support human controllers in their job of safely handling increased traffic volumes. A prerequisite for the success of such automation is that the data driving it are reliable. Current technology, however, still warrants human supervision in coping with (data) uncertainties and consequently in judging the quality and validity of machine decisions. In this study, ecological interface design was used to assist controllers in fault diagnosis of <b>automated</b> <b>advice,</b> using a prototype ecological interface (called the solution space diagram) for tactical conflict detection and resolution in the horizontal plane. Results from a human-in-the-loop simulation, in which sixteen participants were tasked with monitoring automation and intervening whenever required or desired, revealed a significant improvement in fault detection and diagnosis in a complex traffic scenario. Additionally, the experiment also exposed interesting interaction patterns between the participants and the advisory system, which seemed unrelated to the fault diagnosis task. Here, the explicit means-ends links appeared to have affected participants’ control strategy, which was geared toward taking over control from automation, regardless of the fault condition. This result suggests that in realizing effective human-automation teamwork, finding the right balance between offering more insight (e. g., through ecological interfaces) and striving for compliance with single (machine) advice is an avenue worth exploring further. </p...|$|E

We study the ordering behavior of retail store managers in a supermarket chain to characterize such deviations in ordering behavior and investigate their potential drivers. Using orders, shipments, and POS data for 19; 417 item-store combinations over 5 stores, we nd that store managers systematically modify <b>automated</b> order <b>advices</b> by advancing orders from peak to non-peak days. We show that order advancement is explained signicantly by hypothesized product characteristics, such as case-pack size relative to average demand per item, net shelf space, product variety, demand uncertainty, and seasonality error. Our results suggest that store managers add value. They improve upon the automated replenishment system by incorporating two ignored factors: in-store handling costs and sales improvement potential through better in-stock. We test a heuristic procedure, based on our regression results, to modify order advices to mimic the behavior of store managers. Our method performs better than the store managers by achieving a more balanced handling workload with similar average days of inventory...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>automated</b> <b>advice</b> provision in settings that involve repeated interactions between people and computer agents. This problem arises in many real world applications such as route selection systems and office assistants. To succeed in such settings agents must reason about how their actions in the present influence people’s future actions. This work models such settings as a family of repeated bilateral games of incomplete information called “choice selection processes”, in which players may share certain goals, but are essentially self-interested. The paper describes several possible models of human behavior that were inspired by behavioral economic theories of people’s play in repeated interactions. These models were incorporated into several agent designs to repeatedly generate offers to people playing the game. These agents were evaluated in extensive empirical investigations including hundreds of subjects that interacted with computers in different choice selections processes. The results revealed that an agent that combined a hyperbolic discounting model of human behavior with a social utility function was able to outperform alternative agent designs, including an agent that approximated the optimal strategy using continuous MDPs and an agent using epsilongreedy strategies to describe people’s behavior. We show that this approach was able to generalize to new {{people as well as}} choice selection processes that were not used for training. Our results demonstrate that combining computational approaches with behavioral economics models of people in repeated interactions facilitates the design of advice provision strategies for a large class of real-world settings...|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the rate of automation bias - the propensity of people to over rely on <b>automated</b> <b>advice</b> and the factors associated with it. Tested factors were attitudinal - trust and confidence, non-attitudinal - decision support experience and clinical experience, and environmental - task difficulty. The paradigm of simulated decision support advice within a prescribing context was used. Design: the study employed within participant before-after design, whereby 26 UK NHS General Practitioners were shown 20 hypothetical prescribing scenarios with prevalidated correct and incorrect answers - advice was incorrect in 6 scenarios. They were asked to prescribe for each case, followed by being shown simulated advice. Participants were then asked whether they wished to change their prescription, and the post-advice prescription was recorded. Measurements: rate of overall decision switching was captured. Automation bias was measured by negative consultations - correct to incorrect prescription switching. Results: participants changed prescriptions in 22. 5 % of scenarios. The pre-advice accuracy rate of the clinicians was 50. 38 %, which improved to 58. 27 % post-advice. The CDSS improved the decision accuracy in 13. 1 % of prescribing cases. The rate of automation bias, as measured by decision switches from correct pre-advice, to incorrect post-advice was 5. 2 % of all cases - a net improvement of 8 %. More immediate factors such as trust in the specific CDSS, decision confidence, and task difficulty influenced rate of decision switching. Lower clinical experience was associated with more decision switching. Age, DSS experience and trust in CDSS generally were not significantly associated with decision switching. Conclusions: this study adds to the literature surrounding automation bias {{in terms of its}} potential frequency and influencing factors. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of large data sets requires extensive computing resources and detailed {{knowledge about the}} analysis process itself. E-Science and Grid computing {{is an effort to}} provide computing resources for the scientific community and support collaborative research efforts. With the availability of integrated platforms that allow seamless communication and collaboration between researchers and access to distributed computing facilities, there is a strong case to add intelligent applications on top of these infrastructures that support and inform research activities and allow the automation of scientific workflows [1]. Providing an <b>automated</b> <b>advice</b> for scientists in their data analysis is not a new concern. Previous work has been conducted in the machine learning domain. Kodatoff et al. [3] and Sleeman et al. [4] describe an advisory system for this domain. The advisor uses a knowledge base that captures selection criteria for various machine learning algorithms. The central element of this system is a classification expert system, called Consultant, which interrogates the user about features of the learning task and recommends algorithms based on this information. Consultant shows the essential elements of an automated advisor in the machine-learning domain: information about the learning task (including characteristics of the data) is fed into a central knowledge base, which returns specific advice. The Consultant expert system is a typical “single-vendor ” monolithic tool. What we need today is an environment that accounts for the collaborative nature of research. The Web can be used to establish an advisory system that can be maintained by the research community. Consequently, the functionality of such a system is not established by a single group (organisation, company) but emerges from a collaborative effort of many people. This can be described as a “multivendor” scenario. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Computerised {{clinical}} {{decision support}} systems (CDSS) are implemented within healthcare settings as a method to improve clinical decision quality, safety and effectiveness, and ultimately patient outcomes. Though CDSSs tend to improve practitioner performance and clinical outcomes, relatively {{little is known about}} specific impact of inaccurate CDSS output on clinicians. Although there is high heterogeneity between CDSS types and studies, reviews of the ability of CDSS to prevent medication errors through incorrect decisions have generally been consistently positive, working by improving clinical judgement and decision making. However, it is known that the occasional incorrect advice given may tempt users to reverse a correct decision, and thus introduce new errors. These systematic errors can stem from Automation Bias (AB), an effect which has had little investigation within the healthcare field, where users have a tendency to use <b>automated</b> <b>advice</b> heuristically. Research is required to assess the rate of AB, identify factors and situations involved in overreliance and propose says to mitigate risk and refine the appropriate usage of CDSS; this can provide information to promote awareness of the effect, and ensure the maximisation of the impact of benefits gained from the implementation of CDSS. Background: A broader literature review was carried out coupled with a systematic review of studies investigating the impact of automated decision support on user decisions over various clinical and non-clinical domains. This aimed to identify gaps in the literature and build an evidence-based model of reliance on Decision Support Systems (DSS), particularly a bias towards over-using automation. The literature review and systematic review revealed a number of postulates - that CDSS are socio-technical systems, and that factors involved in CDSS misuse can vary from overarching social or cultural factors, individual cognitive variables to more specific technology design issues. However, the systematic review revealed there is a paucity of deliberate empirical evidence for this effect. The reviews identified the variables involved in automation bias to develop a conceptual model of overreliance, the initial development of an ontology for AB, and ultimately inform an empirical study to investigate persuasive potential factors involved: task difficulty, time pressure, CDSS trust, decision confidence, CDSS experience and clinical experience. The domain of primary care prescribing was chosen within which to carry out an empirical study, due to the evidence supporting CDSS usefulness in prescribing, and the high rate of prescribing error. Empirical Study Methodology: Twenty simulated prescribing scenarios with associated correct and incorrect answers were developed and validated by prescribing experts. An online Clinical Decision Support Simulator was used to display scenarios to users. NHS General Practitioners (GPs) were contacted via emails through associates of the Centre for Health Informatics, and through a healthcare mailing list company. Twenty-six GPs participated in the empirical study.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (a) explore the feasibility and acceptability of the Advanced Symptom Management System with patients with lung cancer receiving radiotherapy and clinicians involved in their care and (b) assess changes in patient outcomes during implementation of the Advanced Symptom Management System with patients with lung cancer receiving radiotherapy in clinical practice. METHODS: A repeated-measures, single-arm, mixed-methods study design was used involving poststudy interviews and completion of patient-reported {{outcome measures}} at baseline and end of treatment with 16 patients with lung cancer and 13 clinicians who used this mobile phone-based symptom monitoring system. RESULTS: Only rarely did patients report problems in using the handset and they felt that the system covered all relevant symptoms and helped them to manage their symptoms and effectively communicate with clinicians. Clinical improvements in patient anxiety, drowsiness, and self-care self-efficacy were also observed. Clinicians perceived the use of "real-time" risk algorithms and <b>automated</b> self-care <b>advice</b> provided to patients as positively contributing to clinical care. Reducing the complexity of the system was seen as important to promote its utility. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, these results suggest that monitoring patient symptoms using mobile technology in the context of radiotherapy for lung cancer is feasible and acceptable in clinical practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Future research would be most beneficial if the use of this technology was focused on the postradiotherapy phase and expanded the scope of the system to encompass a wider range of supportive care needs. <br/...|$|R

Therefore, we developed a theory-driven, Web-based, interactive, computer-tailored intervention aimed at reducing and interrupting sitting at work. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our {{study was to investigate}} the effects of this intervention on objectively measured sitting time, standing time, and breaks from sitting, as well as self-reported context-specific sitting among Flemish employees in a field-based approach. METHODS: Employees (n= 213) participated in a 3 -group randomized controlled trial that assessed outcomes at baseline, 1 -month follow-up, and 3 -month follow-up through self-reports. A subsample (n= 122) were willing to wear an activity monitor (activPAL) from Monday to Friday. The tailored group received an automated Web-based, computer-tailored intervention including personalized feedback and tips on how to reduce or interrupt workplace sitting. The generic group received an <b>automated</b> Web-based generic <b>advice</b> with tips. The control group was a wait-list control condition, initially receiving no intervention. Intervention effects were tested with repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: The tailored intervention was successful in decreasing self-reported total workday sitting (time × group: P<. 001), sitting at work (time × group: P<. 001), and leisure time sitting (time × group: P=. 03), and in increasing objectively measured breaks at work (time × group: P=. 07); {{this was not the case}} in the other conditions. The changes in self-reported total nonworkday sitting, sitting during transport, television viewing, and personal computer use, objectively measured total sitting time, and sitting and standing time at work did not differ between conditions.

40|$|Background: Web-based {{physical}} activity interventions that apply computer tailoring have shown to improve engagement and behavioral outcomes but provide limited accountability {{and social support}} for participants. It is unknown how video calls with a behavioral expert in a Web-based intervention will be received and whether they improve the effectiveness of computer-tailored advice. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of brief video-based coaching in addition to fully <b>automated</b> computer-tailored <b>advice</b> in a Web-based {{physical activity}} intervention for inactive adults. Methods: Participants were assigned to one of the three groups: (1) tailoring + video-coaching where participants received an 8 -week computer-tailored Web-based physical activity intervention (“My Activity Coach”) including 4 10 -minute coaching sessions with a behavioral expert using a Web-based video-calling program (eg, Skype; n= 52); (2) tailoring-only where participants received the same intervention without the coaching sessions (n= 54); and (3) a waitlist control group (n= 45). Demographics were measured at baseline, intervention satisfaction at week 9, and physical activity at baseline, week 9, and 6 months by Web-based self-report surveys. Feasibility was analyzed by comparing intervention groups on retention, adherence, engagement, and satisfaction using t tests and chi-square tests. Effectiveness was assessed using linear mixed models to compare physical activity changes between groups. Results: A total of 23 tailoring + video-coaching participants, 30 tailoring-only participants, and 30 control participants completed the postintervention survey (83 / 151, 55. 0 % retention). A low percentage of tailoring + video-coaching completers participated in the coaching calls (11 / 23, 48 %). However, the majority of those who participated in the video calls were satisfied with them (5 / 8, 71 %) and had improved intervention adherence (9 / 11, 82 % completed 3 or 4 modules vs 18 / 42, 43 %, P=. 01) and engagement (110 minutes spent on the website vs 78 minutes, P=. 02) compared with other participants. There were no overall retention, adherence, engagement, and satisfaction differences between tailoring + video-coaching and tailoring-only participants. At 9 weeks, physical activity increased from baseline to postintervention in all groups (tailoring + video-coaching: + 150 minutes/week; tailoring only: + 123 minutes/week; waitlist control: + 34 minutes/week). The increase was significantly higher in the tailoring + video-coaching group compared with the control group (P=. 01). No significant difference was found between intervention groups and no significant between-group differences were found for physical activity change at 6 months. Conclusions: Only small improvements were observed when video-coaching was added to computer-tailored advice in a Web-based physical activity intervention. However, combined Web-based video-coaching and computer-tailored advice was effective in comparison with a control group. More research is needed to determine whether Web-based coaching is more effective than stand-alone computer-tailored advice...|$|R
40|$|Background: Computer-assisted {{decision}} support is an emerging modality to assist patients with {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) in insulin self-titration (ie, self-adjusting insulin dose according to daily blood glucose levels). Computer-assisted insulin self-titration systems mainly focus on helping patients overcome barriers related to the cognitive components of insulin titration. Yet other (eg, psychological or physical) barriers could still impede effective use of such systems. Objective: Our primary aim was to identify experiences with and barriers to self-monitoring of blood glucose, insulin injection, and insulin titration among patients with T 2 DM. Our research team developed a computer-assisted insulin self-titration system, called PANDIT. The secondary {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate patients' perceptions of computer-assisted insulin self-titration. We included patients who used PANDIT in a 4 -week pilot study as well as patients who had never used such a system. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with patients on insulin therapy who were randomly recruited from a university hospital and surrounding general practices in the Netherlands. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed qualitatively. To classify the textual remarks, we created a codebook during the analysis, in a bottom-up and iterative fashion. To support examination of the final coded data, we used three theories from the field of health psychology and the integrated model of user satisfaction and technology acceptance by Wixom and Todd. Results: When starting insulin therapy, some patients feared a lifelong commitment to insulin therapy and disease progression. Also, many barriers arose when implementing insulin therapy (eg, some patients were embarrassed to inject insulin in public). Furthermore, patients had difficulties increasing the insulin dose because they fear hypoglycemia, they associate higher insulin doses with disease progression, and some were ignorant of treatment targets. Patients who never used a computer-assisted insulin self-titration system felt they had enough knowledge to know when their insulin should be adjusted, but still believed that the system advice would be useful to confirm their reasoning. Furthermore, the time and effort saved with <b>automated</b> insulin <b>advice</b> was considered an advantage. Patients who had used PANDIT found the system useful if their glycemic regulation improved. Nevertheless, for some patients, the absence of personal contact with their caregiver was a drawback. While guidelines state that adjustment of basal insulin dose based on fasting plasma glucose values is sufficient, both patients who had and those who had not used PANDIT felt that such a system should take more patient data into consideration, such as lifestyle and diet factors. Conclusions: Patients encounter multiple obstacles when implementing insulin therapy. Computer-assisted insulin self-titration can increase patient awareness of treatment targets and increase their confidence in self-adjusting the insulin dose. Nevertheless, some barriers may still exist when using computer-assisted titration systems and these systems could also introduce new barrier...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{randomized}} controlled trials, participants cannot choose their preferred intervention delivery mode and thus might refuse to participate or not engage fully if {{assigned to a}} nonpreferred group. This might underestimate the true effectiveness of behavior-change interventions. Objective: To examine whether receiving interventions either matched or mismatched with participants’ preferred delivery mode would influence effectiveness of a Web-based physical activity intervention. Methods: Adults (n = 863), recruited via email, {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three intervention delivery modes (text based, video based, or combined) and received fully <b>automated,</b> Internet-delivered personal <b>advice</b> about physical activity. Personalized intervention content, based on the theory of planned behavior and stages of change concept, was identical across groups. Online, self-assessed questionnaires measuring physical activity were completed at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month. Physical activity advice acceptability and website usability were assessed at 1 week. Before randomization, participants were asked which delivery mode they preferred, to categorize them as matched or mismatched. Time spent on the website was measured throughout the intervention. We applied intention-to-treat, repeated-measures analyses of covariance to assess group differences. Results: Attrition was high (575 / 863, 66. 6 %), though equal between groups (t 863 = 1. 31, P =. 19). At 1 -month follow-up, 93 participants were categorized as matched and 195 as mismatched. They preferred text mode (493 / 803, 61. 4 %) over combined (216 / 803, 26. 9 %) and video modes (94 / 803, 11. 7 %). After the intervention, 20 % (26 / 132) of matched-group participants and 34 % (96 / 282) in the mismatched group changed their delivery mode preference. Time effects were significant for all physical activity outcomes (total physical activity: F 2, 801 = 5. 07, P =. 009; number of activity sessions: F 2, 801 = 7. 52, P 2, 801 = 8. 32, P 2, 801 = 9. 53, P 2, 801 = 6. 04, P =. 002), indicating that physical activity increased over time for both matched and mismatched groups. Matched-group participants improved physical activity outcomes slightly more than those in the mismatched group, but interaction effects were not significant. Physical activity advice acceptability (content scale: t 368 =. 10, P =. 92; layout scale: t 368 = 1. 53, P =. 12) and website usability (layout scale: t 426 =. 05, P =. 96; ease of use scale: t 426 =. 21, P =. 83) were generally high and did not differ between the matched and mismatched groups. The only significant difference (t 621 = 2. 16, P =. 03) was in relation to total time spent on the website: the mismatched group spent significantly more time on the website (14. 4 minutes) than the matched group (12. 1 minutes). Conclusion: Participants’ preference regarding delivery mode may not significantly influence intervention outcomes. Consequently, allowing participants to choose their preferred delivery mode may not increase effectiveness of Web-based interventions...|$|R
40|$|Background: In recent years, {{the shift}} in cancer {{services}} from traditional tertiary care to care delivered within communities has increased the need for patients to engage in self-care activities {{in order to prevent}} or reduce the severity of numerous and complex-side effects (McCorkle et al., 2011) and make important health decisions when at home in the absence of clinicians (Butow et al., 2012). The actual degree of engagement in self-management may be dependent on patients’ perceived competence or self-efficacy to perform such activities (Fenlon et al., 2015). Self-efficacy has been defined as “a person’s belief to execute courses of action required to deal with a prospective situation” (Bandura, 1977, 2001). One’s beliefs in their capability to successfully manage tasks and consequently influence situations that impact their lives constitutes a central part of human agency, and can be influenced by performance accomplishments (Bandura, 1989, 2001). Whilst self-efficacy can enable engagement in self-management, actual participation in self-management activities can further increase one’s perceived ability to undertake such activities; it is thus obvious that a bi-directional association between self-management and self-efficacy exists. Supporting a shift in clinical practice with innovative technological systems affords a solution to the increasing demands placed on acute care by enabling the delivery of care in the home and community setting (Basch et al., 2011; Carpenter et al., 2008). Such remote monitoring systems facilitate the provision of clear lines of real-time communication between patients and their health care providers (Basch et al., 2011), and can deliver organised self-management advice tailored to the individual’s clinical characteristics and severity/distress of symptoms of anti-cancer treatment. Aim(s) : Funded by the European Union (FP 7 programme), a multi-centre European project (the eSMART study) has been designed to investigate the effects of an electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) system, the Advanced Symptom Management System (ASyMS), on patient outcomes including improvement in self-efficacy, symptom management, supportive care needs, psychological status, work presenteeism, and well-being; health system costs; and the current clinical practice. The primary aim of eSMART is to evaluate the short and long term impact of the ASyMS technology on patient reported outcomes in people with breast cancer, colorectal cancer or haematological malignancies receiving first-line chemotherapy. In addition, eSMART will evaluate the cost-benefit of remote patient-monitoring and changes in clinical practice {{as a result of the}} application of the ASyMS intervention in different European healthcare settings. The study is currently recruiting patients, thus no data will be available for presentation. This presentation will nonetheless aim to present and discuss the hypothesis that provision of symptom self-management advice may be an important mechanism to improve patient self-efficacy, which may establish a self-sustained cycle where self-care advice provision enables patient self-efficacy and this in turn further increases patient involvement in self-management that can ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. Method(s) /Results: The current study has been informed by the Medical Research Council Complex Interventions Framework (Anderson, 2008; Craig and Petticrew, 2012; Mackenzie et al., 2010), and the Holistic Framework to improve the Uptake and Impact of e-Health Technologies (van Gemert-Pijnen et al., 2011). The eSMART programme of work comprises two parts that will take place over a period of five years. The first part consists of preparatory work to refine the ASyMS intervention for use in a multi-national context, and concludes with a feasibility testing period to establish the technological readiness of the system prior to its use in the second part. The second part will employ a repeated-measures, parallel-group, stratified randomised controlled trial methodology to demonstrate the effects of the ASyMS intervention in supporting patients who receive chemotherapy treatment through individualised symptom management. The second part will test the short- (i. e. during the treatment phase) and long-term effects (i. e. at one-year follow-up) of the ASyMS intervention versus standard care across the participating countries (Austria, Greece, Ireland, Norway and the UK). The ASyMS intervention comprises use of a mobile phone (i. e. ASyMS patient handset) and a tympanic thermometer. The patient handset will enable participants on the intervention group to enter symptom/temperature data on a dedicated, electronic symptom questionnaire daily and whenever they feel unwell. Upon successful submission of their data, patients will immediately receive <b>automated,</b> evidence-based self-care <b>advice</b> based on their symptom reports. Patients will also have access to a self-care library, symptom graphs (detailing trends in individual symptoms experienced) and contact numbers of care teams and patient support organisations in their country, available within the ASyMS patient handset. Via dedicated tablet PCs, all participants will complete an electronic version of the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale for cancer (CASE-Cancer) (Wolf et al., 2005) at baseline; after each CTx; and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-chemotherapy treatment. The CASE-Cancer is a validated, 12 -item measure that yields scores on three factors: understanding and participating in care, maintaining a positive attitude, and seeking and obtaining information. In accordance with latest recommendations for pragmatic research in healthcare (Oakley et al., 2006; Treweek and Zwarenstein, 2009), the longitudinal nature of the trial will aid to establish sustainability of intervention effects and further stress its benefits when compared to standard care. Conclusions: This anticipatory model of care supports symptom management within the patient’s home, where the early toxicities of chemotherapy can be managed, utilising self-care and local community services. This model is also expected to contribute to the health literacy of patients with cancer in relation to early identification, report and self-management of their most common symptoms. As part of the project’s objectives, we will aim to show improved self-efficacy (as shown by statistically significantly higher self-efficacy scores) during active chemotherapy for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or haematological malignancies, and/or at one-year follow-up. It is hoped that an enhanced self-efficacy (evidenced by patients’ greater understanding and participation in care, positive attitude, and engagement in seeking health-related information) will in turn enable a smoother rehabilitation process for patients in the post-treatment survivorship period and beyond.
