5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E

25|$|Since the 2003 {{road map}} for peace, the current outline for a Palestinian–Israeli peace {{agreement}} has been <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Oslo {{peace process}} {{throughout}} the 1990s, as both sides obligated to work towards <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution,</b> Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization negotiated, unsuccessfully, {{and tried to}} reach to a mutual agreement.|$|E

25|$|On 18 October 2007, Adams {{was billed}} {{to perform in}} Tel Aviv and Jericho {{as part of the}} OneVoice Movement concerts, hoping to aid in solving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The peace concert for {{supporters}} of <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the conflict with Israel was called off because of security concerns.|$|E
5000|$|In a press release, the American Jewish Committee (AJC), {{a centrist}} American Jewish {{advocacy}} organization, affirming its conviction [...] "that Israel’s {{presence in the}} West Bank is based on solid legal ground, called on the Israeli government to reject {{the recommendations of the}} Levy Commission as a distraction from the ongoing quest for <b>a</b> negotiated <b>two-state</b> <b>solution...</b> If accepted by the government, the commission's findings would offer an unearned excuse for Palestinian resistance to a return to peace talks with Israel - talks Israel is eager to resume, without preconditions. And they would interfere with the message that Prime Minister Netanyahu and previous Israeli governments have sent for the last two decades of a profound commitment to <b>a</b> negotiated <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> that will require compromise by both sides. We hope the panel's recommendations will not be adopted".|$|R
50|$|Throughout its history, Israel Policy Forum has mobilized {{prominent}} Jewish {{leaders and}} American policymakers {{in support of}} pragmatic approaches to advancing Israel’s security alongside the pursuit of <b>a</b> lasting, negotiated <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.|$|R
5000|$|The {{push for}} a {{statehood}} resolution at the United Nations {{is seen as a}} result of growing frustration among Palestinians over the lack of progress in negotiations, and over the continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In 2008, The New York Times reported that, [...] "Even among the most moderate Palestinians, the credo of <b>a</b> negotiated <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is beginning to erode". Jewish scholar Abdallah Schleifer described [...] "a sense among Palestinians of almost desperation, that they are being left behind, that the focus for the achievement of <b>a</b> Palestinian <b>two-state</b> <b>solution,</b> <b>a</b> Palestinian state living alongside an Israeli state based on negotiations, has collapsed." [...] In August 2008, the Palestine Strategy Group, composed of government officials, researchers and advisers, published a new strategic position recommending that the leadership transfer the conflict to the United Nations. It stressed that, given the Israeli government's intransigence, the option of settling the conflict through bilateral negotiations was no longer available.|$|R
25|$|He was {{the founder}} {{and leader of the}} {{organization}} for peace in the Middle East Breira, A Project of Concern in Diaspora-Israel Relations, that supported <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Founded in 1973, the organization dissolved in 1977, having been the target of criticism from pro-Israel groups in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Habash was {{evicted from}} Jordan {{due to the}} key role of the Popular Front in the Black September clashes. In 1974, the Palestinian National Council adopted a {{resolution}} recognizing <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Habash, who opposed this, formed the Rejectionist Front from several other opposition parties.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on various}} points of view, a one-state {{solution}} to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict {{is presented as a}} situation in which Israel would ostensibly lose its character as a Jewish state and the Palestinians would fail to achieve their national independence within <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> or, alternatively, as the best, most just, and only way to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.|$|E
5000|$|Instead, {{they support}} a revolutionary socialist {{solution}} in the conflict, writing: [...] "A single state solution will be fought against {{to the death}} by the Israeli state, backed by their own working class. <b>A</b> capitalist <b>two-state</b> <b>solution,</b> as pushed {{by the likes of}} US and the EU, will be a Jewish dominated state with second-class rights and standards of living for the Palestinian masses. By far the best solution for working people and the poor in the region is <b>a</b> socialist <b>two-state</b> solution." ...|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{responded to}} the {{announcement}} by rebuking Israel for taking measures that were 'counter-productive' to the <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> in peace talks. Speaking anonymously, a U.S. State Department official, said the U.S. had requested of Israel that it reverse the decision since it contradicted [...] "Israel’s stated goal of <b>a</b> negotiated <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> with the Palestinians.” According to Israeli sources, the decision [...] "drove the Americans nuts", and the United States administration was mulling measures {{to respond to the}} declaration, which had not been cleared with them.|$|R
50|$|OneVoice {{was founded}} by {{entrepreneur}} Daniel Lubetzky {{in the spring of}} 2002 {{in the wake of the}} failure at the 2000 Camp David Summit and renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians. OneVoice emerged from Lubetzky's previous venture, Peaceworks,Inc., on the principle that economic cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians would result in stronger relations. OneVoice was to be a forum for moderate Israelis and Palestinians to express themselves and their desires for peace through <b>a</b> negotiated <b>two-state</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|R
25|$|In October 2007, Brownback {{announced}} {{his support for}} a plan designed by Benny Elon, chairman of Israel's right-wing NU/NRP party. Elon's positions include dismantling the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas and rejecting <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution.</b> The plan calls for the complete annexation of the West Bank by Israel, and the deportation of its Arab population to a new Palestinian state in present-day Jordan.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Intifada gave Arafat and his {{followers}} the confidence they needed to moderate their political programme: At {{the meeting of the}} Palestine National Council in Algiers in mid-November 1988, Arafat won a majority for the historic decision to recognise Israel's legitimacy; to accept all the relevant UN resolutions going back to 29 November 1947; and to adopt the principle of <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 12 March United Nations Security Council Resolution 1397 was passed, which reaffirmed <b>a</b> <b>Two-state</b> <b>solution</b> {{and laid}} the groundwork for a Road map for peace. Arab leaders, whose {{constituencies}} were exposed to detailed television coverage of the violence in the conflict, set out a comprehensive Arab Peace Initiative, which was outlined by Saudi Arabia on 28 March. Arafat endorsed the proposal, while Israel reacted coolly, virtually ignoring it.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the mission}} {{statement}} states [...] "The mission of JANIP {{is to bring}} together scholars, teachers, and administrators who reject the increasingly polarized debate surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Our goal is to bring a voice into the conversation - out of our identification with and commitment to Israel - that supports <b>a</b> negotiated <b>two-state</b> <b>solution,</b> <b>an</b> end to occupation, and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and bilaterally agreed-upon settlements in the West Bank.

2500|$|Rashid Khalidi {{wrote in}} 2011 that the one-state {{solution}} {{was already a}} reality, in that “there is only one state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, {{in which there are}} two or three levels of citizenship or non-citizenship within the borders of that one state that exerts total control.” Khalidi further argued that the [...] "peace process" [...] had been extinguished by ongoing Israeli settlement construction, and anyone who still believed it could result in <b>an</b> equitable <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> should have his [...] "head examined".|$|R
50|$|After having {{returned}} to Palestine at {{the outbreak of}} World War II, for several months Talbar joined the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force in 1940. In 1942 he became {{an officer in the}} Palestine Regiment of the British Army. There he became friends with Hazim el-Khalidi, who later was the commander of the Syrian Yarmouk Regiment in the Israel-Arab War 1948-1949, and Jordanian tourism director in Jerusalem until 1967. Despite the Arab-Israeli conflict Talbar and Khalidi stayed lifelong friends, advocating <b>a</b> peaceful <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israel-Palestine question.|$|R
25|$|On 2 June, Abbas again {{announced}} that if Hamas {{did not approve}} the prisoners' document—which calls for <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to the 1967 borders—within two days, he would present the initiative as a referendum. This deadline was subsequently extended until 10 June 2006. Hamas spokesmen stated that their stance would not change, and that Abbas is not constitutionally permitted to call a referendum, especially so soon after the January elections.|$|E
25|$|He {{has been}} {{critical}} of U.S. involvement in the Israel–Palestine conflict, arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement. Chomsky has long endorsed the left binationalist program, seeking to create a democratic state in the Levant {{that is home to}} both Jews and Arabs. However, acknowledging the realpolitik of the situation, Chomsky has also considered <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> on the condition that both nation-states exist on equal terms. As a result of his criticisms of Israel, Chomsky was barred from entering Israel in 2010.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, Davutoğlu brought <b>a</b> {{possible}} <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> of the Cyprus dispute to Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos after controversy erupted {{over the}} ownership of offshore oil reserves. The prospect was swiftly disregarded by the Greek foreign ministry. Davutoğlu also claimed that negotiations to resolve the dispute would accelerate {{under the leadership of}} Nikos Anastasiadis, who had supported the Annan Plan and had voted yes in the 2004 Annan Plan referendum. This, according to Davutoğlu, was in stark contrast to former Republic of Cyprus President Demetris Christofias, who had voted against. Davutoğlu has also expressed that any new possible solution {{does not need to be}} based on the Annan Plan.|$|R
