Rutger Hauer replaced Dave Brunt as the titular character, though Brunt does make a cameo as a corrupt cop.|$|E
5|$|These two adaptations {{received}} mainly positive reviews, {{with the}} general consensus being that they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being. Although Hobo with <b>a</b> <b>Shotgun</b> was not as big a box office success in the U.S. {{as it was in}} Canada, it has since gained a cult following there.|$|E

5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying <b>a</b> <b>shotgun.</b> (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E

Hašek was sentenced to five years {{imprisonment}} with the High Court in Olomouc arguing that the defense could not be legitimate, since the shot went through a side window rather than through the front windshield. Hašek was pardoned by President Klaus shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The {{rejection}} of their protest greatly upset the German forces, {{because they believed}} they were treated unjustly in the war. Shortly after the protest was rejected, Germany issued threats that they would punish all captured American soldiers that {{were found to be}} armed with <b>a</b> <b>shotgun.</b> This led to the United States issuing a retaliation threat, stating that any measures unjustly taken against captured American soldiers would lead to an equal act by the United States on captured German soldiers.|$|E

5|$|A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, a {{biologist}} named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit {{the town and}} have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike.

Ellsworth's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag, but they encountered the proprietor, James Jackson, as they descended the stairs. Jackson killed Ellsworth with <b>a</b> <b>shotgun</b> blast to the chest, and Cpl. Francis Brownell responded in kind by fatally shooting the innkeeper.|$|E
5|$|After {{the film}} was {{released}} on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In {{much of the rest}} of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on Grindhouses fake trailers: Machete, Machete Kills and Hobo with <b>a</b> <b>Shotgun.</b>|$|E

50|$|Globally, {{shotguns}} {{are generally}} not as heavily regulated as rifles or handguns, likely because they lack the range of rifles and are not easily concealable as handguns are; thus, they are perceived as a lesser threat by legislative authorities.
