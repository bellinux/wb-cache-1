25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{at the end of}} my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'."

She has explained, [...] " [...] is shady, but you still love her. She's still vulnerable. That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in high school {{it was the same}} for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool.

So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E

Fortescue Aland was one of the ten judges who held that George I did have the right to make decisions concerning the education and marriages of his grandchildren.

2500|$|Noel Gallagher was {{an early}} {{champion}} of the band, inviting them to support at Oasis’ historic Knebworth concerts, but from the outset of their career, Kula Shaker polarised UK media opinion. This arguably stemmed from age old British preconceptions about class and race.

Speaking {{in an interview in}} 2016, Mills says [...] "When I was in private schools, they called me 'common', <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in state schools they called me 'posh'.

[...] At the height of Britpop, and 'lager culture', music publications like Melody Maker, Select, and NME often focused on the class angle and ridiculed Kula's fascination with Indian culture. Mills commented in 2016: [...] "The musical styles on K are mainstream now. [...] people didn't know how to understand it or where to place it, so all that was left to do was deride it." ...|$|E
