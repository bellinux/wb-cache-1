5|$|I {{have never}} {{mentioned}} the boy's name except to Probyn, Montagu and Knollys {{when they were}} acting for me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they ought to know. Had they been wise, hearing what I knew and therefore what others knew, {{they ought to have}} hushed the matter up, instead of stirring it up as they did, with all the authorities.|$|E
5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E
5|$|We {{need people}} like , he fights the fight... He {{refused to take}} his anti-retroviral {{medication}} unless it was made affordable and available to everyone—a hugely courageous thing to do. Before then, I'd been frustrated because I wanted to be more hands-on. I just feel that TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that perhaps I might be well-placed to do it.|$|E

"And {{when it was}} done, Esther," [...] said my darling, [...] "I {{was always}} {{thinking}} how to tell you {{and what to do}} for the best. <b>And</b> sometimes <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you ought to know it directly, <b>and</b> sometimes <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you ought not to know it and keep it from my cousin John; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could not tell what to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fretted very much." ...|$|R

25|$|There {{were several}} {{embassies}} in the area.

25|$|In early 2011, {{eight of}} the more {{prominent}} editorial and technology staff members left AOL {{to build a new}} gadget site with CEO Jim Bankoff at SB Nation. On leaving, Joshua Topolsky, former Editor-in-chief, is quoted having said, “We have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we haven’t made a hire since I started running the site, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we could be more successful elsewhere”.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E

25|$|I {{remember}} {{as a child}} {{that she had a}} drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with {{the ups and downs of}} the business… As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

According to the director, [...] "I really liked him in Donnie Darko <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> He's an interesting double-sided coin. He {{can do that}} naive thing but he can also do possessed." [...] To prepare for his role, Gyllenhaal met Graysmith and videotaped him in order to study his mannerisms and behavior.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to Grand Rapids in 1946, Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters {{urged him to}} take on Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman.

500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album.

500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street.

The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> this kind of opens the whole thing up ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E
500|$|... "4-D" [...] expounded {{upon the}} budding {{relationship}} between Doggett and Reyes. Most of the two's romantic interactions {{were limited to}} [...] "flirtatious undercurrents" [...] because, according to Annabeth Gish, series creator Chris Carter [...] "was never big on the flamboyant big performances." [...] Robert Patrick later claimed that {{he came up with}} the scene wherein Reyes shaves a wounded Doggett. He noted, [...] "I'd read The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, and I believe there's a part of that in the book where the character gets shaved, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Wow, that's really an intimate kind of moment.'" ...|$|E
