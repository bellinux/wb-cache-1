The representation created by Guercino emphasizes Petronilla's devotion to God above all, {{but also to}} the Church and the reward with which she met upon her death.

40|$|Two <b>axis</b> optical MEMS <b>mirrors</b> find use in many {{applications}} including raster scanning, image projection, optical networking, bio-medical imaging, etc. In all these applications micro-mirrors are employed to steer {{a beam of}} light. While successive single <b>axis</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{may be used to}} steer the beam along multiple axes, a single two-axis mirror provides a simpler, more compact and inexpensive alternative. In this document, we present a two-axis optical scanning mirror design based on a novel resonant structure that provides optimal raster scanning action. The two scanning axes are orthogonal and are designed to be highly decoupled. Furthermore, translational errors of the mirror are eliminated by using the principle of virtual pivot for cantilever beams. PZT electrodes are employed to excite the structure at the frequencies that correspond to its two desired natural vibration modes. A simple fabrication process flow allows for mass production of the device. Detailed analysis is provided to support the performance claims of the device...|$|R

Place fields were smaller and sharper in proximal CA 3 than in distal CA 3 and CA 2.

These FPI instruments {{follow the same}} design indicated in Fig. 2, but are equipped with 31 cm focal length lenses that generate 11.6 rings on the 1024 × 1024 CCD chip with 13 micron pixels. A double <b>axis</b> <b>mirror</b> system is used to direct light from the 630.0 -nm nightglow layer into the etalon. The incoming light is filtered by a 77 -mm diameter 630.0 -nm filter {{placed in front of}} the 70 -mm diameter etalon. By rotating the skyscanner to the correct azimuth and zenith angles at intervals of ~ 20 minutes, light from a HeNe frequency-stabilized laser is passed into the FPI etalon for calibration of the instrument function and the etalon stability. A thermal controller maintains the etalon temperature to within 0.1 °, and typically, there is no more than 10 – 15 m s− 1 drift exhibited over ten hours of operation.|$|R

40|$|Optical freeforms are {{increasingly}} gaining interest for optical systems like telescopes and spectrometers. This {{is a key}} topic of discussions for many years; however, the manufacturing process of freeform optics remains a challenging task whose complexity derives from the missing symmetry in freeform surfaces. Ultra-precise manufacturing with diamond tools is an appropriate method to realize optical freeforms. Aspherical off <b>axis</b> <b>mirrors</b> machined similar to freeform or classical freeform mirrors like anamorphic mirrors can be fabricated in a deterministic process by using reference structures and correction loops. Diamond machining offers an excellent technology {{to meet the requirements}} regarding small values of surface deviation and low tolerances of position accuracy. Nevertheless, the typical micro-roughness of approximately 5 nm rms and the periodic turning structure set the limitation for diamond machined surfaces. The surfaces fulfill requirements for application in the Near Infrared (NIR) and Infrared (IR) spectral ranges, respectively. For smoothing the periodic structure, the diamond turning is combined with post polishing techniques like MRF (Magnetorheological Finishing) or computer assisted polishing. Therefore, the aluminum mirror has to be coated with amorphous nickel-phosphorous or silicon. Thus, the specification of applications in the visible (VIS) spectral range is reached. This process chain is interesting for a growing number of multi- and hyperspectral imaging devices such as telescopes and spectrometers based on all reflective metal optics. The paper summarizes the fabrication of an optical bench for a high resolution IR telescope, discusses the results of post polishing mirrors for VIS telescopes, and shows an efficient and easy snap-together alignment strategy.

The estimation of vanishing directions is also achieved simultaneously. With the mirror parameters provided, the central catadioptric system can be fully calibrated using the projected mirror boundary. Once the system is fully calibrated, the problem of conic fitting is reduced from five parameters to two parameters.
