25|$|Sometimes {{the town}} might cease to officially exist, but the {{physical}} infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities {{that had to}} be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room school house. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of Weston, Illinois, that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Many houses <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off {{at the edges of the}} property, with gatehouses or simply barricades to prevent unsupervised access.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{differences}} in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often {{not the case for}} music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC60268-4.|$|E
25|$|Puccini left {{instructions}} that Riccardo Zandonai should finish the opera. Puccini's son Tonio objected, and eventually Franco Alfano {{was chosen to}} flesh out the sketches after Vincenzo Tommasini (who had completed Boito's Nerone after the composer’s death) and Pietro Mascagni were rejected. Puccini's publisher Tito Ricordi II decided on Alfano because his opera La leggenda di Sakùntala resembled Turandot in its setting and heavy orchestration. Alfano provided a first version of the ending with a few passages of his own, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> sentences added to the libretto which was not considered complete even by Puccini himself. After the severe criticisms by Ricordi and the conductor Arturo Toscanini, {{he was forced to}} write a second, strictly censored version that followed Puccini's sketches more closely, {{to the point where he}} did not set some of Adami's text to music because Puccini had not indicated how he wanted it to sound. Ricordi's real concern was not the quality of Alfano's work, but that he wanted the end of Turandot to sound as if it had been written by Puccini, and Alfano's editing had to be seamless. Of this version, about three minutes were cut for performance by Toscanini, and it is this shortened version that is usually performed.|$|E

500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E

500|$|The {{continued}} resupply {{of horses}} {{was a major}} issue of the war. One estimate puts the number of horses that served in World War I at around six million, with {{a large percentage of}} them dying due to war-related causes. In 1914, the year the war began, the British Army owned only about 25,000 horses. This shortfall required the US to help with remount efforts, even before it had formally entered the war. Between 1914 and 1918, the US sent almost one million horses overseas, and another 182,000 were taken overseas with American troops. [...] This deployment seriously depleted the country's equine population. Only 200 returned to the US, and 60,000 were killed outright. By the middle of 1917, Britain had procured 591,000 horses and 213,000mules, as well as almost 60,000camels and oxen. Britain's Remount Department spent £67.5million on purchasing, training and delivering horses and mules to the front. The British Remount Department became a major multinational business and a leading player in the international horse trade, through supplying horses to not only the British Army but also to Canada, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> to the US. Shipping horses between the US and Europe was both costly and dangerous; American Expeditionary Force officials calculated that almost seven times as much room was needed per ton for animals than for average wartime cargo, and over 6,500horses and mules were drowned or killed by shell fire on Allied ships attacked by the Germans. In turn, New Zealand lost around 3percent of the nearly 10,000horses shipped to the front during the war.|$|E
500|$|Baba himself {{maintained}} an ambiguous profile, unwilling {{to identify with}} {{either of the two}} religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: [...] "You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?" [...] Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing: Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was [...] "Allah rakhega vaiia rahena", that is, [...] "Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah." [...] On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the variety of content on the album.

[...] In addition, Random Access Memories is ranked #497 on NMEs list, [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork echoed this sentiment, calling the record [...] "a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic". Richardson praised the engineering and recording on the album, but did say that [...] "though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more 'human,' the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect." [...] Pitchfork deemed the album the seventh best of 2013. DJ Magazine {{commented on the}} shift in Daft Punk's musical style: [...] "While Daft Punk clearly {{want to move on}} and evolve, ditching the electronic beats, house and techno that first elevated them to fame, it's that music that forms the bedrock of their best tunes, and still, that's what they're best at making." [...] Resident Advisor stated that [...] "it's an album rooted in a now-ancient aesthetic: '70s staples, like crisply recorded California studio music, or the kind of deceptively sophisticated New York disco that , one of the album's key guest artists, popularized with Chic." [...] In a four-and-a-half star review, Heather Phares of AllMusic said that the record [...] "taps into the wonder and excitement" [...] of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. Phares concluded her review by saying, [...] "Random Access Memories is also Daft Punk's most personal work, and richly rewarding for listeners willing to spend time with it." ...|$|E
