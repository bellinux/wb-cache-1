50|$|An <b>acrochordon</b> (plural acrochorda; also skin tag, skin polyp, fibroepithelial polyp, fibrovascular papilloma, soft fibroma, fibroma molle) {{is a small}} {{benign tumor}} that forms {{primarily}} {{in areas where the}} skin forms creases, such as the neck, armpit, and groin. They may also occur on the face, usually on the eyelids. Perianal skin tags can be associated with Crohn's disease. Acrochorda are generally harmless and painless, and usually do not grow or change over time. Though tags up to a half-inch long have been seen, they are typically the size of a grain of rice. The surface of an <b>acrochordon</b> may be smooth or irregular in appearance and is often raised {{from the surface of the}} skin on a fleshy stalk called a peduncle.

40|$|Background and Design: Although {{the effects}} of obesity on the skin are known, there are no {{adequate}} studies on this subject. To evaluate obesity-related dermatoses in obese and overweight people and to compare the obtained results with those of individuals with body mass index (BMI) lower than 25 kg/m 2. Material and methods: A total of 500 (mean age: 43. 6 ± 12. 8; 318 female, 182 male) volunteer patients aged 18 years and older, who were treated in inpatient clinics except dermatology, and their relatives {{were included in the}} study. The subjects were grouped according to BMI: less than 25 kg/m 2 (controls, n = 120), 25 - 29. 9 kg/m 2 (overweights, n= 130), and greater than 30 kg/m 2 (obeses, n= 250). The participants were examined dermatologically and all known skin diseases associated with obesity were noted. Results: The total number of dermatoses was statistically higher in obeses and overweights than in controls, as well as in obeses than in overweights. The five most frequently seen dermatoses in all groups were: varicose vein, tinea pedis, striae distensae, <b>acrochordon</b> and onychomycosis, respectively. There were statistically significant differences: between obeses and controls with regard to varicose vein, tinea pedis, striae distensae, <b>acrochordon,</b> onychomycosis, acanthosis nigricans and intertrigo; between overweights and controls with respect to varicose vein, tinea pedis, striae distensae, <b>acrochordon</b> and onychomycosis; between obeses and overweights with regard to striae distensae, acanthosis nigricans and onychomycosis. A positive correlation was detected between BMI and degree of plantar hyperkeratosis in all participants; between BMI and hirsutism score, severity of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and cellulite in women. Conclusion: While acanthosis nigricans and AGA in females were associated with obesity, the other dermatoses were related with not only with obesity but also with increasing weight gain...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To study an {{association}} between <b>acrochordon</b> and human papilloma virus (HPV) using quantitative analysis of viral desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); to detect different phenotypes of beta-HPV. Materials and methods: We examined 52   patients (22 immuno-suppressed patients and 30 immunocompetent subjects) in the Dermatovenereology and Dermato-Oncology Department and Chronic Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation Department of the Moscow Regional Research and Clinical Institute (MONIKI). Control group included 49 healthy donors. Burr biopsy samples (micro-samples) of <b>acrochordon</b> and intact skin (apper arm) were collected in sterile conditions. After sample procession and DNA isolation using DNK-sorb-C kit (Central Research Institute for Epidemiology – CRIE), polymerase chain reaction for HPV was performed with real-time fluorescent hybridization detection. For DNA amplification and detection we used RotorGene 3000 analyzer (Corbett Research, Australia). In the beta-HPV assay, recombinant plasmids were used as positive controls and control human beta-globin gene fragments (CRIE). 4 oligo-nucleotide systems (group-specific primers and probes) {{were used for the}} detection of beta-HPV DNA. Results: Preliminary data indicated that acrochordons of open and covered skin regions were common in renal transplant recipients. Beta-HPV DNA was more frequent in acrochordons and intact skin (64 % and 54 %) of renal transplant recipients compared to healthy donors (47 %). 57 % of renal transplant recipients demonstrated mixed infection in acrochordons.

40|$|Background: Polycystic ovarian {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is a heterogenous {{collection of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that when gathered, form a spectrum of disorder with disturbance of reproductive, endocrine and metabolic functions. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to correlate the skin manifestations with hormonal changes and to know the incidence and prevalence of skin manifestations in patients with PCOS. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 patients with PCOS were examined during 1 year time period from May 2008 P to May 2009. Detailed clinical history was taken from each patient. PCOS was diagnosed on the basis of ultrasonography. Hormonal assays included fasting blood sugar, postprandial blood sugar, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, dehydroepiandrostenedione, prolactin, free testosterone, fasting lipid profile and sex hormone binding globulin. The results obtained were statistically correlated. Results: In our study, the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations was 90 %. Of all the cutaneous manifestations acne was seen in highest percentage (67. 5 %), followed by hirsutism (62. 5 %), seborrhea (52. 5 %), androgenetic alopecia (AGA) (30 %), acanthosis nigricans (22. 5 %) and <b>acrochordons</b> (10 %). Fasting insulin levels was the most common hormonal abnormality seen in both acne and hirsutism, whereas AGA was associated with high testosterone levels.

40|$|Abstract Objective : The aim of {{this study}} was to perform a {{systematic}} review of the major skin diseases affecting obese individuals and their influence on physical activity. Methods : Relevant articles were identified by systematically searching PubMed from 2000 to 2014, using the descriptors "skin diseases" and "obesity", "skin disease" and "obesity", "skin diseases" and "physical activity", "skin disease" and "physical activity". The PEDro Scale (in Brazilian Portuguese) was used to rate the methodological quality of the studies. Results : A total of 320 articles were examined in the first phase. In the end, 11 articles met the proposed criteria and were included for analysis in the systematic review. We investigated cutaneous manifestations of diseases and classified them according to their effects under 5 categories: metabolic (n = 10), aesthetic (n = 7), inflammatory (n = 6), mechanical (n = 5) and infectious (n = 3). The most frequent dermatoses among obese were acanthosis nigricans, <b>acrochordon</b> (skin tags), stretch marks, plantar keratodermia, intertrigo, bacterial and fungal infections. Acanthosis nigricans was found to be the most important metabolic implication of obesity. Conclusion : Although neglected, skin lesions are common in obesity and have implications for physical activity because they cause pain, discomfort, friction, infection, inflammation, embarrassment, limitation or difficulty of movement. Strategies to promote skin health may result in a better integration of physical activity into routine therapy and improve the quality of life of obese individuals...|$|E

Aim: To study the impact of control of diabetes on the pattern of cutaneous disorders. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study of patients attending diabetic clinic in a tertiary care hospital. A total of 500 consecutive patients were studied. Detailed history, clinical examination and relevant investigations were done to diagnose diabetic complications and cutaneous disorders. Dermatoses with or without known pathogenesis were correlated with age, gender, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), duration of diabetes, and complications of DM. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student "t" test and Chi-square test with 5 % confidence interval (P value 0. 05). Results: Majority of patients had well-controlled (FPG 0. 05) between the patients with or without DM specific cutaneous disorders was noticed with reference to age and gender distribution, duration of DM and FPG. Signs of insulin resistance, <b>acrochordon</b> (26. 2 %), and acanthosis nigricans (5 %) were common, followed by fungal (13. 8 %) and bacterial (6. 8 %) infections. Eruptive xanthoma (0. 6 %), diabetic foot (0. 2 %), diabetic bulla (0. 4 %), diabetic dermopathy (0. 2 %), generalized granuloma annulare (0. 2 %), and insulin reactions (6. 2 %) and lipodystrophy (14 %) were also seen.

40|$|T H E ASSOCIATION of {{dermatologic}} disorders with under-lying visceral disease, especially neoplasms, is {{well known}} (1, 2). Recent reports, one in patients with acromegaly (3) and another {{in a series of}} male patients (4), have suggested that skin tags may indicate the presence of ade-nomatous polyps of the colon. We undertook our study to test these findings in a population of both men and women over a wide age range. One hundred consecutive patients having colonoscopy were prospectively evaluated over a 3 -month period. Before colonos-copy, patients were examined for the presence of at least one skin tag (<b>acrochordon).</b> Tags were identified as fleshy, papillo-matous growths of flesh or darker hue that were at least 2 mm in height and diameter. Tags tended to appear in the anterior cervical region, axillae, and groin and beneath pendulous breasts. Patients who had had colonic resection, those with known colonic carcinoma, and those who had had previous polypectomy were excluded. Data were analyzed by the chi-square test corrected for conti-nuity, age, and sex. Odds ratios were calculated for the entire sample as well as for age and sex subgroups. In fourfold tables, the association between the presence of skin tags and colonic polyps was used to derive the sensitivity, specificity, false-positive and false-negative rates, and the positive- and negative-predictive values.

40|$|Abstract. Nevus lipomatosus {{cutaneous}} superficialis (NLCS) is {{an extremely}} rare hamartomatous disorder comprising of ectopic mature adipose tissue. The lesions {{take the form of}} large, slow-growing, sessile or pedunculated tumors. We report the case of an 11 -year-old boy with NLCS, dating back many months, that was growing as a cuff around the parotid duct. The lesion was successfully removed by diode laser excision (980 nm) and a diagnosis of NLCS was rendered. At one-year follow-up the tumor has not recurred. To our knowledge this is the first report of NLCS in the oral cavity; the characteristic clinical and morphological features aided in the diagnosis of this hamartoma. The peculiarity of this case is its location; the extreme rarity of NLCS, in general, probably makes this case unique. Nevus lipomatosus cutaneous superficialis (NLCS) is an idiopathic hamartomatous disorder characterized by an ectopic mature adipose tissue in the dermis, which was first described by Hoffmann and Zurhelle in 1912 (1). The lesions usually appear at birth, or during the first 2 - 3 decades of life. Neither gender preference nor familiality has been reported (2). Clinically, two variants have been described: classical (Hoffman–Zurhelle) and solitary. The classical variant consists of multiple, asymptomatic, soft, yellowish lesions that may coalesce to form a plaque with smooth, wrinkled, orange-peel appearance, or with cerebriform surface, with or without the presence of comedones and follicular orifices (3, 4). The solitary type appears between the third and fifth decade of life and manifests as an isolated, domed, or sessile papule. The base is broader than of the common skin tag (<b>acrochordon).</b> Lesions are usually unilateral with a linear or zosteriform pattern, and can occur anywhere on the body, with a predilection for the abdomen, back, buttocks, hips, upper posterior thigh and pelvic girdle (1 - 12). Atypical sites include the face, auricle and neck (13). Lesions can occasionally reach 20 × 30 cm in size, forming linear plaques along the skin folds (8). They may be associated with café-au-lait spots, hypopigmented spots, presence of hair, with ulceration and necrosis; Fordyce’s angiokeratomas have also been reported (14). To our knowledge, this is the first report of NLCS in the oral cavity. The clinical and histopathological profile is described...|$|E

5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and <b>acrochordons</b> (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|R
5|$|Other tumors {{can include}} trichodiscomas (tumors {{of the hair}} disc, which may be {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} <b>acrochordons</b> (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax.|$|R
