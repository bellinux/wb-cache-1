Archie <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might share Jiminy's {{personality}} and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother.

The jury found him not guilty after deliberating for four days.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the debtor offers a lesser sum in {{settlement}} and expressly or by implication {{admits that he}} owes the full debt, he commits an act of insolvency, because he tacitly <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> cannot pay the debt (Laeveldse Kooperasie Bpk v Joubert).|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} All-New, All-Different Marvel event, Amadeus Cho {{became the}} new Hulk. Flashbacks {{revealed}} that the Hulk had absorbed a dangerous new type of radiation while helping Iron Man and the Black Panther deal with a massive accident on Kiber Island. Fearing the Hulk's meltdown would kill countless innocents, Cho {{was able to use}} special nanites to absorb the Hulk from Banner and take it into himself to become his own version of the Hulk, leaving Banner normal and free from the Hulk. He is then rescued from a bar fight by Amadeus, who tells him that he is cured. Having confirmed that he can no longer transform or sense the Hulk, Bruce spends some time travelling across America taking various risks such as driving at high speeds, running away from a bear, or gambling in Las Vegas, until he is confronted by Tony Stark out of concern that Bruce has a death wish. Bruce instead <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> still harbors guilt and rage over how so many of the Hulk's rampages were provoked by various agencies refusing to leave him alone.|$|E

500|$|Jackson <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has had the}} {{benefits}} of privilege and opportunity and says that his hobbies include fencing, hunting and fishing, especially salmon fishing. [...] He often enjoys these hobbies in bipartisan friendships that include Dick Armey and regarded the late Republican Rep. Henry Hyde {{as one of his}} closest friends. [...] In fact, Armey points to Jackson as an example of his ability to work with politicians at all ends of the political spectrum. [...] Jackson also has a very good relationship with Republican United States President George W. Bush despite their sharp ideological differences. [...] The relationship traces back to when Jackson Sr. and United States President-Elect George H. W. Bush met to discuss a range of issues while Jackson Jr. and his siblings Santita and Jonathan had an hour-and-a-half luncheon with future president George W. [...] He also developed a relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton that enabled him to watch Super Bowl XXXIII at Camp David with them.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{an often}} laid back and sarcastic demeanor, Raynor is {{described}} in the novel Liberty's Crusade as a decent and honorable man that is well liked by those under his command. Robert Clotworthy noted that as such, Raynor is always {{willing to do the}} right thing, no matter how difficult it may be. His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan—the series' main antagonist—despite his former love for her early in the story arc is one of the sacrifices that in Clotworthy's eyes makes Raynor a [...] "true hero in the purest sense of the word". He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause, willing to put it all at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves. It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted. Although often displaying an overzealous attitude, Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day, even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into a bad situation. Raynor himself <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not the most intelligent man there is, but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds.|$|E
500|$|Later, two {{government}} physicists {{show up at}} Chris' mansion {{to announce}} that Sonic's' world and Earth were once a single world split in two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly, {{and the only way}} to stop it is to send the anthropomorphic people back home. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport Sonic and company back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all their friends but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the machine down and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide out of fear his parents will return to never being home once Sonic is gone. Sonic is understanding, yet teaches Chris that as a fellow person neither can force the other to feel a certain way and that their friendship is free will. [...] Chris tearfully <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> bound Sonic's freedom today and stopped his friend from going back home and remorsefully asks for forgiveness while Sonic tells him he'll be able to be strong even without him being there. [...] Chris' parents find him and promise to spend more time with him. Chris having learned his lesson and grown as a person goes for one final run with Sonic before they mutually part ways and Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds. However, Chris vows that one day, he will see Sonic again.|$|E

500|$|Fenton {{arrives at}} the oak tree and sings of his {{happiness}} ("Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola" [...] / [...] "From my lips, a song of ecstasy flies") ending with [...] "Lips that are kissed lose none of their allure." [...] Nannetta enters to finish the line with [...] "Indeed, they renew it, like the moon." [...] The women arrive and disguise Fenton as a monk, telling him that they have arranged to spoil Ford's and Caius's plans. Nannetta, as the Fairy Queen, instructs her helpers ("Sul fil d'un soffio etesio" [...] / [...] "On the breath of a fragrant breeze, fly, nimble spirits") before all the characters arrive on the scene. Falstaff's attempted love scene with Alice is interrupted by the announcement that witches are approaching, and the men, disguised as elves and fairies, soundly thrash Falstaff. At length he recognises Bardolfo in disguise. The joke is over, and Falstaff <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has received his due. Ford announces that a wedding shall ensue. Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter. A second couple, also in masquerade, ask Ford to deliver the same blessing for them as well. Ford conducts the double ceremony. Caius finds that instead of Nannetta, his bride is the disguised Bardolfo, and Ford has unwittingly blessed the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta. Ford accepts the fait accompli with good grace. Falstaff, pleased to find himself not the only dupe, proclaims in a fugue, which the entire company sings, that all the world is folly, and all are figures of fun (Tutto nel mondo è burla... Tutti gabbati! / [...] "Everything {{in the world is}} a jest...").|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the book when Cal discusses his family's history and actions prior to his birth, he speaks in an androgynous voice, with limited omniscience; he <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is fabricating some of the details. John Mullan, University College London's professor of English and a contributor to The Guardian, wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters' thoughts, Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction. In the novel's closing pages, Cal provides minute details about his father's dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother. Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male, his identity is not confined by his own body. According to Mullan, this [...] "mobility of identification becomes a narrative principle" [...] and is thoroughly exploited in Middlesex. The novel follows the principle that people are molded by events prior to their birth, and Eugenides explores a character's prenatal life in terms of his or her genes; the narrator is, however, subject to the principle that whatever he does not know is of his imagination. As such, contradictory statements highlight the unreliable nature of Cal's narration. While narrating the story that pre-dates his birth, he remarks, [...] "Of course, a narrator in my position (prefetal at the time) can't be entirely sure about any of this." [...] However, he later says, [...] "I alone, from the private box of my primordial egg, saw what was going on." [...] Cal's dubious omniscience, doubtful narration, and parodies combine to show that his unreliability is an act of mischief.|$|E
2500|$|Fletcher {{has said}} that the {{accident}} changed his political views. [...] He <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "didn't give the less-fortunate any consideration" [...] before 1996, but now describes himself as a [...] "compassionate conservative".|$|E

2500|$|I {{will not}} debate Finkelstein. I have a longstanding policy against debating Holocaust deniers, revisionists, trivializers or minimizers. Nor {{is a serious}} debate about Israel {{possible}} with someone who <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows [...] "very little" [...] about that country. I {{will be happy to}} debate any legitimate experts from Amnesty International or any other human rights organization. Indeed, I have a debate scheduled with Noam Chomsky about these issues in the fall [...]|$|E
2500|$|Steven Weinberg {{rejects the}} {{argument}} about the fine-tuning of the carbon cycle, arguing that [...] "the fine-tuning of the constants of nature here does not seem so fine". He <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> currently has no explanation (apart from a multiverse) for the smallness of the cosmological constant, but cautions that [...] "It is {{still too early to}} tell whether there is some fundamental principle that can explain why the cosmological constant must be this small." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Anthony {{tried to}} speak at the New York State Teachers' Association meeting in 1853, her attempt sparked a half-hour debate among the men about whether it was proper for women to speak in public. Finally allowed to continue, Anthony said, [...] "Do you not see that so long as society says a woman is incompetent to be a lawyer, minister, or doctor, but has ample ability to be a teacher, that every man of you who chooses this {{profession}} tacitly <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has no more brains than a woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|By convention, {{dismissal}} {{decisions are}} handled {{primarily by the}} players – thus if the dismissal is obvious the batsman will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss him. If the batsman and fielding side disagree about a dismissal then the fielding side must appeal to the umpire who will then decide whether the batsman is out. In competitive cricket, many difficult catching and LBW decisions will {{be left to the}} umpire; if a batsman <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is out in such cases and departs without waiting for the umpire's decision it is known as [...] "walking", and regarded as an honourable but controversial act.|$|E
2500|$|When elected {{governor}} of Arkansas, Huckabee was obese. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with type 2 diabetes, and {{informed him that}} he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135kg). Coupled with the death of former Governor Frank D. White (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating a healthier diet and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50kg). The New York Times called the weight loss so rapid that [...] "it was as if he simply unzipped a fat suit and stepped out." ...|$|E
