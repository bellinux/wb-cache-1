Later with packing complete, Rachel finally refuses to move as Frank and Alice come by with another pregnancy test. The boys and the girls begin to argue along with Ross, which is cut short when Phoebe emerges from the bathroom and joyfully announces she is pregnant, the mood turning to one of celebration.|$|E
5|$|Casting for {{the role}} of Maisie took eight weeks. Casting {{director}} Avy Kaufman suggested about 100 young girls to McGehee and Siegel while the directors independently visited New York elementary schools to hold auditions. Six-year-old Onata Aprile auditioned relatively late, and was cast three weeks before production started. She met with two of her adult co-stars, Julianne Moore and Alexander Skarsgård, for a brief rehearsal period before filming began. Moore, who had read the film's script before directors McGehee and Siegel, was anxious <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> sing as part of her role. She prepared by meeting with music producer Peter Nashel, singer Elaine Caswell, and Alison Mosshart, the lead singer of The Kills, whose songs Moore performed in the film.|$|E

5|$|In the inaugural, non-ranking Northern Ireland Trophy, {{he reached}} the quarter-finals before he was {{defeated}} 4–5 by Neil Robertson. In the first three ranking events of the season—the Grand Prix, the UK Championship, and the Malta Cup—{{he reached the}} last 16, losing final-frame matches to Bingham, Robertson, and Graeme Dott, respectively. After his loss to Bingham, he complained <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> play his match on an outside table, given his world champion status. In the revival of Pot Black, a single-frame knockout tournament not staged since 1991, Murphy was defeated in the final by Stevens. Murphy was awarded Sportsman of the Year at the BBC East Midlands Sports Awards in December 2005.|$|E
5|$|Many {{men in the}} SWPA {{believed}} that the demobilisation process was too slow. On 10December 1945 4,500 men at Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies staged a protest march demanding that shipping {{be made available to}} return them to Australia. Soldiers at Bougainville also complained <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> remain on the island after the war had ended, and Prime Minister Ben Chifley's plane was sabotaged in an apparent protest during his visit on 27December 1945. Minister for Defence Frank Forde was largely blamed for the slowness with which military personnel were being demobilised. As a result, he lost his seat at the 1946 election, though the Labor Party itself comfortably retained office.|$|E

At the same time, Jeannie, {{frustrated}} that the entire school believes Ferris has come down with a deathly illness, skips class and returns home to confront him, only to hear someone outside trying to break-in. Rooney flees while she calls the police; when they arrive, they arrest her for filing a false report, and contact her mother to collect her. While waiting, she meets a juvenile delinquent, who advises her not to worry so much about Ferris. Mrs. Bueller arrives at the station, upset <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> forgo a house sale, only to find Jeannie kissing the delinquent, infuriating her more.|$|E

5|$|In early March 2006, Helms {{suffered}} a broken nose. After complaining to Long <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> wrestle on the March 10 episode of SmackDown!, Long told Helms {{that he did}} not have to defend his title, but put Helms in a champion versus champion match against the United States Champion, Chris Benoit. During the match, Helms attempted to leave, but was blocked by other cruiserweights who threw Helms back into the ring, resulting in Helms losing the match. Helms underwent successful surgery on his nose and was expected to miss five to six weeks. During this time SmackDown! announcers stated that Helms had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury. Helms returned to the ring on the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, teaming with MNM to face Super Crazy, London and Kendrick in a six-man tag team match. Helms continued to defend his belt during pay-per-views, but he made more regular appearances on SmackDown!s sister show, Velocity.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{traffic on}} the GCR was never heavy {{because it was the}} last main line to be built and had {{difficulty}} competing against longer-established rivals (especially the Midland Railway from its terminal at St Pancras) for the lucrative intercity passenger business. Low passenger traffic meant Marylebone was the quietest and most pleasant of London's termini. The GCR was unhappy <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> use part of the Metropolitan Railway's route to reach Marylebone, and opened a new line to High Wycombe on 2 April 1906. The additional suburban services generated traffic for the station, which had previously been so empty on occasion that the staff outnumbered passengers. While passenger traffic remained relatively sparse, the line was heavily used for freight, especially coal; in 1914, 67% of traffic was goods-related. Trains ran from the north and East Midlands to the freight depot adjoining the station, which was marginally the largest in London.|$|E
5|$|Sydney Barnes was a {{professional}} cricketer who played for England in 27 Test matches between 1901 and 1914. He claimed 24 five-wicket hauls (five or more wickets in an innings) during his Test career. A five-wicket haul {{is regarded as a}} notable achievement, and as of 2014 fewer than 50 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Barnes had only played seven first-class matches when he was chosen by Archie MacLaren to tour Australia, and played only 47 County Championship matches throughout his entire career, opting to play Minor Counties and Lancashire League cricket instead. He based his decision upon two main criteria– playing club cricket was more financially rewarding, and he was worried <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> bowl too much in first-class county cricket, and suffering from burnout.|$|E

5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain was concerned <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> take the flammable items but {{was told that}} they had to go. A proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the male employees a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained <b>about</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E
