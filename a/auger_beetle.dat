50|$|Heterobostrychus aequalis, known {{commonly}} as {{the lesser}} <b>auger</b> <b>beetle,</b> trank borer, black borer, and kapok borer, is a notorious pest of many wood products. It {{has been found}} in plywood, furniture, wooden toys, wooden clogs, and carvings.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new fossil {{species of}} <b>auger</b> <b>beetle</b> (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), {{preserved}} in mid-Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian) amber from south-western France, {{is described as}} Stephanopachys vetus Peris, Delclos et Perrichot sp. n. The species is the earliest fossil bostrichid discovered to date, but is remarkably similar to Recent species of the genus Stephanopachys, supporting long morphological conservation in wood boring beetles. The specimen is fossilized in fully opaque amber and was imaged in 3 D using propagation phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography. Based on the ecology of extant related species habits, {{it is suggested that}} S. vetus sp. n. was a primary succession pioneer following wildfires in mid-Cretaceous forests. The fossil record of the family is reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Insect {{specimens}} of adult beetles and larvae of 7 – 9 and 9 – 10 [*]mm length, respectively {{were collected from}} infested dry cassava at two locations from multiple stores in southern Ethiopia. The specimens were identified as Heterobostrychus brunneus (Murray, 1867) commonly known as boxwood borer and <b>auger</b> <b>beetle.</b> The study presents a current record of H. brunneus in Ethiopia, particularly {{in the context of}} infesting food products. Additionally, a wide geographical distribution of the pest was reviewed and presented in this article. Current evidence suggests that H. brunneus is a serious pest of forest wood, structural timbers, and dried food products and that it carries a risk to be introduced into various {{other parts of the world}} via global trade...|$|E
50|$|The Bostrichidae are {{a family}} of beetles with more than 700 {{described}} species. They are commonly called <b>auger</b> <b>beetles,</b> false powderpost beetles, or horned powderpost beetles. The head of most <b>auger</b> <b>beetles</b> cannot be seen from above, as it is downwardly directed and hidden by the thorax. Exceptions are the powderpost beetles (subfamily Lyctinae), {{and members of the}} subfamily Psoinae.|$|R
40|$|The lesser <b>auger</b> <b>beetle,</b> Heterobostrychus aequalis (Waterhouse), is {{a serious}} pest of {{seasoned}} hardwood timber throughout the Oriental region and several areas beyond. Some early collection records of H. [*]aequalis from Australia in the 1950 s and 1960 s indicated that the insect was present in northern Queensland, but no confirmed breeding population {{has been found in}} the past few decades suggesting either that it may have not established permanently or it is difficult to detect. The ambiguity about the breeding status of the pest in Australia has caused confusion for regulating authorities needing to respond to each new post-border detection. We examined records of H. [*]aequalis in Australian insect collections and from intensive plant pest surveillance activities in Queensland and northern Australia over the past 48 [*]years to resolve this confusion. Until very recently, available evidence suggested that H. [*]aequalis was not established in Australia, despite multiple introductions and apparently suitable climate and hosts. Collection records of the pest are predominantly linked to intercepted items or are recorded as of unknown origin, and no established populations have been found during many years of targeted surveillance. However, a detection of H. [*]aequalis in suburban Cairns, north Queensland, in late 2013 and two more in mid- 2015 in the same general locality do not appear to be linked to any imported material, indicating that there is at least a tenuously established local population. Investigations are underway to confirm this, but the insect is not widely established in Australia and, if present, remains elusive. Our recommended response to any future detection of H. [*]aequalis is to fumigate or destroy the infested material, conduct tracing enquiries and limit surveys to the immediate vicinity of the detection...|$|E
