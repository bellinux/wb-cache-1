40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{strategies}} for the identification and specification of embedded software quality. After having identified {{the need for additional}} support in eliciting quality requirements, two different <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> presented. The multi-party chain <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> based on an explicit identification of stakeholders and their concerns with the proposed system. The second <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> questionnaire-based. It links quality characteristics to the characteristics in the environment within which the system is to function. Both <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> {{based on the assumption that}} interrelations exist and can be determined between business system characteristics and embedded software quality characteristics. Both <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> validated in various case studies in practice. This paper discusses the major results of these case studies. Advantages and disadvantages of both <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> looked into. Both <b>approaches</b> proved to <b>be</b> fruitful, encouraging further research and experimentation...|$|R

5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as the dirtiest player in the Premier League, a style reflected in the high number of fouls he has committed during his career. He received 39 bookings and three red cards during his time at Manchester City. This physical <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> occasionally criticised by Kevin Keegan as excessive. Opta statistics rated Barton as the tenth best tackler in the Premier League for the 2004–05 season.|$|E

5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E

40|$|Sen opposes two {{approaches}} to social justice. The transcendental one {{deals with the}} question of a just society. The comparative <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> about ordering social alternatives. According to Sen, such <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> exclusive.

The transcendental (or ideal) <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> necessary but needs to be extended with a derivative and comparative approach.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} cognitively {{motivated}} approach to interpreting destination descriptions without computing spatial relations.

5|$|Although {{the weak}} {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E
