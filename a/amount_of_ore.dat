25|$|The deputy barmasters kept {{records of}} all changes of title {{and of the}} amounts of ore {{measured}} and the amounts of lot ore and cope collected at their regular reckonings at the mines. The lot and cope accounts involved quite complicated arithmetic. The information given included the period covered, {{the name of the}} miner or mine (occasionally both were given), the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> mined, the number of dishes of lot ore received, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> sold to each buyer and the sum of money chargeable to each buyer for cope. Traditional methods were used at the reckonings; barmasters carried knives to worke uppon a sticke the nomber of dishes of oare as they were measured which is usuall to be done at a reckoning. Many of their records have survived.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, mining {{started at}} Kiruna's other hill, Luossavaara. However, the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> {{that could be}} mined in open pit mining here was small {{compared}} to Kiirunavaara, and LKAB preferred to concentrate resources in one place. Nevertheless, mining here continued until 1974 and later it became a research mine.|$|E

50|$|In 1926, the Bethlehem Steel Company, {{owners of}} the Cornwall iron mines since 1916, {{acquired}} Robesonia. In {{order to protect the}} mines from the enormous <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> being consumed, Bethlehem Steel elected to shut down the Robesonia furnaces in 1927.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, Pebble was {{estimated}} to be the second-largest ore deposit of its type in {{the world in terms of}} the value of the contained metal, slightly smaller than Indonesia's Grasberg Mine, which contains more metal in a smaller <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> than Pebble. Estimates have grown throughout the history of the project.|$|E
25|$|The Argyle diamond mine is {{economically}} feasible because its large reserves and high-grade ore offset a low average diamond value. The estimated value of Argyle diamond production is only US$7 per carat ($35/g); this compares to values of $70 per carat ($350/g) for diamonds produced at the Diavik mine and US$170 per carat ($850/g) at the Ekati mine, both in Canada. However, Argyle has {{two to four}} times the concentration of diamonds (ore grade) of these mines. This makes extraction {{economically feasible}}, as mine costs are mostly related to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> processed, not the amount of diamond extracted.|$|E
500|$|Around 100BC, Maiden Castle's {{organised}} street {{pattern was}} replaced by more random habitation. At the same time, the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in {{the east of the}} fort. Also during the Late Iron Age, some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance, and into the areas between the banks. Excavations by archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler in this area revealed several houses, storage pits, an area used for iron working, and a cemetery. On the industrial site, more than [...] of iron slag was discovered in an area of , and it is believed the site produced around [...] of iron. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> required could not have been supplied by local sources, so most likely originated from areas of specialist iron production such as the Weald, south west England, and Wales. Maiden Castle {{is one of the most}} important iron production sites from the Late Iron Age in southern Britain.|$|E
50|$|Prospecting pickaxes {{are used}} to scrape at rocks and minerals, obtaining small samples that can be tested for trace <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore.</b> Modern {{prospecting}} pickaxes are also sometimes equipped with magnets, {{to aid in the}} gathering <b>of</b> ferromagnetic <b>ores.</b> Prospecting pickaxes are usually equipped with a triangular head, with a very sharp point.|$|R
2500|$|Underground mines {{developed}} {{to remove the}} valuable <b>ore</b> <b>of</b> most ranges. However, iron mining operations on the Mesabi and Cuyuna Ranges took place in enormous open pit mines where steam shovels and other industrial machines could remove massive <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore.</b> [...] "Large-scale commercial production <b>of</b> magnetite taconite <b>ore</b> on the Mesabi Range started in 1956 at the Peter Mitchell Mine near Babbitt, Minnesota." ...|$|R
50|$|From then until 1885 up to 22 {{people were}} employed, though only minimal <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> were sold. There was another gap until 1906, when 65 people were {{recorded}} as {{working at the}} mine, 16 of them underground. The mine produced some black tin between 1907 and 1910, but then evidently closed again, probably due to difficulty keeping {{water out of the}} mine.|$|R
2500|$|Because of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> {{the mine}} produced, {{transporting}} it by horse and wagon soon proved inefficient. The company built its own five mile railway with completion in November 1858; this linked the mine with Morwellham Quay for {{the export of}} ores. It was the only mine {{to have its own}} railway. In time, the rail line was extended to the Wheal Josiah and Bedford United mines. Devon Great Consols owned three locomotives [...] and 60 wagons which both transported ore to Morwellham Quay and brought needed equipment and supplies such as coal, to the mine. An average run from the mine to Morwellham Quay consisted of 8 to 10 wagons of ore.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the royal}} {{possession}} of the mineral rights and the royal wish to encourage lead mining, that dictated the two characteristic features of so-called [...] "free mining". Any man who could demonstrate to the barmaster that he had discovered a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> was allowed to open a mine and retain the title to {{it as long as}} he continued to work it, and, secondly, mining took precedence over land ownership. No land owner or farmer could interfere with lead mining, though there were many attempts to limit its damage. In 1620 the Duchy of Lancaster's tenants at Brassington complained that lead mining was poisoning their cattle. [...] In 1663 the Brassington manor court forbade miners from taking water from the village well to wash ore, on pain of a fine of 1/-, and in 1670 imposed fines of 3/4d on miners who left shafts uncovered or raised heaps of soil and waste minerals against fences, allowing cattle to climb over them. But the customs raised the possibility of ordinary families making a living independently of farmers or other employers and in the regular conflict between miners and landowners in the Wirksworth area the miners usually managed to hang on to them, though they did lose some of their fights.|$|E
6000|$|The China Year Book for 1919[105] (a work {{as little}} {{concerned}} with politics as Whitaker's Almanack) gives {{a list of}} the five principal iron mines in China, with some information about each. The first and most important are the Tayeh mines, worked by the Hanyehping Iron and Coal Co., Ltd., which, as the reader may remember, was the subject of the third group in the Twenty-one Demands. The total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> in sight is estimated by the China Year Book at 50,000,000 tons, derived chiefly from two mines, in one of which the ore yields 65 per cent. of iron, in the other 58 to 63 per cent. The output for 1916 is given as 603,732 tons (it has been greatly increased since then). The Year Book proceeds: [...] "Japanese capital is invested in the Company, and by the agreement between China and Japan of May 1915 [after the ultimatum which enforced the revised Twenty-one Demands], the Chinese Government undertook not to convert the Company into a State-owned concern nor to compel it to borrow money from other than Japanese sources." [...] It should be added that there is a Japanese accountant and a Japanese technical adviser, and that pig-iron and ore, up to a specified value, must be sold to the Imperial Japanese works at much below the market price, leaving a paltry residue for sale in the open market.[106] ...|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} smelter was a bole, a large fire {{built on}} a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces <b>of</b> rich <b>ore</b> known as bing and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through a half-inch mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.|$|R
50|$|Players {{have the}} option <b>of</b> {{depositing}} large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> cash for investment in trading, as there are player controlled shops and market stalls they can purchase outright (or rent from other players), in various towns in the game, or starting small buying small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore,</b> enmatter, sweat, fruit etc. from players and either manufacturing other items from them or consolidating the small amounts into larger piles and placing them on the auction house for sale.|$|R
50|$|Within Kargaly alone, a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> copper <b>ore</b> was smelted {{during the}} Bronze Age, its total weight {{estimated}} at between 55,000 and 120,000 tons.|$|R
60|$|The Swanzy {{establishment}} {{has set up}} {{an exceptionally}} light battery of twelve stamps, made in sections for easier transport. Neither here nor {{in any of the}} mines have stone-breakers or automatic feeders yet been introduced: the stuff is all hand-spalled. One small 'Belleville' drives the stamps, another works the Tangye pump, and a third turns the saw-mills. I will notice a few differences between the Swanzy system and that of Effuenta. The wooden framework of the stamp-mill is better than iron. The cam-shaft here carries only single, not double cams, a decided disadvantage: in order to strike the same number of blows per minute it has to make double the number of revolutions. Moreover, by some unhappy mistake, it is too far from its work, and the result is a succession of sharp blows on the tappets, with injury to all the gear. On the other hand proper fingers are fitted to the stamps: this is far better than supporting them by a rough chock of wood. At Crockerville, as at Effuenta, only six of the twelve stamps were working: there the pump was at fault; here the blanket-tables had not been made wide enough. I could hardly estimate the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> brought to grass, or its average yield: specimens of white quartz, with threads, strings, and lobs of gold, have been sent to England from Crocker's Reef. The best tailings are reserved either for treatment on the spot or for reduction in England. The mine, as regards present condition, is in the stage of prospecting upon a large and liberal scale. The stamps are chiefly used to run through samples of from 50 to 100 tons taken from the various parts of the property: in this way the most exact results can be obtained. During my visit they were preparing to work a hundred tons from Aji Bipa, the fourth and furthest butte to the north-west.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{findings}} <b>of</b> large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore,</b> no mining was initiated {{because of the}} remote location and the harsh climate. Some ore was extracted in the 19th century. It was extracted in summer and transported in winter, using sleds drawn by reindeer and horses. However, the costs were high and the quality <b>of</b> the phosphorus <b>ore</b> poor, until, in 1878, the Gilchrist-Thomas process, invented by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas and Percy Gilchrist, allowed for the separation of phosphorus from the ore.|$|R
50|$|The mining {{involves}} moving tremendous <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> and waste. The waste {{comes in}} two forms, non-ore bedrock {{in the mine}} (overburden or interburden locally known as mullock), and unwanted minerals which are an intrinsic part <b>of</b> the <b>ore</b> rock itself (gangue). The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps, and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed as tailings. Taconite tailings are mostly the mineral quartz, which is chemically inert. This material is stored in large, regulated water settling ponds.|$|R
50|$|The Eureka & Palisade Railroad {{was built}} in 1875 to carry silver-lead ore from Eureka, Nevada, to the Southern Pacific Railroad trunk line that ran through Palisade. Nevertheless, despite the {{determined}} and colorful management style of John Sexton, the line succumbed {{to the effects of}} flood, fire, competing road traffic, and dwindling <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> extracted in Eureka. The rails and rolling stock of the last surviving narrow gauge railroad in Nevada were removed in 1938.|$|R

5000|$|The Anderson uranium deposit was {{discovered}} in 1955 by an airborne gamma-radiation survey. Small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> were produced from 1955 to 1959. Uranium is associated with organic material in carbonaceous Miocene siltstones and mudstones of lacustrine and paludal origin of the Chapin Wash formation of the Date Creek Basin in Yavapai, La Paz, and Mohave counties. [...] The Anderson mine is now owned by Concentric Energy Corp. which is doing extensive development work to bring it into production.|$|R
40|$|Koryu is an epithermal gold-silver {{quartz vein}} deposit n southwestern Hokkaido, Japan. The deposit occurs in an east-west hear zone within Miocene black mudstone. The deposit {{consists}} ofeight major veins {{with a general}} east-west rike. The three major veins show variable internal structure and texture, in both vertical and horizontal directions. K-Ar ages for adularia from veins 1 and 3 are 0. 8 to 1. 2 Ma, indicating a Pleistocene age of mineralization. Based on crosscutting relationships and mineral parageneses, the veins appear to have formed during two mineralization epochs. The earlier event is further divided into three stages (E-I,-II,-Ill), whereas even stages can be distinguished in the later event (L-I,-II,-Ill,-IV,-V,-VI,-VII). The wide veins consist of multip 16 mineralization stages. Most gold-silver mineralization {{is associated with the}} L-III stage. The earlier mineralization stages are characterized bymanganocalcite, johannsenite, and small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> minerals, whereas the later stages are characterized bylarge <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ore</b> minerals. Gangue minerals associated with later <b>ore</b> consist <b>of</b> interstratified chlorite-smectite and microcrystalline quartz alternately banded with adularia nd comb-texture quartz. Gold-silver-bearing minerals include electrum, aeanthite-aguilarite, polybasite-peareeite, pyrargyrite-proustite, jalpaitc, mekinstryite, hessitc, an Ag-Te-Se-S mineral, and tetrahedrite...|$|R

50|$|Extractions involve many {{expensive}} steps such as roasting and smelting, {{which require}} sufficient concentrations <b>of</b> elements in <b>ores</b> and are environmentally unfriendly. Low concentrations {{are not a}} problem for bacteria because they simply ignore the waste that surrounds the metals, attaining extraction yields of over 90% in some cases. These microorganisms actually gain energy by breaking down minerals into their constituent elements. The company simply collects the ions out of the solution after the bacteria have finished. There is a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>ores.</b>|$|R
30|$|Metals are {{indispensable}} in our society. To obtain sufficient metals {{for economic}} development, huge <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>ores</b> and industrial minerals are extracted globally (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2011); {{on the other}} hand, metal mining and smelting cause negative environmental impacts (Nuss and Eckelman 2014). Because the impacts of these processes directly affect the environment of mining and material processing countries, metal-consuming countries have indirect responsibilities for the impacts occurred in metal-producing countries according to own consumptions (Peters 2008; Peters and Hertwich 2008).|$|R
