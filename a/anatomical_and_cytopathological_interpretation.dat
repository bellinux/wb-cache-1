40|$|Background: Cytological {{reports of}} ameloblastoma are {{relatively}} {{rare in the}} literature. Appropriate cytologic diagnosis may {{play a significant role}} in its preoperative presumptive diagnosis, especially when incisional biopsy findings are inadequate. Aim: To systematically study the detailed cytomorphologic features of ameloblastoma and to evaluate the role of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in its preoperative diagnosis. Materials and Methods: In this study, FNAC was done on 26 cases of intra-osseous jaw lesion, clinically diagnosed as odontogenic tumor or developmental odontogenic cysts <b>and</b> detailed <b>cytopathological</b> <b>interpretation</b> was carried out and the results were correlated with the corresponding histopathology. Results: Of the 26 cases, 15 were found to be ameloblastoma and sensitivity of FNAC in the diagnosis of ameloblastoma was found to be 86. 6 %. None of the intra-osseous jaw lesion was false positively diagnosed as ameloblastoma in FNAC and hence the specificity was found to be 100 %. Conclusion: Presence of cohesive epithelial cell clusters exhibiting smaller basaloid cells with peripherally placed tall columnar cells and occasional large squamous cells either adjoining the basaloid epithelial clusters or in isolated group aids in the specific cytological diagnosis of ameloblastoma and FNAC offers an excellent diagnostic aid that may {{play a significant role in}} preoperative presumptive diagnosis of ameloblastoma along with incisional biopsy...|$|R
30|$|Initial {{stereotactic}} biopsy utilized fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Although impressive {{results could}} be obtained, it required a dedicated team of experts, particularly for <b>cytopathological</b> <b>interpretation</b> [10], <b>and</b> could not be reproduced when FNAC was introduced {{on a large scale}} as in the UK screening programme [11]. The small size and frequent paucicellularity of lesions biopsied under stereotaxis, as well as the lack of reliably identifying calcification in the biopsy specimen, has meant that FNAC is now discouraged from use during stereotactic biopsy [12].|$|R

40|$|A 59 -year-old male was {{diagnosed}} as carcinoma gallbladder around 1 year back and underwent radical cholecystectomy. He also received four cycles of chemotherapy. Now, he complained upper abdominal heaviness; positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was done which showed PET-avid 8. 5 mm sized lymph node at aortocaval region. There was no safe route, so endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) -guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was advised. However, FNA was not possible without crossing inferior vena cava and further management depended on FNA report. The EUS-FNA was done, <b>and</b> <b>cytopathological</b> smears were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. There was no complication...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the importance of urine cytopathology and bladder cancer in patients with urinary complaints. Method: A total of 110 urine cytology specimens from 36 diagnosed bladder cancer patients and 74 patients with urinary complaints were prepared by filter technique at Hannover/Germany <b>Cytopathological</b> Laboratory <b>and</b> evaluated retrospectively with a suspicion of bladder carcinoma. The specimens were stained by the PAP method and the results were analyzed by the chi-squared test. Results: All of the 36 bladder cancer patients (20 as papiller urothelial, 8 squamous cell and 8 adenocarcinomas) were diagnosed as such cytologically as well. The 16 of the patients with urinary complaints have been diagnosed as normal, 23 as metaplasia–inflammation, 35 as suspicious (dysplasia) (10 mild, 12 moderate, 13 severe). There have been significant relationship between the ages <b>and</b> <b>cytopathological</b> results of those patients with urinary complaints (p= 0. 013) and those with bladder carcinoma (p= 0. 004). Moreover, there has been significant relationship between sex <b>and</b> <b>cytopathological</b> findings in the patients with bladder carcinoma (p= 0. 000), but not in those with urinary complaints. (p= 0. 112). Conclusion: Urine cytology is an important method for the detection of metaplasia or suspicious cases at early stage and for the treatment and follow-up of the bladder carcinoma cases. It is recommended to use the urine cytology method which is low cost and easily accessible, and can be used noninvasively for the diagnosis and control of patients with urinary complaints...|$|R

Hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a rare, aggressive, extrahepatic malignancy with a distinct morphological similarity to hepatocel-lular carcinoma, in the absence of primary hepatic disease. A 45 -year-old man presented with sinus headaches and retro-orbital pain and was found to have a nasopharyngeal mass on endoscopy and a large, destructive sinonasal mass extending intracranially on imaging.

40|$|Collagen {{is one of}} {{the most}} common fibers in the {{extracellular}} matrix, where sulfated mu-copolysaccharides are also located. In addition, sulfated mucopolysaccharides are present in some globet cells and secretory glands. The objective of this article is to develop a new staining method that detects these two macromolecules simultaneously in the same sam-ple. The method described stains tissues in five fundamental colors: collagen in red; sulfated mucopolysaccharides in violet; red blood cells in yellow; muscle in orange; and nuclei in green. As a conclusion, it will be interesting in the future to evaluate whether this method could be used as a basic histological method, as a histology teaching tool, or even in histopatholog-ical <b>and</b> <b>cytopathological</b> studies...|$|R
