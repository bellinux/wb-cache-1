40|$|The {{governor}} actuators in some heat-engine {{plants have}} nonlinear valves. This nonlinearity of valves {{may lead to}} the inaccuracy of the opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> time constants calculated based on the whole segment fully open <b>and</b> fully <b>close</b> experimental test curves of the valve. An improved mathematical model of the turbine governor actuator is proposed to reflect the nonlinearity of the valve, in which the main and auxiliary piecewise opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> time constants instead of the fixed oil motive opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> time constants are adopted to describe the characteristics of the actuator. The main opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> time constants are obtained from the linear segments of the whole fully open <b>and</b> <b>close</b> curves. The parameters of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller are identified based on the small disturbance experimental tests of the valve. Then the auxiliary opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> time constants <b>and</b> the piecewise opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> valve points are determined by the fully open/close experimental tests. Several testing functions are selected to compare genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm (GA-PSO) with other basic intelligence algorithms. The effectiveness of the piecewise linear model and its parameters are validated by practical power plant case studies...|$|R

50|$|Ion {{channels}} can {{be classified}} by how they respond to their environment. For example, the ion channels involved in the action potential are voltage-sensitive channels; they open <b>and</b> <b>close</b> {{in response to the}} voltage across the membrane. Ligand-gated channels form another important class; these ion channels open <b>and</b> <b>close</b> in response to the binding of a ligand molecule, such as a neurotransmitter. Other ion channels open <b>and</b> <b>close</b> with mechanical forces. Still other ion channels—such as those of sensory neurons—open <b>and</b> <b>close</b> in response to other stimuli, such as light, temperature or pressure.|$|R

40|$|Pilot control {{globe valve}} (PCGV) {{can use the}} {{pressure}} difference produced by fluid itself to realize the opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> states with a pilot valve. In this paper, numerical method is used to investigate the fluid flow characteristics and the valve core movement inside PCGV under different opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> times of pilot valve. The result shows that, shorter opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> time of valve core results in the shorter vibration of valve core {{as well as the}} stronger unstable fluid in main valve and faster opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> process of PCGV. Longer opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> time of valve core can do less damage to valve body. This work can give some guides for the optimal design work of PCGV and someone who are researching on valves with similar structures...|$|R
