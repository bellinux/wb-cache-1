Some folk may remember the years before lawn-tennis was born when we all played croquet.

Dr. Gregory Stock discusses the use of several diagnostic tests used to monitor current pregnancies and several diagnostic tests that can be done to determine the health of embryos. Such tests include amniocentesis, ultrasounds, and other preimplantation genetic diagnostic tests.

50|$|Mead {{the social}} {{psychologist}} argued {{in tune with}} Durkheim that the individual {{is a product of}} an ongoing, preexisting society, or more specifically, social interaction that is a consequence of a sui generis society. The self arises when the individual becomes an object to themselves. Mead argued that we are objects first to other people, and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people. Language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> other people, and thus through language we become other to ourselves. In joint activity, which Mead called 'social acts', humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their co-actors. A central mechanism within the social act, which enables perspective taking, is position exchange. People within a social act often alternate social positions (e.g., giving/receiving, asking/helping, winning/losing, hiding/seeking, talking/listening). In children's games there is repeated position exchange, for example in hide-and-seek, and Mead argued {{that this is one of}} the main ways that perspective taking develops.|$|E
50|$|Suppose {{for example}} that {{somebody}} is hit by a hammer, and sometime later a bruise appears {{at the point of}} impact. The impact of the hammer is an observable event; the bruise too is observable. The causal connection between the two events, however, is not observed or experienced, at least according to Hume. Hume believed that whenever we can claim to know something about the world, that knowledge must be derived from experience (see Hume's fork). We do not experience the causal connection between a hammer impact and the formation of a bruise. All we observe are distinct events, occurring at the same place and time (Constant conjunction). Because we observe events of this type, we are led by induction to suppose that like causes will result in like effects, and from this we have the notion of causation. This does not mean Hume doubted that one material object was able to cause a change or movement in another material object. It means that insofar <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> some cause resulting in some effect, it is not something we have learned of the world we are talking about because it is not derived from experience. Rather, {{we are talking about a}} feature of our thinking which we are inclined to discuss as if it were a feature of the world.|$|E
5000|$|On October 23, 2007, Kerr gave {{a memorable}} {{speech at the}} annual [...] "GEOINT" [...] conference on Geospatial Intelligence (to an {{audience}} including many people from his prior NRO job). He said,"We really need to realize what a loaded word security really is. When I’m at work, and throughout my day, security is safety, as a barrier against physical or emotional harm. When I go home at night, security is privacy, as an expectation of freedom from unnecessary burdens. In the intelligence community, {{we have an obligation}} to protect both safety and privacy, and over the course of GEOINT 2007, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the hows of new technologies and tradecraft, I’d like to take a step back right now and talk about the whys."Safety and privacy - it's common thinking that, in order to have more safety, you get less privacy. I don’t agree with that. I work from the assumption that you need to have both. When we try to make it an either/or proposition, we’re bound to fail."Later in the speech, he said,"Too often, privacy has been equated with anonymity; and it's an idea that is deeply rooted in American culture. The Lone Ranger wore a mask but Tonto didn’t seem to need one even though he did the dirty work for free. You’d think he would probably need one even more. But in our interconnected and wireless world, anonymity - or the appearance of anonymity - is quickly becoming a thing of the past."Anonymity results from a lack of identifying features. Nowadays, when so much correlated data is collected and available - and I’m just talking about profiles on MySpace, Facebook, YouTube here - the set of identifiable features has grown beyond where most of us can comprehend. We need to move beyond the construct that equates anonymity with privacy and focus more on how we can protect essential privacy in this interconnected environment."Protecting anonymity isn’t a fight that can be won. Not with me in my current job. Anyone that's typed in their name on Google understands that. Instead, privacy, I would offer, is a system of laws, rules, and customs with an infrastructure of Inspectors General, oversight committees, and privacy boards on which our intelligence community commitment is based and measured. And it is that framework that we need to grow and nourish and adjust as our cultures change."I think people here, at least people close to my age, recognize that those two generations younger than we are have a very different idea of what is essential privacy, what they would wish to protect about their lives and affairs. And so, it's not for us to inflict one size fits all. It's a need to have it be adjustable to the needs of local societies as they evolve in our country. Eventually, we can only hope that people's perceptions - in Hollywood and elsewhere - will catch up."These remarks produced major news coverage that said he'd said that [...] "privacy no longer can mean anonymity...Instead, it should mean that government and businesses properly safeguards sic people's private communications and financial information." ...|$|E

More specifically we investigate and compare their computability, their physical meaning, their Markovian to non-Markovian crossover, and their additivity properties {{with respect to the}} number of qubits. The bottom-up approach that we pursue is aimed at identifying similarities and differences in the behavior of non-Markovianity indicators in several paradigmatic open system models. This in turn allows us to infer the leading traits of the variegated phenomenon known as non-Markovian dynamics and, possibly, to grasp its physical essence.

40|$|The {{conversation}} in book publishing has {{established that the}} industry is remarkably, well, white. We abstractly understand that minority groups have not been represented well, if at all, in our literary history; and, I would add, most publishers including the tenor-setting Big Five, want to change this heternormative face of the book industry.

40|$|Architecture {{comes into}} being only <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> and hypothesize about it; the {{buildings}} left ‘out in the rain’ {{participate in the}} discourse of architecture inasmuch as architects include them in their conscious act of theorizing. " Emmanuel Petit, 2013 As deus ex machina, theory posits that public art cannot exist in a culture of disrupted certainties, unless its innate representational virtues are subject to it. Is it a matter, characteristically ironic, of what we expect to talk about and how when we address the strange poetics of irony-work in architecture? Irony-work was once restrained to the private consumption of social art, the novel, from which the modern notion of irony first sprang. With the ascent of certain theories that favor the social aspects of art, architecture {{has been made to}} mimic the novel’s virtue. This paper sets out to defend architecture’s acquired sense of uncertainty in the modern age. The term irony-work, borrowed from Freud’s description of the social function of the joke, is paramount in making a parody of theory’s quest to save architecture from oblivion. For the purpose of illustration, I will look at architectural archetypes, such as a series of temples in modern guise (London, Leeds, Berlin). At the end, a car park in Berlin, where context brings about an inescapable ironic charge, will serve as the stage for an anti-heroic architectural gesture, which negates originality in favor of lost purpose. To what end? One might suggest that the stetting sun on architecture’s public identity coincides with the dawn of a certain genre of theories, which claims the idioms of criticism for itself. The view that theory adds value to our understanding of social aspects of irony-work in architecture will be challenged...|$|E
40|$|Lack {{of iodine}} makes goiters— {{enlargement}} of the thyroid gland in the neck—common {{in some parts of}} the world. In the United States, salt is enriched with iodine, so the condition is far less common. When goiters do occur, it is typically due to other factors, such as Graves’ disease (overactive thyroid) or Hashimoto’s disease (underactive thyroid), as well as an individual’s anatomy or family history. And when goiters go untreated, they can grow down into the chest, spreading behind the breastbone and collarbone; in some cases, they grow all the way down to the arch of the aorta. These substernal goiters tend to grow slowly and steadily—sometimes with symptoms, sometimes without. Because of how and where they grow, substernal goiters can be very difficult to remove, with increased risk of complications. In his practice, Alliric I. Willis, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery, observed that substernal goiters seemed to occur more frequently among minority patients, older patients and patients who perhaps lacked access to care because of their insurance. “The condition also appeared to be relatively more common with men, even though women make up the majority of thyroid surgery patients whether for goiter or malignancy,” he says. “I became interested in trying to find out: Does this condition have particular demographic risk factors or disparities?” To explore that question, Dr. Willis collaborated with Dylan P. Thibault, MS, and Allison W. Willis, MD, MSCI, (also his wife) from the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania. He was also assisted by Ambria S. Moten, MD, a surgical resident (PGY 1 and 2) that he mentored at Temple University. The team used data from the National Inpatient Sample—a federally funded dataset that provides insights into about 20 percent of the population and thus can form the basis of a national sample. The data showed that 110, 889 patients underwent thyroidectomy for goiter from 2000 to 2010. Of those, 5, 525 (5 %) were substernal goiters. Their analysis confirmed that Dr. Willis’ clinical observations were, in fact, accurate. Patients with substernal goiters were indeed older, more likely to be Black or Hispanic and to have Medicare insurance. In addition, they had a higher comorbidity index (meaning they had other conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and/or obesity) and were more likely to be admitted on an emergency basis. “We also found that these patients were more likely to have postoperative complications, and most alarmingly, we found that substernal thyroidectomy patients had 73 percent increased odds of death during admission compared to those patients undergoing a nonsubsternal thyroidectomy,” Dr. Willis explains. He also notes that insurance seems to play an especially significant role, with privately insured patients far less likely to have a substernal goiter. These findings emphasize the importance of early referral of goiter patients for surgical evaluation and an increased appreciation of the challenges associated with substernal goiter operations. With Dr. Willis as principal author, the findings were published in The American Journal of Surgery. This study builds on similar research Dr. Willis has conducted around the role of demographics in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers of the breast, rectum and stomach. “It’s an interesting field that is becoming increasingly appreciated <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> quality and outcomes,” he says. “We can’t just look at the big picture. We have to focus at the individual patient level, including those who may not be achieving great outcomes. As clinicians, we can ask the right questions, team up with good epidemiologists and biostatisticians, and do analyses to figure out what’s significant—and what we can do to make outcomes better for everyone. ...|$|E

40|$|Przedmiotem rozprawy jest filozofia polityczna Johna Rawlsa (1921 – 2002), słynnego dwudziestowiecznego filozofa, który po dziś dzień inspiruje badaczy na całym świecie. Autor publikacji docieka, jakiego rodzaju koncepcję prawa można zrekonstruować zarówno z wczesnej, jak i późnej doktryny Rawlsa. W centrum rozważań znajduje się problem instytucji pluralistycznego społeczeństwa demokratycznego, co czyni niniejszą pozycję ważną dla filozofów polityki czy prawa, a także dla praktyków – prawników i polityków. Powstałe we wrześniu 2007 roku Centrum Myśli Polityczno-Prawnej im. Alexisa de Tocqueville’a jest programową jednostką badawczą, która stanowi integralną część Wydziału Prawa i Administracji Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego. Centrum odwołuje się do ideowego i intelektualnego dziedzictwa autora „O demokracji w Ameryce”. Dziedzictwo to łączy dominujące dziś tradycje – konserwatywną i liberalną – z chrześcijańską wizją zachodniej tożsamości i republikańskim etosem obywatelskiej partycypacji. Wyprowadza refleksję polityczną, ustrojową i prawną z analizy konkretnych stosunków społecznych, unika natomiast konstruowania wszelkich apriorycznych, abstrakcyjnych, racjonalistycznych modeli życia publicznego. Postrzega podstawowe wartości współczesności, takie jak wolność, równość, demokracja, rządy prawa, sprawność i skuteczność władzy państwowej, społeczeństwo obywatelskie czy samorządność, jako dalekie od wzajemnej harmonii. Pozostawia zatem miejsce dla aksjologicznego sceptycyzmu, inspiruje ruch idei i nakazuje poznawczy obiektywizm. W swej działalności Centrum uznaje to dziedzictwo za ważne zarówno dla postaw obywatelskich, jak i wysiłków badawczych. The jurisprudential project {{pursued in}} this book is a study of ideas {{formulated}} {{by one of the}} most eminent philosophers of the twentieth century – john Rawls (1921 – 2002). during his lifetime, from the 1970 s on, you could hardly imagine a book on practical philosophy or politics without passages addressing the notions of the original position, reflective equilibrium, the difference principle, an overlapping consensus, and public reason. But also today we constantly observe Rawls’s considerable influence over political philosophy, not only in american academia (where we find plenty of his direct disciples) but also elsewhere, far beyond english-speaking world. His thought has been a negative or positive source of inspiration not only for liberals, but also for thinkers of nearly the entire politico-philosophical spectrum. one of the biggest reasons for that is the fact that in his opus magnum, “A Theory of Justice”, he gave a new lively impulse to normative reflection on the social world by rediscovering the tradition of social contract. constructing the idea of original position and developing the conception of justice as fairness, Rawls did even more – he created a new paradigm in political philosophy, and we may speak about ‘Rawlsianism’, just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> ‘Kantianism’ or ‘Marxism’. But “A Theory of Justice” is not the whole story. In his subsequent books and papers from the 1980 s on, Rawls introduced new ideas of Kantian constructivism, political liberalism with its central idea of public reason, and many more. In the late works Rawls modified the original project but – as the last book “Justice as Fairness: A Restatement” shows us – he never abandoned its central ideas. Rawls’s major works, as well as the general evolution of his thought, are commonly known, so {{there is no need to}} recall them all here. There is indeed enough secondary literature to refer to. Given that fact, we should rather ask – why still deal with Rawls at all? do we still have something to discover today, in 2015, or perhaps all we can do is to sum up the former discussions? In examining Rawls’ ideas I go to great lengths to show that his philosophy still has something new to offer. The domain I find especially intriguing here is jurisprudence. Rawls himself did not address too many jurisprudential questions at length, but studying his philosophy allows us to approach the familiar and persistent problems from a new perspective. If we set aside, for the moment at least, the heavily disputed questions of the debate between positivism and natural law theory, we can, hopefully, say something new about law in a democratic society. We can do this by taking political philosophy as our basis, not the philosophy of law in its strict sense. This is the main intention of this book. I intend to realize this by constructing a new substantial conception of law, or at least by showing an approach to legal analysis that brings something new to the discourse of lawyers. I call it the ‘cooperative conception of law’, a conception of law as a device of fair cooperation between free and equal citizens in liberal, democratic societies. I try to do this remaining strictly ‘Rawlsian’, i. e. to interpret Rawls in such a way that enables to incorporate a conception of law which would be completely consistent with the rest of Rawls’s philosophical system. The result of such an interpretation is, as I shall argue, the cooperative conception. The secondary result of this project is reinterpretation of the role of contractarianism in jurisprudence, as well as of the nature of contractarianism itself. I’m trying to show that a contractarian approach supports non-positivism – a jurisprudential standpoint to some degree different from legal positivism and natural law theories. In order to do this one needs not only analyse the writings of Rawls carefully, but also to apply his categories to a very special case, namely, the concept of law. once the philosophical conception is worked out, it must be somehow ‘verified’ or ‘falsified’ and I hope to do this by using some examples of institutional analysis, applying abstract conception to legal reality in selected western countries. That is why the full pursuit of the project requires accomplishment of three major research objectives: (1) conceptualize and express clearly a new conception of law, ‘the cooperative conception of law’. as indicated above, this conception perceives the law as a device of fair cooperation between free and equal citizens in a democratic society; a society that is liberal, pluralistic and acknowledges the priority of justice as well as burdens of judgement and the fact of pluralism; (2) show the law, understood as above, as a plausible form of common good for democratic society; (3) verify the results of philosophical investigations through examining the implications of the conception for basic legal institutions and practices (for instance the constitution, property rights, tax system, and judicial review) and comparing those implications with real institutions and practices through the comparative law research. The pursuit of the first two objectives is of philosophical nature and shall apply methods of philosophical interpretation and analysis of concepts and ideas. The third objective is to verify the results of philosophical scrutiny with methods of (comparative) legal analysis. The philosophical analysis of ideas that can be worked up into the cooperative conception of law has two main parts. In the first part the priority of justice is considered. In order to show the priority of justice in a democratic society I examine the idea of society as a fair system of cooperation and the political conception of the person, as well as the idea of a well-ordered society in circumstances of pluralism. This is the main subject of Chapter 1, “The Need for Law – Democratic Society”. according to those ideas a society is seen as a system of cooperation, effectively regulated by publicly recognized, reciprocal rules. In this scheme each participant of the cooperation seeks his own advantage or good, but at the same time wants to do it under certain rules that everyone else can accept on common ground. This aspect of cooperation is complemented by the idea of reasonable and rational citizens who are at the same time deemed free and equal. Taken together, those ideas form a conception of priority of justice, where the latter is understood as a common and supreme tribunal adjudicating conflicting claims of citizens in the circumstances of social pluralism. The concern of the second part is constructing the original position and the idea of public reason. This is the main topic of Chapter 2, “The Foundation of Law – Law in the Light of Public Reason and the Principles of Justice”. as I argue there, the idea of the original position provides us with formal constrains imposed not only on a conception of justice, but also on a concept of right. The careful analysis will try to prove that those constrains are identical for the concept of law. If this is connected with the idea of public reason, one can provide a model of law and of law-making process. This enables reconstructing the principles of justice as the principles constitutive for law, which can be pursued by the use of public reason. Those arguments taken together amount to arguments for perceiving law as a device of fair cooperation – the conception where law is necessarily connected to some minimal moral standard but at the same time is not dependent on any substantial notion of a good ethical life of a person. Having this done, I focus on the ideas that enable us to express and endorse the conception of law as a common good. Firstly, I examine the idea of community and the ideas of the good introduced by Rawls, with the special focus on the concept of the good of political community. once I have a clear idea of the good of political society, and a clear image of possible community dimension of liberal philosophy of Rawls, I provide a possible Rawlsian interpretation of the idea of common good and compare it with republican and Thomistic models. The general thesis here is that common good is an important part of Rawls’s system, but according to the cooperative conception of law common good is closely connected to legal institutions and not to the ethical notions of good life. That is why the notion of common good is somehow ‘reversed’ – common good is not the purpose of the institutions, but the institutions themselves become common good of a pluralistic society with a limited (i. e. ‘constitutional’ or ‘overlapping’) social consensus. With respect to the main subject of this project, the analysis of Rawlsian political philosophy has to take a lawyers’ perspective. This is realized throughout the whole work, however, special emphasis to the legal aspects is given within the pursuit of the third research objective. Chapter 3, “Toward Institutions – The Political Conception of Justice and the Legal Order” aims at showing the implications of the cooperative conception of law to a specific institution, and then at comparing and confronting those implications with real institutions by means of using knowledge and skills of legal analysis and comparative law. Special focus is given to the following institutions – the constitution, property, and freedom of contract. Generally I argue that the cooperative conception of law is indeed capable of enhancing our understanding of the institutions, and stays generally consistent with legal thinking.
