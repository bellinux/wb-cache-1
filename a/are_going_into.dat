25|$|The {{drift tube}} (DT) system {{measures}} muon {{positions in the}} barrel part of the detector. Each 4-cm-wide tube contains a stretched wire within a gas volume. When a muon or any charged particle passes through the volume it knocks electrons off the atoms of the gas. These follow the electric field ending up at the positively charged wire. By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram, the wires <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> the page) {{as well as by}} calculating the muon's original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon’s position. Each DT chamber, on average 2m x 2.5m in size, consists of 12 aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each with up to 60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the perpendicular coordinate.|$|E

2500|$|Where {{classical}} hypnosis is authoritative {{and direct}} and often encounters {{resistance in the}} subject, Erickson's approach is permissive, accommodating and indirect. For example, where a classical hypnotist might say [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> a trance", an Ericksonian hypnotist {{would be more likely}} to say [...] "you can comfortably learn how to go into a trance". In this way, he provides an opportunity for the subject to accept the suggestions they are most comfortable with, at their own pace, and with an awareness of the benefits. The subject knows they are not being hustled and takes full ownership of, and participates in, their transformation. [...] Because the induction takes place during the course of a normal conversation, Ericksonian hypnosis is often known as Covert or Conversational Hypnosis.|$|E

That year, YouTube videos of rats on subway tracks and in a subway car in New York City went viral, as did videos of rats in a Dunkin' Donuts in Manhattan. In June 2014, residents at adjacent Upper West Side buildings started a rent strike, demanding {{an end to the}} rat problem. Also in 2014, Allerton Coops in Bronx Park East received three Notices of Violation from the Health Department and was fined for their inadequate response to a severe rat infestation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} later used in March 1984 by Gay Bryant. She was the {{former editor of}} Working Woman {{magazine}} and was changing jobs to be the editor of Family Circle. In an Adweek article written by Nora Frenkel, Bryant was reported as saying, [...] "Women have reached a certain point—I call it the glass ceiling.

[...] Also in 1984, Bryant used the term in a chapter of the book The Working Woman Report: Succeeding in Business in the 1980s. In the same book, Basia Hellwig used the term in another chapter.|$|E

2500|$|In France, pre-hospital care is {{performed}} either by first responders {{from the fire}} department (sapeurs-pompiers, in most emergency situations) or from a private ambulance company (relative emergency at home), or by a medical team that includes a physician, a nurse and an ambulance technician (called [...] "SMUR"). The intermediate scale, the firefighter nurse (infirmier sapeur-pompier, ISP), is only a recent evolution and {{is performed}} by nurses who have been specially trained acting with emergency protocols; these nurses are the French equivalent of paramedics. The arrival of first responders is thus the most common result of an emergency call. In addition, in France there exists a network of first responder associations, as French Red Cross (Croix-rouge française), civil protection (protection civile), FFSS (Fédération Française de Sauvetage et de Secourisme) or others. These CFR volunteers are allowed to supervise massive outside meetings, student gatherings, et cetera. These volunteers have followed the same special rescuer training as firefighters (PSE 1 & PSE 2, in all 70 hours of training), trainees always know what they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>into,</b> they would be given basic medical training then transferred to the Fire Department, they shall always show humanistic interaction, and shall assist and help people with their concerns.(( [...] firefighter))s ((PSE1-PSE2)) ...|$|E
