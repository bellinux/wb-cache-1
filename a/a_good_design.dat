25|$|Product {{and process}} design can be largely {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. The key question in optimal design {{is the measure}} of what is good or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E

A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, {{and with good}} motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> needs to be used properly for best effect, but: [...] "Electric toothbrushes tend {{to help people who}} are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems." [...] The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

2500|$|While {{some of the}} {{components}} in the PCC car had been used before—resilient wheels, magnetic braking, sealed gears, and modular design to name a few—the ERPCC redesigned, refined, and perfected many of these while developing new acceleration and braking controls and put them all in one package.

2500|$|Such a CMG {{includes}} two gimbals per rotor. [...] As an actuator, {{it is more}} versatile than a single-gimbal CMG because {{it is capable of}} pointing the rotor's momentum vector in any direction. [...] However, the torque generated by one gimbal's motion must often be reacted by the other gimbal {{on its way to the}} spacecraft, requiring more power for a given torque than a single-gimbal CMG. [...] If the goal is simply to store momentum in a mass-efficient way, as in the case of the International Space Station, dual-gimbal CMGs are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> choice. [...] However, if a spacecraft instead requires large output torque while consuming minimal power, single-gimbal CMGs are a better choice.|$|E

2500|$|During {{development}} of the earlier Hawker Typhoon, the design team, {{under the leadership of}} Sydney Camm, had already planned out a series of design improvements; these improvements cumulated in the Hawker P. 1012, otherwise known as the Typhoon II or Thin-Wing Typhoon. Although the Typhoon was generally considered to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design,</b> Camm and his design team were disappointed with the performance of its wing, which had proved to be too thick in its cross section, and thus created airflow problems which inhibited flight performance, especially at higher altitudes and speeds where it was affected by compressibility. The Typhoon's wing, which used a NACA 4 digit series wing section, had a maximum thickness-to-chord ratio of 19.5 per cent (root) to 12 per cent (tip), in comparison to the Supermarine Spitfire's 13.2 per cent tapering to 6 per cent at the tip, the thinner design being deliberately chosen to reduce drag. [...] In addition, there had been other issues experienced with the Typhoon, such as engine unreliability, insufficient structural integrity, and the inability to perform high altitude interception duties.|$|E

At last I seemed to be prevailed on by her importunity, and told her I dared trust her with a secret of the greatest importance, and she would soon see that this was so, and that I would consent to lodge it in her breast, if she would engage solemnly not to acquaint her son with it without my consent.|$|E

60|$|And {{there had}} come a reason quite {{irrespective}} of Dorothea, {{which seemed to}} make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of philanthropic duty.

60|$|As in {{my present}} {{condition}} {{there were not}} really many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation, had taken {{off the edge of}} my invention for my own conveniences, and I had dropped <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design,</b> which I had once bent my thoughts upon; and that was, to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer: this was really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I could never compass; no, though I spent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet, had not all these things intervened, I mean the frights and terrors I was in about the savages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave any thing over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my head enough to begin it.|$|E
