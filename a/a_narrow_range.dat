5|$|The {{subspecies}} Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum (Santa Cruz Long-toed Salamander) is {{of particular}} concern and it was afforded protections in 1967 under the US Endangered Species Act. This subspecies lives in <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of habitat in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County, California. Prior to receiving protections, some few remaining populations were threatened by development. The subspecies is ecologically unique, having unique and irregular skin patterns on its back, a unique moisture tolerance, {{and it is also}} an endemic that is geographically isolated {{from the rest of the}} species range. Other subspecies include A. m. columbianum, A. m. krausei, A. m. macrodactylum and A. m. sigillatum.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of frequencies, a stub {{can be used}} as a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, unusual environments may {{preserve}} soft tissues. These lagerstätten allow paleontologists {{to examine}} the internal anatomy of animals that in other sediments are represented only by shells, spines, claws, etc. – if they are preserved at all. However, even lagerstätten present an incomplete picture of life at the time. The majority of organisms living at the time are probably not represented because lagerstätten are restricted to <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of environments, e.g. where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly by events such as mudslides; and the exceptional events that cause quick burial {{make it difficult to}} study the normal environments of the animals. The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms are expected to exist long before and after they are found in the fossil record– this is known as the Signor-Lipps effect.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variation}} on the standard die {{is known as the}} [...] "average" [...] die. These are six-sided dice with sides numbered , which results in the same average result as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> <b>range</b> of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> <b>range</b> of numbers is required.|$|R

5|$|The outer Adams ring, with an orbital {{radius of}} about 63,930km, {{is the best}} studied of Neptune's rings. It is named after John Couch Adams, who {{predicted}} the position of Neptune independently of Le Verrier. This ring is narrow, slightly eccentric and inclined, with total width of about 35km (15–50km), and its normal optical depth is around 0.011±0.003 outside the arcs, which corresponds to the equivalent depth of about 0.4km. The fraction of dust in this ring is from 20% to 40%—lower than in other narrow rings. Neptune's small moon Galatea, which orbits just inside of the Adams ring at 61,953km, acts like a shepherd, keeping ring particles inside <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of orbital radii through a 42:43 outer Lindblad resonance. Galatea's gravitational influence creates 42 radial wiggles in the Adams ring with an amplitude of about 30km, which {{have been used to}} infer Galatea's mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune {{are made of}} {{extremely}} dark material, likely organic compounds processed by radiation, similar to that found in the rings of Uranus. The proportion of dust in the rings (between 20% and 70%) is high, while their optical depth is low to moderate, at less than 0.1. Uniquely, the Adams ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between the Adams ring and its inner shepherd moon, Galatea.|$|E
5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen storage {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{by some to be}} optimal in <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of energy storage time, probably somewhere between a few days and a few weeks.

Rattles and water drums are used, in a swift tempo. The Sun Dance and Grass Dance of the plains are the roots of intertribal powwows, which feature music with terraced descent and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen fusion {{may occur}} in a stable manner {{on the surface of}} the white dwarf for <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of {{accretion}} rates, giving rise to a super soft X-ray source, but for most binary system parameters, the hydrogen burning is unstable thermally and rapidly converts a large amount of the hydrogen into other, heavier chemical elements in a runaway reaction, liberating an enormous amount of energy. This blows the remaining gases away from the surface of the white dwarf surface and produces an extremely bright outburst of light.|$|E
25|$|For {{scientific}} optical work, dielectric mirrors {{are often}} used. These are glass (or sometimes other material) substrates on which {{one or more}} layers of dielectric material are deposited, to form an optical coating. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, the range of wavelengths and amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified. The best mirrors of this type can reflect >99.999% of the light (in <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of wavelengths) which is incident on the mirror. Such mirrors are often used in lasers.|$|E

25|$|In {{biological}} {{systems such as}} organisms, ecosystems, or the biosphere, most parameters must stay under control within <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change {{of some of the}} environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An example of this is insulin oscillations.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} New Zealand's economy {{was built on}} <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of {{agricultural}} products, such as wool, meat and dairy. These products became New Zealand's staple and most valuable exports, underpinning {{the success of the}} economy, from the 1850s until the 1970s. For example, from 1920 to the late 1930s, the dairy export quota was usually around 35% of New Zealand's total exports, and in some years made up almost 45%. Due to the high demand for these primary products, manifested by the New Zealand wool boom of 1951, New Zealand had one of the highest standards of living in the world for 70 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{decrease in}} the member of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, {{increase the amount of}} detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>range</b> of depth. In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources.|$|E
