5000|$|Jones {{endured a}} torrid season <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> in 2007, who {{finished}} {{bottom of the}} Super 14 table, only managing two wins the entire season. Injury spells meant Jones at times had to do without up to 8 regulars in his starting team, including the loss of influential Wallabies fullback Chris Latham even before the season started. His last match was an away defeat to the Bulls by a Super Rugby record margin of 89 points, which led to mounting calls in the media {{for him to be}} sacked. His stint <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> is by far the least successful of his coaching career and he resigned after just one season in charge. During his time <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> he was also fined $10,000 dollars for calling the performance of referee Matt Goddard [...] "disgraceful" [...] and [...] "lacking common sense" [...] after a close 6-3 loss to his former side the Brumbies.|$|R

Nonetheless, by early afternoon, the police and volunteers had established evacuation centres at hospitals, schools and tram stations, and a morgue was established in the Asano library.|$|E

The highway then ran through Lawton—concurring with {{the original}} SH-29—en route to Anadarko via Apache. In Anadarko, SH-8 linked up with the present highway. The remainder of the route was mostly the same as it is today.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failure}} to {{assimilate}} Indigenous children by early missionaries in the 17th century, educational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, prior {{to the introduction of}} state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> River Colony in what is today Manitoba. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in the current Ontario region, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture as a way to ensure they would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.|$|E
