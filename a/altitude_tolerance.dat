50|$|Bioaerosols {{can range}} in size from 10 {{nanometer}} virus particles to 100 micrometers pollen grains. Pollen grains are the largest bioaerosols and are less likely to remain suspended in the air {{over a long period of}} time due to their weight. Consequently, pollen particle concentration decreases more rapidly with height than smaller bioaerosols such as bacteria, fungi and possibly viruses, which may be able to survive in the upper troposphere. At present, there is little research on the specific <b>altitude</b> <b>tolerance</b> of different bioaerosols. However, scientists believe that atmospheric turbulence impacts where different bioaerosols may be found.|$|E
40|$|High {{altitude}} Andean streams harbor a quite diverse {{benthic community}} {{represented by the}} major groups of invertebrates. Evidence is provided that abundant insect species have not been described taxonomically and that unique genotypes occur, probably {{as a result of}} the geological history of the Andes and the strong selection for high <b>altitude</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Cuticular pigmentation of larvae is demonstrated to form an inducible sunscreen against scorching UV radiation, but the pigment melanin is also effective in mitigating metal stress. Thus a single trait of the fauna enables species to cope with the combined stressor UV radiation and metal exposure from leaching rock. The only species from the stress tolerant chironomids that survives the most harsh condition of a metal-rich, UV blasted site is a non-identifiable chironomid, characterized as a new haplotype. The vertical zonation of insect fauna on the slopes of the Andes is strong and I identify multiple stress factors such as the mountainous oxygen regime, high UV radiation and metal leaching as drivers of the composition of benthic assemblages in high altitude Andean streams. It is concluded that selection is strong at all altitudes in the Andes, but is most evident at high altitude and high metal exposure: at ‘the edges of life’...|$|E
30|$|There were various {{effects of}} pasture site on ECM yield and milk composition. Pasture site effects within a transhumant cycle on {{different}} performance traits or milk FA profile {{were also found}} elsewhere (Leiber et al. 2006; De Noni and Battelli 2008; Gorlier et al. 2012). For their interpretation {{it is important to}} keep in mind that the factor ‘pasture site’ inseparably included individual effects of forage quality, amount of forage biomass on offer, altitude, the progressing stage of lactation and interactions among these factors. Generally, MY is impaired with increasing altitude, as has been reported for instance by Qiao et al. (2013) for Chinese Holstein cattle kept at 3, 600  m a.s.l. as compared to 1600  m a.s.l. In the present study the decline in ECM yield was primarily caused by the well-known effect of the advancing stage of lactation during transhumance (e.g. Gorlier et al. 2012). In addition, energy supply and ECM yield were depressed by the decline of forage quality due to the progressing season. Consistent with Leiber et al. (2006) and, numerically, Gorlier et al. (2012), the milk fat content increased with altitude, but in the present study only when moving the animals from 3, 200 to 4, 000  m a.s.l. During the downward movement, milk fat content further increased due to the progressing stage of lactation (Ostersen et al. 1997) and the increasing fiber content of the forage. As expected, milk protein declined with increasing altitude (Leiber et al. 2006) and with low forage quality (Rook and Line 1961). Grazing at both, the highest altitude Site 3 (4, 500  m) and Site 5, obviously resulted in an energy deficiency in the hybrids as indicated by BW changes, the first likely because of hypoxia (Bianca 1976) and the last due to the low forage quality. The BW gain found on Site 4 compared to Site 3 might indicate that this altitude was more comfortable for the hybrids whereas their high <b>altitude</b> <b>tolerance</b> was surpassed at 4, 500  m. Fully adapted animals staying most of the time at very high altitude such as the yaks in the present study do not show such BW losses (Bartl et al. 2009; Qiao et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} ten years, two major {{experiments}} have elucidated the factors determining acclimatization and <b>tolerance</b> to extreme <b>altitude</b> (over 7000 m). These were the American Medical Research Expedition to Everest, and the low pressure chamber simulation, Operation Everest II. Extreme hyperventilation {{is one of the}} most important responses to extreme altitude. Its chief value is that it allows the climber to maintain an alveolar PO 2 which keeps the arterial PO 2 above dangerously low levels. Even so, there is evidence of residual impairment of central nervous system function after ascents to extreme altitude, and maximal oxygen consumption falls precipitously above 7000 m. The term 'acclimatization' is probably not appropriate for altitudes above 8000 m, because the body steadily deteriorates at these <b>altitudes.</b> <b>Tolerance</b> to extreme <b>altitude</b> is critically dependent on barometric pressure, and even seasonal changes in pressure probably affect climbing performance near the summit of Mt Everest. Supplementary oxygen always improves exercise <b>tolerance</b> at extreme <b>altitudes,</b> and rescue oxygen should be available on climbing expeditions to 8000 m peaks...|$|R

40|$|Variety N 12 was {{released}} in the rainfed areas of the South African sugar industry in 1979. Its many good features, including resistance to mosaic, superior sucrose yields particularly in high <b>altitude</b> areas, <b>tolerance</b> of moisture stress and waterlogged conditions and general reliability, have resulted in N 12 being planted extensively throughout the rainfed parts of the industry. In the 1997 - 98 season, N 12 accounted for 32 % of the total cane crush {{and it is the}} most widely grown variety in the industry. Since 1980, N 12 has been included in 53 trials in the agronomy released varieties trials programme, and harvested on 237 occasions. Trial results in terms of sucrose content, cane and sucrose yield are reviewed, and the effect of age of harvest and region are compared with varieties NCo 376 and N 16. Other factors discussed are the performance of N 12 during periods of drought, crop stage and month of harvest. N 12 is a variety clearly suited to a longer growing period and has proved very productive in the higher altitude regions. In the coastal regions where harvesting is generally conducted annually, it has filled a valuable role in less favourable conditions and as carryover cane, but under more productive conditions in the Zululand /Umfolozi regions, has been outperformed by NCo 376 and N 16...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} two {{populations of}} Populus cathayana Rehder, originating from altitudes 2 840 m and 1 450 m, {{to determine whether}} trees from different <b>altitudes</b> exhibit different <b>tolerance</b> to alkalinity. The tree cuttings were exposed to nutrient solutions with pH 7. 9, 8. 8, 9. 8 and 10. 4 and the salt concentration 200 mM. Na+ and K+ contents, and Na+/K+ ratios in leaves and roots were greatly affected by pH values. At pH 10. 4, the Na+/K+ ratios in both leaves and roots sharply dropped in the higher altitude population but were maintained at higher levels in the lower altitude population. The patterns of pH-induced changes in contents of malondialdehyde and free proline, and antioxidative enzyme activities indicated that the higher altitude population exhibits greater tolerance to alkalinity stress than does the lower altitude population.

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} was conducted at three levels of altitude i. e 80 m asl (Kediri), 530 m asl (Malang), and 800 m asl (Ponorogo). The purpose of this {{research was}} to evaluate cassava clones under three altitudes (80 m asl, 530 m asl, and 800 m asl) and to identify cassava clones that tolerant to low temperature zones at medium altitude in the tropics. Criteria that used for selection the best clone in different <b>altitude</b> were stress <b>tolerance</b> index (STI), stress susceptibility index (SSI), stress tolerance (TOL), mean productivity (MP), and yield stability index (YSI). The result showed that stress tolerance index (STI) and mean productivity (MP) were good criteria for selecting cassava clones that tolerant to higher altitude. Tuber yield loss at 530 m asl was 32 %, while at 800 m asl was 86 %, compared to tuber yield at 80 m asl. Malang 4 (G 3) and CMM 03038 - 7 (G 8) are adaptive clones to environment at medium altitude up to 800 m asl...|$|R
40|$|Hippophae rhamnoides L. {{is uniquely}} capable of growing well under extreme {{environmental}} {{conditions such as}} water deficit, low temperature, and high <b>altitude.</b> Such <b>tolerance</b> invokes much interest in understanding the biology of this plant species and its utilization potential. In this study, analysis of drought stress-responsive proteins in H. rhamnoides was conducted wherein greenhouse-grown seedlings were subjected to drought stress. By using proteomic techniques, proteins, extracted from leaves, were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS. Altogether, 55 proteins exhibited changes in abundance under stress. Of these, 13 proteins were identified, including three that disappeared under drought (a putative ABC transporter ATP-binging protein, a heat shock protein Hs 1 U, and a hypothetical protein XP 515578), seven that were up-regulated (three large subunits of rubisco, a hypothetical protein DSM 3645 - 23351, a putative acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a nesprin- 2, and a J-type co-chaperone HSC 20), and three that were only detected under drought (a probable nitrogen regulation protein (NtrX), a 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, and an unnamed protein product). These proteins may function in beta-oxidation pathways in mitochondria, across membranes transport, abnormal protein removal, or prevent protein aggregation arrest, cell division, cytoskeleton stabilization, iron-sulfur cluster assembly, nitrogen metabolism regulation, and antioxidant substance biosynthesis. Four proteins (J-type co-chaperone Hsc 20, a putative ABC transporter ATP-binging protein, NtrX, and Hs 1 U) were deemed as new discoveries in higher plants, and their functions were predicted either from their conserved domains or homologies to other organisms. These results provide new insights into {{our understanding of the}} mechanism of drought tolerance in plants.

50|$|The {{basic concept}} of {{autoland}} {{flows from the}} fact that an autopilot could be set up to track an artificial signal such as an Instrument Landing System (ILS) beam more accurately than a human pilot could - not least because of the inadequacies of the electro-mechanical flight instruments of the time. If the ILS beam could be tracked to a lower height then clearly the aircraft would be nearer to the runway when it reached the limit of ILS usability, and nearer to the runway less visibility would be required to see sufficient cues to confirm the aircraft position and trajectory. With an angular signal system such as ILS, as <b>altitude</b> decreases all <b>tolerances</b> must be decreased - in both the aircraft system and the input signal - to maintain the required degree of safety. This is because certain other factors - physical and physiological laws which govern for example the pilot's ability to make the aircraft respond - remain constant. For example, at 300 feet above the runway on a standard 3 degree approach the aircraft will be 6000 feet from the touchdown point, and at 100 feet it will be 2000 feet out. If a small course correction needs 10 seconds to be effected at 180kts it will take 3000 ft. It will be possible if initiated at 300 feet of height, but not at 100 feet. Consequently, only a smaller course correction can be tolerated at the lower height, and the system needs to be more accurate.|$|R
