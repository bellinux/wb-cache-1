40|$|Components of plasminogen/plasmin system play {{crucial role}} in fibrinolytic rocesses. They are also {{involved}} in regulation of cell activity in normalcy and various pathological conditions. In particular, kringle-containing proteolityc plasminogen fragments, which are denoted as <b>angiostatins,</b> participate in processes during neovascularization, metastasis, tumor growth, inflammation. <b>Angiostatins</b> {{are considered to be}} potential markers of diseases associated with vascular pathologies. Therefore, elaboration of specific and sensitive methods for their detection is still important area of inquiry. In the present study, approaches for obtaining of plasminogen fragments through its limited proteolysis by pancreatic elastase and further purification of proteolytic derivates by means of gel filtration and affinity chromatography on Lys-Sepharose are described. Polyclonal antibodies raised to fragment K 1 - 3 have been produced, and their principal immunochemical properties have been studied. It has been found that antibodies purified on immunoaffine sorbent demonstrate different affinity toward plasminogen and its fragment, as follows: Glu-Pg > Lys-Pg > К 1 - 3 > mini-Pg > К 4. Based on the data obtained, immunological features of plasminogen kringle domains are discussed. Antibodies against fragment K 1 - 3 could be applied in immunochemical analysis, in particular, Western blot, for detection of <b>angiostatins</b> as markers of tumor growth, metastasis, cardiovascular diseases and inflammation processes, and used as molecular tool for investigation of plasminogen/plasmin system functioning in health and disease...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multicell model to {{describe}} the evolution of tumour growth from the avascular stage to the vascular one through the angiogenic process. The model is able to predict the formation of necrotic regions, the control of mitosis {{by the presence of}} an inhibitory factor, the angiogenesis process with proliferation of capillaries just outside the tumour surface with penetration of capillary sprouts inside the tumour, the regression of the capillary network induced by the tumour when angiogenesis is controlled or inhibited, say as an eect of <b>angiostatins,</b> and nally the regression of the tumour size. The three-dimensional model is deduced both in a continuum mechanics framework and by a lattice scheme in order to put in evidence the relation between microscopic phenomena and macroscopic parameters. The evolution problem can be written as a free-boundary problem of mixed hyperbolic{parabolic type coupled with an initial-boundary value problem in a xed domain. 1...|$|R
50|$|Plasminogen (Pg) is an {{important}} mediator of <b>angiostatin</b> production in the fibrinolytic pathway. Plasminogen {{is made up of}} five subunit kringle molecules (Pg-K1 to Pg-K5), of which the first three make the protein <b>angiostatin.</b> VEK-30 is a protein domain of the group A streptococcal protein PAM. It binds to Pg-K2 domain of <b>angiostatin</b> and activates the molecule to mediate its anti-angiogenic effects. VEK-30 binds to <b>angiostatin</b> via a C-terminal lysine with argininyl and glutamyl side chain residues known as a 'through space isostere'.|$|E
50|$|Plasmin {{cleavage}} produces <b>angiostatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Angiostatin</b> is produced, for example, by autoproteolytic {{cleavage}} of plasminogen, involving extracellular disulfide bond reduction by phosphoglycerate kinase. Furthermore, <b>angiostatin</b> can be cleaved from plasminogen {{by different}} metalloproteinases (MMPs), elastase, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), 13 KD serine protease, or 24KD endopeptidase.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} review, we have {{summarized}} and analyzed the literature data concerning cooperation between multifunctional proteins, {{the components of}} plasminogen/plasmin system and actin. The mechanisms underlying intermolecular interactions {{and the role of}} plasminogen kringle domains in protein-protein recognition are reviewed. A particular attention is paid to extracellular actin that serves as a surface protein of plasma membrane in various cells. A putative role of surface actin as the universal «non-hemostatic» center of plasminogen activation is discussed. The exposition of cytoskeletal actin on the outer surface of cellular membrane is thought to be a phenomenon, which is involved in both normal cell functioning and development of pathologies. In particular, the mechanism of plasminogen fragmentation on the surface of cancer cells mediated by actin, which results in generation of endogenous suppressors of tumor growth and metastazing (<b>angiostatins),</b> is described. It has been acknowledged that the plasminogen/plasmin system in concert with surface actin regulates releasing biologically active substances, e. g. catecholamines. The comprehensive assessment of plasminogen/plasmin system and surface actin exposition is proposed to be a criterion of functional status of cells and {{can be used as a}} diagnostic parameter at various pathologies...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis, the {{sprouting}} of new capillaries from pre-existing microvasculature, {{is a key}} phenomenon {{for many}} physiological and athological processes. Physiological angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis and for a healthy adult it occurs during wound healing and the female ovarian/menstrual cycle. Uncontrolled or dysfunctional angiogenesis on the other hand, {{has been shown to}} be associated with ischemia of the heart, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and tumour growth and metastasis. Control of angiogenesis occurs via a signal network of activators and repressors, known as angiogenesis-stimulating factors (angiogenic factors) and angiogenesis inhibitors (<b>angiostatins).</b> PrC?teins involved in this key process include nucleoside phosphorylases as well as the tissue inhibitors ofmetalloproteinases (TIMPs). Nucleoside phosphorylases catalyse the reversible phosphorolysis of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, a reaction of key importance for the nucleotide salvage pathway. Pyrimidine phosphorylases (PyNPs), which cleave the glycosidic bond of pyrimidines readily catalyses the reversible phosphorolysis (having primarily a catabolic function) of thymidine and 2 '-deoxyuridine to their respective base and to 2 -deoxy-D-ribose-l-' phosphate, as well as that of some pyrimidine analogues. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) was found to induce the eH] thymidine incorporation, endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. This is achieved by retaining a constant and correct supply of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) for DNA repair and replication. TP has also been shown to play a crucial role in pathological angiogenesis; TP overexpression has been related to various carcinomas while TP deficiency has been related to certain clinical conditions. Here we report the crystal structures of hTP in two fonns: unbound (native hTP) and bound with a small molecule inhibitor, 5 IUR, which greatly resembles the chemotherapeutic agent currently used, 5 FUR. Additionally, mutagenesis and enzymatic activity assays provide some novel infonnation on the significance of certain active site residues and their role in the phosphorolytic reaction catalysed by hTP. Extracellular matrix (ECM), which surrounds tissues and organs, has been shown to influence cell behaviour. Turnover of ECM components is therefore a crucial process for the control of cellular behaviour. It is essential in morphogenesis and tissue remodeling, which occur during embryonic development, wound healing and angiogenesis, while., misregulation of ECM components turnover, has been linked to a series of pathological conditions. Enzymes involved in proteolytic systems that ECM turnover include the matrix-degrading proteinases known as Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) or matrixins. The role of these molecules is highly controlled under physiological conditions, primarily by endogenous inhibitors, known as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). TIMPs have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential use in therapeutics. Understanding the structural features that are essential for TIMP potency against MMPs is thus of outmost importance. A bioinformatic analysis of an 'ancestral' TIMP form, TIMP from Drosophila melanogaster (dTIMP) allows the understanding of the evolutionary relati<;mships thatlink TIMPs. from different species, and raises questions about the significance of certain conserved TIMP features.

5000|$|<b>Angiostatin</b> {{is known}} to bind many proteins, {{especially}} to angiomotin and endothelial cell surface ATP synthase but also integrins, annexin II, C-met receptor, NG2 proteoglycan, tissue-type plasminogen activator, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and CD26. Additionally, smaller fragments of <b>angiostatin</b> may bind several other proteins. There is still considerable uncertainty on its mechanism of action, {{but it seems to}} involve inhibition of endothelial cell migration, [...] proliferation and induction of apoptosis. It has been proposed that <b>angiostatin</b> activity is related, among other things, to the coupling of its mechanical and redox properties.|$|E

50|$|<b>Angiostatin</b> is a 38 kDa {{fragment}} {{of a larger}} protein, plasmin (itself a {{fragment of}} plasminogen) enclosing three to five contiguous kringle modules. Each module contains two small beta sheets and three disulfide bonds.|$|E
50|$|PGK {{has been}} {{reported}} to exhibit thiol reductase activity on plasmin, leading to <b>angiostatin</b> formation, which inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. The enzyme was also shown to participate in DNA replication and repair in mammal cell nuclei.|$|E
50|$|<b>Angiostatin</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring protein found in several animal species, including humans. It is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor (i.e., it blocks {{the growth of}} new blood vessels), and it is currently undergoing clinical trials for its use in anticancer therapy.|$|E
50|$|Granzyme B {{can also}} impair wound healing. Cleavage of the von Willebrand factor {{inhibits}} platelet aggregation and of plasminogen produces an <b>angiostatin</b> fragment preventing angiogenesis. The cutting of fibronectins and vitronectins delays {{the formation of}} a provisional matrix impairing wound healing further.|$|E
50|$|Angiomotin p80 locates and binds <b>angiostatin</b> on {{the cell}} surface. In primary endothelial of Chinese hamster ovary, it localizes to cell-cell junction, {{recruits}} ZO-1 and interacts with MAGI-1. It {{may play a role}} in the assembly of endothelial cell-cell junctions, as well.|$|E
50|$|Expression of angiomotin p80 in endothelial cells {{increases}} the random migration of endothelial cells, {{as well as}} the migration of endothelial cells toward growth factors, e.g. bFGF, VEGF and LPA etc. Angiomotin also mediates tube formation of endothelial cells. Angiomotin promotes angiogenesis by both stimulating cell spreading and stabilizing established tubes, e.g. in mouse aortic endothelial (MAE) cells the tubes remained stable for over 30 days, while control tubes started to regress after 3 days. In the presence of <b>angiostatin,</b> endothelial cells expressing angiomotin p80 exhibit reduction in migration as well as reduction in tubules formation in vitro. These observations are consistent with the localization of angiomotin in the leading edge of migrating cells. <b>Angiostatin</b> therefore, is an inhibitor of angiomotin.|$|E
50|$|Angiomotin p130 {{does not}} promote cell migration, nor {{responds}} to <b>angiostatin.</b> It localizes to cell-cell junction like p80 and regulates paracellular permeability. Its N-terminal domain localizes to actin fibers and stabilizes them, and {{this effect is}} not affected by <b>angiostatin.</b> Transfection of p130 angiomotin into MAE cells results in change in cell shape, increased average cell size and stress fiber formation. So p80 is involved in cell migration and expressed during migratory phase. While p130 controls cell shape by interaction with actin, and is expressed {{during the period of}} blood vessel stabilization and maturation. The relative expression levels of p80 and p130 regulate a switch between a migratory and a non-migratory cell phenotype, where homo-oligomerization of p80 and hetero-oligomerization of both isoforms are critical for this regulation.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 Michael O"Reilly, {{working in}} the Folkman lab with Entremed funding, {{discovered}} the first endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, <b>angiostatin</b> and then another, endostatin. Entremed began developing them and soon struck a collaboration with Bristol-Myers, which caught national interest and spurred further investment in angiogenesis inhibitors by other pharma companies.|$|E
50|$|PGK1 {{overexpression}} {{has been}} associated with gastric cancer and has been found to increase the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells in vitro. The enzyme is secreted by tumor cells and participates in the angiogenic process, leading to the release of <b>angiostatin</b> and the inhibition of tumor blood vessel growth.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a {{peripheral}} membrane protein {{that is a}} component of tight junctions or TJs. TJs form an apical junctional structure and act to control paracellular permeability and maintain cell polarity. This protein is related to angiomotin, an <b>angiostatin</b> binding protein that regulates endothelial cell migration and capillary formation.|$|E
50|$|PEDF {{expression}} is upregulated by plasminogen kringle domains 1-4 (also known as <b>angiostatin)</b> and the kringle 5 (K5) domain. Hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, {{leads to the}} downregulation of PEDF. This effect is due to hypoxic conditions causing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to proteolytically degrade PEDF.

50|$|Angiomotin (AMOT) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the AMOT gene. It {{belongs to the}} motin family of <b>angiostatin</b> binding proteins, which {{includes}} angiomotin, angiomotin-like 1 (AMOTL1) and angiomotin-like 2 (AMOTL2) characterized by coiled-coil domains at N-terminus and consensus PDZ-binding domain at the C-terminus. Angiomotin is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells of capillaries as well as angiogenic tissues such as placenta and solid tumor.|$|E
50|$|A DNA {{vaccination}} targeting angiomotin generated antibodies that detected AMOT on the {{endothelial cell}} surface, which inhibited migration. It blocked angiogenesis and prevented growth of transplanted tumors {{for up to}} 150 days in vivo. A combination of DNA vaccines encoding AMOT and the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human EGF receptor 2 (Her-2)/neu oncogene inhibited breast cancer progression and impaired tumor vascularization in Her-2/neu transgenic mice, showing DNA vaccination targeting AMOT {{may be used to}} mimic the effect of <b>angiostatin</b> and no toxicity or impairment of normal blood vessels was detected.|$|E
50|$|Angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) is an {{essential}} part of the formation of large tumour masses. Angiogenesis can be inhibited by the expression of several genes, which can be delivered to cancer cells in viral vectors, resulting in suppression of angiogenesis, and oxygen starvation in the tumour. The infection of cells with viruses containing the genes for <b>angiostatin</b> and endostatin synthesis inhibited tumour growth in mice. Enhanced antitumour activities have been demonstrated in a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding anti-angiogenic therapeutic antibody and with an HSV1716 variant expressing an inhibitor of angiogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Angiomotin p80 is a 72.54 kD protein of 675 residues, {{characterized}} by conserved N-terminal coiled coil domains and C-terminal PDZ binding motifs, with <b>angiostatin</b> binding domain (ABD) {{located in the}} central region. It is hypothesized that the ABD is extracellular, while the coiled-coil and the PDZ binding domain are intracellular. The PDZ-binding motif of angiomotin serves as a protein recognition site and deletion of as few as three amino acids from the C-terminal results in complete loss of pro-migratory activity, and endothelial cells expressing such mutant angiomotin failed to migrate or form tubes.|$|E
5000|$|Gorski's {{work with}} Helena Mauceri and others, {{published}} in Nature as [...] "Combined effects of <b>angiostatin</b> and ionizing radiation in antitumour therapy" [...] studied the [...] "combined effects of angiostatin" [...] (a protein occurring in several animal species) [...] "and ionizing radiation in anti-tumor therapy" [...] led to {{investigation into the}} selective destruction of tumor cells, which {{according to a study}} by Gregg L. Semenza (citing Mauceri and others), [...] "are more hypoxic than normal cells," [...] allowing for [...] "tumor cells to be killed without major systemic side effects." ...|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{proteolytic}} fragments or {{domains of}} ECM proteins {{have been reported}} to exert positive or negative activity on angiogenesis. Native proteins which contain such domains with regulatory activity are normally inactive, most likely because they are cryptic segments hidden in the native protein structure. <b>Angiostatin</b> is a 38 kDa plasminogen fragment with angiogenesis inhibitor activity. <b>Angiostatin</b> fragments contain kringle domains which exert their inhibitory activity at several different levels; they inhibit endothelial cell migration and proliferation, increase apoptosis, and modulate the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Endostatin is a 20 kDa fragment of collagen XVIII. The major role of endostatin is in its ability to potently inhibit endothelial cell migration and induce apoptosis. [...] These effects are mediated by interacting and interfering with various angiogenic related proteins such as integrins and serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. Numerous studies have demonstrated that tropoelastin, the soluble precursor of elastin, or proteolytic elastin fragments have diverse biological properties. Nackman et al. demonstrated that elastase generated elastin fragments mediate several characteristic features of aneurismal disease which correlated to angiogenesis. Osteonectin is a metal binding glycoprotein produced by many cell types including ECs. Lastly, endorepellin is a recently described inhibitor of angiogenesis derived from the carboxy terminus of perlecan. Nanomolar concentrations of endorepellin inhibits EC migration and angiogenesis in different in vitro and in vivo models by blocking EC adhesion to various substrate such as fibronectin and type I collagen.|$|E
50|$|Proteases {{not only}} {{facilitate}} angiogenesis, {{but they also}} have the ability to put the brakes on the process. One example of this is the processing of angiogenesis inhibitors by MMPs. As previously described, MMPs have been shown to cleave plasminogen and collagen XVIII into the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors <b>angiostatin</b> and endostatin. MMP-2 itself possesses anti-angiogenic properties that are independent of its catalytic domain. Interactions between integrin αvβ3 and MMP-2 on the EC cell surface may be necessary for MMP-2 activity during angiogenesis. The hemopexin like domain in the carboxy terminus of MMP-2 is able to block this interaction of active MMP-2 and integrin αvβ3 on the EC surface which lead to inhibition of MMP-2 activity.|$|E
