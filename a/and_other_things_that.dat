25|$|Historian Timothy Brook {{states that}} Ming dynasty gazetteers {{demonstrate}} {{a shift in}} the attitudes of Chinese gentry towards the traditionally lower merchant class.

Hence, the gentry figures composing the gazetteers {{in the latter half of}} the Ming period spoke favorably of merchants, whereas before they were rarely mentioned. Brook and other modern sinologist historians also examine and consult the local Ming gazetteers to compare population info with the contemporary central government records, which often provided dubious population figures that did not reflect the actually larger population size of China during the time.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variation}} of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section {{to the game}} that either already existed in the game's code or was recently developed after the game had already been released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> weren't previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is Bungie's most recent game, Destiny, when they released the [...] expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, higher levels, and also remade old missions so that the difficulty would be meet the new levels that {{were added to the}} characters. Expansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game all together. Developers at times plan out their games life and already have the code for the expansion in the game but inaccessible by players and they would unlock the expansions as time went on to the players, sometimes at no extra cost and other times it costs extra to get the expansion. There are also some developers who make the game and then make the expansions as time goes on so that they could see what the players would like to have and what they can do to make the game better. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, an example of that is Ubisoft's expansion [...] Freedom's Cry which takes place control of a different character than that of the original game.|$|E
