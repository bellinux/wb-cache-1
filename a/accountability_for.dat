5|$|Most of the equipment, arms, and {{machinery}} at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to {{east of the}} Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen.

5|$|Despite U.S. {{declarations}} of neutrality and German <b>accountability</b> <b>for</b> its unrestricted submarine warfare, in 1915 the British passenger liner Lusitania was sunk, leading {{to calls for}} war. President Wilson forced the Germans to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare and after long debate Congress passes the Naval Act of 1916 that authorized a $500million construction program over three years for 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 10 scout cruisers, 50 destroyers and 67 submarines. The idea was a balanced fleet, but in the event destroyers were much more important, {{because they had to}} handle submarines and convoys. By {{the end of the war}} 273 destroyers had been ordered; most were finished after World War I ended but many served in World War II. There were few war plans beyond the defense of the main American harbors.|$|E

5|$|On 17 July 1995, U.S. Senator William Roth, {{chairman}} of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, authorized a Senate investigation into the incident, primarily in response to complaints from {{family members of the}} shootdown victims that it appeared that the U.S. military was not holding anyone seriously accountable for the shootdown. Also in response to complaints about the DoD's response to the incident, the U.S. House of Representatives' Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel scheduled a hearing on the incident for 3 August 1995 to examine the accident investigation and the judicial actions that followed. In addition, on 24 July the DoD ordered the USAF to reexamine the disciplinary and administrative actions for the personnel involved in the shootdown and for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review the corrective actions taken against those involved and determine whether further action was necessary. Widnall requested that the new USAF chief of staff, Ronald R. Fogleman begin his own review of <b>accountability</b> <b>for</b> the incident.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Enterprises need {{corporate}} data quality management (DQM) that combines business-driven and technical perspectives {{to respond to}} strategic and operational challenges that demand high-quality {{corporate data}}. Hitherto, companies have assigned <b>accountabilities</b> <b>for</b> DQM mostly to IT departments. They have thereby ignored the organisational issues that are {{critical to the success}} of DQM. With data governance, however, companies implement corporate-wide <b>accountabilities</b> <b>for</b> DQM that encompass professionals from business and IT. This study examines a large organisation that has adopted an ad-hoc data governance model to manage its data. It was found that its DQM efforts were hampered mainly by the lack of clear roles and responsibilities and the lack of mandate to carry out data quality improvement initiatives. In order to promote effective DQM, this research identifies a data governance structure with the emphasis on collaboration between business and IT to support organisations. ...|$|R
