John moved to Cardiff and shared a house with several other rugby players, including former Llanelli team mate Gerald Davies.

He spent six weeks unemployed and during this period he considered turning to professional rugby league, almost signing for St Helens R.F.C.. Following an interview with David Coleman for the BBC programme, Sportsnight, in which his jobless situation was discussed, John was offered a job working for Forward Trust, <b>a</b> <b>finance</b> company in Cardiff.

5|$|McCay {{became the}} sixth Minister for Defence in four years. His predecessor, Senator Anderson Dawson, had chaired a {{committee}} that had produced a detailed report recommending {{the abolition of}} the post of General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces {{and the creation of a}} Council of Defence, a Naval Board and a Military Board. It fell to McCay to implement the report's recommendations and create a five-man Military Board consisting of himself, <b>a</b> <b>finance</b> member and three military officers. McCay preferred the senior member not be styled the Chief of the General Staff. This change would not be made until 1909. At the first meeting of the Council of Defence, McCay rejected the arguments of Captain William Rooke Creswell for the majority of the defence budget to be spent on supporting the British fleet. In 1905 the Reid government collapsed and McCay became a backbencher once more. Since the Federal parliament sat in Parliament House, Melbourne, McCay lived at the Stock Exchange Club in Collins Street, Melbourne while his family remained in Castlemaine. He maintained a liaison with a married woman, Ella Gavan Duffy.|$|E
5|$|The Lords {{would only}} be able to delay money bills for one month, {{effectively}} ending their ability to do so. These were defined as any public bill which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof. It did not however, cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures. Some Finance Bills have not fallen within this criterion; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills have. The Speaker of the House of Commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill, endorsing it with a Speaker's certificate. The Local Government Finance Bill 1988, which introduced the Community Charge ("Poll Tax"), was not certified as a Money Bill and was therefore considered by the Lords. Whilst Finance Bills are not considered Money Bills, convention dictates that those parts of <b>a</b> <b>Finance</b> Bill dealing with taxation or expenditure (which, if in an Act alone, would constitute a Money Bill) are not questioned.|$|E
