50|$|In 1860, {{brothers}} Philander and Francis Marion Roots, {{founders of}} Roots Blower Company of Connersville, Indiana, patented {{the design for}} an <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> for use in blast furnaces and other industrial applications.|$|E
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> systems {{serve the}} same purpose as blower systems at a lower cost. However, this type of system can only be used when {{there is little or}} no back {{pressure}} because they generate lower pressure and airflow. <b>Air</b> <b>mover</b> functionality is based on the Venturi effect. A small amount of high velocity air connected to the side of the casting passes out through a nozzle, creating venturi action. This effect causes a large volume of low velocity air to flow through the venturi and out of the air diffuser. The ratio of air supplied depends on the design of the air mover’s physical structure.|$|E
50|$|An {{essential}} component of <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> systems is continual operational reliability. Failure of the system can lead to contamination of optical instruments. To ensure consistent functionality, a pressure switch {{can be used to}} indicate air failure when flow drops below a pre-set value. Under undesired flow conditions, an alarm will be activated or protective shutters will go into effect.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>movers</b> have no {{moving parts}} {{and are thus}} {{maintenance}} free. Due to the high heat transfer coefficients, high reliability but lower overall flow rates, Synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>movers</b> are usually used at the chip level and not at the system level for cooling. However {{depending on the size}} and complexity of the systems they can be used for both at times.|$|R
5|$|Hardware stores {{experienced}} great {{demand for}} portable generators, chain saws, dehumidifiers, and <b>air</b> <b>movers</b> following {{the passage of}} the hurricane. Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area. By four days after landfall, 83,000 customers were without power, down from its peak of several hundred thousand.|$|R
50|$|Water damage {{restoration}} {{is often}} prefaced by a loss {{assessment and evaluation}} of affected materials. The damaged area is inspected with water sensing equipment such as probes and other infrared tools {{in order to determine}} the source of the damage and possible extent of area affected. Restoration services would then be rendered to the residence in order to dry the structure, sanitize any affected or cross contaminated areas, and deodorize all affected areas and materials. After the labor is completed, water damage equipment including <b>air</b> <b>movers,</b> <b>air</b> scrubbers, dehumidifiers, wood floor drying systems, and sub floor drying equipment is left in the residence. Industry standards state that drying vendors should return at regular time intervals, preferably every twenty-four hours, to monitor the equipment, temperature, humidity, and moisture content of the affected walls and contents.|$|R
50|$|It is not {{necessary}} to use filter in an <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> in a relatively clean environment. Generally, a gauze filter is attached to the inlet to collect larger particles. However, filters are always a beneficial precaution.In environments with high ambient dust levels, it is beneficial to utilize a filter system that has double filtration. First, air passes through a pre-filter that collects larger dust particles. Second, the air travels through a screen filter where smaller particles are captured.|$|E

5000|$|The Jupiter Project was {{supposed}} to continue the mainframe product line into the future by using [...] "gate arrays" [...] with an innovative <b>Air</b> <b>Mover</b> Cooling System, coupled with a built-in floating point processing engine called [...] "FBOX". The design was intended for a top tier scientific computing niche, yet the critical performance measurement was based upon COBOL compilation which did not fully utilize the primary design features of Jupiter technology. When the Jupiter Project was cancelled in 1983, some of the engineers adapted aspects of the 36-bit design into a forthcoming 32-bit design, releasing the high-end VAX8600 in 1985.|$|E
40|$|The {{topic for}} this thesis {{was given by}} Ab Solving Oy, which is {{specialized}} {{in the design and}} manufacturing of complex, heavy load handling systems, ranging from single air bearing elements to complex Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) systems. This thesis focuses on developing the software (SW) used in Solving wheeled vehicles. The current structure of the SW does not allow Solving to produce vehicle types that are asked for on the market. Solving would like to base the vehicle control on Siemens Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), partly for economic reasons and partly for customer demand. The Siemens PLCs are currently used only in Solving <b>air</b> film <b>movers,</b> but should be expanded to be used in other vehicle types as well. The current SW supports the use of precisely two or four wheels, which must be positioned in a specific fixed relation to one another. The immediate challenge Solving is facing is that customers are asking for three-wheeled <b>air</b> film <b>movers</b> that are obviously not supported by the current solution. There are also inquiries for vehicles with more than four wheels, which Solving are also not able to fulfill today. This thesis presents a new program structure that will enable Solving to produce vehicles with an unrestricted amount of wheels positioned anywhere within the construction of the vehicle frame. The outcome of this thesis consists of two types of Function Blocks (FBs). Software engineers at Solving can use the FBs to create any imaginable layout of the wheels on the vehicle. By using the outcome of this thesis, Solving will be able to meet the market demands that they are not able to meet today...|$|R

Figure 1 shows such a system, where water is sprayed onto the fan blades cocurrently with the moving exhaust gas. Some gaseous pollutants and particles are initially removed as they pass over the liquid sprays.The liquid droplets then impact on the blades to create smaller droplets for additional collection targets. Collection can also {{take place on the}} liquid film that forms on the fan blades. The rotating blades force the liquid and collected particles off the blades. The liquid droplets separate from the gas stream because of their centrifugal motion.|$|E

Additionally it has been found that, for any given conveying system, the choice of <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> also has a strong influence on the power requirement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A simple mobile {{engine-driven}} pneumatic paddy collector made {{of locally}} available materials using local manufacturing technology was designed, fabricated, and tested for collecting and bagging of paddy dried on concrete pavement. The pneumatic paddy collector had the following major components: radial flat bladed type centrifugal fan, power transmission system, bagging area, frame and the conveyance system. Results showed significant {{differences on the}} collecting capacity, noise level, and fuel consumption when rotational speed of the <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> shaft was varied. Other parameters such as collecting efficiency, air velocity, augmented cracked grain percentage, and germination rate were not significantly affected by varying rotational speed of the <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> shaft. The pneumatic paddy collector had a collecting efficiency of 99. 33 % with a collecting capacity of 2685. 00 kg/h at maximum rotational speed of centrifugal fan shaft of about 4200 rpm. The machine entailed an investment cost of P 62, 829. 25. The break-even weight of paddy was 510, 606. 75 kg/yr at a collecting cost of 0. 11 P/kg of paddy. Utilizing the machine for 400 hours per year generated an income of P 23, 887. 73. The projected time needed to recover cost of the machine based on 2685 kg/h collecting capacity was 2. 63 year.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) air movers {{are uniquely}} {{positioned}} {{to become a}} key emerging <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> technology to compete with mechanical rotary fans {{in the next generation}} of ultrathin consumer electronics thermal management, due to their form factor flexibility, low height capability, flow rates, and silent operation. However, as is true of many emerging technologies, EHD driven thermal management lacks the development of fundamental scaling and design rules, robust and mature design tools, and proof-of-concept demonstration of small-scale EHD systems for thermal management, which are needed to progress to the commercial sector. This dissertation, broken roughly into four parts, attempts to move EHD thermal management a step forward towards commercial application. The first, presents the development of design theory investigating the fundamental factors of pressure generation in EHD systems, transduction efficiency, and device scaling. The second presents a coupled-physics EHD numerical model and its results that take into account charge generation, charge transport, electrostatics, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer. The third presents simulations and experiential work focused on the development of a proof-of-concept meso/micro-scale EHD <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> for jet impingement forced convection cooling. The forth presents a proof-of-concept EHD thermal management solution embedded in a commercial notebook computer, demonstrating the ability to integrate an EHD thermal system into a modern notebook computer. Finally, key future efforts required to bring EHD thermal management technology to a successful commercial application are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of an air-slide pneumatic conveying system depends, first of all, on several basic elements chosen or calculated during {{the design of}} a plant: air-slide design parameters, <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> characteristics, as well as the physical and chemical properties of the material to be transported. However, during the exploitation of this type of system which is used for handling ash in thermal-power plants, either gradual and/or sudden changes in the operating conditions can arise. This may be due to changes both in the proportion of ash content, and in the flow characteristics of the porous membrane. The consequences of changes in these conditions on the performance of the ash handling system are analyzed, based upon the results of the experimental work carried out on the test rig at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Belgrade, and upon the on-site measurements at the thermal-power plant "Nikola Tesla B"...|$|E
40|$|Waste heat {{recovery}} remains an inviting subject for research. Solid state thermoelectric devices {{have been widely}} investigated for this purpose, but their practical application remains challenging due to high cost and the inability to fabricate them in geometries that are easily compatible with heat sources. An alternative to solid-state thermoelectric devices are thermogalvanic cells. 1 - 7 The temperature difference between the hot and the cold electrodes creates a difference in electrochemical potential of the redox couples at the electrodes. Once connected to a load, electrical current and power is delivered, converting thermal energy into electrical energy. The aim of this summer project is to extend ongoing research to study the feasibility of incorporating thermogalvanic systems into automobiles. A climate-controlled wind tunnel (Fig. 1) was built to provide equivalent conditions to the ambient air stream under the car. Temperature was controlled using a window air conditioner, while an <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> drove the flow up to 6 m s− 1. A heat gun provided {{the equivalent of a}} low-temperature exhaust gas stream (~ 110 oC). The annular cell was bound by concentric copper pipes (electrodes) and CPVC bulkheads; all sealed with silicone. K-type thermocouples were attached with epoxy onto electrode surfaces to measure the electrode temperature, which were monitored and recorded by a Campbell Scientific CR 23 X Micrologger.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1997. A {{computer}} programme for the simulation of dilute phase pneumatic conveying of solids is presented. This includes positive pressure and vacuum pneumatic conveying. The characteristic conveying parameters {{such as the}} conveying absolute pressure, conveying air density, interstitial and average air velocity, particle velocity and voidage are calculated by integrating five differential equations that govern two-phase flow. The two-phase flow is approximated as one-dimensional along the pipe axis. Density and acceleration effects are accounted for. The integration is carried out {{by means of the}} Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method yielding conveying parameter traces along the length ofthe pipeline. A new method is presented for the determination of the solids friction coefficient from the solids motion equation. This allows for a more accurate determination of the solids velocity in the pipeline when compared to currently used methods. The computer model results are compared to experimental results for cement and ice conveying yielding good correlation for the main output parameters. The theory for the scaling and calculation of Roots blower performance characteristics is presented. This is implemented in a Roots blower selection programme {{as an integral part of}} determining the prime <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> for the design of a pneumatic conveyor. The aim of providing a fast, user-friendly interface in terms of pipeline geometry input, simulation and data visualisation has been achieved by using the advantages of object orientated programming and the visual user interface of the DELPHI programming language...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Fugitive {{emissions}} {{arising from}} the handling of particulate materials have occurred since these materials were first handled. As the volume of materials handled has increased so has the volume of fugitive materials; the fraction of the fugitive material focused on in this thesis, we generally call dust. In modern operations, dust represents a lost income stream, as the dust is often saleable product; increased cost of operations due to cleaning costs; a public nuisance for those working and living adjacent to material-handling operations; an explosion risk with some dust types; an environmental pollutant, and significantly a multitude of health risks due to slips, trips and inhalation of dust (Hamelmann & Schmidt). Government regulation through various environmental pollution agencies is continually reducing the so-termed acceptable limits for dust emissions associated with different operations and in different environments. As these limits reduce, a greater level of operational care and often cost is required by the operators to comply. Active dust control is often seen as an easy method to reduce emissions. In the simplest form, an <b>air</b> <b>mover</b> is used to pull dust laden air away from the process in question, before air separation and returning the fine product back to the process line. Active measures clearly carry an energy penalty to operate the air movers, but also have high costs associated with duct and pipe wear, air-mover filtration system maintenance and reliability issues. Further, there are many areas where active dust control is impractical. Passive dust control in contrast, through {{an understanding of the}} mechanics of dust generation, aims to reduce the total emissions through a range of mechanisms, without external energy input. This can be achieved for example by embedding the smaller particles fractions deeper within a flowing stream (Wheeler, Krull, Roberts, & Wiche, 2007), or careful positioning of baffles and stilling zones in equipment. Unfortunately with passive control systems, there is a much greater need to ‘understand the system’ before an appropriate passive solution can be implemented. This is unlike a high-cost active system where a simple up-scaling of equipment can often overcome a poor understanding of the system. This thesis presents a volume of work expanding the overall understanding of the underlying mechanics required for passive dust control, particularly related to transient events such as dump hoppers. Air entrained into a falling stream of bulk material under the influence of gravity is known as the main source of dust generation (R. Ansart, A. d. Ryck, & J. A. Dodds, 2009 b). For calculating the amount of entrained air, several researches and formulas have been published. However, the accuracy of different formulas varies under different conditions. To understand the impact of different parameters on the behaviour of a material stream, this research was undertaken in a particular sequence, to enable detailed analysis in a controlled manner. In general, free falling largely contributes to the discrete bulkmaterial-handling case activities. Therefore, research was initiated on free-falling streams to better identify the impact of key influencing variables. This research provided an insight into the free-falling and influencing parameters such as particle diameter, particle solid density, stream diameter and drop height. Resulting from these investigations, a new approach to calculate the magnitude of air entrained into the free-falling stream of particles (AVCF - Air-Entrainment using Volume Conservation Theory in Free-Falling) has been developed (Esmaili, Donohue, Wheeler, McBride, & Roberts, 2013). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was successfully applied to different free-falling conditions. These simulations were then verified with Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV), high-speed videos and particle-tracking techniques. A close correlation between the provided theory (AVCF), CFD and experimental data was observed. The knowledge obtained from the analysis of free falling was extended to transient bulkmaterial-handling cases. Dump hoppers are known to be one the major dust generation sources within the mining industry (Cecala, 2010), and was selected to extend the work completed on free falling air entrainment research. Scale model tests were conducted to provide air velocity readings, airflow patterns and high-quality footage for simulation verification purposes. The two-phase CFD simulation method is considered as a compromise solution, optimising accuracy, time consumption and ease-of-use considerations. The potential to further improve performance in the scale model tests were investigated using these CFD method. The influences of the drop height, particle size, particle density and the design of the dump hopper geometry, in relation to the air-flow pattern within the enclosure, and subsequently reducing dust emissions are discussed. Moreover, the effects of ‘air cells’, ‘curtains’, ‘baffles’ and introduced new technique (additional section) are investigated. The results reveal that the flow pattern of the air within the dump hopper geometry can be improved and the flow slowed down if air cells, baffles, curtains or any other technique is utilised appropriately. In addition to the above, the introduced theory work for the air-entrainment-magnitude calculation concept has been expanded to dump hoppers by utilising particle trajectory analysis. It has been concluded that this formula provides a close correlation to simulation...|$|E
