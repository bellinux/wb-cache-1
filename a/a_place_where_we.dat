500|$|Lee Greenwood {{has stated}} that he wrote the song [...] "God Bless the USA" [...] in {{response}} to his feelings about the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. [...] "The song just about wrote itself," [...] Greenwood said in the book God Bless the USA (by Greenwood and Gwen McLin). [...] "The words seemed to flow naturally from the music, and came out with total honesty. They were an expression of my feelings of pride. To me, America seemed just like a rookery, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> have a chance to grow, unmolested and free." ...|$|E
500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted to find <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly {{and that he would}} stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whether Web 2.0 is substantively {{different}} from prior Web technologies {{has been challenged}} by World Wide Web inventor [...] Tim Berners-Lee, who describes the term as jargon. His original vision of the Web was [...] "a collaborative medium, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> [...] all meet and read and write." [...] On the other hand, the term Semantic Web (sometimes referred to as Web 3.0) was coined by Berners-Lee {{to refer to a}} web of content where the meaning can be processed by machines.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{money from}} their Interscope contract, {{the band members}} {{designed}} and built their own recording studio, The Blasting Room, {{with the help of}} Egerton's father, Dan O'Reilly. [...] " [...] was the single smartest thing we probably ever did, really", said Egerton. [...] "Bill and I had thrown around {{the idea of having a}} studio forever, because by then any time we were home, we were recording Big Drill Car or Chemical People. We were always recording somebody, so we really wanted <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> could refine our skills that way. We read some books and tried to learn what we could about how to lay the place out, and we actually built the place ourselves." ...|$|E

But we did rescue them from a destruction that was becoming ever more complete. There was not yet an Osman Hamdi Bey around, who soon became a close friend of Humann, and at the time we could not imagine what has become possible in the meantime with his help, that the ruins still at the site could be protected from the stone robbers of the modern city ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was nearly}} six o'clock, {{and the day}} was just dawning. <b>As</b> the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had passed the night was too much exposed, we moved up into the {{thickness}} of the woods.

2500|$|In March 2010 the duo's second album, Down the Way, debuted at No.1. By 2011 it was {{certified}} 3×platinum by ARIA. It was the highest-selling album by an Australian {{artist in}} 2010. Down the Way peaked in the top30 on the French Albums Chart {{and stayed in}} the top200 for 86weeks. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 the duo won 'Album of the Year' for Down the Way and 'Single of the Year' for [...] "Big Jet Plane". Their single [...] "Big Jet Plane" [...] was voted No.1 in the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2011. After a world tour promoting Down the Way, Stone and his sister parted ways, according to Stone with a [...] "tip of the hat and strolled in different directions". In a Rolling Stone (Australia) interview, Julia revealed the duo had started recording tracks for a third album, in January 2011, but shelved them indefinitely: [...] "It {{was too much to}} think we could only pick six songs each… We were both in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> really wanted creative space to go in whatever direction we wanted so we were like 'let’s just take a year out'". She elaborated that those songs were unlikely to be heard, but maintained the pair would reunite after their solo projects.|$|E
2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> can sit down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E
