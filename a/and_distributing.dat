5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at speaking to large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags <b>and</b> <b>distributing</b> leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Parallel <b>and</b> <b>distributed</b> {{simulation}} {{is concerned}} with the efficient execution of large-scale discrete event simulation models on multiprocessors <b>and</b> <b>distributed</b> platforms. After the development of World Wide Web (WWW), many efforts in parallel <b>and</b> <b>distributed</b> simulation have been made for modeling, particularly building simulation languages and creating model libraries that can be assembled and executed over WWW, and for analysis, particularly developing simulation optimization algorithms for parallel <b>and</b> <b>distributed</b> experimentation. These efforts have thus far produced mixed results. However, the recent advent of XML and web services technology provides enhanced opportunities for web-based distributed simulation. Especially, web services as a distributed information technology possess powerful capabilities for scalable interoperation of heterogeneous systems. This paper aims to develop and evaluate parallel <b>and</b> <b>distributed</b> simulation using the web services technology for efficient simulation execution. In particular, a prototype framework is implemented using web services for a simple shop floor simulation, where we focus on web-based simulation optimization through the distribution of simulation replications across different servers. The development of parallel <b>and</b> <b>distributed</b> simulation using web services will help to solve large-scale problems efficiently and guarantee interoperability among heterogeneous networked systems.

5|$|After the British army {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans in 1917-1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed {{its role as}} an important town in the District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested {{due to lack of}} people strong enough to work in the fields. The new British regime began a program of sealing open wells, improving drainage <b>and</b> <b>distributing</b> quinine across Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim, increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, still all Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.|$|E
