40|$|The Extreme-Ultraviolet Normal-Incidence Spectrometer (EUNIS) is a soundingrocket payload that obtains imaged {{high-resolution}} {{spectra of}} individual solar features, providing {{information about the}} Sun's corona and upper transition region. Shortly after its successful initial flight last year, a complete end-to-end calibration was carried out to determine the instrument's absolute radiometric response over its Longwave bandpass of 300 - 370 A. The measurements were done at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in England, using the same vacuum facility and EUV radiation source used in the pre-flight calibrations of both SOHO/CDS and Hinode/EIS, {{as well as in}} three post-flight calibrations of our SERTS sounding rocket payload, the precursor to EUNIS. The unique radiation source provided by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) had been calibrated to an absolute accuracy of 7 % (l-sigma) at 12 wavelengths covering our bandpass directly against the Berlin electron storage ring BESSY, which is itself a primary radiometric source standard. Scans of the EUNIS aperture were made to determine the instrument's <b>absolute</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to +- 25 %, considering all sources of error, and demonstrate that EUNIS- 06 was the most sensitive solar E W spectrometer yet flown. The results will be matched against prior calibrations which relied on combining measurements of individual optical components, and on comparisons with theoretically predicted 'insensitive' line ratios. Coordinated observations were made during the EUNIS- 06 flight by SOHO/CDS and EIT that will allow re-calibrations of those instruments as well.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the UV-absorbing {{sensitizing}} pigment fly photoreceptors on <b>absolute,</b> <b>spectral</b> and angular <b>sensitivity</b> was investigated with a wave-optics model for the facet lens-rhabdomere system. When sky light {{was used as a}} UV-rich light source, one sensitizing pigment molecule per rhodopsin increased the photoreceptor absorption by 14 - 18 % with respect to pure rhodopsin, whilst two sensitizing pigment molecules per rhodopsin increased the absorption by 20 - 27 %. Upon light adaptation, when the pupil mechanism is activated, photoreceptor absorption decreases; in the housefly, Musca, by up to 6 -fold. The fully light-adapted pupil diminishes the photoreceptor's acceptance angle by a factor of similar to 0. 6 due to selective absorption of higher order waveguide modes. Spatial acuity of dark-adapted photoreceptors is more or less constant throughout the visual wavelength range, including the UV, because the waveguide optics of the rhabdomere compromise acuity least at wavelengths most limited by diffraction of the facet lens. Diffraction is not the general limiting factor causative for UV sensitivity of insect eyes. Visual acuity is governed by diffraction only with a fully light-adapted pupil, which absorbs higher waveguide modes. Closure of the blue-absorbing pupil causes a UV-peaking <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of fly photoreceptors. The sensitizing pigment does not play an appreciable role in modifying spatial acuity, neither in the dark- nor the light-adapted state, due to the dominant contribution of green light in natural light sources...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe human {{visual system}} encodes the {{chromatic}} signals conveyed {{by the three}} types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This opponency is thought to reduce redundant information by decorrelating the photoreceptor signals. Correlations in the receptor signals are caused by the substantial overlap of the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the receptors, {{but it is not clear}} to what extent the properties of natural spectra contribute to the correlations. To investigate the influences of natural spectra and photoreceptor <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> we attempted to find linear codes with minimal redundancy for trichromatic images assuming human cone <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> or hypothetical non-overlapping cone sensitivities, respectively. The resulting properties of basis functions are similar in both cases.

Thus, color opponency arises for the encoding of human cone signals, i. e. with strongly overlapping <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> but also under the assumption of non-overlapping <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Our results suggest that color opponency may in part be a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the cone <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Color vision plays a {{critical}} role in visual behavior. An animal's capacity for color vision rests on the presence of differentially sensitive cone photoreceptors. <b>Spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{is a measure of the}} visual responsiveness of these cones at different light wavelengths. Four classes of cone pigments have been identified in vertebrates, but in teleost fishes, opsin genes have undergone gene duplication events and thus can produce a larger number of spectrally distinct cone pigments. In this study, we examine the question of large-scale variation in color vision with respect to individual, sex and species that may result from differential expression of cone pigments. Cichlid fishes are an excellent model system for examining variation in <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> because they have seven distinct cone opsin genes that are differentially expressed. Results To examine the variation in the number of cones that participate in cichlid <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> we used whole organism electrophysiology, opsin gene expression and empirical modeling. Examination of over 100 <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curves from 34 individuals of three species revealed that (1) <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of individual cichlids was based on different subsets of four or five cone pigments, (2) <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was shaped by multiple cone interactions and (3) <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> differed between species and correlated with foraging mode and the spectral reflectance of conspecifics. Our data also suggest that there may be significant differences in opsin gene expression between the sexes. Conclusions Our study describes complex opponent and nonopponent cone interactions that represent the requisite neural processing for color vision. We present the first comprehensive evidence for pentachromatic color vision in vertebrates, which offers the potential for extraordinary spectral discrimination capabilities. We show that opsin gene expression in cichlids, and possibly also <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> may be sex-dependent. We argue that females and males sample their visual environment differently, providing a neural basis for sexually dimorphic visual behaviour. The diversification of <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> likely contributes to sensory adaptations that enhance the contrast of transparent prey and the detection of optical signals from conspecifics, suggesting a role for both natural and sexual selection in tuning color vision. </p...|$|R

Relative sensitivity was determined from the nonlinear reaction time curve by converting reaction times to a linear measure that was independent of <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Two models for mesopic <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were compared. The first was a linear combination of V(λ) and V′(λ), and the second included input from the L-M colour-opponent mechanism and the S-cones. The second model produced a significantly better fit to the data. The chromatic mechanisms appear to contribute to reaction time {{when there is an}} appreciable chromatic signal but luminance contrast is low...|$|R
40|$|The <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of 12 {{species of}} mesopelagic {{crustaceans}} were studied {{by means of}} electrophysiological recordings. Nine of the species are vertical migrators, while 3 are not, and 9 species possess bioluminescent organs, while 3 are not bioluminescent. All species had a single peak of <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with maxima between 470 [*]nm and 500 [*]nm. There was no apparent correlation between sensitivity maxima and daytime depth distribution, migratory behavior, or {{the presence or absence}} of bioluminescent organs. With the exception of the hyperiid amphipod Phronima sedentaria, the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of these mesopelagic crustaceans demonstrate a better match for maximum sensitivity to bioluminescence than to downwelling light...|$|R
