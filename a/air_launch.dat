25|$|By {{the end of}} 1944 the {{development}} of the D-3 pulse engine that propelled the 10Kh was at the prototype stage and the first production 10Kh was ready on 5 February 1945. As no launching ramps had been constructed, the first test was an <b>air</b> <b>launch</b> from a Petlyakov Pe-8 heavy bomber on 20 March 1945, near Tashkent. By 25 July, 66 missiles had been launched, of which 44 transitioned to autonomous flight, 22 of these reaching the range target and 20 maintaining the required heading. A batch of improved 10Kh (Izdeliye 30) were constructed with wooden wings, and 73 more air launches were performed in December 1948. A ground-launched variant called the 10KhN was also tested in 1948, which used rocket-assisted take-off from a ramp.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{numerous}} options investigated during the study, none were fully implemented. Although the STRAT-X [...] "Land Mobile" [...] option {{resulted in the}} MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper missiles, {{the fall of communism}} throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in the Midgetman being canceled while still a prototype, while only 50 out of the original 100 Peacekeeper missiles were ever fielded. Nevertheless, the study did inspire a number of developments in nuclear weapons delivery systems. In October 1974, the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted an <b>air</b> <b>launch</b> of a Minuteman missile from a C-5 Galaxy, demonstrating the credibility of the [...] "Air Launched ICBM" [...] option of STRAT-X.|$|E

500|$|In early September 1944, a {{detachment}} of the Special Weapons Branch, Wright Field, Ohio, arrived at Wendover with thirteen Republic-Ford JB-2 flying bombs. [...] The JB-2 was a United States {{copy of the}} Nazi V-1 flying bomb, which was reverse-engineered from malfunctioning wrecks of V-1s recovered in England. [...] The United States JB-2 {{was different from the}} German V-1 in only the smallest of dimensions. At Wendover, a launch ramp was constructed for the JB-2, engineered from plans developed from aerial photographs of ramps used by the Germans in the Low Countries. [...] In addition to the ground launch ramp, a B-17 Flying Fortress was modified to be able to carry the jet bomb underneath a wing and <b>air</b> <b>launch</b> it. [...] Numerous tests were conducted and an initial production order was 1,000 units was made by the Army, with subsequent planned production of 1,000 per month. The fortunes of war in Europe in the spring of 1945 led to the decision to use the JB-2 in the Pacific Theater, to be used as part of Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan. The sudden end of the war in September 1945 led to the curtailment of the JB-2 program and the weapon was never used in combat.|$|E

2500|$|Walt Disney Entertainment {{invented a}} new way of {{launching}} fireworks for the show, using a pneumatic launch system, instead of black powder, which pollutes more and causes the trail of an igniting firework shell to be seen. The compressed air technology allows for explosions to be timed with the music and for the height of the shell's explosion to be controlled. Not all the shells use the ALF (<b>Air</b> <b>Launch</b> Fireworks) technology. A timing chip is inserted into the shell and can be programmed to ignite and explode with precision. Eric Tucker, an award-winning pyrotechnics designer, was brought on board to design new fireworks effects. Designers of the show meet with fireworks manufacturers in China to create these new effects for the show. 750 individual mortar tubes are used during each show, inside one of the 56 firing modules at 34 locations around the lagoon, producing 2,120 visible effects. [...] During the holiday season, two more barges are added and an additional 455 pieces are fired, producing 818 more visible effects.|$|E
