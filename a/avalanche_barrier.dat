50|$|Originally, the Bernina Railway was {{intended}} for use only in summer, but in 1913/14 the BB commenced winter operations as well. This development was associated with major weather-related problems, necessitating further erection of <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers.</b>|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} emergence {{of renewable energy}} sites in Switzerland, new impacts on the landscape can be observed. Above the Alpine village of Bellwald, a pilot project testing <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers</b> as a possible site for photovoltaic installations was inaugurated in 2012. This study focused on social aspects {{of the project and}} asked questions about local residents' and tourists' perceptions of and attitudes toward the installations. Its findings reveal that the new elements are not perceived as a drastic intrusion into the landscape, because the view was already affected by the <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers,</b> which are accepted because of their vital protective function. No significant difference was found between residents' and tourists' evaluation of the new photovoltaic installations. However, different factors influenced the perceptions of these 2 groups. In both groups, conceptions related to place {{played an important role in}} the evaluation of possible photovoltaic sites...|$|R
50|$|As of the 1970s, {{the crowd}} of winter athletes on the Turracher Höhe {{increased}} and as a result, the gradient of the federal road was evened out little by little by adjustments of the route. From 1978 until 1980, a new section of the road, which had been affected time and again by avalanches, was opened on the Kornock above the old road, with <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers.</b>|$|R
40|$|From a {{conservation}} point of view, avalanches are a natural ecological process. However, {{they can also}} endanger people and cause serious damage to buildings and infrastructure. From an anthropocentric point of view, protective measures {{in the form of}} <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers</b> are necessary. <b>Avalanche</b> <b>barriers</b> in the starting zone of avalanches can prevent avalanche events. Hence there is a conflict between nature conservation and protection against natural hazards. This study aimed primarily at assessing the conservation value of active avalanche tracks. To this end we examined 16 plant stands on three different avalanche tracks in the Gesäuse National Park (Styria, Austria) and recorded butterfly species at the same time. On the investigated avalanche tracks, the soils are very shallow, stony, periodically dry, nutrient-poor, base-rich rendzinas developed over limestone debris. The sites are scree-covered, steep and mainly east-facing slopes located in the montane belt. The plant stands investigated belong mainly to the Origano-Calamagrostietum variae community. This study of biodiversity concludes that under these conditions the vegetation in active avalanche tracks is characterized by a high richness of vascular plant species. On average, a plot size of 20 m² contains 71 vascular plant species and 5 bryophyte species. The species-rich plant stands, colourful when in bloom, are dominated by herbs, resulting in a high aesthetic value and an increased diversity of butterflies. The avalanche tracks investigated have a high conservation value because natural ecological processes continue to happen, leading to near-natural and species-rich disclimax communities...|$|R
50|$|Avalanche barriers: The {{main part}} of the <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers</b> is based on a high tensile {{strength}} steel wire mesh, extending across the slope and reaching {{to the surface of the}} snow. The supporting effect created by the retaining surface prevents possible creeping within the snow cover and sliding of the snow cover on the terrain surface. Breaking-away of avalanches is thus prevented at the starting zone, while occurring snow movements are restricted to the extent that they remain harmless. The forces resulting from the snow pressure are absorbed by the snow nets and carried off over the swivel posts and anchor ropes into the anchor points.|$|R
50|$|The hospice in All'Acqua was the {{starting}} point to two famous mountain crossings: the Nufenen Pass, which leads to Ulrichen in the Upper Valais, and the Passo di San Giacomo, {{which leads to the}} Italian Formazza valley. The Hospice of Valdolgia or St. Nicholas on the Passo di San Giacomo was a second station in the old mule track. Due to the steep slopes of Bedretto Valley, avalanches often hit the villages. The avalanche in 1863, destroyed half the village and killed 29 people, and the one in 1749 killed 13. In winter, the valley is often cut off and the connection of villages to each other and with Airolo may be interrupted for days. With the construction of <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers,</b> the situation has improved. The road between Airolo and Bedrett opened in 1924, was extended in 1932 to Ronco then in 1964 extended beyond Nufenen. The valley is also today still fairly isolated and without a constant connection with Valais, since a rail project to connect the valley to the Furka Oberalp Bahn as part of the Furka Base Tunnel project failed. Historically, the scarce resources of the valley (cattle, dairy farming and cultivation of potatoes and rye) were insufficient to feed all of the inhabitants. So they were forced to seasonal migrate abroad (mainly in Italy and France) seeking work as chestnut roasters, waitresses or domestic servants. Since the seasonal migration ceased at the end of World War II, the valley has depopulated more rapidly. The decline of the permanent resident population is offset in the summer months by the return of locals and offset in the winter by the influx of tourists and holiday guests.|$|R
30|$|Reindeer herding {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{livelihoods}} in northern Fennoscandia (Kortesalmi 2007 : 22 – 23). Starting in the 1600 s, Northern, or Fell, Sámi families roamed hundreds of kilometres with their herds from summer pastures on the coast to winter pastures inland and back again. In Finland, reindeer herding has experienced a number of changes, including the adoption of an organized system of fenced co-operatives, a shift from a subsistence to a financial economy, a transition to permanent housing, modernization in technology and changing herding systems (Kortesalmi 2007; Helle and Jaakkola 2008; Vuojala-Magga et al. 2011; Turunen and Vuojala-Magga 2014). The interplay between ecological, historical, economic and political factors affecting reindeer herding in the northernmost part of Fennoscandia has been discussed in the literature (Lehtola 2004, 2012; Lempa et al. 2005; Heikkinen 2006; Caballero et al. 2007; Näkkäläjärvi 2007, 2013; Tyler et al. 2007; Helander-Renvall 2008, 2014; Riseth and Vatn 2009). Mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (Orlova) Hämet-Ahti), a hybrid of dwarf (B. nana) and downy birch (B. pubescens), is an important plant for the reindeer herding communities in northern Fennoscandia (Wielgolaski 2005; Holtmeier 2007). In early summer, when female reindeer are lactating, young birch leaves serve as a principal source of nutrition for reindeer (Warenberg et al. 1997). In mountain birch forests, practically all large-sized mushrooms are mycorrhizal fungi of birch (Ruotsalainen et al. 2009). Mushrooms are the animals’ preferred forage in autumn. Mountain birch forests are also important in winter as they support epiphytic lichens, which offer forage, particularly when digging conditions for ground lichens are difficult. Birches also provide shelter for people: logs and branches are used for building laavus (lean-tos) and the wood is used for heating and cooking. In winter birch forests also serve as <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Since the {{introduction}} of flexible snow nets in the 1950 ’s {{it became obvious that}} such barriers provide a better performance on combined loadings of static snow pressure and dynamic rockfall impacts compared to stiff steel bridges. In various cases <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers</b> in the starting zone have to be built under rock faces with frequent rockfall. On a qualitative basis it was found that rigid systems e. g. snow bridges made of steel are not able to withstand rock fall energies of more than 50 kJ. This {{is the result of a}} research project and case studies in Switzerland, Austria and Germany together with the alpS – Zentrum für Naturgefahrenmanagement and WSL- Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF (Margreth 2006 a and b). The investigations have shown that flexible snow nets have a higher energy absorption capacity which may be even more than 200 kJ. To obtain a bet-ter understanding of the interaction and performance of rock fall on snow nets and to quantify the ca-pacity of snow nets a trial of 4 different 1 : 1 large scale rockfall tests with flexible snow nets have been done. With this testing it is possible to quantify the rockfall capacity of a new type of snow net. Integral part of this snow net is a rhomboidal spiral rope net with a load capacity of 220 kN/m’. The rockfall bearing capacity could be even increased by applying stronger spiral rope nets. As a result it was pos-sible to achieve a rock fall capacity of up to 500 kJ which is ten times more compared to rigid struc-tures. This rockfall adapted snow net system has been already installed in Austria. In this paper the project is presented and detailed information about the performed test series is provided. The results of our technical development are improved flexible avalanche supporting structures which can with-stand rockfall energies up to 500 kJ leading to reduced costs for maintenance and repair respectively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, {{the local}} {{government}} of South Tyrol, a province in the alpine area {{in the north of}} Italy, has defined the guidelines for an energy and climate package with targets for 2050 where it is stated that-The yearly CO 2 emission per capita will be reduced to less than 1. 5 tons (less than 4 tons per capita by 2020 as intermediate target) - 90 % of the energy need will be covered by renewables (at least 75 % by 2020 as intermediate target). Specifically, energy production from photovoltaics will contribute towards those targets with a total installed power of 300 MW by 2020 (around 0. 6 kW per capita considering population as of 2012) and 600 MW by 2050 (around 1. 2 kW per capita considering population as of 2012). These figures start from a baseline of PV installed power in the province at the end of 2012 of 220 MW (around 0. 45 kW per capita, around 0. 28 kW per capita in Italy for comparison). Although both targets seem easily within reach, it is nonetheless important to lay the right foundation through favourable legislation and long term planning. It is within these context that a detailed analysis of the real PV potential (as comprehensive and effectively exploitable) of the area is proposed so to understand how ambitious those targets really are and to provide data and information for future energy and strategy planning. In this work, in an innovative approach, the impact of novel solutions on non-conventional surfaces were also included such as PV installations on transport infrastructure, <b>avalanche</b> <b>barriers,</b> artificial lakes, etc. High altitude installations were also taken into account due to the high irradiance values in the alpine area which are comparable to those in South of Italy (up to 2200 kWh/m 2 per year). Limitations due to costs, phasing out of generous incentives programs, restrictive laws (for instance, architectural and environmental constraints) were considered, too. The different technical aspects will be presented from the use of existing solar cadastres and databases to statistical analysis based on the morphology of different urban contexts. The roof (and façade) potential will then be added to the potential from the above mentioned non-conventional surfaces with the final aim of providing a figure for PV potential that takes into account planning permissions, restrictions, structural limitations, current legislation, visual impact and costs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The “Great Wall of Mica ” was {{constructed}} in 2011 {{at the base of}} BC Hydro’s Mica Dam, 130 km north of Revelstoke, Canada. This barrier was designed to stop avalanches, which will protect workers, vehicles, equipment and structures. This 89 m long <b>avalanche</b> defense <b>barrier</b> stands 3. 75 m tall by 3 m wide, and {{was constructed}} using 1, 218 interlocking and freestanding concrete lock-blocks. It was designed to be overtopped, but withstand impacts from a minimum 30 -year design avalanche. A Structured Project Decision Matrix was used to evaluate 12 risk treatment alternatives, 6 of which were unique structural barrier types. This Decision Matrix considered 10 discrete requirements, including: health and safety (risk to workers during and post-construction), costs (construction, maintenance, de-commissioning), environmental impacts, footprint and impact to the work area, and the project schedule. Aesthetics and value were intangible criteria also considered in the evaluation. Through this structured evaluation process, the best solution was determined to be a barrier made of in-terlocking and freestanding concrete lock-blocks. Although more complicated solutions were considered, the lock-block barrier provided the best combination of aesthetics and value, and most importantly one that could be constructed within the tight project schedule. The evaluation, design and construction of this barrier was completed in summer and fall of 2011...|$|R
50|$|Artificial {{barriers}} can be {{very effective}} in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types. One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires {{in addition to their}} foundations. These barriers are similar to those used for rockslides. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence like structure (snow fence) and may be constructed of steel, wood or pre-stressed concrete. They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid barriers are often considered unsightly, especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. Finally, there are barriers that stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made of concrete, rocks or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road or railway that they are trying to protect, although they {{can also be used to}} channel <b>avalanches</b> into other <b>barriers.</b> Occasionally, earth mounds are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a set of}} experiments to investigate the properties of fully relaxed reactions in the mass 80 region. Symmetric and asymmetric entrance channels, leading to similar compound nuclei, have been compared {{in order to determine}} the characteristics of the reaction mechanism. The symmetric system 40 Ca + 40 Ca has been studied at laboratory energies of 197. 3 and 230. 5 MeV. The fissionlike products were detected by a series of six time of flight telescopes, placed at angles between 10 ° and 52. 4 ° to the beam, and a Bragg curve spectrometer-multiwire proportional chamber telescope, situated at 30 °. Data were collected in both singles and coincidence modes. To complement this measurement, fully damped yields from 28 Si + 50, 52, 54 Cr at 130 MeV and from 28 Si + 50 Cr at 150 MeV were measured using an array of four <b>avalanche</b> counter-silicon surface <b>barrier</b> detector telescopes spanning the angular range between 20 ° and 50 °. The avalanche counters used in this experiment are of a new design which was developed in Oxford. We present the features of this design and discuss the detectors' operational characteristics. Several possible interpretations of the data are considered. It is shown that diffusion models of deep-inelastic scattering tend to underpredict the measured fully relaxed cross sections. Rotating finite range model calculations of fission barriers point to the possibility of fast-fission in this mass region; a process hitherto associated with much heavier systems. Furthermore, such models also predict that these systems may fission asymmetrically. The more commonly employed rotating liquid drop model of the nucleus is unable to predict either of these effects. The data are compared with those reported in the literature for other systems in this mass region. It is argued that all these results are consistent with fast-fission and asymmetric fission, thus obviating the need for the previously proposed interpretation in terms of intermediate mechanisms. </p...|$|R
