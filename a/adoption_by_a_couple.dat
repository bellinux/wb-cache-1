50|$|LGBT {{adoption}} is the <b>adoption</b> of children <b>by</b> lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. This {{may be in}} the form of <b>a</b> joint <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> same-sex <b>couple,</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> one partner of <b>a</b> same-sex <b>couple</b> of the other's biological child (step-child <b>adoption)</b> and <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single LGBT person. Joint <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> same-sex couples is legal in 26 countries and in some sub-national territories. Furthermore, 5 countries have legalized some form of step-child adoption. Opponents of LGBT adoption question whether same-sex couples have the ability to be adequate parents (see LGBT parenting) while other opponents question whether natural law implies that children of adoption possess a natural right to be raised by heterosexual parents. Since constitutions and statutes usually fail to address the adoption rights of LGBT persons, judicial decisions often determine whether they can serve as parents either individually or as couples.|$|R

50|$|In January 2007, Parrott {{made his}} ruling denying Hadaway's {{adoption}} of Emma. Parrott accused Hadaway of being deceitful in her petition <b>by</b> applying as <b>a</b> single parent {{despite the fact}} that she was living with a domestic partner and had been for seven years. He also said that treating the <b>couple</b> as <b>a</b> family unit for the purposes of adoption would be a de facto violation of the state's constitutional ban on same sex marriages, reasoning that such treatment would mean that the couple would receive one of the benefits afforded to married couples. Parrott argued that <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> legally married <b>couple</b> would provide <b>a</b> more secure environment for Emma than would Hadaway and her partner, because of the inability of a court to order child support payments if Hadaway and her partner split. Finally, Parrott expressed concern about the possibility of the child suffering a psychologically harmful stigma in being raised in the rural community with two openly homosexual women as her parents.|$|R
40|$|A healthy 13 -year-old boy who {{had spent}} the first 4. 5 {{years of his life}} in an orphanage in Thailand before <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> American <b>couple</b> became ill with {{subacute}} sclerosing panencephalitis and died several months later. The boy had most likely contracted wild-type measles in Thailand. Measles complications are a risk in international adoptions. Undiagnosed infections in internationally adopted children have been receiving increasing attention throughout the past decade. HIV, hepatitis viruses, Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and intestinal parasites frequently complicate such adoptions (1, 2). Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a postinfectious neurologic complication of measles, can also occur. We describe a fatal case of SSPE in an internationally adopted child 9 years after he arrived in the United States. Case Report A 13 -year-old boy of Thai descent was referred to the pediatric neurology clinic at the University of Iowa Hospital with cognitive difficulties and a progressive movement disorder. The boy was born in 1984 and spent the first 4. 5 years of his life in an orphanage in Thailand before being adopted <b>by</b> <b>an</b> American <b>couple</b> from Dubuque, Iowa. His adoptive parents were told <b>by</b> the <b>adoption</b> agency that the boy’s medical history was unremarkable. No history of measles was reported.

40|$|This memo {{estimates}} {{the impact on}} children and {{the cost to the}} State of Kentucky of Senate Bill 68, "The Child Welfare Adoption Act," which would prohibit unmarried cohabiting couples [...] including both different-sex couples and same-sex couples [...] from fostering or adopting children. We use past data to estimate the number of children in foster care who were placed with unmarried <b>couples</b> as <b>a</b> way to estimate the number of impacted children in the first year the proposed legislation would take effect. Prohibiting unmarried couples from fostering or adopting would reduce the number of foster and adoptive families available to care for the 7, 027 children currently in foster care. We estimate that 630 foster children will be removed from their current homes and placements during the first year that the ban is in effect. In addition, 85 children in foster care will either not be adopted or remain in foster care longer because the ban will prohibit their <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> unmarried <b>couples.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the ban will cost the State of Kentucky over $ 5. 3 million in the first year. As explained below, this estimate is conservative since some likely additional costs are difficult to quantify...|$|R
40|$|In Adoption of M. A., the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, {{held that}} <b>an</b> unmarried, {{same-sex}} <b>couple</b> could file <b>a</b> joint petition for adoption of two foster {{children in their}} care. This recent decision is {{only a fraction of}} a story that originated a long time ago when same-sex couples began raising children. This Comment begins by examining {{the role of the state}} courts and the United States Supreme Court in their exposition of family law relating to <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> same-sex couples. The United States Supreme Court has periodically weighed in on family law and parenting in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment, providing powerful guidance for state courts. In analyzing decisions of several states, the issue of <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> same-sex couples is explored in the contemporary contexts of de facto parentage, guardianship, visitation, child support, and marriage. Although certain circumstances raise little doubt as to which individuals constitute the parents of a child, other situations may not be as clear. Empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that children raised by same-sex couples are no different than children parented by heterosexual couples. Accordingly, such social science findings of equality should translate to a presumption of equality in the eyes of the law, thus blinding the process to the sexual orientation of the parents and advancing an argument for parentage based on equality. A legal presumption of this nature would not only find support in the empirical evidence, but would also safely rest upon recent Supreme Court decisions upholding constitutional rights of gay and lesbian persons under the Fourteenth Amendment. By painting the contemporary national backdrop of this realm of family law while also weaving in Maine’s approach, culminating with the landmark decision in Adoption of M. A., the complexity of the issue at hand is apparent. However, the reader may be left with dissatisfaction regarding our imperfect legal system, which pales in comparison to the frustration experienced by those same-sex couples who are refused the ability to adopt. Despite the inconsistency among the laws of the states on <b>adoption</b> <b>by</b> same-sex <b>couples,</b> <b>a</b> ray of hope lies in the national trend that favors allowing such adoptions. Nevertheless, our nation would be best served by the Supreme Court relying on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to enunciate a uniform standard for adoption that mandates blindness to sexual orientation of the prospective adoptive parents along with consideration of the best interest of the child; thus effecting equality by treating prospective same-sex adoptive couples in the same manner as heterosexual couples. There exists both a rational basis and laudable objective in utilizing the Equal Protection Clause in securing protections for same-sex couples and their children. This would transform a mere ray of hope into the constitutionally guaranteed equality enunciated in the Fourteenth Amendment...|$|R
