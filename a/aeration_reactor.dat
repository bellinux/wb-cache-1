Two membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems, namely, aeration–denitrification system (ADS) and denitrification–aeration system (DAS) were studied with 50 mg/L of influent concentrations for both organic matter and nitrate nitrogen. The DAS achieved better removal efficiency of 91. 4 % total nitrogen (T-N) and denitrification rate of 363. 7 mg/L. {{day at a}} HRT of 3 h compared to ADS. Further, there was no nitrite accumulation in the DAS effluent. The nitrite accumulation in ADS effluent was lesser when CO 2 was used as buffer rather than K 2 HPO 4 and KH 2 PO 4.

A bio-photoreactor system was designed to combine this photocatalytic reactor with the IDEA reactor for the treatment of dyeing wastewater. The performance of this combined bio-photoreactor system with and without recirculation was investigated and compared. The system with recycled water has similar efficiency for decolorization and COD removal to that without recirculation, but has a high capacity to eliminate the effects caused by a shock loading, and also the system can treat dyeing wastewater with a higher organic concentration.

Then, when real RAS wastewater was used, the Shannon index decreased in both reactors and the bio-diversities were decreased, which {{could be explained by}} the higher abundance of dominating species. It was interesting to notice that all the samples in the reactor bottom have lower Shannon index than that of middle, which indicated the microbial diversity got higher along the reactor column to the middle. We assume that in the anoxic up-flow fixed bed reactors (I and II), the relative higher nitrate and DO concentration in the bottom decreased the bacterial diversity, on the other hand, in interval <b>aeration</b> <b>Reactor</b> (III) the relative low DO concentration in the bottom decreased the bacterial diversity.

Water nutrient recycling {{is a key}} step to increase the sustainability of algae biofuel production facilities. This thesis discusses the process of nutrient and water recycling in high rate algae raceway ponds (HRAP) fed primary treated municipal wastewater. Research was conducted primarily at the San Luis Obispo Water Resource Reclamation Facility (SLOWRRF). Nine 30 m 2, 0. 3 m deep HRAP’s were operated continuously from June 1, 2013 to April 17, 2014. The ponds were arranged in three sets of triplicate ponds, with two pond sets run on 3 -day hydraulic residence time (HRT), and the third on a 2 -day HRT. The biomass productivity of the 2 -day HRT and 3 -day HRT were compared. The two sets of 3 -day HRT ponds were run in series {{to determine the effect}} on productivity associated with recycling growth media without supplemental nutrient addition. The first pond in series was referred to as round 1 and the second as round 2. Due to solids accumulation in the 2 -day HRT ponds in summer proper biomass productivity values could not be determined. 4 -inch standpipes were determined to cause the solids accumulation when large flocs were present in ponds. As a possible solution to the solids accumulation issue, a ramped standpipe was designed and installed in one pond per triplicate set. In winter the 2 -day HRT pond was roughly 37 % more productive than the 3 -day HRT. In summer the round 1 (3 -day HRT) ponds were roughly 33 % more productive than the round 2 (3 -day HRT) ponds. In winter the round 1 (3 -day HRT) ponds were roughly 19 % more productive than the round 2 (3 -day HRT) ponds. The type of standpipe (ramped or 4 -inch) did not cause a significant amount of solids accumulation in either of the 3 -day HRT ponds. The type of standpipe did {{make a difference in the}} 2 -day HRT ponds. On average the 4 -inch standpipe pond had 35 % higher TSS than the ramped standpipe ponds. In addition to these field experiments, laboratory aerobic degradation experiments were conducted to determine the nutrient release of previously digested sludge in aerobic ponds. Pretreatment of algae sludge did not have a significant effect on nutrient release of previously anaerobically digested algae sludge in aerobic conditions.

40|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorus}} in wastewaters are a burning environmental {{issue of the}} present world. This review covers the studies conducted on the removal and recovery of phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewaters through struvite crystallization. Wastewater which contains a high amount of phosphorus and nitrogen {{would be a good}} source of struvite. Struvite is a phosphate fertilizer, although it contains a significant amount of nitrogen and magnesium, and it is an effective alternative source of rock phosphate to maintain the agricultural production system. The present review deals with the principles and concept of struvite nucleation, crystal growth and the factors that affect on the struvite quality. Struvite precipitation occurs in an equimolecular concentration of Mg 2 +,NH 4 + andPO 43 − at slightly alkaline conditions. Addition of a source of Mg is essential to maintain the favorable condition of PO 4 and Mg. Different factors such as Mg:PO 4 molar ratio, pH, <b>aeration</b> rate, <b>reactor</b> types, as well as P and N removal efficiencies were also discussed throughout this review. The slower nutrient leaching loss and its fertilizer quality make struvite an eco-friendly fertilizer.

The effects of both types of passive aeration apparatus were investigated {{in order to determine}} the degree of composting rate by continuously monitoring temperature, moisture content, organic matter, electrical conductivity, pH and C/N ratio in the piles.

The aim of the study was to describe nitrogen transformation process and the demand of chemical fractions, involved in the ASP process. Moreover, the non-linear relationship between the flow of wastewater and the consumed electrical energy, used by the blowers, was determined.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the removal of phosphorus in the activated sludge process showed that: (1) Luxury uptake of phosphorus may be induced {{by the presence of}} an anoxic zone (2) If a primary and secondary anoxic reactor are present in the system, the actual retention time of the primary anoxic reactor will have the dominant effect on the degree of phosphorus removal. (3) In a system where only a primary anoxic reactor is present, there is an optimum actual anoxic retention time for obtaining maximum phosphorus removal. This optimum value appears to coincide with the condition where there is no nett release of phosphorus in the anoxic zone. Decreasing or increasing the actual anoxic retention time either side of the optimum value has a detrimental effect on phosphorus removal. (4) Increasing the influent ammonia-nitrogen and hence the reactor nitrate concentration, enhances phosphorus removal. (5) An increase in <b>aeration</b> <b>reactor</b> pH to between pH 7 - 8 enhances phosphorus removal. (6) The mechanism of removal {{does not appear to be}} precipitation. Although an increase in pH through the anoxic reactor was observed due to denitrification, phosphorus was released into solution. (7) The degree of phosphorus removal is independent of the influent phosphorus concentration. (8) Anoxic stripping of phosphorus is not a pre-requisite for luxury uptake of phosphorus to occur. (9) The concentration of phosphorus removed is a function of the COD utilized. The ratio of phosphorus removed to the COD utilized is constant at a particular sludge age, so that as the concentration of COD utilized increases, the concentration of phosphorus removed increases.

Although influent chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH 3 -N and total phosphorus (TP) fluctuated, effluent COD, NH 3 -N and TP remained stable. Moreover, average COD, NH 3 -N and TP removal efficiency were 68. 41 %, 93. 67 % and 45. 82 %, respectively, during the A/O process.

In contrast, molecular oxygen is the most inexpensive and harmless oxidant availabe. Enzymatic activation of molecular oxygen is an interesting biotechnological reaction in the conversion {{of a wide range}} of substrates into their more valuable oxidized products. The promotion of the use of molecular oxygen as primary oxidant for sustainable oxidations in the fine chemical industry using isolated biocatalysts was the main motivation to start this work. Even though its great biocatalytic potential, stability and productivity still often limit the use of these biocatalysts. In this dissertation, the primary objective was to study bubbleless oxygenation with membranes as a method for the prevention of gas/liquid inactivation of isolated enzymes. This was experimentally studied on a small scale (200 mL) for the conversion of lactose to lactobionic acid using cellobiose dehydrogenase as the synthesizing enzyme and a laccase-mediator system for regeneration of the flavo-enzyme. Kinetic modeling of the enzymatic conversion of lactose to lactobionic acid lead to a thorough understanding of the seemingly complicated reactions and provided a framework for rationalization of biocatalyst and redox mediator use. A similar approach was used to quantitatively describe the interactions between a laccase-mediator system and pyranose 2 -oxidase for production of 2 -ketoaldoses. Reaction engineering enabled to shift the pathway from oxygen to redox mediator reduction by pyranose 2 -oxidase and thus lead to an increased productivity and stability of the system without the addition of catalase. The experimental knowledge gathered during the conversions on small scale and the developed kinetic model for conversion of lactose to lactobionic acid made us confident enough to upscale this conversion to 20 L using the dynamic membrane <b>aeration</b> <b>reactor</b> originally developed for aeration of sensitive animal cells by Bayer Technology Services. This reactor was both operated in batch and continuous mode. Ultrafiltration membranes were used in the continuous mode to retain the biocatalysts in the reactor. Some aspects that were studied in this dissertation require further elaboration and optimization, but it is clear that the concept of bubbleless oxygenation can be beneficial for a number of biocatalytic oxidations and we are convinced that the developed reaction engineering approach will become a versatile tool for optimization and upscaling of biocatalytic oxidations based on isolated enzymes with enzymatic redox mediator/coenzyme regeneration...|$|E

The technological demands of the membrane filtration has to be combined {{with the demands of}} the biological step. In pre tests the used machines were optimised for this task. After selection of membrane modules, pumps and pressure valves the semi scale tests were started. During the anaerobic investigations for the membrane reactors a fixed bed reactor was used in parallel as a reference. The fixed bed reactor was able to handle organic loading rates up to 13 - 15 kg (COD/(m 3 x d)) under good conditions. In the membrane supported reactor it was possible to operate at a value of 6 - 7 kg COD/(m 3 x d). This difference was not affected by any different operating condition of both systems. The results of accompanying activity tests showed that the mechanical strain of the sludge is the reason for this lack. The anaerobic membrane reactors are technological expensive but have no advantage about conventional high rate systems. The discontinuous operation of the membrane filtration showed a better flux than the continuous operation. This is due to the relaxing of the cake on the membrane surface which will be swept away after starting the next filtration cycle. The aerobic membrane aeration indicated that shear forces in a normal cross flow filtration caused floc destruction with negative results for the flux. The reason were the pumps used for the feed. Using a low pressure membrane system, the feed is accelerated and lifted by upstreaming air, the flux is constant over several month. The activity of the sludge is unaffected by the equipment and the type of membrane filtration, but the excess sludge production is lower related to a conventional <b>aeration</b> <b>reactor.</b> Kinetic parameters of suspended biomass at ages of 100 - 250 d and more are different form the well known values. The reduced amount of surplus sludge is an advantage but it is combined with an higher oxygen demand for the degradation of the biomass. The effluent quality is much better than it could be reached by a conventional waste water treatment system, even hygienic parameters could be met easily. The aerobic low pressure membrane filtration system will enrich the process engineering for waste water treatment. (orig.)

40|$|The Sri Lankan {{national}} water authority, that is The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) {{has taken}} a new wastewater treatment plant into operation at Ja Ela, North of Colombo. The plant has been in operation since September 2011. In April 2012, it was concluded how {{a test of the}} aeration efficiency and a performance test should be carried out. The tests have been based on the actual loading of the plant and the analysis results from the daily process control. The evaluation of the aeration efficiency is not reported in this paper. The paper presents the overall perform ance of the water treatment part of the plant during start-up conditions, from fall 2011 through the first five months of 2012. The results from the operation are found in Table 1. An important circumstance at the plant is the current very low loading in comparison with the design load. This fact has resulted in an introduction of an intermittent mode of the <b>aeration</b> (nitrification) <b>reactor.</b> Based on operation figures, during more than a month (May 2012), it has been possible to give a realistic assessment of the overall performance. The most striking results are summarized as follows: 1) The intermittent operation has enabled an energy efficient operation of the plant. By the introduction of the intermittent aeration, the energy consumption has been reduced by around 75 %, compared with the continuous operation mode; 2) The plant performance during the intermittent operation has been improved with respect to virtually all important pollu tion variables. The most striking improvement is the discharge total P level, reflecting that a substantial enhanced bio logical phosphorus removal takes. The typical discharge levels found during May 2012, were compared with the earlier obtained values. It is important to underline that the loading on the plant has slightly increased during May as compared with the previous operation period. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{decision}} support system for wastewater treatment plant (WASDA) was developed to make appropriate decisions on plant design and process selection. WASDA mainly focused on municipal and industrial applications to produce conceptual and process design for primary, secondary and advanced treatments. It consists of multiple modules such as equalization tank, coagulation, neutralization, conventional activated sludge, extended <b>aeration,</b> sequencing batch <b>reactor,</b> oxidation ditch, rotating biological contactor and membrane system. This paper presents the architecture of WASDA for Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR), which includes the structural and developmental cycles of the SBR module that is available within WASDA package. Expert knowledge in the information base was assembled from design textbooks, manuals and other design requirements stipulated by the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE) and Department of Sewerage Services (DoSS) and converted into Artificial Intelligence (AI) rules. The study provides a user-friendly approach to access essential knowledge about SBR and the procedures to design SBR, including design requirements, facilities selection and analysis of selected process performance. The design conducted using WASDA was verified based on manual calculation and a worksheet (Mathcad 11).

40|$|The vortex-ingesting {{stirred tank}} reactor uses a {{combination}} of a helical screw impeller and concentric draft-tube to entrain and recycle headspace gas and disperse it as bubbles in a liquid reaction solvent. This study presents an experimental characterisation of a 0. 29 m diameter vortex-ingesting gas-liquid stirred reactor, operated with solids mass fractions from 0 to 25 %, over a range of specific power inputs up to 3 W/kg and for a variety of tank geometries. As was found in previous studies the most important geometric variable is the draft-tube top clearance, since this has the most direct effect on the gas ingestion rate. The presence of low solids fractions causes {{a significant increase in the}} minimum speed required for vortex ingestion of the gas. At low impeller speeds and low solids mass fractions, accumulation of particles in the annulus surrounding the draft-tube reduces the pumping capacity of the impeller. This mechanism also reduces the gas holdup and gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient, although not always in a monotonic fashion. In this design of <b>reactor,</b> <b>aeration</b> results in only a small decrease in the specific power input and so the just-suspended condition is not much affected by the presence of gas...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of a thiosulfate-oxidizing bioreactor that allowed high elemental sulfur production and recovery efficiency. The reactor system, {{referred to as a}} Supernatant-Recycling Settler Bioreactor (SRSB), consisted of a cylindrical upflow reactor and a separate <b>aeration</b> vessel. The <b>reactor</b> was equipped with an internal settler and packing material (structured corrugated PVC sheets) to facilitate both cell retention and the settling of the formed elemental sulfur. The supernatant from the reactor was continuously recirculated through the aerator. An inlet thiosulfate concentration of 100 mmol l − 1 was used. The reactor system was fed with 89 mmol l − 1 d − 1 thiosulfate reaching 98 to 100 % thiosulfate conversion with an elemental sulfur yield of 77 %. Ninety-three percent of the produced sulfur was harvested {{from the bottom of the}} reactor as sulfur sludge. The dry sulfur sludge contained 87 % elemental sulfur. The inclusion of an internal settler and packing material in the reactor system resulted in an effective retention of sulfur and biomass inside the bioreactor, preventing the oxidation of thiosulfate and elemental sulfur to sulfate in the aerator and, therefore, improving the efficiency of elemental sulfur formation and recovery.

40|$|Three lab-scale vertical-flow {{constructed}} wetlands (VFCWs), {{including the}} non-aerated (NA), intermittently aerated (IA) and continuously aerated (CA) ones, were operated at different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) {{to evaluate the}} effect of artificial aeration on the treatment efficiency of heavily polluted river water. Results indicated that artificial aeration increased the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in IA and CA, which significantly favored the removal of organic matter and NH 4 +-N. The DO grads caused by intermittent aeration formed aerobic and anoxic regions in IA and thus promoted the removal of total nitrogen (TN). Although the removal efficiencies of CODCr, NH 4 +-N and TN in the three VFCWs all decreased {{with an increase in}} HLR, artificial <b>aeration</b> enhanced the <b>reactor</b> resistance to the fluctuation of pollutant loadings. The maximal removal efficiencies of CODCr, NH 4 +-N and total phosphorus (TP) (i. e., 81 %, 87 % and 37 %, respectively) were observed in CA at 19 cm/day HLR, while the maximal TN removal (i. e., 57 %) was achieved in 1 A. Although the improvement of artificial aeration on TP removal was limited, this study has demonstrated the feasibility of applying artificial aeration to VFCWs treating polluted river water, particularly at a high HLR...|$|R

40|$|Settling {{properties}} of activated sludge or {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} (MLSS) {{have been studied}} for more than 75 years at wastewater treatment plants. Temperature, together with MLSS concentration, has been acknowledged as important contributors to MLSS settling variations. Batch MLSS settling tests are performed on a regular basis at most of the plants. The majority of these MLSS settling test reports reflect the complete absence of any form of temperature compensation or even MLSS sample temperature (Ts) recordings. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effects of short-term temperature variations on MLSS settling parameters. This is done by means of simplified theoretical calculations, followed by operational reactor temperature (Tr) observations, and batch MLSS settling tests. The experimental work concludes with the implementation of an on-line MLSS settling test procedure at a full-scale plant reactor to develop settling models based on diurnal Tr fluctuations. These settling models illustrate that parameter correlations improve when Tr is included in on-line MLSS concentration-based settling models. The unhindered settling velocity of a single solid biofloc in water is considered in a simplified calculation to estimate the effect of temperature variations on MLSS settling. Over a Ts increase of 20 °C, water density and viscosity reductions result in a calculated biofloc settling velocity increase of less than 0. 5 m/hr. Similarly, biofloc density, shape, and size changes result in calculated biofloc settling velocity increases of about 11, 10, and 2 m/hr respectively over the 20 °C Ts range. Plant temperature recordings show significant short- to long-term variations. Ambient temperature (Ta) and Tr fluctuate about 20 °C and 1. 8 °C respectively per day, and Tr changes by about 4 °C within a week, as measured on-line at local plants during the test period in winter. The aeration method can have a significant impact on Tr. Differences in Tr in adjacent surface and bubble <b>aeration</b> <b>reactors</b> in the same plant were about 5 °C. Large enough Tr and Ta variations exist at these local plants to affect MLSS settling test results. The MLSS settling test cylinder environment and meteorological conditions have a direct influence on Ts during batch settling tests. Direct solar radiation increases the average Ts by 4. 3 °C, or by 0. 15 °C per minute, during a 30 -minute MLSS settling test duration. This Ts change leads to a sludge volume index (SVI) change of 63 mℓ/g, at an average SVI decrease of 14. 8 mℓ/g per 1 °C Ts increase. Changes to other parameters include an initial settling velocity (ISV) increase of about 0. 12 m/hr for every 1 °C Ts increase, together with a clarified supernatant turbidity increase of about 1. 4 formazine nephelometric unit (FNU) for every 1 °C Ts increase. Ts adjusts towards Ta before and during a batch MLSS settling test, thereby influencing MLSS settling results. Compensation for Ts variations during routine MLSS settling tests is nevertheless not reported as a common practice. To some extent, this is due to a lack of temperature-controlled MLSS settling test equipment. An automated MLSS settling meter demonstrates a semi-continuous on-line method to determine settling parameters in situ at the operational Tr of a full-scale plant. A basic polynomial fits 11 MLSS settling parameters that indicate in most instances improved MLSS settling at increased Tr. The average SVI decreases by 14. 8 mℓ/g for every 1 °C Tr increase. Similarly, for every 1 °C Tr increase, the maximum settling velocity (u_max) increase is 0. 1 m/hr, and the time to reach maximum settling velocity (t_umax) decreases by 2. 4 minutes. The incremental 5 -minute duration average settling velocities increase over the first 15 minutes of a MLSS settling test, as the MLSS concentration decreases and the Tr increases. This direct incremental settling velocity trend with Tr is reversed between 15 and 30 minutes, as the average 5 -minute MLSS settling velocity increases at a reduced Tr. The inclusion of Tr in MLSS concentration-based settling best-fit correlations with SVI, u_max, and t_umax improves the coefficient of multiple determinations (R 2) by an average of 0. 32. Best-fit SVI models with u_max and t_umax have R 2 -values of 0. 90 and 0. 95 respectively. The developed models are only valid for the individual reactor MLSS conditions within the experimental parameter ranges. The main contribution of this study is to present temperature-based MLSS settling models. These models illustrate that an automated on-line MLSS settling meter is suitable to identify and model temperature related MLSS settling data with minimal experimental effort. A suitable approach is provided to improve the reliability of MLSS settling data, as effects of short-term temperature variations can be practically eliminated from settling test.

40|$|Low {{solubility}} {{of oxygen}} {{has resulted in}} high bioreactor energy requirements in order to supply sufficient oxygen to aerobic bioprocesses. It is desirable to reduce energy consumption in bioreactors to benefit environmental sustainability {{as well as economic}} feasibility. This is particularly important with the resurgence of interest in bio-based commodity products. Some research has suggested that venturi aeration of bioreactors will reduce energy consumption by eliminating the need for air compression, {{while at the same time}} maintaining or improving oxygen transfer rates. On the other hand, there are findings that suggest venturi aeration has lower energy efficiency than conventional sparging and oxygen transfer rates achieved are too low sustain aerobic biological processes. A comparison of the <b>aeration</b> of geometrically-similar <b>reactors</b> using the same analytical methods to determine kLa is not available in the literature. This comparison should also address analysis of energy input including energy used for compressing gas sparged into a stirred tank reactor; the investigation of mass transfer rates at higher flow rates (vvm) in venturi-aerated reactors and resulting cell response to these higher flow rates. This is the topic of the dissertation presented. In this laboratory scale study, venturi aerators were characterised and energy consumption as a function of oxygen mass transfer rates compared with a geometrically identical aerated stirred tank reactor by evaluating the volumetric mass transfer coefficients (kLa). The kLa was investigated in varying reactor setups using the dynamic gassing-in method...|$|R

The {{system with a}} total working volume of 4. 6 L (3. 7 L in the reactor and 0. 9 L in the reservoir) treated 2. 1 L of synthetic wastewater in 12 -h cycles. As inoculum two types of biomass were used: an anaerobic/anoxic one from an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) and an aerobic one from a prolonged aeration activated sludge system. The system, maintained at 30 ± 1 oC, operated in batch mode followed by fed-batch mode and was aerated intermittently.
