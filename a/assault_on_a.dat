5|$|After the Allies {{landed in}} Sumatra, {{many of the}} Muslim Indian {{soldiers}} brought by the English deserted and joined the native revolutionaries. They planned strategy in the mosque, including the <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> British barracks. One of these Indian soldiers, {{who had died in}} the assault, was buried at the mosque. Since 1950, after Indonesia's independence was recognised, the Ganting Grand Mosque has hosted numerous statesmen from both Indonesia and abroad, including Vice President Mohammad Hatta, Minister of Defence Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, and General Abdul Haris Nasution. Foreign dignitaries who have visited the mosque included people from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.|$|E

She refused paramedics' attempts to put her on a stretcher, returned to her vehicle, and continued to refuse to cooperate. She then attempted {{to walk away from the}} scene, but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E

5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{was first}} sent to Cámus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, {{which was at}} the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war. Although she officially was not a soldier and was not {{supposed}} to participate in combat, this did not deter her from fighting alongside the men of her regiment. Indeed, she was noted for her great skill with a rifle. She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was looked up to by the men of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put herself at risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from being abused by her compatriots.|$|E

5|$|On 6April, all {{available}} Liberators joined B-25 Mitchells of No.79 Wing in an <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Japanese convoy {{that included the}} cruiser Isuzu. Anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, as well as attacks by enemy fighters, resulted {{in the loss of}} two Liberators, and the crews' standard of aerial gunnery was criticised afterwards. Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the following day. Later that month, No.23 Squadron, having recently converted to Liberators from A-31 Vengeances, was added to No.82 Wing's strength. The wing's three flying squadrons identified themselves with black chevrons on the tail fins of their aircraft, No.21's facing backwards, No.23's downwards, and No.24's forwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{same month}} Charlesworth assumed command, No. 76 Wing arrived from Cairns, Queensland, to {{coordinate}} and control minelaying operations in NWA by three Catalina squadrons. The Catalinas mined Manila Bay in December 1944, {{to support the}} Allied landing at Mindoro. No. 82 (Heavy Bomber) Wing—the RAAF's first—became operational under NWA's control at Fenton Airfield on 11January 1945. Comprising two Liberator squadrons, the wing replaced the USAAF's 380th Group when the latter {{was transferred to the}} Fifth Air Force in the Philippines. The Liberators of No.82 Wing sank seven Japanese ships in the Dutch East Indies during March. On 6April, all of its available aircraft joined Mitchells of No.79 Wing in an <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. Anti-aircraft fire and attacks by enemy fighters resulted in the loss of two Liberators; Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the following day.|$|E
5|$|The tenth {{anniversary of}} the RLI's {{formation}} on 1 February 1961 was commemorated on 30 January 1971 with a special military tattoo, held at Glamis Stadium in Salisbury. The Battalion spent three weeks rehearsing for the three-hour tattoo, {{which was the first}} held by a single military unit in Rhodesia. The men gave demonstrations of drilling, physical training and unarmed combat; a staged <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> guerrilla camp was held by 2 Commando, using blank ammunition and dummy mortars. The show culminated with a sky-dive by three Battalion Parachute Club members, Captain Garth Barrett, Sergeant Dennis Croukamp and Major John Pierson. Following this a retreat ceremony was held as well as a final march-past by all participants.|$|E

5|$|Trevor is Canadian, born {{just north}} of the border of the United States. He grew up with a {{physically}} abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10. This upbringing combined with Trevor's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged, leading to numerous fights at school, including an <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> teacher. Trevor loved planes, and at some point entered the military as a pilot, but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation. Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that landed him in jail for six months (however, due to good behavior, he was out in four). He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor eventually met Michael Townley and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists, and both men became successful in doing so. However, their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{hampered}} the wing's {{activities in}} January 1945. No.1 Squadron was withdrawn to Queensland to re-equip with Mosquitos, with No.13 Squadron, flying Venturas, {{taking up the}} slack on anti-shipping missions. The squadron accounted for around half of the thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No.79 Wing in February, and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month. Wing operations were cut back in March, as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to Jacquinot Bay in New Britain. On 6April, all twenty available aircraft of Nos.2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join B-24 Liberators of No.82 Wing in an <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. The Liberators were late for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off Sumba so the latter, at the very limit of their range, attacked the convoy regardless. They claimed two direct hits without loss, despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, and frontal attacks by enemy fighters. Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the next day.|$|E
