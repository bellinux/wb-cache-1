5|$|The winning design, the English Electric Canberra, also {{dispensed}} with defensive armaments, producing a design {{with the speed}} that allowed it to fly past most defences. Just as importantly, the design's long, straight wing gave it the lift needed to operate at very high altitudes, placing it above the range where even jet powered fighters were able to operate. The Canberra could simply fly over its enemy with relative impunity, <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> made it naturally suited to aerial reconnaissance missions, spawning a number of spin-off versions of the aircraft with even larger wings for even greater altitude performance and improved range.|$|E
5|$|Harold Larwood {{maintained}} {{great respect}} for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing {{him to be a}} great man. Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler shortly before he emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton admitted that he had liked Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done their job on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> caused problems in Australia. Bill O'Reilly stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him agreeable and even charming.|$|E

La cabina (1972) is the most awarded Spanish TV production in history. In the 90s Acción mutante (1992), by Álex de la Iglesia, and Abre los ojos (1997), by Alejandro Amenábar, represent a watershed in Spanish sf filming, with <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> would only be reached again by Los cronocrímenes (2007), by Nacho Vigalondo.

25|$|West Indies won {{the inaugural}} World Cup in England in 1975, {{defeating}} Australia in the final. Then in 1975–76 they toured Australia, only to lose 1–5 in the six-Test series, and then beat India at home two-one in a four Test series {{later that same}} winter. It was in Australia that the quick bowler Michael Holding made his first appearance. Colin Croft and Joel Garner made their debut the next year, and Malcolm Marshall two years after. In the span of about four years, West Indies brought together a bowling line-up of <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> had rarely been seen before. The tour of India had seen the debut of Vivian Richards, arguably the finest West Indian batsman ever, and Gordon Greenidge, who joined a strong batting line-up that already included Alvin Kallicharran and opener Roy Fredericks in addition to Rowe and Lloyd.

25|$|Planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} {{water from}} Greater Irbid in the Jordan Valley. A major water reuse project is being planned to reuse water from three {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{in the area of}} Irbid in the North of Jordan through a project supported in the framework of Jordanian-German cooperation. As of 2006, only 14% of the wastewater from these plants was being reused. An explanation for this is that farmers in the Jordan Valley are reluctant to use the reclaimed water, which they perceive to be of poor quality, for irrigation. The wastewater thus flows into the Jordan River, unused. In the future, the treated effluent from the three plants will flow through a pipe into the Jordan Valley, generating hydropower from the elevation differential of more than 1,000m. It will then be mixed with freshwater and delivered to the farmers in <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> is acceptable to them.|$|E
25|$|Snow goggles (niguak ~ niiguak dual or nigaugek dual nigauget pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, igguag in Cup'ig) is old-style snow goggles {{made out}} of wood with narrow slits, which admit only a little light. Snow goggles were carved from {{driftwood}} (esp. spruce), walrus ivory, bone or caribou antler, and sometimes made with coarse seashore grass. They always paint the inside of goggles black, so our eyes won’t be bothered by the glare and can stay wide open. goggles were created in various styles by artists from different regions, and they often resembled animals underscoring a pervasive Native theme of human-animal transformation. Some snow goggles are carved {{in the form of}} an animal mask. Arctic foxes have keen eyesight for hunting on the land and sea ice, <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> the mask/goggles may have been intended to transfer to the person wearing them. The goggles with narrow slits not only protect the eyes from excess light, but also sharpen and focus vision, like a pinhole camera. Some goggles have large eye openings and are blackened with soot inside to eliminate reflections. Snow goggles are an ancient element of Eskimo hunting cultures, appearing in archaeological sites up to 2000 years old.|$|E

500|$|The {{inclusion}} of [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues" [...] on Material World marked a rare {{example of a}} secular composition on Harrison's most spiritually oriented album. Recorded at the Beatles' Apple Studio in London, the track features his extensive use of the dobro-style resonator guitar, as well as musical contributions from Gary Wright, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. The song's musical mood and lyric recall aspects of old English square dance, <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> some writers identify as mirroring the changing of sides amid the lawsuits relating to the Beatles' break-up.

500|$|By 1973, Sellers and Milligan {{were among}} the comedians who formed part of Harrison's social circle at his Friar Park estate in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. This period coincided {{with the end of}} his {{marriage}} to Pattie Boyd, who has described their home as [...] "a madhouse" [...] during their final year together. Harrison became reacquainted with Smith through longtime Beatles aide Terry Doran. Harrison admired Smith as [...] "a wonderfully eccentric person", <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> had similarly inspired him about Sir Frank Crisp, the original owner of Friar Park. Author Dale Allison suggests that Smith became a court jester figure for Harrison, who wrote the song [...] "His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)" [...] as a tribute to Smith.

Claudia Puig, in her review for USA Today, wrote, [...] "The dialogue by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer is spotty. There are some great, pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, [...] "Clive Owen makes a semi-believable hero, not performing too many feats that are physically unlikely. He's handsome and has the obligatory macho stubble, but he has <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> makes you worry a little about him". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B–" [...] rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "the star of the pic may well be NYC's Guggenheim Museum and Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends".|$|E
500|$|The aim of {{this group}} was to create an {{independent}} Russian school of music {{in the footsteps of}} Glinka. They were to strive for [...] "national character," [...] gravitate toward [...] "Oriental" [...] (by that they meant near-Eastern) melodies and favor program music over absolute—in other words, symphonic poems and related music over symphonies, concertos and chamber music. To create this Russian style of classical music, Stasov wrote that the group incorporated four characteristics. The first was a rejection of academicism and fixed Western forms of composition. The second was the incorporation of musical elements from eastern nations inside the Russian empire; this was <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> would later become known as musical orientalism. The third was a progressive and anti-academic approach to music. The fourth was the incorporation of compositional devices linked with folk music. These four points would distinguish the Five from its contemporaries in the cosmopolitan camp of composition.|$|E
