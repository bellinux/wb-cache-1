Crawford supplied gas for Jones' boat, and they set out into the river, which flooded as high as the telephone wires. Rescuing people from their porches, second-floor windows, or roofs, Crawford described that he and Jones bounced <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cork, and dodged debris, houses and telephone poles.|$|E

He spends some quality time with her, and convinces her to join the group. Unfortunately, the friendship is short-lived when Asami becomes trapped while attempting to save a boy in the parking lot. She shouts for Kohta {{to make it so}} that she will not become a zombie and cause pain to others around her. Kohta kills her and later finds himself in shock, but he is set straight by Shizuka, who uses a psychology trick of ordering him <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sergeant.|$|E

25|$|As {{the number}} of prisoners at the camp {{increased}} {{in the summer of}} 1864, the War Department again reduced rations, in retaliation for the Confederates reducing rations for Union prisoners. Rations reportedly no longer lasted quite as long as the period for which they were allotted. A few prisoners reported that prisoners resorted to eating rats. Guards punished anyone caught taking bones from the garbage by tying the bone in the prisoner's mouth and making him crawl <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dog. As the length of confinements increased {{due to the lack of}} prisoner exchanges, more fights between prisoners arose. Other prisoners usually broke them up before guards intervened. Work details were still required.|$|E

Rodgers and Hammerstein's King [...] supposed to be a compelling personality [...] bears no resemblance to the man described ... in the [...] "Something Wonderful" [...] number.

500|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of Ernest's childhood. When he was fourteen months old, a servant commented that Ernest [...] "runs <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> weasel. He is teething and as cross {{as a little}} badger from impatience and liveliness. He is not pretty now, except his beautiful black eyes". In May 1820, his mother described Ernest as [...] "very big for his age, as well as intelligent. His big black eyes are full of spirit and vivacity". Biographer Richard Hough writes that [...] "even from their infancy, it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father, in character and appearance, while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects". Ernest and his brother often lived with their grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld until her death in 1831.|$|E
500|$|In December 1895, the Boston Daily Globe {{published}} a lengthy biography of Lowe, whom the paper described as Boston's [...] "quiet, unassuming but phenomenal second baseman." [...] The Globe {{noted that the}} ease with which Lowe played the game led many to understate his value to the club:"For a grand player, Lowe is seldom given the credit often dished out to his inferiors. His work does not appeal to the bleachers and grandstand like the less natural and clumsy player who is often seen floundering <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fish out of water, while the crowd enjoy the effort and go home to tell what great playing they saw. 'He is a hard worker,' you will hear them say. Bobby Lowe is not only a hard worker but a conscientious player and an artist of the first magnitude." ...|$|E
500|$|May {{was delighted}} that Lima [...] "went for {{something}} more fashion-forward" [...] with Susan Sarandon's Queen Narissa. She decided to make {{her look like a}} [...] "runway lady", wearing something that is [...] "still Disney" [...] but also [...] "high fashion, like something John Galliano or Thierry Mugler might design". Since Narissa appears in three media: hand drawn animation, live-action, and computer animation, May had {{to make sure that the}} costume would be the same throughout in terms of [...] "color, shape, and texture". The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt, which looked [...] "reptilian", as well as a cape. Working with the animators, May incorporated parts of the dragon's form into the costume; the cape was designed to look like wings, the [...] of the skirt wrap <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tail and a crown that would turn into horns during Narissa's transformation into a dragon.|$|E

500|$|An {{observer}} in {{an accelerated}} reference frame must introduce what physicists call fictitious forces {{to account for}} the acceleration experienced by himself and objects around him. One example, the force pressing the driver of an accelerating car into his or her seat, has already been mentioned; another is the force you can feel pulling your arms up and out if you attempt to spin <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> top. [...] Einstein's master insight was that the constant, familiar pull of the Earth's gravitational field is fundamentally the same as these fictitious forces. [...] The apparent magnitude of the fictitious forces always appears to be proportional to the mass of any object on which they act – for instance, the driver's seat exerts just enough force to accelerate the driver {{at the same rate as}} the car. [...] By analogy, Einstein proposed that an object in a gravitational field should feel a gravitational force proportional to its mass, as embodied in Newton's law of gravitation.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, Crash's sole offensive maneuvers were jumping onto his enemies and a distinctive technique in which he spins <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tornado, kicking away anyone or anything that he strikes. In later games Crash can expand his range of abilities by defeating boss characters. The expanded abilities include a powerful splash, the ability to jump while in the air, the [...] "Death Tornado Spin" [...] (a variation of his spinning technique that allows him to hover through the air for a limited time), a bazooka that fires Wumpa Fruit, increased running speed, the ability to safely tip-toe on top of explosive crates, and the ability to jump at incredibly high heights. The games Crash of the Titans and [...] allow Crash to further expand his offensive abilities with new fighting moves learned from collecting a magical substance known as [...] "Mojo". In , Crash has the ability to throw TNT crates, and can use his Yo-yo to bring in enemies to spin attack.|$|E
500|$|Robert Smith said he {{considers}} [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] {{to be one}} of the band's strongest works, and called it [...] "the best pop song the Cure have ever done".

It’s as good as it gets. Anytime I hear it on the radio or a mix tape, I jump <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> freak." [...] J Mascis said his band Dinosaur Jr.'s affection for the song inspired them to record a cover version that was released in 1989. On 16 July 2006, [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was played as a wake-up call for the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery on their flight STS-121 at the request of astronaut Piers Sellers' family; Sellers told mission control center that the song reminded him of [...] "the wild, happy, beer-drinking years of my youth." ...|$|E

500|$|Lajoie led the AL in {{batting average}} {{five times in}} his career and four times {{recorded}} {{the highest number of}} hits. During several of those years with the Naps he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other, most notably coming in 1910, when the league's batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson. Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league players to record 3,000 career hits. He led the NL or AL in putouts five times in his career and assists three times. He has been called [...] "the best second baseman in the history of baseball" [...] and [...] "the most outstanding player to wear a Cleveland uniform." [...] Cy Young said, [...] "Lajoie {{was one of the most}} rugged players I ever faced. He'd take your leg off with a line drive, turn the third baseman <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> swinging door and powder the hand of the left fielder." [...] He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Bertuzzi's playing {{style as}} a power forward {{resulted}} in comparisons to former Islander Clark Gillies. As a result, the club hired Gillies to personally mentor Bertuzzi. Failing to meet lofty expectations from the club, Gillies once said of Bertuzzi, [...] "If you're built like a freight train, you can't drive <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Volkswagen." [...] Feeling burdened with the pressure of playing up to the club's expectations while his offensive production diminished, he requested to be traded away {{at one point during}} the 1996–97 season. In response, Milbury, who had also taken over general manager duties the previous season, demoted Bertuzzi to the Islanders' minor league affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League (IHL). Playing 13 games in the minors, he registered 10 points before being called back up to the NHL. During the 1997–98 campaign, he continued to score below his pace as a rookie. On February 6, 1998, he was traded along with defenceman Bryan McCabe and a third-round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft (Jarkko Ruutu) to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for veteran forward Trevor Linden. The deal was made prior to the NHL's roster freeze in preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympics.|$|E
500|$|Liu Kang's Fatality {{from the}} {{original}} game is the [...] "Shaolin Uppercut", in which he performs a butterfly kick (often mistaken for a cartwheel) on his opponent before hitting an uppercut that knocks them offscreen before landing. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, there were two versions; one where the victim explodes to pieces upon impact and the original, in which the opponent is torn to pieces upon falling to the ground. In another signature Fatality, he morphs into a large dragon, chomping the upper body of his opponent. This Fatality was turned into an Animality in Mortal Kombat 3 and back into a normal Fatality in Mortal Kombat 4. In the Game Boy and Game Gear versions of Mortal Kombat II, the dragon torches the opponent with fire instead. The series' composer and co-designer John Vogel noted it to be his favorite Fatality due to how much Liu Kang's appearance changes. Another famous Fatality of Liu Kang has him vanish and a Mortal Kombat arcade game machine drop down and crush his opponent. According to GameSpy's MK2011 walkthrough, Liu Kang [...] "inflicts better damage" [...] than Kung Lao [...] "by jumping <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lunatic and kicking {{the crap out of}} everything he sees." ...|$|E

This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised".

500|$|Almost all {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that Chamorro could not win. She was depicted as rich {{with no real}} experience. There were rumors that she received millions from the United States via their embassy {{and that she was}} a US lackey; that she was too religious; and that her coalition was too disorganized, had no money, and was plagued by in-fighting. In reality, her humility and provincial roots worked for her; she had run a family, a business and been part of the original Junta; the Sandinistas blocked payment of funds to her from the US while simultaneously claiming she received them; and she had long been vocal about her displeasure of US involvement in Nicaragua. According to Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa; Humberto Belli, an editor of La Prensa and later Minister of Education; and other writers such as Edward Sheehan and Shirley Christian who have written about the country, Nicaragua {{is one of the most}} religious countries in Latin America. Chamorro's faith and support for free expression united those who had felt alienated by the Sandinistas. Her chief appeal though was that she promised peace to a country tired of war.

500|$|Their playing {{schedule}} at the Kaiserkeller {{remained the}} same as {{it had been in the}} Indra. Lennon said: [...] "We had to play for hours and hours on end. Every song lasted twenty minutes and had twenty solos in it. That's what improved the playing. There was nobody to copy from. We played what we liked best and the Germans liked it as long as it was loud." [...] The Beatles had been used to simply standing still when they had performed in Liverpool, but Koschmider would come to the front of the stage and loudly shout “Mach schau, mach schau!” ("make [...] show" [...] or, more idiomatically, [...] "put on a show" [...] for the customers). Harrison explained that this prompted Lennon to “dance <b>around</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gorilla, and we’d all knock our heads together.” As Best had been the only one to take O-Level German at school, he could communicate with Koschmider and the clientele better than the rest of the group, and was invited to sing a speciality number called [...] "Peppermint Twist" [...] (while McCartney played the drums) but Best complained that he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage. Willie Limpinski, Koschmider's business manager, decided that the club would attract more customers if it presented continuous live music.|$|E
