40|$|This paper {{describes}} the analytical and numerical methods adopted {{in developing a}} program for modeling wave and current forces on slender offshore structural members. Two common wave theories have been implemented in the present study, namely <b>Airy</b> <b>s</b> linear <b>theory</b> and Stokes fifth order theory, based on their attractiveness for engineering use. The program is able to consider wind drift and tidal currents by simply adding the current velocity to the water velocity caused by the waves. The Morison equation was used for converting the velocity and acceleration terms into resultant forces and was extended to consider arbitrary orientations of the structural members. Furthermore, {{this program has been}} coupled to a 3 -D finite element code, which can analyze any offshore structure consisting of slender members. For calibration and for comparison purposes, the developed program were checked against a commercial software package called Structural Analysis Computer System (SACS). From the simulations of wave loading and structural analysis on few model tests, it can be concluded that the developed program are able to reproduce results from the model tests with satisfactory accuracy...|$|R

40|$|My {{thesis is}} an attempt to show the {{brilliance}} and novelty of John Dewey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> of knowledge, instrumentalism. The main objective of my thesis is to explain Dewey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> of knowledge, which he coined instrumentalism, and to describe how instrumentalism as a theory of knowledge overcomes the pitfalls of competing theories within the philosophical tradition. Dewey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> of instrumentalism does not assume that ideas are mental entities nor that ideas are true if they somehow match or fit with the object in question; thus, Dewey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> presents a different view opposed to what we have usually called coherence, or correspondence theories of knowledge. Dewey also argued that consciousness and thinking are functions of a complex organism in transaction with its environment and thus consciousness is an instrumentality not a thing-in-itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} science is that of older {{theories}} being challenged and eventually being superseded by newer theories. The rationality of this process of scientific theory change is a central issue in contemporary philosophy of science. This paper aims to elucidate this topic by examining an episode {{in the history of}} medical science, namely the change from Galen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> of the movement of the heart and blood to Harvey’s theory of the circulation of the blood. In Part I the historical details include Galen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory,</b> the generation of Harvey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory,</b> Harvey 2 ̆ 7 s arguments for his theory, the reception of and arguments against Harvey’s theory, and the fate of Galen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory.</b> In Part II to elucidate the topic, the change from Galen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> to Harvey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> is assumed to be rational, and the ideas of Imre Lakatos and Thomas Kuhn are examined in turn {{to see if they can}} account for this rationality. It is argued that they cannot. In Part III a different conception, which does account for the rationality of this scientific theory change, is presented. One noteworthy consequence of this conception is that it provides an argument against the context of discovery/context of justification distinction as an adequate basis for understanding the rational process of scientific theory change...|$|R

40|$|A new questionnaire, the Maternal Mental State Input Inventory (MMSII) {{was created}} to measure mothers 2 ̆ 7 {{preferences}} for introducing and elaborating on mental states in conversation with their young children. In two studies, the questionnaire was given to mothers of young children, and the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> of mind (ToM) development was assessed with standard tasks. In both studies, the questionnaire exhibited good internal reliability, and significant correlations emerged between mothers 2 ̆ 7 self-reported preferences for elaborated, explanatory talk about the mental states and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> of mind performance. Further, mothers 2 ̆ 7 conversational preferences, {{as measured by the}} MMSII, were the best predictors of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> of mind development when relevant control variables were included in the analyses.

Two essential elements of Piaget 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory</b> regarding the developmental sequence of spatial abilities with age are nativism and constructivism. A forum in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers journal in 1997 on the mapping abilities of young children helped to distinguish the intrinsic duality of Piaget 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> developmental <b>theory</b> and its influence on the debate between Blaut and Downs/Liben. Both Blaut and Downs/Liben studied young children 2 ̆ 7 s ontogenetic development of mapping abilities, but they examined different aspects of Piaget 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theory.</b> On the basis of nativism, Blaut recognized that children can perform various mapping tasks regardless of age, and he insisted that children naturally possess mapping abilities, whereas Piaget implied that they could not. In contrast, on the basis of constructivism, Downs and his colleagues emphasized that children 2 ̆ 7 s mapping abilities are the effect of both direct and indirect learning experience, and they pointed out some deficiencies in Blaut 2 ̆ 7 s testing method.

This account of vision in terms of 2 ̆ 2 natural geometry 2 ̆ 2 was first introduced by Descartes and Malebranche.
