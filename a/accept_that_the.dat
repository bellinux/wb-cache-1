5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{universal}} agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. Life may also {{be said to be}} simply the characteristic state of organisms.|$|E
5|$|Lemaire {{noted the}} {{similarity}} of his Schlumbergera epiphylloides to a species first described as Epiphyllum truncatum by Adrian Hardy Haworth in 1819, but did not <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two species {{should be included in}} the same genus. In 1890, Karl Moritz Schumann created the new genus Zygocactus, transferring Epiphyllum truncatum to Zygocactus truncatus. Although he later placed it back in Epiphyllum, abandoning Zygocactus, the generic name Zygocactus continued to be widely used.|$|E
5|$|Thurstan {{refused to}} <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, was his superior, {{and did not}} help with William's consecration. The dispute between the two continued, and both archbishops carried their {{complaints}} in person to Rome twice. In 1126, Pope Honorius II ruled in favour of York. The pope based his decision {{on the fact that}} Canterbury's supporting documents had been forged.|$|E

5|$|That {{same day}} British {{forces in the}} Mediterranean carried out Churchill's orders by attacking Ottoman {{shipping}} off of the port of İzmir. That night at an Ottoman Cabinet meeting, the Grand Vizier's anti-war faction was forced to <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Empire was at war, {{and that there was}} little they could do to avoid conflict. The Russians declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November 1914. Admiral Andrei Eberhardt immediately ordered Russia's fleet to retaliate against the Ottomans for the raid. On 4 November, a Russian task force bombarded Zonguldak.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him {{in the days and weeks}} prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E
5|$|Wallace began {{investigating}} spiritualism in {{the summer}} of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at séances, he came to <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.|$|E

25|$|The latter {{situation}} is rarely applied, as the fielding side generally <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> batsman is being helpful in returning the ball.

25|$|Smuts could <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{reluctance}} towards {{union and}} development {{came down to}} a simple, God-fearing people, concerned at {{the effect of the}} influx of migrants and industry on their old pastoral ways.

25|$|The {{calculation}} adjusts {{only for}} the 1,000 tombs found in Jerusalem instead of the whole Jewish populace that lived in the area. This effectively assumes that Jesus family in NT did indeed have a family tomb and it was among the 1000 tombs found in Jerusalem area. There is no historical evidence for this assumption. Some experts, including archaeologist Amos Kloner (the one who excavated the tombs) do not <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poor family from Nazareth had a family tomb in Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, England had a {{disagreement}} with Scotland over a try that England had scored {{but that the}} referee disallowed citing a foul by Scotland. England argued that the referee should have played advantage and that, as they made the Law, if {{they said it was}} a try then it was. The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was formed by Scotland, Ireland and Wales in 1886; but England refused to join, since they believed that they should have greater representation on the board because they had a greater number of clubs. They also refused to <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> IRFB should be the recognised law maker of the game. The IRFB agreed that the member countries would not play England until the RFU agreed to join and <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> IRFB would oversee the games between the home unions. England finally agreed to join in 1890. In 1930, it was agreed between the members that all future matches would be played under the laws of the IRFB. In 1997, the IRFB moved its headquarters from London to Dublin and a year later it changed its name to the International Rugby Board (IRB); in 2014, it changed its name again to the current World Rugby (WR).|$|E
25|$|Alms are {{the fruits}} of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and {{of a notion of}} sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of {{happiness}} and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.|$|E
25|$|When Falcone's {{record of}} success and {{high-profile}} led to resentment from some quarters, he was not given the job he coveted as chief prosecutor in Palermo. The new incumbent did not <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hierarchical Mafia structure revealed by the Maxi Trial actually existed, and he attempted to force Falcone to work on cases of wife beating and car theft. Falcone became so frustrated that he spoke of resigning. During 1988 Falcone collaborated with Rudolph Giuliani, at the time U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in operations against the Gambino and Inzerillo families. Rumours impugning his integrity deeply troubled Falcone during this period.|$|E
