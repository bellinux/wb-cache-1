5|$|Animals {{are raised}} {{for a wide}} variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also {{including}} tallow, isinglass and rennet. Animals are also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and <b>antiserum</b> (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called <b>antiserum.</b> Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in egg yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E

25|$|Hemagglutination assay. In {{generating}} {{an immune}} {{response to an}} antigen, the B-cells go {{through a process of}} maturation, from surface IgM production, to serum IgM production, to maturation into a plasma cell producing IgG. Graft recipients who generate an immune response have both IgM and IgG. The IgM can be used directly in hemagglutination assays, depicted on the right. IgM has 10 antigen binding regions per molecule, allowing cross-linking of cells. An <b>antiserum</b> specific for HLA-A3 will then agglutinate HLA-A3 bearing red blood cells if the concentration of IgM in the <b>antiserum</b> is sufficiently high. Alternatively, a second antibody to the invariable (Fc) region of the IgG can be used to cross-link antibodies on different cells, causing agglutination.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{diagnosis}} {{has been}} done by culturing on sorbitol-MacConkey medium and then using typing <b>antiserum.</b> However, current latex assays and some typing antisera have shown cross reactions with non-E. coli O157 colonies. Furthermore, not all E. coli O157 strains associated with HUS are nonsorbitol fermentors.|$|E
25|$|Temporary {{immunity}} {{to a specific}} infection can be induced in a subject by providing the subject with externally produced immune molecules, known as antibodies or immunoglobulins. This was first performed (and is still sometimes performed) by taking blood from a subject who is already immune, isolating the fraction of the blood which contains antibodies (known as the serum), and injecting this serum into the person for whom immunity is desired. This is known as passive immunity, and the serum that is isolated from one subject and injected into another is sometimes called <b>antiserum.</b> <b>Antiserum</b> from other mammals, notably horses, {{has been used in}} humans with generally good and often life-saving results, but there is some risk of anaphylactic shock and even death from this procedure because the human body sometimes recognizes antibodies from other animals as foreign proteins.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{treatment}} for tick paralysis is the careful administration of anti-tick serum. The effectiveness of anti-tick serum is most dependent on how early it is administered. Early treatment {{offers the best}} chance of full recovery. Unlike snake bite, tick envenoming has a relatively slow onset. Despite this slow onset the fatality rate can be very high (even higher than snake bite) if <b>antiserum</b> is not given sufficiently early, before the signs are advanced.|$|E
25|$|Present {{vaccination}} {{strategies for}} SIV {{control and prevention}} in swine farms typically {{include the use of}} one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with <b>antiserum</b> to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{immunity}} is {{the transfer}} of active humoral immunity {{in the form of}} ready-made antibodies. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta, and it can also be induced artificially, when high levels of antibodies specific to a pathogen or toxin (obtained from humans, horses, or other animals) are transferred to non-immune persons through blood products that contain antibodies, such as in immunoglobulin therapy or <b>antiserum</b> therapy. Passive immunization is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or immunosuppressive diseases. Passive immunization can be provided when people cannot synthesize antibodies, and when they have been exposed to a disease {{that they do not have}} immunity against.|$|E
25|$|Doctors at Royaumont also {{undertook}} cutting-edge research, {{focusing on}} the treatment of gas gangrene. The doctors found X-ray and bacteriology for diagnosis and surgical debridement of affected tissue and <b>antiserum</b> therapy to be especially effective. Doctors at the facility believed the collaboration of different specialties was important in fighting infection and avoiding excess amputations. The hospital had a mobile X-ray car manufactured by Austins and purchased for £300. Installation of the X-ray equipment was assisted by Marie Curie and included water and electrical sources independent {{of the rest of}} the facility. The X-ray car was highly coveted; other hospitals in the area occasionally utilized it and the British military attempted to impound and keep the car for itself. In spite of their work, Dr. Ivans was restricted in her ability to publish and present her results. In 1918 she had to obtain permission from General Célestin Sieur of the French military medical services to publish her results, and she was not allowed to present her work directly to the Société de Chirurgie de Paris, her work being instead presented by a third party.|$|E

[...] Biochemical studies showed that the <b>antiserum</b> recognized a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with a core glycoprotein of 300 kDa, and the antigen was named NG2 (nerve/glial antigen 2). [...] NG2 {{was found to be}} expressed on A2B5+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells isolated from the perinatal rat CNS tissues and on process-bearing cells in the CNS in vivo. [...] Comparison of NG2 and Pdgfra expression revealed that NG2 and Pdgfra are expressed on the same population of cells in the CNS.

2500|$|The {{era of the}} {{pharmaceutical}} industry began {{in the last decade}} of the 19th century when the manufacturing of acetylsalicylic acidmore commonly referred to as aspirinin Germany was started by Bayer. By 1910 Paul Ehrlich and his laboratory group began developing arsenic-based arsphenamine, (Salvarsan), as the first effective medicinal treatment of syphilis, and thereby initiated the medical practice of chemotherapy. Ehrlich popularized the concepts of [...] "magic bullet" [...] drugs and of systematically improving drug therapies. His laboratory made decisive contributions to developing <b>antiserum</b> for diphtheria and standardizing therapeutic serums.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the tables}} a fortuitous {{transplant}} between two unrelated individual {{has resulted in}} an <b>antiserum</b> to single alloantigen.

On the left the [...] "B" [...] and [...] "cw" [...] antigens are matched (B and C are close together so if B matches then C likely also matches), but A antigens are not matched. The antisera that is produced by the recipient {{is most likely to}} be A3, but if the direction of transplant is reversed A2 is the likely alloantigen. Two of the first three alloantigens are thus readily easy to detect because of the similarity and frequency of the A2-B7 and A3-B7 haplotypes (see example 1).|$|E

50|$|This assay may be {{modified}} to include the addition of an <b>antiserum.</b> By using a standard amount of virus, a standard amount of blood cells, and serially diluting the <b>antiserum,</b> one can identify the concentration of the <b>antiserum</b> (the greatest dilution which inhibits hemagglutination).|$|E
5000|$|Antibodies in the <b>antiserum</b> {{bind the}} {{infectious}} agent or antigen. The immune system then recognizes foreign agents bound to antibodies and triggers a more robust immune response. The use of <b>antiserum</b> is particularly effective against pathogens which {{are capable of}} evading the immune system in the unstimulated state but which are not robust enough to evade the stimulated immune system. The existence of antibodies to the agent therefore depends on an initial [...] "lucky survivor" [...] whose immune system by chance discovered a counteragent to the pathogen, or a [...] "host species" [...] which carries the pathogen, but does not suffer from its effects. [...] Further stocks of <b>antiserum</b> can then be produced from the initial donor or from a donor organism that is inoculated with the pathogen and cured by some stock of preexisting <b>antiserum.</b> Diluted snake venom is often used as an <b>antiserum</b> to give a passive immunity to the snake bite itself.|$|E

50|$|However, some {{antibodies}} {{found in}} <b>antiserum</b> are cross-reactive. This {{means that they}} bind antigens that have no apparent relationship to the immunogen, and are problematic when <b>antiserum</b> is used to detect antigens that bind specifically to these antibodies. This can be resolved by absorption of these antibodies with their cross-reactive antigen, leaving only the antibodies that are specific to the immunogen of interest.|$|E

She developed an improved <b>antiserum</b> for the disease; by combining <b>antiserum</b> therapy with the use of sulfa drugs, and developing standardized techniques for diagnosis and treatment, she and her associate Grace Leidy helped reduce the mortality rate from Hib from nearly 100 percent to less than 25 percent. Later, Alexander and Leidy studied the effect of antibiotics on Hib, finding streptomycin to be highly effective. The combined use of the <b>antiserum,</b> sulfa drugs, and antibiotics significantly lowered the mortality rate from Hib.|$|E
