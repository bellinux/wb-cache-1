5|$|After {{the riders}} left Huy, Team Sky {{came to the}} front of the peloton with Peter Kennaugh; his riding <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bunch reduced the gap to under five minutes. Honig and Teunissen were dropped from the leading group on the second climb of the Côte de Bellaire. Katusha and Movistar were joined <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peloton by Etixx-Quick Step as the race {{returned}} towards Huy.|$|E
5|$|In the legion, the velites were {{attached}} to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They usually formed up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legion before battle to harass the enemy with javelin throws and to prevent the enemy doing the same before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier infantry to attack. After they had fallen back, they would move up behind the attacking troops and throw darts at the enemy. They also sometimes carried wounded back to the rear, however usually a corps of deportates did this. In a pitched battle, the velites would form up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legion and cover the advance of the hastati, who were armed with swords. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back and let the principes, similarly equipped though more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes failed, they would retire behind the triarii, well trained, heavily armoured, spear armed legionaries and let them attack.|$|E

5|$|A christening ewer and basin {{made by the}} Garrard&Co. founder George Wickes in 1735 {{were used}} at the christening of the future GeorgeIII in 1738. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, had been banished from the royal court by GeorgeII and was {{forbidden}} to use the CharlesII Font. An inscription <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ewer records its use at the christening of GeorgeIII's son, Prince Alfred, in 1780. The handle of the ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising the triumph of virtue over vice.|$|E

He {{was the best}} of a five-rider {{breakaway}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, one which included teammate Taaramäe. That same day, Gallopin took sixth in a sprint finish to the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan. The team's last race of the early season was Halle–Ingooigem in June, where Sijmens rode to ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Gorgosaurus {{teeth were}} typical of all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary teeth <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout were {{smaller than the}} rest, closely packed and D-shaped in cross section. In Gorgosaurus, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth. The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section, rather than blade-like as in most other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30maxillary teeth and 30 to 34teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This number of teeth is similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus but is fewer than those of Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

5|$|In January 2008, the Gold Coast City Council {{released}} {{plans for}} a Mack Rides Water Coaster at Sea World. The ride would have been located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, with the ride's station situated where the Penguin Encounter exhibit exists and the main track extending out and over the car park. These plans were shelved. In December 2008, Sea World opened Jet Rescue, an Intamin JetSki Coaster.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E

5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. The principes stood in the second battle line, behind hastati of the first line {{and in front of}} the triarii in the third. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin armed light infantry would form up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati, light spearmen.|$|E
5|$|Kiplagat, who {{was ever}} present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women's race, outdid Ethiopian Dire Tune {{in the last}} {{kilometre}} to win her second gold medal on the global stage. Mirroring Kitwara, Kenya's women's bronze medallist Peninah Jerop Arusei secured the team's victory over Ethiopia. Representing the hosts, Zhu Xiaolin was the only non-African {{to reach the top}} eight at the championships. The joint effort of the Japanese women aided them to a sixth consecutive team bronze medal – making them the only medalling country outside the typically strong African triumvirate of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea.|$|E
5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun {{in the opposite direction}} to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
