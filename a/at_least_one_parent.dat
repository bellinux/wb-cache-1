40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies of adoptees {{have the}} {{potential}} to disentangle the contributions of genetic versus family environmental factors in the familiar transmission of coronary heart disease (CHD) because adoptees do not share the same family environment as their biological parents. The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to examine the risk of CHD in adopted men and women with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> biological <b>parent</b> with CHD and (2) to examine the risk of CHD in adopted men and women with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> adoptive <b>parent</b> with CHD. METHODS: The Swedish Multigenerational register was used to follow all Swedish-born adoptees (born in or after 1932, n = 80, 214) between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 2008, for CHD. The risk of CHD was estimated in adopted men and women with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> biological <b>parent</b> with CHD and adopted men and women with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> adoptive <b>parent</b> with CHD. The control groups consisted of adopted men or women without a biological parent with CHD or adopted men or women without an adoptive parent with CHD. RESULTS: Adopted men and women with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> biological <b>parent</b> with CHD (n = 749) were 1. 4 to 1. 6 times (statistically significant, 95 % CI) more likely to have CHD than adoptees without a biological parent with CHD. In contrast, men and women with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> adoptive <b>parent</b> with CHD (n = 1, 009) were not at increased risk of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: These findings (based on validated hospital diagnoses unbiased by recall) suggest that the familiar transmission of CHD from parents to offspring is more related to genetic factors than to family environmental factors...|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>parent</b> due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible {{for the care of}} their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E

The two sentences did not run concurrently. Rather, Jackson initially served prison time and upon his release, his wife was to begin her prison sentence shortly thereafter.

5|$|The Greek Town Riot in 1909 flared after {{increased}} Greek immigration, Greeks' {{working as}} strikebreakers, and {{the killing of}} an Irish policeman provoked violence among earlier immigrants such as ethnic Irish. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or had <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>parent</b> born outside of America. Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a Mexican immigrant named Juan Gonzalez {{was killed by a}} mob near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer was investigating a criminal operation selling goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. Afterward it was discovered that Gonzalez was unarmed, and that he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. Nobody was ever indicted for his killing. In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of blacks as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.|$|E
