40|$|A decting {{system of}} the {{velocity}} of moving pattern is constructed by using the spatial filter with-out mechanical parts. The filter is composed of optical fibers associated with phototransistors and electrical <b>analogue</b> <b>gate</b> circuits. The movement of the window is carried out by supplying {{the pulse of the}} rectangular form to the <b>analogue</b> <b>gate</b> circuits. The accuracy of the measurement with this method is discussed theoretically. It is shown that the present method is not so inferior to the mechanical one in accuracy of the measurement (within 3 %). The observed velocity is linearly changed with increasing the velocity of the moving patterns in the range of 0. 01 m/sec∿ 5 m/sec. From these values, the constructed system is avairable for practical usage...|$|E
40|$|The first {{codes of}} the Internet made their {{tentative}} steps along {{the information highway}} in 1969, connecting two computers at UCLA. Since that time, the Internet has grown beyond institutions of research and scholarship. It is now a venue for commerce, popular culture and political discourse. The last decade, following {{the development of the}} World Wide Web, has seen access to the Internet, particularly in wealthy countries such as Australia, spread throughout the majority of the population. While this proliferation of users has created many opportunities, it also profiled questions of disadvantage. The development and continuation of a digital divide between the information 'haves' and 'have nots' was framed as a problem of 'access. ' In the context of the increasing population online, debates into social inequity have been directed at technical barriers to access, the physical infrastructure and economic impediments to the adoption of the medium by all members of society. This doctoral research probes questions of access with greater subtlety, arching beyond the spread of broadband or the expansion of computers into schools. Forging dialogues between Internet and Cultural Studies, new theories of the screen - as a barrier and border - emerge. It is an appropriate time for such a study. The (seemingly) ever expanding growth in Internet access is stalling. New approaches are required to not only understand the pattern of events, but the type and mode of intervention that is possible. This doctoral research takes theory, politics and policy to the next stage in the history of digital access. By forging interdisciplinary dialogues, the goal is to develop the concept of 'cultware'. This term, building on the history of hardware, software and wetware, demonstrates the imperative of understanding context in the framing and forging of exclusion and disempowerment. Mobilising the insights of postcolonial theory, Popular Cultural Studies, literacy theory and socio-legal studies, a new network of exclusions emerge that require a broader palette of interventionary strategies than can be solved through infrastructure or freeing codes. Commencing with the Universal Service Obligation, and probing the meaning of each term in this phrase and policy, there is a discussion of networks and 'gates' of the Digital Empire. Discussions then follow of citizenship, sovereignty, nationalism and the subaltern. By applying the insights of intellectual culture from the analogue age, there is not only an emphasis on the continuities between 'old' and 'new' media, but a confirmation of how a focus on 'the new' can mask the profound perpetuation of analogue injustices. Access to the Invisible Empire occurs for each individual in a solitary fashion. Alone at the screen, each person is atomised at the point where they interface with the digital. This thesis dissects that point of access. The three components of access at the screen - hardware, software and wetware - intersect and dialogue. All three components form a matrix of access. However, the ability to attain hardware, software and wetware are distinct. An awareness of how and where to attain these literacies requires the activation of cultware, {{the context in which the}} three components manifest. Without such an intersection, access is not possible. The size of the overlap determines the scale of the gateway and the value of access. There is an interaction between each of these components that can alter both the value of the access obtained and the point at which the gateway becomes viable and stable for entry into the digital discourse. A highly proficient user with developed wetware is able to extract more value, capital and currency from hardware and software. They have expert knowledge in the use of this medium in contrast to a novice user. In dissecting the complexity of access, my original contribution to knowledge is developing this concept of cultware and confirming its value in explaining digital inequalities. This thesis diagnoses the nodes and structures of digital and analogue inequality. Critical and interpretative Internet Studies, inflected and informed by Cultural Studies approaches and theories, offers methods for intervention, providing contextual understanding of the manifestations of power and social justice in a digital environment. In enacting this project, familiar tropes and theories from Cultural Studies are deployed. Particular attention is placed on the insights of postcolonial theorists. The Invisible Empire, following the path of the digital intellectual, seeks to act as a translator between the digital subaltern and the digital citizen. Similarly, it seeks to apply pre-existing off screen theory and methodology to the Invisible Empire, illuminating how these theories can be reapplied to the digitised environment. Within this context, my research provides a significant and original contribution to knowledge in this field. The majority of analyses in critical and interpretative Internet Studies have centred on the United States and Europe. While correlations can be drawn from these studies, there are features unique to the Australian environment, both socially and culturally, as well as physical factors such as the geographic separation and sparse distribution of the population, that limit the ability to translate these previous findings into an Australian context. The writer, as a white Australian, is liminally positioned in the colonial equation: being a citizen of a (formerly) colonised nation with the relics of Empire littering the symbolic landscape, while also - through presence and language - perpetuating the colonization of the Indigenous peoples. This 'in-betweenness' adds discomfort, texture and movement to the research, which is a fundamentally appropriate state to understand the gentle confluences between the digital and analogue. In this context, the screen is the gateway to the Invisible Empire. However, unlike the <b>analogue</b> <b>gate</b> in the city wall that guards a physical core, these gates guard a non-corporeal Invisible Empire. Whereas barbarians could storm the gates of Rome without the literacy to understand the workings of the Empire within, when an army masses to physically strike at these gates, the only consequences are a broken monitor. Questions cannot be asked at the gate to an Invisible Empire. There is no common space in which the digital subaltern and the digital citizen cohabitate. There is no node at which translation can occur. These gates to the Invisible Empire are numerous. The walls cannot be breached and the gates are only open for the citizenry with the required literacy. This literacy in the codes of access is an absolute requirement to pass the gates of Invisible Empire. The digital citizen transverses these gates alone. It is a point where the off screen self interfaces the digital self. Social interaction occurs on either side of the screen, but not at the gateway itself. Resistance within the borders of Invisible Empire is one of the founding ideologies of the Internet, tracing its origin back to the cyberpunk literature that predicted the rise of the network. However this was a resistance to authority, both on and off screen, by the highly literate on screen: the hacker and the cyber-jockey. This thesis addresses resistance to the Invisible Empire from outside its borders. Such an intervention is activated not through a Luddite rejection of technology, but by examining the conditions at the periphery of Empire, the impacts of digital colonisation, and how this potential exclusion can be overcome. Debates around digital literacy have been deliberately removed or bypassed to narrow the debate about the future of the digital environment to a focus on the material commodities necessary to gain access and the potential for more online consumers. Cultware has been neglected. The Invisible Empire, like its analogue predecessors, reaches across the borders of Nation States, as well as snaking invisibly through and between the analogue population, threatening and breaking down previous understandings of citizenship and sovereignty. It invokes new forms of core-periphery relations, a new type of digital colonialism. As the spread of Internet access tapers, and the borders of Empire close to those caught outside, the condition of the digital subaltern calls for outside intervention, the place of the intellectual to raise consciousness of these new colonial relations, both at the core and periphery.

40|$|Silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) {{have emerged}} as novel {{cryptographic}} primitives {{with the ability to}} generate unique chip identifiers and cryptographic keys by exploiting intrinsic manufacturing process variations. “Two Choose One” PUF (TCO-PUF) is a new PUF that has been recently proposed to exploit the non-linear relationship of current and voltage in the subthreshold operating region, hence increase the security against modeling-based attacks. However, as CMOS technology scales down, aging-induced Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is becoming more pronounced resulted in reliability issue of PUF response. In this study, we investigate the robustness of <b>analogue</b> and logic <b>gates</b> based differential architectures known as TCO-PUF and Arbiter-PUF under influence of NBTI. In comparison against NBTI, particularly RO-PUF and SRAMPUF, the reliability of TCO-PUF and Arbiter-PUF are shown to be more robust to aging-induced degradation. TCO-PUF and Arbiter-PUF only degrade by about 4. 5 % and 2. 41 % respectively after 10 years, while RO-PUFs and SRAM-PUFs degrade by about 12. 76 % in ten years and 7 % in 4. 5 years, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Network {{security}} checking {{is a vital}} {{process to}} assess and to identify weaknesses in network for management of security. Insecure entry points of a network provide attackers an easy target to access and compromise. Open ports of network components such as firewalls, gateways and end systems are <b>analogues</b> to open <b>gates</b> of a building through which any one can get into. Network scanning is performed to identify insecure entry points in the network components. To find out vulnerabilities on these points vulnerability assessment is performed. So security checking consists of both activities- network scanning as well as vulnerability assessment. A single tool used for the security checking may not give reliable results. This paper presents a framework for assessing {{the security of a}} network using multiple Network Scanning and Vulnerability Assessment tools. The proposed framework is an extension of the framework given by Jun Yoon and Wontae Sim [1] which performs vulnerability scanning only. The framework presented here adds network scanning, alerting and reporting system to their framework. Network scanning and vulnerability tools together complement each other and make it amenable for centralized control and management. The reporting system of framework sends an email to the network administrator which contains detailed report (as attachment) of security checking process. Alerting system sends a SMS message as an alert to the network administrator in case of severe threats found in the network. Initial results of the framework are encouraging and further work is in progress...|$|R
40|$|Optical techniques, {{which have}} been widely used in various fields {{including}} bio-medicine, remote sensing, astronomy, and industrial production, {{play an important role in}} modern life. Optical focusing and imaging, which correspond to the basic methods of utilizing light, are key to the implementation of optical techniques. In free space or a nearly transparent medium, optical imaging and focusing can be easily realized by using conventional optical elements, such as lenses and mirrors, due to the ballistic propagation of light in these media. However, in scattering media like biological tissue and fog, refractive index inhomogeneities cause diffusive propagation of light that increases with depth, which restricts the use of optical methods in thick, scattering media. Generally speaking, scattering media poses three challenges to optical focusing and imaging: wavefront aberrations, glare, and decorrelation. Wavefront aberrations can randomize light traveling through a scattering medium, disrupt the formation of focus, and break the conjugate relation in imaging. Glare caused by backscattering will largely impair the visibility of imaging, and decorrelation in dynamic media requires systems that counter the effect of scattering to operate faster than the decorrelation time. In this thesis, we explored solutions to the problem of scattering from different aspects. We presented Time Reversal by Analysis of Changing wavefronts from Kinetic targets (TRACK) technique to realize noninvasive optical focusing through a scattering medium. We showed that by taking the difference between time-varying scattering fields caused by a moving object and applying optical phase conjugation, light can be focused back to the location previously occupied by the object. To tackle the decorrelation of living tissue, we built up a fast digital optical phase conjugation (DOPC) system based on FPGA and DMD, which has a response time of 5. 3 ms and was the fastest DOPC system in the world before 2017. We demonstrated that the system is fast enough to focus light through 2. 3 mm-thick living mouse skin. As for glare, inspired by noise canceling headphones, we invented an optical <b>analogue</b> termed coherence <b>gated</b> negation (CGN) technique. CGN can optically cancel out the glare in an active illumination imaging scenario to realize imaging through scattering media, like fog. In the experiment, we suppressed the glare by an order of magnitude and allowed improved imaging of a weak target. Finally, we demonstrated a method to image a moving target through scattering media noninvasively. Its principle roots are in the speckle-correlation-based imaging (SCI) invented by Ori Katz. We improved the technique and extended its application to bright field imaging of a moving target. </p...|$|R
