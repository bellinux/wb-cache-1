5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be impossible for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them <b>all</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the planned genocide.|$|E
5|$|The Laycoe {{incident}} was Richard's second altercation with an official that season, after having slapped a linesman {{in the face}} in Toronto the previous December, {{for which he was}} fined $250.

5|$|By 1940, Jinnah {{had come}} to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, {{demanding}} a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading <b>all</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|Penn National wanted Rosecroft {{to begin}} {{simulcasting}} races in late August 2011. Disputes between tracks and simulcasters about revenues, however, {{led to a}} delay in reaching new agreements on broadcast rights. In the 2011, the Maryland legislature passed a bill that required <b>all</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> enter into mediation. If mediation was not successful by October 1, 2011, then an arbitrator was required to help. To resolve a conflict of interest, Penn National sold its financial stake in the Maryland Jockey Club's in July 2011. In August 2011, Rosecroft made public its plans for adding a casino at Rosecroft. It planned to destroy the grandstand and build a casino with approximately 4,700 slot machines alongside the track.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the WIPO case Glynnis MacNicol of Mediaite commented that those including Glenn Beck afforded freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment must allow for an Internet environment with the same rights given to everyone. Brayton of ScienceBlogs pointed out that Beck and his lawyers never replied to Randazza's request for <b>all</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in the case. Brayton observed that this was irrelevant as Beck's case was weak even when examined under the standards of the UN agency. Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after {{the conclusion}} of the case he commented that this was a wise strategic move. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post remarked upon {{the conclusion of}} the case that the division between what is considered libel and satire was murky, and asked whether this determination was more difficult to make on the Internet where speech can be amplified by others.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{performed}} a few ceremonial functions {{for the remainder}} of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson's communications and deciding what he would be presented with and what she would delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that <b>all</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.|$|E

25|$|In the Middle Ages, the {{majority}} of seals were pendent. They were attached both to legal instruments and to letters patent (i.e. open letters) conferring rights or privileges, which were intended to be available for all to view. In the case of important transactions or agreements, the seals of <b>all</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the arrangement {{as well as of}} witnesses might be attached to the document, and so once executed it would carry several seals. Most governments still attach pendent seals to letters patent.|$|E
25|$|With the {{invention}} of agriculture, humans were able to clear sections of rainforest to produce crops, converting it to open farmland. Such people, however, obtain their food primarily from farm plots cleared from the forest and hunt and forage within the forest to supplement this.

This issue has seen little improvement because no plan has been established for <b>all</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> be aided.|$|E
