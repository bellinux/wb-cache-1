40|$|Antibiotic/Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is a {{terminology used}} to describe immunity to an antibiotic. When <b>a</b> <b>bacteria</b> becomes antibiotic resistant, it means the antibiotic attributed to killing it, no longer has an effect. This immunity can be gained by <b>a</b> <b>bacteria</b> coming into direct contact with an antibiotic, with the frequency of contact often determining the rate of resistance. Also by <b>a</b> <b>bacteria</b> joining to <b>an</b> antibiotic resistant strain, genetic material can be transferred, including immunity, to give them both resistance (Burmeister, 2015) ...|$|R

5|$|Different AtPeps {{may allow}} A. thaliana to {{distinguish}} between different pathogens. When inoculated with a fungus, oomycete and <b>a</b> <b>bacterium,</b> the increases in AtPep expression varied depending on the pathogen.

5|$|To develop {{resistance}} to RNAi, the {{western corn rootworm}} would {{have to change the}} genetic sequence of its Snf7 gene at multiple sites. Combining multiple strategies, such as engineering the protein Cry, derived from <b>a</b> <b>bacterium</b> called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and RNAi in one plant delay the onset of resistance.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with <b>a</b> <b>bacterium</b> called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{nomenclature}} of monoclonal antibodies is a naming {{scheme for}} assigning generic, or nonproprietary, names to monoclonal antibodies. An antibody is a protein that {{is produced in}} B cells and used by the immune system of humans and other vertebrate animals to identify a specific foreign object like <b>a</b> <b>bacterium</b> or a virus. Monoclonal antibodies are those that were produced in identical cells, often artificially, and so share the same target object. They have {{a wide range of}} applications including medical uses.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or weight) {{increase}} with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. He shows {{in a few short}} equations that the speed of a fish or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than <b>a</b> <b>bacterium</b> is essentially impossible.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to <b>a</b> <b>bacterium,</b> then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

5|$|Thermus aquaticus is <b>a</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{found in}} the Yellowstone hot springs that {{produces}} an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Transformation, unlike {{transduction}} or conjugation, {{depends on}} numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. In order for <b>a</b> <b>bacterium</b> to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA {{into its own}} chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required {{for the development of}} competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.|$|E
5|$|For some years, {{the cause}} of the disease was unknown, and {{hypotheses}} included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey Department had a native plant nursery at Taupo in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was <b>a</b> <b>bacterium</b> Phytoplasma australiense, which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that peptic ulcer disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, <b>a</b> <b>bacterium</b> with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E
