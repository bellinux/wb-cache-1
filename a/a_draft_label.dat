25|$|A {{total of}} five scripts were written as Romero {{wrestled}} with the film's concepts and the budgetary constraints. The first draft was over 200 pages, which he later condensed to 122 pages. This is the true original script, and to date no copies of it have come to light. This version was likely rejected because UFDC felt it was too expensive for them to produce even with an R rating. Romero subsequently scaled down {{the scope of this}} script into <b>a</b> 165-page <b>draft</b> (often erroneously referred to as the original version), then condensed it again to <b>a</b> 104-page <b>draft</b> <b>labeled</b> the 'second version, second draft' in an unsuccessful final attempt to get the story within budget parameters. When this failed, he drastically altered the original story concept and ultimately produced <b>a</b> shooting <b>draft</b> that numbered only 88 pages.|$|R

30|$|The {{mode shapes}} and {{frequencies}} for <b>an</b> individual <b>draft</b> pad and <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> gear {{have been obtained}} using finite element approach. It is seen that the mode shapes of <b>draft</b> pads in <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> gear are dominated by the first five modes (Fig.  3) of <b>an</b> individual <b>draft</b> pad. For these dominant mode shapes of <b>an</b> individual <b>draft</b> pad, different values of frequencies (Table  3) of the draft gear have been identified. These values are different than the various values of frequency obtained for an individual pad. These different values of frequency assumes significances as the draft gear is subjected to variable loading frequency due to acceleration and braking of the locomotive. Hence, a range of frequency values have been identified against which <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> pad must be tested for fatigue response. As per the schedule of technical requirements by Indian Railways [13], <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> pad is subjected to cyclic loading of 10  Hz for determining its fatigue behaviour. The values identified (Table  3) are greater than the existing value but have significance as {{the possibility that the}} frequency of cyclic load acting on the draft gear in actual operation will not exceed this specified value cannot be ruled out. The modal analysis thus gives us a basis for subjecting <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> pad to higher frequency loading for determining its fatigue behaviour.|$|R
