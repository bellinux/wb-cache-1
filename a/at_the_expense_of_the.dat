5|$|At Sampford Peverell two rectories {{were built}} in 1836, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Western Canal Company, in {{compensation}} for cutting through the grounds and demolishing the south wing of the Old Rectory.

5|$|Since taking power Xi has {{initiated}} the most concerted anti-corruption effort in decades, while centralizing {{powers in the}} office of CPC General Secretary <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective leadership which had led foreign commentators to liken him to Mao.|$|E

60|$|As long {{as there}} was any {{appearance}} of success, the spirit of aggrandizement, and consequently the spirit of mutual jealousy, seized upon all the coalesced powers. Some sought an accession <b>of</b> territory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> France, some <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> each other, some <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> third parties; and when the vicissitude of disaster took its turn, they found common distress a treacherous bond of faith and friendship.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the episode}} {{primarily}} mocks the Republican Party, the writers included several jokes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party, {{liberal and conservative}} politics, {{to try to be}} as neutral as possible. Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were very interested in the Watergate scandal and based a lot of the second act on that. Mark Kirkland directed the episode.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Genesis were {{suffering}} from press attention being exclusively directed towards frontman Gabriel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} band, a notable factor that ultimately led to Gabriel leaving the group in 1975. They took an extended break in 1974 following the Selling England by the Pound tour; Collins joined a side project, Brand X, while Rutherford worked with former Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips.|$|E
5|$|Disaster Management: Identification of true {{victims of}} {{disasters}} is often problematic {{because there are}} infiltrators who {{take advantage of the}} absence of credible identification system to benefit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected ones. Data on a persons Lebanese Identity Card is used to establish whether they live in an area affected by a disaster to enable them to receive relief items.|$|E
50|$|Some {{monitors}} {{are designed}} exclusively for gamers, featuring higher refresh rates and improved response times <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> a lower resolution. E-sports, or competitive gamers, often favor higher framerates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> reduced color accuracy, preferring TN panels over IPS panels.|$|R
60|$|Break {{was a more}} {{uncertain}} quantity. Sometimes {{he could}} get it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> pitch, sometimes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> pace.

50|$|For example, {{we should}} think of two {{countries}} that both make cards and pencils {{and use the}} same amount of time to make one unit of items (see table). Country one can make 4 pencils if they specialize just in pencils <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> one card, but this country can also make ¼ <b>of</b> a card <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> one pencil. <b>The</b> same logic goes for country two: if country two makes only pencils, it will make 2 pencils <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> 1 card.|$|R
5|$|Domitian also heavily prosecuted {{corruption}} among public officials, removing jurors if {{they accepted}} bribes and rescinding legislation when {{a conflict of}} interest was suspected. He ensured that libellous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for satire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government. Consequently, he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Somerset's {{successor}} John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, made Duke of Northumberland in 1551, {{was once}} regarded by historians {{merely as a}} grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown. Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, {{and he has been}} credited with restoring the authority of the royal Council and returning the government to an even keel after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the 1st and 2nd century AD the Wielbark culture {{expanded}} south, towards Greater Poland and Masovia, partially <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Przeworsk culture. Around the mid-1st century the Wielbark culture people forced out the Przeworsk population from northern Greater Poland and settled the area for about 150 years. The Przeworsk culture itself also expanded in the southern, eastern and south-western directions.|$|E

5000|$|For Khomyakov, {{socialism}} and capitalism were equally repugnant offspring of Western decadence. The West failed to solve human spiritual problems, as it stressed competition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> co-operation. In his own words, [...] "Rome kept unity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> freedom, while Protestants had freedom but lost unity".|$|R

5|$|Most other revolutionaries were {{detained}} {{in areas of}} present-day Bulgaria until spring 1849, and, passing through Rustchuk and Varna, {{were taken to the}} Anatolian city of Brusa, where they lived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman state. They were allowed to return after 1856. During their period of exile, rivalry between the various factions became obvious, a conflict which became the basis for political allegiances in later years.|$|E
5|$|Potter's own three-door oven, her hearthrug, her indoor plants, her {{coronation}} teapot, and {{her water}} pump are minutely detailed with more color {{than in other}} productions. The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the full page color illustrations, and the occasional lack of coordination between picture and text all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR)'s publication, the {{retirement}} of the entire Tornado fleet was under consideration, savings of £7.5billion were anticipated.

5|$|Ramsay {{named the}} shoe polish after the kiwi, the {{national}} bird of New Zealand; Ramsay's wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay, {{was a native}} of Oamaru, New Zealand.

5|$|The New Kingdom saw the Book of the Dead {{develop and}} spread further. The famous Spell 125, the 'Weighing of the Heart', is first {{known from the}} reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, c.1475 BCE. From this period onward the Book of the Dead was {{typically}} written on a papyrus scroll, and the text illustrated with vignettes. During the 19th dynasty in particular, the vignettes tended to be lavish, sometimes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding text.|$|E

Up to 60students from foreign countries are present at USMA, educated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sponsoring nation, with tuition assistance based on the GNP of their country.

5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.|$|E
5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
