The keel, badly damaged during the grounding, was {{completely}} renewed along a length of , and the owners {{took the opportunity to}} further strengthen the hull. The old keelsons were replaced and ten new ones laid, which ran {{the entire length of the}} keel. Both the bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double <b>angle</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{automobile}} was lightweight, {{a critical}} determinant in a well-performing car for that time, given the limited {{power of the}} engines available. Most Franklins were wood-framed, although the very first model in 1902 was constructed from an <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> frame. Beginning in 1928, the heavier Franklin models adopted a conventional pressed-steel frame.|$|E
25|$|Towers {{were built}} of {{numbered}} <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> sections with concrete footings. Some facilities used concrete arrows pointing {{in the direction}} of towers. In areas where no connection to a power grid was available, a generator was housed in a small building. Some buildings also served as weather stations. Many arrow markings were removed during World War II, to prevent aiding enemy bombers in navigation, while 19 updated beacons still remain in service in Montana.|$|E

50|$|The Coppergate Helmet, {{from the}} middle to late eighth century, {{was found in a}} Viking {{settlement}} in York, but the helmet itself was made by the <b>Angles.</b> <b>Iron</b> plates were used to construct the helmet bowl—iron cheek-pieces were hinged to the sides, and curtain of mail was attached {{at the back of the}} helmet for neck protection. The nasal plate, interlaced with engravings of animals, extended over the eyebrows and ended in small canine designs at the head. At the two helmet crests, there are Latin inscriptions praising the Christian Trinity.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} plans {{called for}} open anti-aircraft mounts, {{but the experience}} of the existing monitors in the first battles on the Danube against Serbia demonstrated that the mounts needed protection from small arms fire, so armoured barbettes were added. These modifications prevented the crew in the conning tower from viewing directly aft of the ship, so a [...] high rectangular platform was placed on top of the conning tower that afforded a view aft. To avoid any increase in her draught from these modifications, her hull was lengthened. Due to the urgent need for the ship to be put into service, the planned telescopic mast was not installed, and an alternative mast was constructed using <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> lattice. Enns was launched on 29 July 1914 and commissioned on 17 October 1914.|$|E
500|$|When drydocked in the New York Navy Yard for {{the first}} time after her trials several {{structural}} flaws came to light. The floors had buckled their brackets and the cement near the keel had cracked. Her floor brackets were reinforced with [...] <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> and the cement was repaired. But this raised issues regarding her structural integrity so a Board of Survey in January 1896 was formed to evaluate her condition and suggest improvements. The Board determined that further strengthening of her hull was needed, but the exact measures taken are not known, although they would cost $39,450 and take 100 working days. However, the Board wished to know what effect these changes would have on the draft, stability, and metacentric height of the Texas. The Board received a reply on 4 February that they would increase her displacement by , deepen her draft by less than [...] and raise her metacentric height to [...]|$|E
500|$|During her {{sea trials}} in November 1916 off the River Tyne, Courageous {{sustained}} structural damage while running {{at full speed}} in a rough head sea. The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret. In addition, the side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks. Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the vertical flange of the <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> securing the deck armour in place. The exact cause remains uncertain, but Courageous received [...] of stiffening in response; Glorious did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Courageous also was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917, but never actually laid any mines. In mid-1917 both ships received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs: one mount {{on each side of}} the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts {{on each side of the}} rear turret on the quarterdeck. Courageous and Glorious served together throughout the war. Both ships were initially assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and later reconstituted the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS).|$|E

25|$|The National Park Service {{chose to}} {{refinish}} the statues using brush electroplating. Workers discovered {{that because the}} interior of each pedestal was exposed to bare earth, excessive condensation built up inside the hollow statues. Additionally, the statues had not been completely seated on their plinths, and additional moisture worked its way inside through the poorly sealed joint. Extreme temperature changes (due to daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the bronze) and proximity to the river also led to extensive condensation inside the statures. Workers found the interior of each statue damp, even wet, and water pooled in every recess. The moisture build-up created tremendous galvanic corrosion inside the sculptures. The steel joint bolts were so extensively corroded that some had almost completely disintegrated, {{and many of the}} steel <b>angle</b> <b>irons</b> were close to failure. National Bureau of Standards workers believed all four statues {{were on the verge of}} structural collapse. The corrosion problem was worsened by the presence of gypsum. Gypsum was used to make the molds from which the bronze was cast. But the gypsum was never completely cleaned from the interior of the two The Arts of Peace statues, leading to additional corrosion in these pieces. The corrosion problems were solved by removing the steel bolts and <b>angle</b> <b>irons</b> and replacing them with bronze components, and by cleaning as much gypsum as possible from the statue interiors. More than 1,000 brass bolts were used in Music and Harvest and Aspiration and Literature alone.|$|R
60|$|The tubes were rectangular, {{with double}} {{top and bottom}} made of plates of wrought-iron, from three-eighths to three-quarters of an inch thick, and varying in length {{according}} to their position--the whole when put together forming a single tube about 500 yards long. The two centre ones were {{the largest and most}} difficult to manage, each having to be built on shore, floated off on barges, and lifted by hydraulic power a height of about 100 feet. Some idea of what this implied may be gathered from the following fact. Each tube weighed 1800 tons--the weight of a goodly-sized ocean steamer! A perfect army of men worked at the building of the tubes; cutting, punching, fitting, riveting, etcetera, and as the place became the temporary abode of so many artificers and labourers, with their wives and children, a village sprang up around them, with shops, a school, and a surgery. Two fire-engines and large tanks of water were kept in constant readiness in case of fire, and for many months rivet-making machines, punching machines, shearing machines, etcetera, were in full work. There were two million rivets used altogether, and the quantity of three-quarter-inch iron rod used in making them measured 126 miles. The total weight of iron used was nearly 12,000 tons. The bridge was strengthened by eighty-three miles of <b>angle</b> <b>iron.</b> For many months the outlay in wages alone was 6000 pounds a week, and the cost for the whole of the works more than 600,000 pounds. A curious fact connected with this enormous mass of iron is, that arrangements had to be made to permit of shrinkage and expansion. The tubes were placed on a series of rollers and iron balls, and it was afterwards found that in the hottest part of summer they were twelve inches longer than in winter--a difference which, if not provided for, would have caused the destruction of the towers by a constant and irresistible pull and thrust! The Menai Bridge was begun in 1846 and opened for traffic in March 1850.|$|E

50|$|Very narrow aisle {{otherwise}} known as VNA, {{is the use of}} selective pallet racking in a tighter configuration to provide maximum space utilization within a storage facility. These systems typically operate in conjunction with wire-guided or rail-guided reach-truck systems. A wire-guided system consists of a wire embedded in the concrete floor that provides tracking for the reach-truck. A rail-guided system consists of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> bolted to the floor down the length of each row. Typically, the <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> is 4” by 3” and ¼” - ⅜” inches thick. A distinct advantage of a narrow aisle pallet racking is fast picking without large aisles which results in improved use of space. When there is limited space, a compact storage method is ideal. Fully adjustable system flexibility and space saving aisles can be manipulated as one to give the greatest amount of pallet storage locations.|$|E
