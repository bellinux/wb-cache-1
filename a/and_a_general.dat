5|$|After the war the {{division}} was demobilised in 1919 before being re-raised in 1921 {{as part of}} the Citizen Forces, based in central Victoria. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, {{the division}}'s establishment fluctuated due to the effects of the Great Depression <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> apathy towards military matters.|$|E
5|$|With {{their record}} deal with Island Records {{coming to an}} end, the band signed a more lucrative {{extension}} in 1984. They negotiated {{the return of the}} copyrights of their songs, an increase in their royalty rate, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> improvement in terms, at the expense of a larger initial payment.|$|E

5|$|After making {{way to the}} {{submarine}} base at Brioni, U-41 set out on another patrol into the Mediterranean on 29 August, but put into Sebenico the next day for engine repairs. Resuming her patrol after a day's delay, U-41 reached her patrol area east of Malta. Wolf and U-41 scored their first success on 13 September, when they torpedoed and sank the steamer Amiral Charner west of Pantellaria. The 4,604-ton French ship was carrying horses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> cargo from Marseilles for Salonika when she was attacked. Six {{were killed in the}} attack on the French ship. On 26 September, U-41 attacked another steamer west of Kefalonia, but was apparently unsuccessful. U-41 ended her patrol at Cattaro on 28 September.|$|E
5|$|Another son, Albert Gallatin Edwards (1812–1892), was an {{assistant}} secretary of the U.S. Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln. In 1887 he founded the brokerage firm A. G. Edwards in Saint Louis, Missouri. A third son, Benjamin S. Edwards (1818–1886), established a successful law practice in Springfield, Illinois {{and served as a}} judge in Illinois' Thirteenth Circuit. Ninian Edwards' daughter, Julia Edwards Cook, married Congressman Daniel Pope Cook. Their son, John Pope Cook, was a mayor of Springfield <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> in the Union Army during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Children and infants may {{be unable}} to report being bitten, making it {{difficult}} to associate their symptoms with a spider bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing to feed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> erythematous rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are often seen in children over four years of age.|$|E

5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} {{the portion of the}} upper class which was willing {{to come to terms with}} at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the company}} {{experienced}} a 40% passenger growth, and from 6 September, Air Norway also introduced services on Wednesday. The same year, the municipality started a NOK1.8 million upgrade to the airport. When it opened on 3 September 2007, {{it became an}} international airport and allowed transit for passengers to Aalborg, plus increased security <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> renovation of the terminal building from 1978.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> {{election was}} called for 3 May. This led to a brief delay in {{the start of the}} trial as Thorpe, who still had a following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as their candidate in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to his Conservative opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E

5000|$|Australia-Germany {{relations}} are foreign relations between Australia and Germany. Germany has an embassy in Canberra <b>and</b> <b>a</b> consulate <b>general</b> in Sydney, {{as well as}} a number of honorary consulates throughout Australia.

5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal {{hearing to}} determine whether they should stand trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E
5|$|Its closest {{relatives}} may be O.concolor {{from the}} northern Amazon rainforest, including northwestern Brazil, southern Venezuela, and eastern Colombia, and O.mamorae from Bolivia, Paraguay, nearby Brazil, and possibly northeastern Argentina. The three share a particular configuration of the arteries in the head known as the derived carotid arterial circulatory pattern, which is unique within the genus Oecomys, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> similarity in other traits. However, O.sydandersoni differs from the other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters. Whether the three species are truly closely related needs to be determined using molecular data.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> lack of objectivity.|$|E

5|$|Ramanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is an {{orthodox}} Brahmin and a straightforward consumer protection advocate living in Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone {{to follow the}} law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence always seems to favour the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> lack of seriousness. Frustrated at his inability {{to bring about a}} change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter-ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga was {{the fifth}} US Navy ship named after the 1777 Battle of Saratoga, an {{important}} victory during the Revolutionary War. She was originally authorized in 1916 as a , but construction was placed on hold so that higher-priority anti-submarine vessels and merchant ships, needed to ensure the safe passage of men and materiel to Europe during Germany's U-boat campaign, could be built. After the war the ship was extensively redesigned to incorporate improved boiler technology, anti-torpedo bulges, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> increase in armor protection based on British wartime experiences. Given the hull number of CC-3, Saratoga was laid down on 25 September 1920 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.|$|E
5|$|Though {{originally}} set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to {{the genre}} of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes.|$|E
5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
