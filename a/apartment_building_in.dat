5|$|The 2010 Shanghai {{fire was}} a fire on 15 November 2010 that {{destroyed}} a 28-storey high-rise <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> the city of Shanghai, China, killing at least 58 people and injuring more than 70 others (with at least one source reporting more than 120 others injured).|$|E
5|$|At 1211 North LaSalle Street on the city's Near North Side, a 16-story {{apartment}} hotel {{built in}} 1929 and converted into an <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> 1981 {{was used by}} muralist Richard Haas for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to Chicago School architecture. One of the building's sides features the Chicago Board of Trade Building, intended {{as a reflection of}} the actual building two miles (3km) south.|$|E
5|$|In November 1955, {{while on}} the sick list for the 49ers due to a {{shoulder}} injury, Johnson carried two women to safety out of a blazing <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> Oakland, California. One of the women was his pregnant wife, Barbara Johnson. The couple divorced in 1959, and a bench warrant was issued for Johnson after he fell $2,360 behind on alimony payments, concurrent with his suspension from the Lions for missing the team plane. After retiring as a player, he worked for Columbia Gas and later for Warner Communications. He had aspirations of coaching football, but the opportunity never arose.|$|E

5|$|Los Angeles was {{extensively}} researched for the game. The team {{spent the}} first year of development researching Los Angeles by using newspapers and magazines, organising field research field trips, and capturing photographs. A total of 180,000 photographs were available as resources throughout development, and over 1,000 newspapers were used for research. Both the interior and exterior of multiple sets were the result of researched reference material. For example, the Barclay Hotel in Los Angeles was used as a reference point when modelling an <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> the game. However, some sets were originally designed, {{in order to meet the}} gameplay or the narrative script.|$|E
5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to {{the sidewalk}} outside the Rosencrantz <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor balcony along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that they seem to have fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E
5|$|Corzine, who {{was running}} for the United State Senate {{in the spring of}} 1999, met Carla Katz, the then married {{president}} of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), in the same apartment building where he resided in Hoboken; the CWA represents the largest number of state workers in New Jersey. As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer. Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) For more than two years Corzine was romantically involved and living with Katz. She lived with him at his <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> Hoboken from April 2002 until August 2004.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe {{recruited}} F.G. Walton Smith, a young British {{marine biologist}} {{who was working}} in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine laboratory. In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University. They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> Coral Gables, Florida near the main campus.|$|E
5|$|In early May 2012, five alleged {{members of}} the Abergil {{organization}} who were suspected of conspiring {{to commit a crime}} and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem, after police had found a weapons cache inside a storage room in an <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> Jerusalem where one of the suspects' parents live. According to the suspects, they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization. At the suspects’ homes police discovered signs of violence, including ceramic bulletproof vests with bullet holes in them. The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack. According to the suspects, they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident, who owed the organization money.|$|E
5|$|Other architects {{chose the}} era's simpler styles, like Arts and Crafts, as a contrast. The marble-and-brick 1905 YMCA {{building}} on Second Street, and the six-story Caldwell Apartments at State and Second streets {{are two of}} the district's best examples of that style. The latter building, built in 1907, was also the first large-scale <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> the city. The Colonial Revival style would also leave its mark in Troy with several buildings. Most notable among them is the Hendrick Hudson Hotel {{on the east side of}} Monument Square, a six-story structure that was the largest building ever built in the city at the time. Projects of similar scale, and the city's annexation of the village of Lansingburgh to its north, helped swell its population to over 72,000 in 1930, its alltime peak.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in New York over 23 days in March 2014. Most of the film was shot in a townhouse on West 162nd Street in Manhattan. Some scenes were filmed in an <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> Yonkers and a senior's home in Hastings-on-Hudson. The film was shot by French cinematographer Denis Lenoir, whom Glatzer and Westmoreland had met at a film screening in 1999; they had {{wanted to work with}} him ever since. During filming, Glatzer and Westmoreland attempted to divide the directing duties equally between themselves, even though Glatzer's physical condition had deteriorated to the point that he could only communicate by typing on an iPad with a single finger.|$|E
5|$|Born to an upper-middle-class {{family in}} Saint Ann Parish, Williamson {{initially}} considered {{a life in}} the Roman Catholic clergy before deciding to devote himself {{to the cause of}} gay rights in Jamaica. In the 1990s, he purchased an <b>apartment</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> the New Kingston area of Kingston, in which he established a gay nightclub, which remained open for two years despite opposition from police. In 1998, he co-founded J-FLAG with other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists, soon becoming the public face of the organisation. As J-FLAG's representative, he argued in favour of LGBT rights during appearances on Jamaican television and radio programs. This attracted great hostility within Jamaica – a country with particularly high rates of anti-gay prejudice – with J-FLAG members receiving death threats and Williamson surviving a knife attack. For a time he left Jamaica, living in Canada and England for several years, before returning to Kingston in 2002.|$|E
25|$|A {{day after}} the blast on 5 September, Basaev and Khattab {{launched}} a second incursion into Dagestan, ostensibly {{with the aim of}} relieving the Islamid Djamaat from the government attack.
