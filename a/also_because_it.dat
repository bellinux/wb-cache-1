No more human children are born, and many parents die or commit suicide. The members of New Athens destroy themselves with a nuclear bomb.|$|E
5|$|Children, ages 11–17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has always been looked upon as an honor. It {{is a chance for}} children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity for them to try to make themselves more holy and therefore more worthy of the position.|$|E
5|$|For {{services}} unknown, he {{was rewarded}} with a consulship early in Vespasian's reign in 71. This was a remarkable honour, not only because he held this office early under the new regime, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was an ordinary consulship (instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship), making {{him one of the}} few non-Flavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian. After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record, presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian (69–79) and his sons Titus (79–81) and Domitian (81–96).|$|E

5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle {{group who}} {{were looking for}} someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could {{transition}} from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.|$|E
5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by Har'el's {{interview}} at Mashable, PJ Pereira, CCO {{and co-founder of}} Pereira & O’Dell announced he will be pursuing a mandatory bid from a female director on every pitch at his agency. Pereira explained, “It’s a simple idea {{that will help the}} entire advertising ecosystem be more open to women directors. <b>Because</b> <b>it's</b> right but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> smart. A more diverse industry means a more creative one and a better representation of their customers and of society itself.” ...|$|R

5|$|In early 1942 the Australian Government sought Drummond for the {{position}} of Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) of the RAAF, to succeed Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett {{at the completion of}} the latter's two-year term. Although initially supportive of the plan, the British Air Ministry eventually declined to release Drummond from his role in the Middle East, partly to avoid disruption to the region's command and <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> did not believe that Drummond's operational abilities would be put to sufficient use in the largely administrative role of CAS. Drummond himself was reportedly dubious about the appointment because of the division of authority between RAAF Headquarters and Allied Air Force Headquarters, South West Pacific Area (SWPA).|$|E
5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E
25|$|Panspermia {{is often}} criticized <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{does not answer}} the {{question}} of the origin of life but merely places it on another celestial body. <b>It</b> was <b>also</b> criticized <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was thought it could not be tested experimentally.|$|R

25|$|In short, {{oxy-fuel}} {{equipment is}} quite versatile, {{not only because}} it is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> lends itself to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), rust or scale removal, the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and is a ubiquitous means of cutting ferrous metals.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{reinforcement}} {{often is}} stronger, {{or at least}} has a better strength to weight ratio than reinforcing steels. <b>Also,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> resists corrosion, it does not need a protective concrete cover as thick as steel reinforcement does (typically 30 to 50mm or more). FRP-reinforced structures therefore can be lighter and last longer. Accordingly, for some applications the whole-life cost will be price-competitive with steel-reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|Rolleston Avenue – {{this street}} {{formerly}} belonged to Antigua Street. The section between Cambridge Terrace and Armagh Street was renamed {{in honour of}} William Rolleston on 11 January 1903, about one month before his passing. This street was chosen because of his association with Canterbury College (now the Christchurch Arts Centre, which adjoined Antigua Street and <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was proposed to erect his statue there.|$|E

Violations are punishable by a fine between $ 25 and $ 250, and/or imprisonment for 15 days or community service. Many local businesses {{may not be}} aware of this law, and they may not be recycling at all, or they may be recycling only some of their recyclable materials. It’s time to spread the word about recycling, not just <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> the law, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> good for business, the community, and the planet...|$|R

25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} acro is the smooth, graceful transitions between dance and acrobatic movements. Also, a dance must have {{a significant percentage of}} dance movement, with respect to its acrobatic content, in order for it to be categorized as acro. For example, a gymnastics floor exercise is not considered to be acro because it has little or no dance movement compared to its acrobatic content, and <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> lacks smooth transitions between dance and gymnastic movements.|$|E
25|$|Arias' {{association}} with Trumbull proved fortuitous, {{not only for}} the experience of working daily with Trumbull himself, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> resulted in what would be Arias' first trip to Japan, with Trumbull, with whom he toured the Osaka Expo and visited post-production monolith Imagica and video game giant Sega Enterprises. That first visit, combined with Arias' friendship with key members of BTTFTRs largely Japanese modelmaking crew, set the stage for Arias' subsequent long-term stay in Japan.|$|E
25|$|El Greco {{would pay}} homage to the {{aristocracy}} of the spirit, the clergy, the jurists, the poets and the scholars, who honored him and his art with their esteem, by immortalizing them in the painting. The Burial of the Count of Orgaz has been admired {{not only for its}} art, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was a gallery of portraits of the most eminent social figures of that time in Toledo. Indeed, this painting is sufficient to rank El Greco among the few great portrait painters.|$|E

25|$|Captain Winter {{and first}} officer Luppis survived and were placed {{under house arrest}} in Pula.

Nevertheless, {{it is known that}} both of them worked in the 1920s as skippers for the Lloyd Adriatico, during which time they also commanded transatlantic liners. Details from their trial and the verdict are unknown because the events were under war censorship, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was believed that everything about the case should stay hidden from general public for morale reasons.|$|E
25|$|Dune premiered in Washington, DC, on December 3, 1984, at The Kennedy Center and was {{released}} worldwide on December 14. Prerelease publicity was extensive, {{not only because it}} was based on a best-selling novel, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was directed by Lynch, who had had success with Eraserhead and The Elephant Man. Several magazines followed the production and published articles praising the film before its release, all part of the advertising and merchandising of Dune, which also included a documentary for television, as well as items placed in toy stores.|$|E
25|$|Red dwarfs are {{far more}} {{variable}} and violent than their more stable, larger cousins. Often they are covered in starspots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% {{for months at a}} time, while at other times they emit gigantic flares that can double their brightness in a matter of minutes. Such variation would be very damaging for life, as it would not only destroy any complex organic molecules that could possibly form biological precursors, but <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would blow off sizeable portions of the planet's atmosphere.|$|E
