5|$|The most {{successful}} {{example of the}} country’s economic evolution is the international financial services industry based in London. Within this sector aviation services are seen as critically important for both businesses and their clients, even {{in the era of}} video-conferencing. London’s air transport services are widely regarded within the London business community surveyed by the OEF to provide a competitive advantage over the rest of Europe, and expansion of <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> in the South East has significant support. Whilst these economic contributions are not disputed by environmental groups, they are not considered as sufficient justification to support further growth in air transport services which would primarily service increased demand for leisure travel rather than a business travel market which is already well served.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of Gatwick Airport has involved several proposals aimed at increasing <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> in south east England and relieving congestion {{at the main}} hub airport Heathrow.|$|E
50|$|The <b>airport’s</b> <b>capacity</b> is 500 {{passengers}} {{per hour}} for domestic flights and 200 passengers per hour for international flights.|$|R
50|$|In June 2016, the new bus {{terminal}} for remote aircraft stand operations was opened {{to increase the}} <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> with gates 50A-M.|$|R
50|$|In April 2013, Exim Bank of China had {{provided}} a $150 million loan {{to build the}} airport's new runway, taxiways and a new terminal to increase the <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> from 500,000 to 1.7million passengers annually.|$|R
25|$|The {{airport was}} {{originally}} {{planned to be}} built in three phases, incrementally increasing <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> as the demand grew. This was changed, however, to four phases after the airport was opened.|$|E
25|$|Emirates' {{financial}} {{success has been}} attributed to rapid growth in demand for air travel in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia; the airline's investment in state-of-the-art aircraft, and the availability of <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> that can be used 24 hours a day.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} the opening of Midway Airport in 1926, the city of Chicago {{realized}} that additional <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> would be needed in the future. The city government investigated various potential airport sites during the 1930s, but made little progress until the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Don Mueang International Airport has two terminals. Terminal 1 is {{used for}} {{international}} flights and Terminal 2 for domestic flights. The opening of Terminal 2 has raised the <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> to 30 million passengers per year.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Somalia's then ruling socialist {{government}} enlisted its Soviet allies {{for major}} renovations to the ground's facilities. The <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> {{to cater to}} both civilian and military needs {{was in the process}} significantly enlarged.|$|R
25|$|Since 1984 the <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> {{had been}} limited to a maximum {{throughput}} of 25million passengers per annum (25 mppa) in accordance with recommendations made by the 1984 public inquiry and confirmed {{by the government of}} the day.|$|R
25|$|In 1969 a new {{terminal}} was {{built at the}} airport. It has had several expansions taking place since it opened. It closed in 2011 following a brand {{new terminal}} being built at the airport. In 1981, a cargo terminal was built, giving the <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> to handle cargo flights. During the 1990s, the airport had non-stop service to South America operated by Viasa.|$|E
25|$|Gatwick {{has been}} {{included}} {{in a number of}} reviews of <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> in southeastern England. Expansion options have included a third terminal and a second runway, although a 40-year agreement not to build a second runway was made in 1979 with West Sussex County Council. Expanded operations would allow Gatwick to handle more passengers than Heathrow does today, with a new terminal between two wide-spaced runways. This would complement or replace the South Terminal, depending on expected future traffic.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent and governments grappled with Sydney's <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> for decades; eventually the controversial decision {{to build a}} third runway was made. The third runway was parallel to the existing runway 16/34, entirely on reclaimed land from Botany Bay. A proposed new airport {{on the outskirts of}} Sydney was shelved in 2004, before being re-examined in 2009–2012 showing that Kingsford Smith airport {{will not be able to}} cope by 2030.|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{growth at}} the airport has been growing at an average rate of 18%. The <b>airport</b> reached its <b>capacity</b> of 33 million {{passengers}} per annum by 2007, however this was still not enough to handle the growing over congestion {{at the airport}}. As 2013 the <b>airports</b> <b>capacity</b> reached 75 million {{with the opening of}} concourse A and expansion of Terminal 2.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, PT Angkasa Pura I had <b>airport</b> <b>capacities</b> of 30,700,440 people, but the {{movement}} was 49,237,437 passengers. Over capacities also occurred for PT Angkasa Pura II with capacities of 30,815,000 people, but {{the movement}} was 62,215,834 passengers.|$|R

25|$|Construction {{of a third}} {{passenger}} terminal was completed {{in time to the}} 2014 World Cup, and raise yearly capacity to 42million passengers. The project is part of the airport’s master plan, which will rase, by the end of 2032, the <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> to nearly 60million passengers. São Paulo International Airport is also the main air cargo hubs in Brazil. The roughly 150 flights a day carry everything from fruits grown in the São Francisco Valley to locally manufactured medicine and electronics devices. The airport's cargo terminal is South America's largest. In 2015, over 503.675 tons were transported from the airport.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2010 general election, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties {{announced}} that they would prevent {{the construction of an}}y third runway or further material expansion of the airport's operating capacity. The Mayor of London, then Boris Johnson, took the position that London needs more <b>airport</b> <b>capacity,</b> favouring the construction of an entirely new airport in the Thames Estuary rather than expanding Heathrow. After the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition took power, it was {{announced that}} the third runway expansion was cancelled. Two years later, leading Conservatives were reported to have changed their minds on the subject.|$|E
25|$|Speaking at {{the first}} Gatwick Airport Consultative Committee (Gatcom) meeting since GIP's {{takeover}} of the airport (held on 28 January 2010 at Crawley's Arora Hotel), Gatwick's chairman Sir David Rowlands ruled out building a second runway for the foreseeable future, citing {{the high cost of}} the associated planning application – estimated to be between £100million and £200million – as the main reason for the new owners' lack of interest. At that meeting, Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate stressed GIP's preference for increasing the existing runway's capacity and confirmed GIP's plans to request an increase in the current limit on the permitted number of take-offs and landings. However, in 2012, Gatwick's new owners reversed their initial lack of interest in building a second runway at the airport for the foreseeable future. On 3 December 2012, chief executive Stewart Wingate argued in front of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee that allowing Gatwick to add a second runway to relieve the growing <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> shortage in the South East of England once the agreement with West Sussex County Council preventing it from doing so had expired in 2019 served the interests of the 12million people living in its catchment area better than building a third runway at Heathrow or a new four-runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary. In support of his argument, Wingate stated that expanding Heathrow or building a new hub in the Thames Estuary was more environmentally damaging, more expensive, less practical and risked negating the benefits of ending common ownership of Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted by the erstwhile BAA. Wingate contrasted this with the greater range of flights and improved connectivity including to hitherto un-/underserved emerging markets that would result from a second runway at Gatwick by the mid-2020s as this would enable it to compete with Heathrow on an equal footing to increase consumer choice and reduce fares. In this context, Wingate also accused his counterpart at Heathrow, Colin Matthews, of overstating the importance of transfer traffic by pointing to research by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This counts the number of air travel bookings made by passengers passing through the IATA-designated London area airports and shows that only 7% of these passengers actually change flights there. Wingate believes this to be a more accurate measure of the share of passengers accounted for by transfer traffic at these airports than the more widely used alternative based on survey data collated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA survey data relies on the number of passengers changing flights at these airports as reported by the airlines to the airport authorities and shows that fewer than 20% of all passengers actually change flights there.|$|E
50|$|The <b>airport</b> has <b>capacity</b> {{to handle}} 350 daily {{operations}} and 850,000 passengers per year, it comprises a concrete runway, a parallel taxiway, several hangars, a commercial aviation apron, a general aviation apron, a military base, and a state-of-the-art commercial terminal equipped with six glass jetways, {{two of which}} are capable of handling medium-large airliners such as the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330. To improve the <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity,</b> the check-in and boarding gates areas will be expanded in 2017 to accommodate up to 140,000 passengers per month.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{commencement}} of operations at Terminal 3 in 2010, it became India's and South Asia's largest aviation hub, with a current capacity of handling more than 40 million passengers. The planned expansion program will increase the <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> to handle 100 million passengers by 2030.|$|R
50|$|In July 2014, Pascall+Watson {{obtained}} {{planning permission}} for the £100 million redevelopment of Luton Airport. The scheme will include extending the terminal building, increasing retail, circulation and seating areas, while improving access. The redevelopment {{will see the}} <b>airports</b> <b>capacity</b> increase from 12 million to 18 million by 2031.|$|R
500|$|The {{availability}} of <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> {{has been identified}} as an important constraint on the ability to meet the increasing demand for air travel. In many cases <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> is already fully used in meeting current demand. At Heathrow and Gatwick airports the runways are full for [...] "… virtually the whole day". In 2003 the runway at Birmingham airport was expected to reach full capacity by 2009 at the latest, whilst terminal capacity at Edinburgh airport had reached its limit. Government forecasts that year predicted that by 2030 the number of passengers could rise to between 400million passengers per annum (mppa) and 600 mppa, representing a two to threefold increase, and a figure of 500 mppa by 2030 was regarded by the government as robust. In 2006 the government reported that at 228 mppa the demand for air travel the previous year was in line with the 2003 forecast, but also revised the forecast demand for 2030 downwards to 465 mppa as a result of capacity constraints, even taking into account proposed airport developments.|$|E
500|$|The White Paper {{does not}} in itself {{authorise}} or preclude any development, but seeks instead to define a [...] "national strategic framework for the future development of airport capacity" [...] over the next 30years. The principal conclusion {{is that the two}} extremes of failing to provide additional <b>airport</b> <b>capacity,</b> and encouraging growth without regard for the wider impacts, are equally unacceptable options. Instead a [...] "balanced and measured approach" [...] to the future of air transport in the UK is adopted. This approach is designed to cater for the forecast growth in demand, thus supporting economic prosperity nationally and enabling ordinary people to travel at reasonable cost, whilst at the same time managing and mitigating the environmental impacts of aviation and ensuring that the costs associated with them are reflected in the price of air travel. The strategy seeks to minimise new airport development by making best use of existing facilities, and specific policies include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{airports}} had terminals {{too small}} for [...] "aerobuses".

50|$|In 2013 {{the company}} won a tender costing 27.6 million US {{dollars for the}} {{construction}} of a new international airport terminal building in Nairobi (Kenya), after a fire destroyed the original building. The new terminal enabled the airport to increase the <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> to 7.5 million people per year.|$|R
25|$|In 2014 {{the airport}} was {{auctioned}} {{to the private}} sector. Renovations were concluded in 2016. A new terminal was built with 17 new jetways, increasing the <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> to 22 million passengers a year and the runway is undergoing expansion. A new runway is planned to be built by 2020.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 {{a brand-new}} {{passenger}} terminal was built, {{including a new}} shopping mall, thus generating more traffic and revenue. Furthermore, a new concourse was opened in 2004 and the <b>airport's</b> <b>capacity</b> increased from 1.5 to 9 million passengers/year. Today, the runway is 3,300 meters (10,827 ft) long, the longest in Northeastern Brazil.|$|R
2500|$|The Soviet {{solution}} to the <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> issue involved passengers loading and unloading their own luggage into and from the aircraft. This was eventually called [...] "the luggage at hand system" [...] ( [...] ; transliterated: [...] "sistyema bagazh s soboy"). Soviet aviation journalist Kim Bakshmi described it (at its ultimate) thus: [...] "One arrives five minutes prior to departure, buys oneself a ticket on board the aircraft, hangs one's coat next to the seat and places one's bag or suitcase nearby.".|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, {{the airport}} {{submitted}} three new proposals for expansion to the Airports Commission, {{which was established}} to review <b>airport</b> <b>capacity</b> in the southeast of England. The Airports Commission was chaired by Sir Howard Davies who, {{at the time of}} his appointment was in the employ of GIC Private Limited (formerly known as Government Investment Corporation of Singapore) and a member of its International Advisory Board. GIC Private Limited was then (2012), as it remains today, one of Heathrow's principal owners. Sir Howard Davies resigned these positions upon confirmation of his appointment to lead the Airports Commission, although it has been observed that he failed to identify these interests when invited to complete the Airports Commission's register of interests. Each of the three proposals that were to be considered by Sir Howard Davies's commission involved the construction of a third runway, either to the north, northwest or southwest of the airport.|$|E
