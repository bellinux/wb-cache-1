5|$|The second-ever Elevation X {{match was}} held between Rhino and James Storm, who was {{accompanied}} by Jackie Moore. The bout lasted thirteen minutes and eighteen seconds. In an Elevation X match, both opponents fight on a scaffolding several feet above the ring, in which {{the only way to}} win is for one to fall off <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring. The two brawled at ringside during the opening minutes. Rhino won the match after kicking Storm off the scaffold <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring through a table.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{then held}} an impromptu Ten-Man Gauntlet match to {{determine}} Kevin Nash's replacement {{in the main}} event. This was the ninth match of the show {{with a duration of}} 14 minutes and 12 seconds. The participants for the match were Abyss, A.J. Styles, Jeff Hardy, Kip James, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Rhino, Ron Killings, Sabu, and Samoa Joe. The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows: two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals. The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest. The last two wrestlers were Abyss and Rhino. Rhino won the match after lifting Abyss over the top rope <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match at}} Victory Road to air live on PPV was a twenty-man Gauntlet match, {{consisting}} of wrestlers who compete in TNA's X Division. In this particular match, wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown {{over the top}} rope <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor until there were two left in the ring. Those two men had a standard match until one was pinned or made to submit. The final two participants were Kazarian and Héctor Garza. Kazarian tried to pin Garza with a Cradle, but Garza countered the maneuver with a roll-up for the win.|$|E

50|$|The two-seam fastball {{often is}} {{perceived}} to be slower than the four-seam fastball, but the slight pronation of the hand and off-center spin on the ball carries the ball <b>down</b> <b>and</b> toward the pitcher's dominant side, <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right for right-handers, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left for left-handers.|$|R
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Final Resolution was a {{standard}} wrestling {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Jeff Jarrett, and the challenger, Monty Brown. On the December 24 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, authority figure Dusty Rhodes announced a Three Way Elimination match for Final Resolution involving Brown, Kevin Nash, and Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). The winner of said match would challenge Jarrett for the NWA Championship in the main event. A Three Way Elimination match involves three competitors fighting to eliminate each man by pinfall, submission, or throwing one another over the top rope <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor until there is one left. Brown defeated Nash and DDP at Final Resolution to gain the opportunity to challenge Jarrett.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{scheduled}} bout was a Three Way Elimination {{match between}} DDP, Kevin Nash, and Monty Brown. The winner of this match {{would go on}} to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. DDP eliminated Nash by performing a dropkick, which caused Nash to fall over the top rope <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. With Nash eliminated, it was down to Brown and DDP. After the two fought back and forth for a few minutes, Brown threw DDP against the ropes while he ran against the opposite ropes and performed a running shoulder block {{in the center of the}} ring to complete a move he named the Pounce.|$|E

5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{was scheduled}} to begin shortly following the misdirected airstrike, and was to be preceded by an artillery bombardment with high explosive and smoke at 16:00. The American tanks were subsequently moved forward to provide cover, and when the New Zealand artillery failed to fire at the appointed hour, they provided the direct fire support. Still in contact, the Australians began to pull back, fighting a number of well-disciplined rearguard actions as the companies leapfrogged each other. Meanwhile, the New Zealand artillery kept the Chinese at bay, after it finally commenced firing. B Company had taken 39 Chinese prisoners during the earlier fighting, and unable to leave these behind, {{they were used to}} carry many of the Australian wounded and much of their equipment as well. O'Dowd's fear that the Chinese might have blocked the withdrawal route was not realised, and B Company moved back along the ridge <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ford without incident, reaching the Middlesex area after dark. C Company was the next to withdraw, departing at 16:30, just after suffering another casualty from sniper fire. Saunders led his company up the spur and then south down the main ridge without incident, followed by A Company during the next hour with the Chinese in close pursuit.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 16th century, Mapuche-speaking agriculturalists {{penetrated}} the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> far south. Through confrontation and technological ability, they came to dominate the other peoples of the region {{in a short period of}} time, and are the principal indigenous community today. The Mapuche model of domination through technological superiority and armed confrontation was later repeated as Europeans implemented a succeeding but conceptually identical cycle, essentially replacing the position of the former dominators with a new, albeit predominately European class.|$|E

25|$|The {{most modern}} method of loading and {{unloading}} a revolver is {{by means of the}} swing out cylinder. The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers, and the cylinder swings out <b>and</b> <b>down</b> (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting {{from the front of the}} cylinder assembly. When pressed, it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top break models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, unfired rounds). The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodywork}} of the Bristol 450 {{was very}} advanced {{for the early}} 1950s. As a division of an aircraft manufacturer the Bristol design team {{had access to the}} company wind tunnel and the car was designed to be as aerodynamically efficient as possible. The cars first appeared with smooth basic shape, perhaps slightly over wide for the narrow track, but with the outline broken by lumpy, inelegant headlamp, spotlight and air intake bulges. The most striking features of the design were large twin stabilising fins running vertically down the rear of the small, enclosed cockpit, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tip of the tail. The overall effect was far from pretty.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the book}} Hvem er skrivekuglens opfinder? (English: Who is the {{inventor}} of the Writing Ball?), written by Malling-Hansen's daughter, Johanne Agerskov, in 1865, Malling-Hansen made a porcelain model of the keyboard of his writing ball and experimented with different placements of the letters to achieve the fastest writing speed. Malling-Hansen placed the letters on short pistons that went directly through the ball <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> paper. This, together with the placement of the letters so that the fastest writing fingers struck the most frequently used letters, made the Hansen Writing Ball the first typewriter to produce text substantially faster than a person could write by hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensive}} {{settlement of}} the site {{took place during the}} 1st century AD, when it came under the rule of the Nabatean king Aretas IV Philopatris (Al-Harith IV) (9 BC 40 AD), who made Mada’in Saleh the kingdom's second capital, after Petra in the north. The place enjoyed a huge urbanization movement, turning it into a city. Characteristic of Nabatean rock-cut architecture, the geology of Mada’in Saleh provided the perfect medium for the carving of monumental and settlements, with Nabatean scripts inscribed on their façades. The Nabateans also developed oasis agriculturedigging wells and rainwater tanks in the rock and carving places of worship in the sandstone outcrops. Similar structures were featured in other Nabatean settlements, ranging from southern Syria (region) to the north, going south to the Negev, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immediate area of the Hejaz. The most prominent and the largest of these is Petra.|$|E
25|$|Initially, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 15th century, Roma and Tatar {{slaves were}} all grouped into self-administrating sălaşe (Old Church Slavonic: челѣдь, čelyad) which were {{variously}} described by historians {{as being an}} extended family, a household or even a community. Their leaders, themselves slaves, were known as cneji, juzi or vătămani, and, in addition to sorting legal disputes, collected taxes and organised labour for the owners. With time, disputes between two Roma slaves were usually dealt by the community leaders, who became known as bulibaşi. Occasionally, the larger slave communities elected themselves a başbulibaşa, who was superior to the bulibaşi and charged with solving the more divisive or complicated conflicts within the respective group. The system went unregulated, often leading to violent conflicts between slaves, which, in one such case attested for the 19th century, led to boyar intervention and the foot whipping of those deemed guilty of insubordination.|$|E

25|$|Shoshone {{was then}} taken further downriver, making the run over Celilo Falls, itself always {{reckoned}} a hazardous stretch, on June 28, 1870. Once below Celilo, she ran as a cattle boat between the upper Cascades and The Dalles. Later {{she was taken}} over the Cascades <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Willamette River, where she was sold to the Willamette River Transportation Company. The W.R.T. Co. then hauled Shoshone up around Willamette Falls, and ran her on the upper Willamette and also on the Yamhill River. There, perhaps surprisingly for a boat that had run Hells Canyon, she struck a rock near Salem, Oregon {{in the fall of}} 1874 and sank. Efforts to raise her failed, although her machinery was salvaged, and later installed in Champion. In January 1875, rising water lifted her free, and washed her down river to Lincoln. There a farmer salvaged her cabins, hauled them ashore, and turned them into a chicken coops.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints {{of the lower}} limb are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely {{the head of the}} femur), through the knee joint (the intercondylar eminence of the tibia), <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> center of the ankle (the ankle mortise, the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3cm), and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis (intercondylar distance exceeds 5cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January 1866 {{a second}} {{government}} expedition, then {{unaware of the}} fate of the messenger, set out for Lake Waikaremoana to enforce McLean's demand. The force of 520, under Fraser's command, was mostly kupapa Māori—the majority Ngāti Kahungunu but also a contingent of Ngāti Porou. Two days later they captured a near-empty Pai Mārire pā about 20km up the Waikaretaheke River, but soon after realised they had been lured into a trap when they were ambushed from hidden rifle pits in the ridges overlooking the track. Fraser's force repulsed the attack, setting fire to dry fern to drive about 150 of the ambush force—a third of them with horses—out of their cover <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake's southern shore at Onepoto, where many fled across the lake on canoe. Fourteen of Fraser's force were killed in the attack and up to 30 wounded, but the allied force killed between 25 and 60 of the Pai Mārire Māori and took 14 prisoners, including five women. Three days later at Onepoto, Ropata seated four of his prisoners in a row—one of them the most senior chief of the upper Wairoa—and executed them with revolver. Binney has claimed Fraser sanctioned the executions, as he had a similar execution at Pukepapa pā near Tokomaru Bay in August 1865.|$|E
