50|$|A {{classification}} {{of all possible}} Born rigid motions can be obtained using the Herglotz-Noether theorem. This theorem states, that all irrotational Born <b>rigid</b> motions (class <b>A)</b> consist of hyperplanes rigidly moving through spacetime, while any rotational Born rigid motion (class B) must be isometric Killing motions. This implies that <b>a</b> Born <b>rigid</b> body only has three degrees of freedom. Thus a body can be brought in <b>a</b> Born <b>rigid</b> way from rest into any translational motion, but it cannot be brought in <b>a</b> Born <b>rigid</b> way from rest into rotational motion.|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} an underwire {{can be traced to}} an 1893 patent that {{describes}} a breast supporting device using <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> plate under the breasts for stability. The modern underwire bra was designed in the 1930s, and gained widespread popularity by the 1950s. As of 2005, underwire bras were the largest and fastest growing segment of the bra market. A bra without an underwire is a softcup bra.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{incident to}} result in more than 50 fatalities did not involve an airplane. On 21 December 1923, the Dixmude, <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> airship of the French Navy, was reportedly struck by lightning and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, off Sicily, Italy. All 52 crew and passengers were killed. Nearly 10 years later, the , also <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> airship, encountered severe weather and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off Barnegat Light, New Jersey, killing 73 of those on board. It was another 5 years before a fixed-wing aircraft incident claimed more than 50 fatalities. On 24 July 1938, A Curtiss Hawk II crashed into spectator stands in the Santa Ana air show disaster. 52 spectators were killed {{on the ground in}} addition to the pilot of the airplane. One month later on 24 August 1938, the Japan mid-air collision in Tokyo claimed 53 lives on the ground in addition to the 5 crew members aboard both planes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{formation}} merging {{problem for a}} leader-follower network. The objective is to control a group of agents called followers and modeled by double-integrator dynamics {{so that they are}} merged with another group of agents called leaders to form <b>a</b> single globally <b>rigid</b> formation. With the assumption that leaders move in <b>a</b> globally <b>rigid</b> formation with their synchronized velocity known to the followers, we show that <b>a</b> globally <b>rigid</b> formation can be merged. Each follower selects its neighbors and control law according to the target configuration and thus it allows directed and time-varying switching topologies. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition such that <b>a</b> globally <b>rigid</b> formation can be merged asymptotically for the leader-follower network in a setup with directed and time-varying graphs. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

Industry retains its important place in the town and the Port of Sheerness is one of the United Kingdom's leading car and fresh produce importers.

5|$|Development of {{the eggs}} {{is a mixture of}} deuterostome and protostome characteristics. Early {{divisions}} of the egg are holoblastic (the cells divide completely) and radial (they gradually form a stack of circles). The process is regulative (the fate of each cell depends on interaction with other cells, not on <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> program in each cell), and experiments that divided early embryos produced complete larvae. Mesoderm is formed from mesenchyme originating from the archenteron.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E

Meckiff claimed a match total of 4/90 for Lindwall's men and was {{selected}} for the Test tour of Pakistan and India. Before the team departed, Meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action, which used <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> left arm during the run-up, before swinging the arm over during the delivery stride. Over the next two years, sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action as fair, and said so in public. He was not called for throwing in either India or Pakistan, meaning that he had played in five nations without being sanctioned.|$|E
5|$|Like all insects, wasps {{have a hard}} {{exoskeleton}} {{which protects}} their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the petiole, joining {{the first and second}} segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are held together by small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females there is usually <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> ovipositor which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely or can be retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defence and for paralysing prey.|$|E
5|$|Most archaea (but not Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma) {{possess a}} cell wall. In most archaea {{the wall is}} {{assembled}} from surface-layer proteins, which form an S-layer. An S-layer is <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> array of protein molecules that cover {{the outside of the}} cell (like chain mail). This layer provides both chemical and physical protection, and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, archaea lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Methanobacteriales do have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan, which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks D-amino acids and N-acetylmuramic acid.|$|E

5|$|Simpson {{was killed}} on 9 May 2013, during {{training}} for the 34th America's Cup, when the Swedish Artemis Racing team yacht he was aboard capsized near Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. The yacht, a 72-foot catamaran with <b>a</b> <b>rigid,</b> wing-like sail, was turning downwind and bearing away when it flipped over and broke into pieces. Simpson was trapped underneath its hulls for approximately ten minutes, and attempts to revive him by doctors afloat and subsequently ashore were unsuccessful. The cause of the accident is unknown. An investigation was initiated by the United States Coast Guard which involved San Francisco police and the America's Cup management.|$|E
5|$|Since the anemone lacks <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E

5|$|The chelicerae ("claw horns") {{that give}} the sub-phylum its name {{normally}} consist of three sections, and the claw is formed by the third section and <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> extension of the second. However, spiders' have only two sections, and the second forms a fang that folds away behind the first when not in use. The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely: those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body, while scorpions' are tiny pincers {{that are used in}} feeding and project only slightly in front of the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the double {{crossover}} (DX) complex, which contains two Holliday junctions {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>rigid</b> structure that can self-assemble into larger arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday junctions to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly side-by-side, in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60°. The complex can be designed to force the junctions into either a parallel or antiparallel orientation, but in practice the antiparallel variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>rigid</b> {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
