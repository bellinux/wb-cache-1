30|$|Organizational {{resources}} {{determine how}} many apprentices are assigned to <b>a</b> workplace <b>trainer.</b> Workplace <b>trainers</b> have <b>an</b> important role in guiding apprentices.

We expect that, in a situation where <b>a</b> workplace <b>trainer</b> has fewer apprentices to supervise, the apprentice–trainer relationships will be better.|$|R
