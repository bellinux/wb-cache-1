Current economic management strategies {{mean that a}} growing group of young people are leaving school with a basic education but no economic prospects. Will 'marginal' youth in towns and cities pose a threat of political and criminal violence? Can peace be built on poverty and rising inequality? Are elections and expanded schooling enough {{when there are no}} jobs...|$|E
40|$|The {{discourse}} on poor state performers {{has suffered from}} widely varying definitions on what distinguishes certain weak states from others. Indices that rank states from strong to weak conceal important distinctions that can adversely affect intervention policy. This deficiency is addressed by grouping states according to their performance on three dimensions of statehood: authority, legitimacy, and capacity. The resultant categorization identifies brittle states that are susceptible to regime change, impoverished states often considered as <b>aid</b> <b>darlings,</b> and fragile states that experience disproportionately high levels of violent internal conflict. It also provides a quantifiable means to analyze transitions from one state type to another for more insightful intervention policy...|$|R
40|$|The first Policy Brief {{part of the}} Nopoor ProjectThe equity problem: <b>aid</b> <b>darlings</b> and <b>aid</b> orphansA {{criticism}} that is frequently levelled against the current pattern of aid allocation is the coexistence of 'aid darlings' and 'aid orphans' among recipient countries. It subsists {{in spite of the}} coming to the fore of a new approach to development cooperation that emphasized policy dialogue, country ownership and the need to get rid of conditionalities and reform overload or high transaction costs. Heralded by the Paris Declaration (March 2005) and the Accra Agenda for Action (September 2008), this approach also privileged new aid modalities, General Budget Support (GBS) in particular, considered to be especially suitable to meet the above objectives. Yet, results proved rather disappointing and ex post conditionalities were soon re-introduced, leading to suspension or disruption of GBS in countries such as Nicaragua and Honduras. Donor agencies that are well-known for their rigour, such as SIDA (Sweden) and DFID (United Kingdom), have even decided to give up budget support and return to aid modalities – programmes and projects – that...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} spatial dependence in dyadic data by {{the means}} of three applications. These have in common that they concern bilateral international relations or flows between two countries with a particular focus {{on the relationship between}} developing and developed countries. While the first chapter provides a general introduction to spatial dependence with a focus on dyadic datasets, the second chapter looks at double taxation treaties (DTTs) and analyses whether strategic interaction among capital importing countries can explain the widespread conclusion of double taxation treaties between an industrialised and a developing country. This is important since upon entering such a treaty, the net-capital importer can lose a significant amount of tax revenues from foreign direct investment (FDI), while the net-capital exporter is better off. The analysis reveals that a country is more likely to enter a DTT if competitor countries for FDI also negotiated such a DTT, providing evidence for the hypothesis that the group of net-capital importers finds itself in a situation which can be described as a prisoners’ dilemma: individually they {{would be better off if}} they refused to negotiate a treaty, but collectively they have an incentive to sign such a tax treaty. The third chapter is on official development assistance and deals with the question whether a specific donor tends to dedicate a larger share of its aid budget to a certain recipient if other donors give money to the same beneficiary. A considerable degree of spatial dependence is found in the form that donors tend to allocate their money to the same recipients. Donors particularly follow the example of the most important aid donors. This behaviour has negative implications for aid effectiveness, contributes to harmful aid volatility and leads to <b>aid</b> <b>darlings</b> and orphans. However, there is no evidence that donors strategically interact with each other in order to pursue their military strategic and economic goals. Spatial dependence in asylum migration is the third application, discussed in the fourth chapter. It is well documented in the literature that personal networks of migrants reduce the risk of migration and facilitate transition to the host country. So far it has always been assumed that these personal networks only exist for fellow countrymen. The empirical analysis, however, shows that the positive effects also operate across borders and that also migrants from other geographically close source countries make asylum migration from a given source country more likely. Furthermore, it is shown that a more restrictive asylum policy in one destination country provides a negative externality for other destinations. This is because asylum seekers are deflected by a tighter asylum regime and encouraged to lodge their application in more liberal target countries...|$|R
