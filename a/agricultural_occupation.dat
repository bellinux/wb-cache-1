There is an obvious shift in the 'type' of occupations held for example the occupations for the 1831 record were sorted into 4 categories where as the later data was sorted into 6 categories and instead of being [...] "labourers and servants" [...] for the 1831 dataset the labouring and agriculture occupations were grouped as being; vegetable substances, food and lodging, animals and conveyance of men, goods and messages which could be related to the later record of data in 1881 being more specified than that of 1831 but most of the occupations still relate to some sort of agricultural profession. With the data from both the 1831 and 1881 occupational data there is a large indication that there wasn't much opportunity for a range of occupations other than that was based around agriculture.|$|E

To solve the research problem a model of data disaggregation was developed, taking the utmost of previous information available in earlier studies.

The model also involves two application variants: simultaneous disaggregation of data as well as a direct one (to solve the problems that might appear in the previous one and maximize the recovered information). Moreover, a model based on these principles is proposed to the disaggregation of the livestock data. The model is applied to the disaggregation of data in the municipality of Castelo de Vide.

Seventy-six former students with two or more years of agricultural training were compared with a group of 45 students without agricultural training. The specific criteria on which the comparisons between the two groups are based were: occupational status, post high school training, job satisfaction, value of high school training, income, and the number of jobs held. Also being analyzed were persons influencing graduates occupational choice, value of additional vocational training, and the location of employment. The following conclusions are based on the findings of the study. 1. Agricultural students do become employed in <b>agricultural</b> <b>occupations</b> with most of them entering business and lumbering occupations in agriculture, while over one-half of the comparison group entered the <b>agricultural</b> <b>occupations</b> of lumbering. 2.
