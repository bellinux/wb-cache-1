40|$|An edited {{version of}} this paper was {{published}} by AGU. Copyright 2006 American Geophysical Union. Using the kinematic-wave overland flow equation and a fractional dispersion-advection equation, a process-oriented, physically-based model is developed for overland solute transport. Two scenarios, one consisting of downslope and the other of upslope rainstorm movements, are considered for numerical computations. Under these conditions, the hydrograph displays a long-tailed distribution due to the variation in flow velocity in both time and distance. The solute transport exhibits a complex behavior. Pollutographs are characterized by a steep rising limb, with a peak, and <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> <b>stretched</b> receding limb; whereas the solute concentration distributions feature a rapid receding limb followed by <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>stretched</b> rising limb. Downslope moving storms cause much higher peak in both hydrographs and pollutographs than do upslope moving storms. Both hydrographs and the pollutographs predicted by the fractional dispersion model are in good agreement with the data measured experimentally using a soil flume and a moving rainfall simulator...|$|R

25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in wedge anchors a short fully opaque plastic tape to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the supply reel, before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>stretch</b> of tape instead of to the microscopic splice.
