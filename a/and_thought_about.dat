500|$|Fleming {{returned}} to Britain with a completed {{first draft of}} the manuscript in March 1964 and wrote to the copy editor of all his novels, William Plomer, saying it needed a lot of re-writing. As time went on Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> re-working it {{in the spring of}} 1965, but was persuaded against it by Plomer, who considered the novel viable for publication. Five months after returning from Jamaica, on the morning of 12 August 1964, Fleming died of a heart attack. His obituary in The Times noted that he [...] "had completed and was revising a new novel, The Man with the Golden Gun." ...|$|E

During this enforced rest there were lectures and classes for the crew, and various theatrical diversions in which Markham was able to display his [...] "great histrionic talent". He did much reading, mainly Arctic history and classical literature, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> a possible return visit to Peru, a country which had captivated him during the Collingwood voyage. When spring returned, a series of sledging expeditions was launched to search for further signs of the missing crews. Markham played a full part in these activities, which produced no further evidence of Franklin, but led to the mapping of {{hundreds of miles of}} previously uncharted coast. The expedition returned to England in early October 1851.|$|E
500|$|Hard Boiled took 123 days to shoot. Although Woo {{told his}} cast {{that the film}} would be more gritty and not as stylish as his {{previous}} films, Hard Boiled became more stylish as the filming began. The tea house sequence in the film was shot before the script was written. The crew found that the tea house {{was going to be}} torn down and decided to film a scene there. Woo saw the staircase in the tea house, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> a scene where a character would come shooting down gun smugglers while sliding down the banister. The tea house sequence was shot in around a week's time and was choreographed by Woo and Philip Kwok. It was shot with interruptions from many local triads in the area asking for protection money, and residents complaining about the noise.|$|E

500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

When Madonna started work on Like a Prayer, she considered many options, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the musical direction for it. She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her ex-husband Sean Penn, her family, her lost mother and even her belief in God. Madonna thought about lyrical ideas for the songs on topics that, until then, were personal mediation never to be shared with her public so openly and pointedly. She came {{to the realization that}} as she and her fans were growing up, and it was time for her {{to move away from the}} teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market. Madonna wanted her new sound to be calculative and indicative of what was fashionable, and ride the changing trend of music.|$|E

In an interview, Nagata said that he felt slighted <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> quitting when he was relegated to the pre-show. The day after the event, {{he was scheduled to}} challenge Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship, returning to the IWGP main-event picture {{for the first time in}} years. Although Nagata received his title shot at NJPW The New Beginning in Sendai, he was defeated by Nakamura. Nakamura's Wrestle Kingdom 9 opponent, Kota Ibushi, won the 2015 New Japan Cup tournament on March15 by defeating Hirooki Goto in the finals, thus earning the right to choose a championship to challenge. [...] Ibushi picked a match with A.J. Styles for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship (leaving Goto to challenge Nakamura).

500|$|Consistent with Bolkovac's account, The Whistleblower portrays DynCorp International {{employees}} {{as participants in}} the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we are going to hear a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E
500|$|Coming {{after two}} episodes {{focused on the}} series' [...] "mythology", or fictional history, [...] "Squeeze" [...] helped {{establish}} that the show could cover other paranormal subjects, {{and was the first}} [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episode of The X-Files. Series creator Chris Carter thought that the show could not sustain its momentum unless it branched out from the previously UFO-centered plots. Co-writers Glen Morgan and James Wong were inspired to write the episode when they looked at a ventilation shaft outside of their office <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> whether someone could crawl inside it. Although the episode has parallels with the second [...] film, The Night Strangler (1973), which featured a man who commits murders every 21 years, Morgan and Wong have stated they were inspired by the serial killers Jack the Ripper and Richard Ramirez. After eating foie gras during a trip to France, Carter proposed the idea that the villain should consume human livers. Morgan noted that the writers settled on the liver because it was [...] "funnier" [...] than any other organ. The idea to have Tooms use a nest for hibernation came from Morgan and Wong; they liked that if the agents were unable to catch Tooms, he could return after weeks of dormancy.|$|E
500|$|According to Chen, Cloud was {{designed}} to [...] "expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke." [...] Chen had the first idea for the game; while walking to school one day {{he looked up at}} the sky, noticing the difference between the fluffy clouds there and the [...] "polluted and gray" [...] clouds of Shanghai where he was born, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> making a game about clouds. It was given a story to [...] "create the premise and help player to be emotionally invested"; however, the team avoided making the story too strong, as it would [...] "distract the player from the core experience" [...] of flying freely and shaping clouds. In the early stages of development, the game had an involved backstory about an alien who attempts to clean up the environment, but this was cut down to [...] "a simple 'poetic' introduction to the cloud child trapped in a hospital bed." [...] The team intended Cloud to [...] "communicate a feeling of youthfulness, freedom, and the wonder of imagination." [...] It was built on a modified version of a game engine developed by several team members for their previous game, Dyadin. At the 2006 Game Developers Conference student showcase, Chen and Santiago pitched Cloud to Sony representative John Hight as the first game in the [...] "Zen" [...] genre. Hight was interested, but Sony declined to publish the game.|$|E

The Bulletin wrote, [...] "Thus was fulfilled a prophecy made the first time the magnificent 7'1" [...] scoring star of the Warriors played a game in the National Basketball Association three years ago." [...] New York City papers ran stories from the news agencies. The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune ran the AP story on pages 14 and 11, respectively.

Even at this point, however, Balakirev had trouble finishing large works; the symphony would not be finished until decades later. He began a second piano concerto {{in the summer of}} 1861, with a slow movement thematically connected with a requiem that occupied him at the same time.
