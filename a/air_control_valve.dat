40|$|Thesis (MIng (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Various {{commercial}} {{software packages}} {{are available for}} simulating compressed air network operations. However, none of these software packages are able to dynamically prioritise compressor selection on large compressed air networks in the mining industry. In this dissertation, a dynamic compressor selector (DCS) will be developed that will actively and continuously monitor system demand. The software will ensure that the most suitable compressors, based on efficiency and position in the compressed air network, are always in operation. The study will be conducted at a platinum mine. Compressed air flow and pressure requirements will be maintained without compromising mine safety procedures. Significant energy savings will be realised. DCS will receive shaft pressure profiles {{from each of the}} shafts’ surface compressed <b>air</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> These parameters will be used to calculate and predict the compressed air demand. All pipe friction losses and leaks will be taken into account to determine the end-point pressure losses at different flow rates. DCS will then prioritise the compressors of the compressed air network based on the overall system requirement. This software combines the benefits of supply-side and demand-side management. Potential energy savings with DCS were proven and compressor cycling reduced. A DCS user-friendly interface was created to easily set up any mine’s compressed air network. Master...|$|R
50|$|An {{idle air}} control {{actuator}} or idle <b>air</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> (IAC actuator/valve) is a device commonly used in fuel-injected vehicles to control the engine's idling RPM. In carburetted vehicles a similar device known as an idle speed control actuator is used.|$|E
5000|$|Simply put, the ACIS {{system uses}} a single intake <b>air</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> {{located in the}} intake to vary {{the length of the}} intake tract in order to {{optimize}} power and torque, as well as provide better fuel efficiency and reduce intake [...] "roar".|$|E
50|$|Most divers have a {{screw-down}} <b>air</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the {{air hose}} to control air flow rate into the helmet. The early helmets did not have air control valves and the diver signaled the surface with pulls on his rope or air line, indicating that he needed more or less air.|$|E
40|$|Air for the {{internal}} combustion engine (1) passes through a turbocharger (2, 3) compressor (4). The air line (7) downstream of the compressor divides with some air bypassing (9) the intercooler (6) and passing through a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> (10). There is a sensor (14) downstream of the point where the bypass joins the main air line. - Air is bled off downstream of the sensor to a control module (11). This may return <b>air</b> to the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> or pass it to the waste gate (13) for the turbine (5). Some of the exhaust gas (8) passes through the turbine and some of it bypasses it (12) through the waste gate...|$|R
5000|$|Air was {{provided}} {{from the air}} filter intake to the intake manifold by a Holley-designed, aluminum, twin-venturi, mechanically actuated throttle body, which was bolted atop the intake manifold. Each venturi was progressively bored and had a diameter of 50mm. To this unit were mounted the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor and Idle <b>Air</b> <b>Control</b> (IAC) <b>valve</b> (initially {{referred to as the}} [...] "AIS Motor"). A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage {{at the side of the}} throttle body, which acted to open the air intake butterfly valves inside the venturis. During idle these butterfly valves were closed, so a bypass port and the IAC valve were used to control the intake of air.|$|R
50|$|A {{continuous}} flow of compressed air is {{provided to the}} helmet and vented to the surrounding water at a pressure {{very close to the}} ambient pressure at the exhaust port, which lets the diver breathe normally. The helmet must have a non-return valve at the air inlet port of the helmet, to prevent massive and fatal squeeze, should the air line be cut at the surface. Diving helmets, while very heavy, displace a great deal of water and combined with the air in the suit, would make the diver float with his head out of the water. To overcome this, some helmets are weighted on the corselet, while other divers wear weighted belts which have straps that go over the corselet. Some divers have an <b>air</b> inlet <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> while others may have only one control, the exhaust back-pressure. Helmet divers are subject to the same pressure limitations as other divers, such as decompression sickness and nitrogen narcosis.|$|R

50|$|Additional {{functions}} of the ECM include operation of the fuel pump by closing the Ground for the fuel pump relay, and control of idle speed by a throttle plate bypass valve. The Idle <b>Air</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Valve</b> (IACV) (previously known as an Idle Air Stabiliser Valve - IASV), receives a changing milliamp signal that varies the strength of an electromagnet pulling open the bypass valve.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{improvements}} in digital technology {{over the last}} two decades have led to artificial ventilators that drastically improve physicians' ability to measure and control aspects of their patients' breathing. However, the mechanical systems paired with the new digital controllers have not advanced in parallel with them. As a result, mechanical ventilators do not respond sufficiently fast to changes in operating conditions and can injure patients by allowing the air volume or pressure in their lungs to become too high. This thesis describes a new <b>air</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> that can be incorporated in existing ventilators to correct this condition. The valve's low mass and short stroke result in rapid full-range motion with low actuator force and travel. These qualities also make the valve well-suited for use as a flow-change mechanism in instruments that measure airway resistance, including the Airflow Perturbation Device (APD). We describe a series of experiments that verify the valve's performance in both ventilator and APD applications...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the 1970s, Midland-Ross made {{a series}} of consoliditions among its {{divisions}} and divested itself of assets. It consolidated Ross Engineering, Waldron-Hartig, and Cameron Machine into a new Machinery Division in February 1971; sold Midrex to a West German steel manufacturer, Korf Stahl A.G., in January 1974 for $25 million ($ in [...] dollars); merged Industrial Castings and Unicast into a new division called National Castings in July 1975; spun off Capitol Foundry into a new division called Capitol Castings in July 1975; sold Reinforced Plastic Container to the Youngstown Steel Door Company for $2 million ($ in [...] dollars) in December 1975; and merged Nelson Metal and Grand Rapids Bright Metal into Power Controls in December 1977. The new division focused on the manufacture of air horns, <b>air</b> reservoirs, <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> bus door operating systems, load levelers, and aluminum and zinc ornamental and functional die castings like taillight trim, hood ornaments, and name plates. Power Controls was renamed Midland Brake in 1980.|$|R
5000|$|The SBEC {{controlled}} the ignition, {{as well as}} the opening and closing of the fuel injectors. During cold startup, wide-open throttle and deceleration, it did this based on [...] "open-loop", pre-programmed operating parameters. During normal idle and cruising, it began [...] "closed-loop" [...] operation, during which the module acted based upon inputs from a variety of sensors. The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the Oxygen sensor (O2), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and Coolant Temperature sensor (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC's outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the Idle <b>Air</b> <b>Control</b> (IAC) <b>valve.</b> The latter <b>controlled</b> idle characteristics. However, the SBEC also {{controlled the}} operation of the charging system, air conditioning system, cruise control and, in some vehicles, transmission shifting. By centralizing control of these systems, the operation of the vehicle was simplified and streamlined.|$|R
5000|$|Throttle bodies {{may also}} contain valves and {{adjustments}} {{to control the}} minimum airflow during idle. Even in those units that are not [...] "drive-by-wire", there will often be a small solenoid driven valve, the Idle <b>Air</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Valve</b> (IACV), that the ECU uses to control the amount of air that can bypass the main throttle opening to allow the engine to idle when the throttle is closed.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the {{facelift}} appeared for the 1981 {{model year}} and meant more black trim (including the bumpers) {{and a new}} grille and headlights. The engine also received new emissions equipment, consisting of two catalytic converters, an air pump, and an <b>air</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> which robbed the 2.0 four of some power. Also new for 1981 was the [...] "Luxury" [...] model, which featured ample equipment.|$|E
5000|$|... 2008: The CB400SF Hyper VTEC Revo {{introduced}} Honda's PGM-FI programmed {{fuel injection}} and an idle <b>air</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for improved fuel economy and reliability. Revised engine materials and an integrated crank-case cover reduced the engine weight by 2 kg. The VTEC operation was further refined such that in gears 1-5 four-valve operation engaged at 6,300 rpm for wide open throttle, otherwise at 6,750 rpm, and remaining at 6,750 rpm in 6th gear. Independent cylinder ignition timing map, revised air intake geometry {{and a larger}} stainless steel muffler contribute to fuel efficiency. Updated frame rigidity and engine mounting position improved handling. Optional combined ABS uses three-piston sliding calipers on the front brakes instead of the standard four-piston opposed calipers and a larger 256 mm rear brake disc. Overall weight increased by 4 kg, and 9 kg with ABS.|$|E

25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If {{the system is not}} recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the <b>air</b> brake <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} this {{research}} was to conduct an experimental analysis in which a THUNDER™ (Thin Unimorph DrivER) actuator was used to adjust the flow of air through a specified cross sectional area inside a Plexiglas housing. The THUNDER™ actuator was developed over ten years ago as a high displacement piezoelectric actuator. It is a curved, bilayer actuator made up of a piezoelectric layer (PZT, lead zirconate titanate) and a stainless steel layer. In this study, the THUNDER™ is the prime mover in an <b>air</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve is made up of a flow channel that allows air to pass {{over the top of the}} actuator. When voltage is applied to the actuator, causing the piezo ceramic layer to expand or contract, the curvature of the actuator changes, thus changing the orifice area in the valve and causing a change in flow. Testing is done with single and dual flow loop arrangements. In the dual flow loop, one flow line contains the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> while the other is a bypass line. The valve is used to balance flow between the lines. Both lines have adjustable outlet valves so that the valve can be tested under a wide range of flow conditions. Pressure transducers were placed along the experimental setup to observe various pressures conditions in the system. Two flow meters were used to measure either the single loop flow rate or the corresponding flow rate in each line of the dual flow loop. Several lids for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> were manufactured and tested to reveal that alternative channel geometries could lead to increased performance over a specific range. The test results showed that the THUNDER™ <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> could modulate the air flow by as much as 16 % at 4. 4 SCFM (125 LPM) in single loop flow and 30 % at 2. 3 SCFM (65 LPM) in dual loop flow for inlet pressures up to 25 PSI (172 kPa) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) {{controls}} the position {{of one or more}} air control valves based on input signals from throttle angle and engine RPM. The vacuum switching valve (VSV) which controls the vacuum supply to the actuator is normally closed and passes vacuum to the actuator when it is energized by the ECU. By energizing the VSV vacuum is passed to the actuator, closing the <b>air</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> This effectively lengthens the intake manifold run. By de-energizing the VSV, vacuum to the actuator is blocked and trapped vacuum is bled off of the actuator diaphragm. Toyota ACIS is an On/Off system. The valve (or valves in newer models with multiple valves to create more than 2 lengths) is either fully opened or fully closed.An example of early single-valve ACIS programming would be the 3.0L 3VZ-FE engine. The ECU actuates the VSV to close the valve when the throttle position is 60% or greater and engine speed is 3,900 RPM or more.|$|E

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature survey}} {{on the proposed}} subject has been conducted in the Center for Advanced Energy Systems and Environmental Control Technologies at Morgan State University. About forty-five related journals and technical reports have been reviewed for the references of the project preparation. Two different types of thermocouples (T-type for the cold model testing, R-type for the hot model testing) have been purchased for the project. The thermocouple assembly for the cold model testing has been designed and fabricated. The cold model of the proposed gasification simulator has been designed and fabricated. The cold model is made of a transparent acrylic tube with 10 -inch ID and 20 -inch length. This model allows them to observe the phenomena of the gasification process, which may cause dirty and harsh environments around the thermocouples. Two pairs of flanges were made to host the irritating air injection ports, thermocouple assembly, and seal the cold model system. The air injection system {{is attached to the}} cold model testing system, which includes an air compressor, an <b>air</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and the auxiliary tubes. The char coal dust mixtures are used in the cold model to simulate the gasifier environment.

50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak.

The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed <b>air</b> via hand <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue).

The torpedo then stops in opposite tilt at certain degree, and starts rolling back the angle toward the neutral center position. Then the controller senses the angle tilted and countersteers roll-rudders to break the moment. It is rolling over the neutral center position then stops at certain degree, vice versa, like an air cushion is bouncing and settled to the floor.
