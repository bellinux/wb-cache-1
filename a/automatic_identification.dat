25|$|The {{center has}} three main duties. Firstly, it {{provides}} information services to vessels, {{such as the}} traffic situation, meteorological information and regulations. Secondly, it provides navigational assistant services to ships either on request or when deemed necessary by the staff. This often happens in severe weather conditions or in cases with technical difficulties with the ship. Thirdly, the VTS provides traffic organization to ensure a safe and orderly operation of the traffic. The center can draw on data from the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Identification</b> System, local radar, meteorology, SafeSeaNet and video cameras.|$|E
25|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID) uses {{electromagnetic fields}} to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy {{from a nearby}} RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source (such as a battery) and may operate hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line {{of sight of the}} reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method for <b>Automatic</b> <b>Identification</b> and Data Capture (AIDC).|$|E

25|$|In February 2014, Airbus Helicopters {{announced}} at Heli-Expo 2014 {{the development of}} an improved variant, the EC225e. The EC225e features numerous changes including new avionics systems, such as the TCAS II collision avoidance system, an <b>automatic</b> <b>identification</b> system, and a specialized rig-approach system; it was also intended to feature an improved Turbomeca Makila 2B engine to increase the EC225e's maximum takeoff weight by 550kg, and an additional fuel tank in the rear baggage compartment to extend its range to 300 nautical miles with up to ten passengers on board. Some, but not all, modifications can be retrofitted onto existing EC225s. In the same announcement, in February 2014, Lease Corporation International said that they had placed a $645million order for 15 EC225e (along with 6 Airbus Helicopters EC175) helicopters as the launch customer. In February 2016, the Makila 2B engine was dropped from the EC225e as a cost reduction measure, development of the other structural and avionics aspects is proceeding.|$|E
25|$|The British Maritime and Coastguard Agency had {{the last}} known radio contact with the vessel as it was passing through the Strait of Dover on July 28. Nothing {{extraordinary}} was detected during the communication, though authorities believe that the crew was coerced not to raise an alarm by the hijackers. The ship continued to send <b>Automatic</b> <b>Identification</b> System signals until July 30. A press-secretary of the Swedish Police Authority confirmed {{that one of its}} investigators had a phone contact with a crew member on July 31, but refused to disclose its nature. No communication occurred after that; the ship failed to come to Béjaïa on its scheduled arrival date, August 5. Coastal tracking radar last picked up the ship's signal near Brest, France; it was later reported being observed by a patrol aircraft near the Portuguese coast. The vessel was never seen passing through the Strait of Gibraltar. A hijack alert was issued by Interpol on August 3.|$|E

25|$|It {{refers to}} {{determining}} the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities, e.g., {{of a cell}} phone, a digital camera, or a bank. A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity, e.g., the screen of a cell phone, the service for a restaurant, or the picture quality of a camera. The advantage of feature-based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest. Different features can generate different sentiment responses, for example a hotel can have a convenient location, but mediocre food. This problem involves several sub-problems, e.g., identifying relevant entities, extracting their features/aspects, and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature/aspect is positive, negative or neutral. The <b>automatic</b> <b>identification</b> of features can be performed with syntactic methods, with topic modeling, or with deep learning. More detailed discussions about this level of sentiment analysis {{can be found in}} Liu's work.|$|E

40|$|A segment-based <b>Automatic</b> Language <b>Identification</b> (ALI) {{system has}} been developed. The system was {{designed}} around a formal probabilistic framework. This framework forms the basis for investigating the ALI approach proposed by House and Neuburg which utilizes phonotactic constraints of languages.
