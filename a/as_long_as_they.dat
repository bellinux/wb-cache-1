5|$|Historically, {{only those}} wishing to use {{specialised}} material unavailable in other public or academic libraries {{would be given}} a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, {{who have access to}} their own university libraries, to the reading rooms.

5000|$|Glenroe was {{the subject}} of {{controversy}} with regard to actors' rights to avail of other commercial work during their contracted periods with the broadcaster. In 1990 RTÉ prohibited soap actors from portraying their characters for advertising purposes. The Irish Times ran an article titled [...] "RTÉ forbids ‘soap star’ ads." [...] It read: [...] "Actors in RTÉ soap operas such as Glenroe and Fair City will be prevented from portraying well-known characters... for advertising purposes this year... In effect the ban will mean that actors such as Mick Lally and Joe Lynch will be free to earn money from advertisements and from supermarket openings <b>as</b> <b>longs</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> do not portray the characters they play in the Glenroe series." ...|$|R
5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> wanted to {{so that he}} could get a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation {{will come to}} an end.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft {{for the first}} time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse {{for the first time}}, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E

5|$|Another account {{mentions}} the Maha-matrikas (the great mothers), {{a group of}} the wives of six of the Saptarishis (7 great sages), who were accused of being Skanda's real mothers and thus abandoned by their husbands. They request Skanda to adopt them as his mothers. Skanda agrees and grants them two boons: to be worshipped as great goddesses and permission to torment children <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are younger than 16 years and then act as their protectors. These six goddesses {{as well as the}} Saptamatrikas are identified or associated with Vedic Krittikas, the constellation Pleiades.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special {{supportive}} clothing and shoes are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are not {{mounted on the}} pistol, which may only have open sights.

5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they {{had no need to}} seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at City College went {{through a series of}} further changes. The most {{significant}} was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> completed 150 credits.|$|E
5|$|In February 1990, the Pittston Coal Company and the UMWA {{came to a}} settlement. The current miners of Pittston {{would receive}} health and {{retirement}} benefits once again. Pittston Coal Company also had to pay around $10million for the retirement benefits plan for pre-1974 miners. In return Pittston was permitted to operate {{seven days a week}} <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were closed from 8am–4pm on Sundays. Miners were also put on a rotating schedule where every 28 days they would work one week for 4 days, 10 hours each day.|$|E

She was not known as a strong orator.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> {{do not live in}} too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
