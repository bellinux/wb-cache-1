5|$|On 24 December 1962, UN {{troops and}} Katangese gendarmes clashed near Élisabethville and {{fighting}} broke out. After attempts to reach <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire</b> failed, UN troops launched Operation Grandslam and occupied Élisabethville, prompting Tshombe {{to leave the}} country. <b>A</b> <b>ceasefire</b> was agreed soon thereafter. Indian UN troops, exceeding their orders, then occupied Jadotville, preventing Katangese loyalists from regrouping. Gradually, the UN overran {{the rest of the}} Katanga and, on 21 January 1963, Tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of Kolwezi, effectively ending the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|European Union – On 8 August, France (who {{held the}} {{rotating}} {{presidency of the}} European Union) announced that the EU and the US would send a joint delegation to negotiate <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire.</b>|$|E
50|$|Israel {{declared}} <b>a</b> unilateral <b>ceasefire</b> on January 17, 2009. Hamas responded {{the following}} day by announcing <b>a</b> one-week <b>ceasefire</b> to give Israel time to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip. Between 1,166 and 1,400 Palestinians and 13? {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{time after}} dawn, <b>a</b> one-hour <b>ceasefire</b> was {{brokered}} but the International Committee of the Red Cross proved unable to evacuate those {{trapped in the}} area. According to a witness interviewed by the UNHRC, there was <b>a</b> 2-hour <b>ceasefire,</b> but the family still {{had to wait for}} 6 hours ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 1972, during <b>a</b> {{short-lived}} <b>ceasefire,</b> <b>an</b> IRA delegation {{that included}} Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness held talks {{in a house}} in Cheyne Walk with a British government team led by NI Secretary William Whitelaw.|$|R
5|$|Muammar Gaddafi was {{angered by}} the devastating {{counter-attack}} on Libya and the ensuing defeat at the Battle of Maaten al-Sarra. Forced to accede to <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire,</b> the defeat ended his expansionist projects toward Chad and his dreams of African and Arab dominance.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{was opposed}} {{to the idea of}} <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire,</b> but under {{pressure}} from Machel he agreed to it. Mugabe signed the agreement, although felt cheated, remaining disappointed that he had never achieved a military victory over the Rhodesian forces.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire</b> was {{scheduled}} to come into force throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina on 12 October, OG Centre continued its advance northeast of Sanski Most, engaging {{the bulk of the}} VRS 43rd Motorised Brigade in a series of clashes. This fighting resulted in little change to the territory held by either side by 20 October, when fighting died down.|$|E

5|$|In February 2009, FATA's provincial {{government}} officially declared Islamic law in Swat to achieve <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire</b> with the northwestern Pashtun tribes. Because the United States and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By {{the end of}} April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to reach <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire,</b> peacekeepers escorted Tshombe {{to the front lines}} where he was forced to agree that his own forces were attacking UN {{positions}} without provocation. He ordered his troops to cease firing but was ignored. Radio intercepts revealed to the UN that General Norbert Moke, the commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, had ordered the Katangese Air Force to bomb the Élisabethville airport on the night of 29 December. With the failure to enact <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire,</b> Lieutenant General Dewan Prem Chand of India convinced Thant to authorise a strong, decisive offensive to pre-emptively eliminate Katangese forces. This brought relief to some of the UN peacekeepers, mindful that they now had justification to act forcefully against Katanga. Determined to avoid civilian casualties and widespread destruction, the secretary-general sent a wire to the UN Force Commander in the Congo to explain that napalm was to be prohibited from use in combat. Early on 28 December for unknown reasons, Tshombe quietly departed Élisabethville.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{tensions}} in Jordan between an increasingly autonomous PLO and King Hussein's government had been simmering; following the Dawson's Field hijackings, a military campaign was launched to rout out PLO forces. The offensive elevated risks {{of a regional}} war and prompted Nasser to hold an emergency Arab League summit on 27 September in Cairo, where he forged <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire.</b>|$|E

5|$|On Wednesday, Assad sent Tlass to Moscow {{to seek a}} {{comprehensive}} air umbrella. The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshall Pavel Stepanovich Kutakhov to Syria {{to find out what}} happened to the Syrian SAMs, fearing that NATO might do the same in Eastern Europe. On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire.</b> US President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire</b> effective at 6:00 AM, on June 10. By noon on Friday, when the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat. A year after the battle, a US fact-finding mission headed by Lieutenant-General John Chain, then deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|Scott—still unsure who his {{ships were}} firing at, and {{afraid that they}} might be firing on his own destroyers—ordered <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire</b> at 23:47, {{although}} not every ship complied.

5|$|The Downing Street Declaration of 1993 allowed Sinn Féin, a {{political}} party associated with the IRA, to participate in all-party peace negotiations on condition that the IRA called <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire.</b> The IRA called <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire</b> on 31 August 1994. John Major's government, dependent on Ulster Unionist Party votes, then began insisting that the IRA must fully disarm before there could be any all-party negotiations. The IRA saw this as a demand for total surrender and believed the British were unwilling to hold negotiations. It ended its ceasefire on 9 February 1996 when it detonated a powerful truck bomb in Canary Wharf, {{one of the two}} financial districts of London. The blast killed two people and caused an estimated £150 million worth of damage. The IRA then planted five other devices in London within the space of 10weeks.|$|E

The battle led the United States to impose <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire</b> on Israel and Syria.|$|E
5|$|While Carabane's tourism {{sector has}} {{suffered}} {{because it has}} not taken part in the network of villages, tourists have avoided travelling to Casamance in general because of the civil unrest.

50|$|Having had its {{push for}} <b>a</b> post-Tet <b>ceasefire</b> denied, the North Vietnamese were desperate for <b>a</b> formal <b>ceasefire</b> before {{negotiations}} began. They made a token withdrawal of a brigade {{back into the}} North while pulling other troops back from combat into sanctuaries. On 13 February 1968, a four party meeting among the warring parties began in Yangon. Game Control then mandated a military stand-down by both sides.|$|R

It ended with <b>a</b> unilateral <b>ceasefire</b> by Israel, followed by Hamas declaring <b>a</b> one-week <b>ceasefire.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>ceasefire</b> order reached Crummel on 2November, {{upon which}} {{he and his men}} {{returned}} to Batavia after stationing a contingent of 50 men at Cadouwang.

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Hervé de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire,</b> monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian Serbs and implementating confidence-building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions. He promised {{for the first time}} to negotiate with the RPF; a multiparty cabinet formed in April, still dominated by the MRND, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and were successful in negotiating <b>a</b> <b>ceasefire.</b> In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began a peace negotiation process headquartered in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.|$|E
