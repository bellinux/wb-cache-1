5|$|Although {{the battle}} was a British victory, there was {{criticism}} of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The invasion at Quiberon ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships {{did not return to}} Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline {{for the remainder of the}} year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.|$|E
5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and author of several popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day.

As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E

25|$|The {{geomorphology}} of the Mount Meager massif {{resembles that}} of Glacier Peak, another Cascade Arc volcano located in the U.S. state of Washington. It consists of at least four overlapping stratovolcanoes that are younger from south to north. With a total volume of , Mount Meager is older than most volcanoes in the Cascade Arc, tracing its history back to 2,200,000years ago. In the Cascade Range, the oldest volcanoes are generally {{no more than a}} million years old. This includes Mount Rainier (500,000yearsold), Lassen Peak (25,000years old), Mount Jefferson (290,000years old) and Mount St. Helens (50,000years old). However, portions of Mount Meager formed in the last million years. The volcano is made of volcanic rocks ranging from rhyodacite to basalt. Rhyodacite forms a series of eroded volcanic plugs which represent the highest peaks of Meager. Their flanks are covered with their eruptive products and serve as the surface expressions of intrusions. As a result, they provide <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> study the relationships between magma chambers and their lavas. The mafic, intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks of Meager were erupted from at least eight volcanic vents.|$|E

Perth had hit fever pitch and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86–81). Game 2 was played on a Friday night and Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90–80) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships.

500|$|The {{video was}} filmed {{in front of}} a live {{audience}} at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on August 10, 2012. SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology, the structure design and projection mapping that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital. 10 20K HLM Barco projectors were placed and mapping was done using Pandora's widget designer and 5 Pandora's Dual Box servers. The final video had an 8856 x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels, since each projector was turned on its side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure. Two slices were fed into each system and SuperUber did the warping and edge blending inside Pandora. The screen which was used was over 12,000 square feet; Lucas Werthein, a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted compound curve adding that from an engineering standpoint, it is [...] "extremely complex". It was custom-designed to mold {{to the inside of the}} General Assembly Hall. It spanned 68m X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection. Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200,000 lumens, creating one continuous giant image. The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was sewn by forty five people. The whole structure, which was hanging off the UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds. Werthein revealed, [...] "In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly." [...] Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface: [...] "What makes the mapping so effective is the way in which it can fill the space, making those pictures immersive on a grand architectural scale. It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place." [...] Russ Rive, SuperUber’s director said, [...] "It’s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging, with its goldplated panel and grand volume. By adding a virtual layer to it, we could digitally rebuild it, playing with the architectural elements, and therefore changing the notion of something static. The technology made the integration between animation and architecture. We used projectors to 'paint with light' the UN General Assembly’s Hall – <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> transform such an emblematic place." ...|$|E
