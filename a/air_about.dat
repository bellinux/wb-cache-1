5|$|Vildanden AS ("The Wild Duck") was a virtual, {{regional}} airline {{based at}} Skien Airport, Geiteryggen in Norway, {{where it was}} the only airline. With operations starting in 2005, it flew to Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger using a Jetstream 32 and an ATR 42, which is wet leased from Danish Air Transport (DAT) and Helitrans. Previously, the airline has also served Stockholm and Molde, and has also operated Saab 340 aircraft, operated by Coast Air, Air Aurora and Avitrans. The airline hadbeen in conflict with Coast <b>Air</b> <b>about</b> terminating the wet lease agreement. The company has had to be bailed out several times, including by the municipality, until it managed to make its first profit in 2009. It ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in January 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} AOM {{is related to}} {{childhood}} anatomy and immune function. Either bacteria or viruses may be involved. Risk factors include exposure to smoke, use of pacifiers, and attending daycare. It occurs more commonly among Indigenous peoples {{and those who have}} Down syndrome. OME frequently occurs following AOM and may be related to viral upper respiratory infections, irritants such as smoke, or allergies. Looking at the eardrum is important for making the correct diagnosis. Signs of AOM include bulging or a lack of movement of the tympanic membrane from a puff of <b>air.</b> <b>About</b> 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.|$|E
25|$|On May 27, {{during the}} first stages {{of the battle of}} Goose Green, several Harrier sorties hit the Argentine {{advanced}} positions to the north in support of the assault, but the Close Air Support mission was complicated by bad weather and poor communications.

The aircraft, Harrier nº XZ998, exploded in the <b>air</b> <b>about</b> 5,000 meters from GADA 601's position. Sqn Ldr Iveson bailed out safely and was rescued by friendly forces three days later. Many of the aircraft shot down by ground defences were hit after making repeated passes over the target, and the wisdom of these tactics was repeatedly questioned.|$|E

25|$|Americium-241 is {{an alpha}} emitter with a {{half-life}} of 432.6 years. Alpha particle radiation, {{as opposed to}} beta (electron) and gamma (electromagnetic) radiation, is used for two additional reasons: alpha particles have high ionization, so sufficient air particles will be ionized for the current to exist, and they have low penetrative power, meaning they will be stopped, safely, by the plastic of the smoke detector or the <b>air.</b> <b>About</b> {{one percent of the}} emitted radioactive energy of 241Am is gamma radiation. The amount of elemental americium-241 is small enough to be exempt from the regulations applied to larger sources. It includes about 37kBq or 1µCi of radioactive element americium-241 (241Am), corresponding to about 0.3µg of the isotope. This provides sufficient ion current to detect smoke, while producing a very low level of radiation outside the device.|$|E
25|$|Any object {{containing}} pointed {{metal can}} create an electric arc (sparks) when microwaved. This includes cutlery, crumpled aluminium foil (though some foil used in microwaves are safe, see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire; or into a pointed shape. Forks {{are a good}} example: the tines of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This {{has the effect of}} exceeding the dielectric breakdown of <b>air,</b> <b>about</b> 3 megavolts per meter (3×106 V/m). The air forms a conductive plasma, which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some ozone and nitrogen oxides are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Don was {{generally}} well received by critics. Mayank Shekhar from Mumbai Mirror gave the film {{a rating of}} 4 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "The former was a character-driven, intimate film, albeit a fairly slick thriller, mostly for its screenplay. The latter is a most updated Indian film of the action genre that always calculably concentrates on the new twists, and the turning points, both of which mostly seem cleverer than contrived; ably fitting pieces, the known characters, into a new domino." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave a mixed review, saying that the film was [...] "conventional and predictable", and complained that the director did not develop his characters. However, Sen was impressed by Chopra's performance, calling it [...] "film's biggest surprise", and wrote, [...] "Stepping into Zeenat Aman's shoes is a tough task, but she doesn't really waste time pretending to be the stunner's successor. Chopra handles her role with efficiency, looking every bit the competent woman of actionand a ravishing babe who fills out a skintight white jumpsuit deliciously. Roma is a hard part to play, but Priyanka has a no-nonsense <b>air</b> <b>about</b> her throughout the film. This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic. Not to mention a great smile." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted {{the words}} [...] "Trois Jours" [...] ("Three Days"), {{along with a}} picture of the {{official}} single artwork, via TwitPic. Gaga is shown topless in the black-and-white cover art and displays the tattoos on her back. Her hair is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulders. The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran. Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the [...] "stark black and white image" [...] had a glossy eighties <b>air</b> <b>about</b> it. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga looked almost [...] "animalistic" [...] in the picture, and her flowing hair made her look like a creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was [...] "totally and completely fierce". Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover art and [...] Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single [...] "2 Hearts". Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's [...] "wild side" [...] and her [...] "glamorous" [...] looks. Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make-up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song.|$|E
500|$|Returning home, Brian informs Lois that Limbaugh will {{be coming}} over for dinner. That night, Lois and Peter begin arguing and {{challenging}} Limbaugh politically. Deciding to confront Limbaugh for brainwashing Brian, Lois demands for their dog {{to go back to}} the way he used to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on [...] "The Company Way", [...] "Republican Town". Angered, Brian decides to move out and become roommates with a reluctant Limbaugh. Brian begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces lots of Limbaugh's possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Deciding to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, Brian attempts to voice his own political opinions on the <b>air</b> <b>about</b> Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, causing Limbaugh to become frustrated and throw him out. Deciding to prove his devotion to the conservative cause, Brian attempts to waterboard Pelosi before being apprehended and arrested. After being bailed out by Limbaugh later that day, Brian continues to assert his conservatism. Limbaugh attempts to convince Brian he is only fighting against the Establishment due to his desire of being the underdog. He tells Brian that a child was executed in Texas and Brian is visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Rush leaves the jail, making a Grapes of Wrath-like pledge to [...] "be around" [...] wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance, and the episode ends with Limbaugh then transforming into a bald eagle and flying away into the skyline.|$|E

500|$|Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton {{describe}} de Lucía as a [...] "titanic {{figure in}} the world of flamenco guitar", highlighting his [...] "astounding technique and inventiveness" [...] and his broad range of musical ideas from other styles, such as Brazilian music and jazz. He is noted for his innovation and colour in harmony and his remarkable dexterity, technique, strength and fluidity in his right hand, capable of executing extremely fast and fluent picados. A master of contrast, he often juxtaposes picados with rasgueados and other techniques and often adds abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. Bill Milkowski of Down Beat described him as [...] "the portrait of studied concentration and pristine perfection: stiff backed and stern faced, with a distinguished <b>air</b> <b>about</b> him that some might misread as haughtiness. He's proud and majestic, like a regal Arabian steed prancing with grace and elegance, yet able to reveal great power." [...] Craig Harris of AllMusic noted his [...] "deeply personal melodic statements and modern instrumentation." [...] Atlanta magazine said, [...] "The guitar, when used properly, {{can be one of the}} most haunting and beautiful instruments to create sound... when he brushes his fingers across the strings, [...] can create some of the most incredible music. It's almost like a lullaby." [...] José Luis Acosta, president of the Spanish Artists and Editors Society stated that [...] "Paco was and will be a universal artist, who took the guitar and flamenco sentiment to the heart of the whole world." [...] In 2015, Billboard magazine named de Lucía as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time, an editor writes: [...] "The virtuoso intrumentalist popularized flamenco worldwide, and brought the Spanish sound to the forefront of avant-garde jazz.". In the same year, he was posthumously inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame for his contributions to flamenco music. On December 21, 2016, Google commemorated the anniversary of de Lucia's birth with a Google Doodle shown in Spain, Mexico, and several South American nations.|$|E
