5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (<b>AIDS)</b> {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop <b>AIDS</b> within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of <b>AIDS</b> are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis.

5|$|People with <b>AIDS</b> have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with <b>AIDS</b> and is the initial sign of <b>AIDS</b> in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with <b>AIDS</b> because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>aid</b> {{bombardment}} which often occurs in priority issues of <b>aid</b> to developing countries, and aims {{to find the}} most effective and feasible modality to resolve <b>aid</b> bombardment.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirics of <b>aid</b> and growth by investigating whether <b>aid</b> modality matters in explaining its effectiveness. For this purpose, we include the four main <b>aid</b> modalities (project <b>aid,</b> financial programme <b>aid,</b> technical assistance grants and food <b>aid)</b> as explanatory variables in an endogenous growth model. Using the GMM-SYS approach to dynamic panel estimator we test the three main competing specifications in the <b>aid</b> and growth literature for a sample of <b>aid</b> recipient countries over the 1974 - 2001 period. We find that project <b>aid</b> exerts a positive and significant impact on growth, thus casting doubt on the so-called “micromacro paradox”. Our results also show that financial programme <b>aid</b> generally impacts on growth negatively, while the impact of non-financial <b>aid,</b> technical assistance grants and food <b>aid,</b> is statistically insignificant. We found, however, no {{evidence to suggest that}} policy enhances the growth effect of the <b>aid</b> categories.

40|$|How does {{respect for}} human rights affect the {{disbursement}} of food <b>aid</b> by US foreign policymakers? Scholars analyzing foreign <b>aid</b> generally look at only total economic <b>aid,</b> military <b>aid</b> or a combination of both. However, for a more nuanced understanding of human rights as a determinant of foreign <b>aid,</b> the discrete foreign <b>aid</b> programs must be examined. By disentangling component-programs from total <b>aid,</b> this analysis demonstrates how human rights influence policymakers by allowing them to distribute food <b>aid</b> to human rights abusing countries. Consequently, policymakers can promote strategic objectives with food <b>aid,</b> while legally restricted from distributing other <b>aid.</b> The primary theoretical argument, which links increasing human rights abuse with increasing food <b>aid,</b> is supported by results from a Heckman model. This procedure models the two-stage decision-making process where foreign policymakers first, select countries for <b>aid</b> and then, distribute <b>aid</b> to those selected. i...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the fungibility of foreign <b>aid</b> and makes three {{contributions to the}} existing literature. Firstly, fungibility of <b>aid</b> at the aggregate level is reexamined on a richer panel dataset of 91 developing countries for 1980 - 2009, taking into account endogeneity of <b>aid</b> and autocorrelation in residuals. Results indicate that <b>aid</b> is strongly fungible: around 80 % is substituting rather than increasing government spending in the short run. There is also substantial heterogeneity in the sample, with <b>aid</b> being more fungible for countries with a low share of <b>aid</b> in GDP. Secondly, <b>aid</b> is disaggregated into bilateral and multilateral components. Despite substantial differences between both components, there are only very small indications that multilateral <b>aid</b> is less fungible than bilateral <b>aid</b> and estimates are volatile when <b>aid</b> is instrumented. Thirdly, this study attempts to distinguish between off- and on-budget <b>aid</b> at the aggregate level using the value of technical cooperation {{as a proxy for}} off-budget <b>aid.</b> While on-budget <b>aid</b> is strongly fungible, off-budget <b>aid</b> is non-fungible. In the long run, around 50 % of <b>aid</b> increases government expenditures, although results are not stable.

First we discuss best practice for an ideal <b>aid</b> agency and the difficulties that <b>aid</b> agencies face because they are typically not accountable to their intended beneficiaries. Next we consider the transparency of <b>aid</b> agencies and four additional dimensions of <b>aid</b> practice: specialization, or the degree to which <b>aid</b> is not fragmented among too many donors, too many countries, and too many sectors for each donor); selectivity, or the extent to which <b>aid</b> avoids corrupt autocrats and goes to the poorest countries; use of ineffective <b>aid</b> channels such as tied <b>aid,</b> food <b>aid,</b> and technical assistance; and the overhead costs of <b>aid</b> agencies. We compare 48 <b>aid</b> agencies along these dimensions, distinguishing between bilateral and multilateral ones.

The three allocation models varied greatly {{with respect to the}} significant predictive covariates of diarrhea incidence, geographic region, and rural setting, but other <b>aid</b> allocation was a positive predictor in all three models such that areas receiving health <b>aid</b> were likely to also receive substantial water <b>aid</b> and education <b>aid.</b> A significant, positive effect of health <b>aid</b> on decreasing disease severity and a significant, positive effect of water <b>aid</b> on decreasing diarrhea incidence were found through both instrumentation and propensity score matching.
