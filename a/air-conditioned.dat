5|$|Except for the partly {{at-grade}} Bishan MRT Station (North South Line), {{the entirety}} of the MRT is elevated or underground. Most below-ground stations are deep and hardened enough to withstand conventional aerial bomb attacks and to serve as bomb shelters. Mobile phone and 3G service is available in every part of the network. Underground stations and the trains themselves are <b>air-conditioned,</b> while above-ground stations have ceiling fans installed.|$|E
5|$|John was succeeded as {{owner of}} Rùm by his son, George (later Sir George). George built Kinloch Castle in 1900 using {{sandstone}} quarried at Annan. The interior boasted an orchestrion that could simulate {{the sounds of}} brass, drum and woodwind, an <b>air-conditioned</b> billiards room, and a jacuzzi. A dam was built on Coire Dubh burn for hydroelectric purposes; the house was the first private home in Scotland, outside of Glasgow, to have an electricity supply.|$|E
5|$|Opened on 6 March 2000, the Marine Parade Community Club is {{equipped}} with a glass-walled gymnasium overlooking part of the East Coast Parkway, a covered basketball court on the rooftop and an <b>air-conditioned</b> sports hall.

5|$|The {{airplane}} {{itself has}} been moved to Airport City Accra, a suburb of Accra near to Kotoka International Airport and opposite Marina Mall Accra, with people entering and exiting the plane/restaurant via a covered staircase from ground level. They enter through the former first class seating area, which has {{been converted into a}} waiting area. Separate bathrooms have been installed for male and female diners and the restaurant is <b>air-conditioned</b> throughout.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of deep-freeze and the <b>air-conditioned</b> hypermarché, these {{seasonal}} variations are less marked than hitherto, {{but they are still}} observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. Crayfish, for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season. Moreover, they do not freeze well.|$|E
5|$|At , the 21-story Milam Building in {{downtown}} San Antonio, Texas was the tallest brick and reinforced concrete {{structure in the}} United States {{when it opened in}} 1928, as well as the first high-rise <b>air-conditioned</b> office building. The building was designed by George Willis, engineered by M.L. Diver, and constructed by L.T. Wright and Company. The building was named in honor of the Republic of Texas historical figure Benjamin Milam, noted for his leadership during the Texas Revolution. In keeping with that motif, the only flag that flies atop the tower is the Lone Star flag.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Nan Chiau High School {{celebrated its}} 68th school anniversary. Themed “Appreciating our Past, Inspiring the Future”, {{the event was}} graced by Guest-of-Honour, Minister for Defence, Dr Ng Eng Hen, which saw {{the school and the}} {{community}} coming together to mark the occasion with a celebration of SG50, the outstanding achievements of the students, as well as the completion of the school’s upgrading works which costed a total of 2.67 million dollars. The school upgrading works were co-funded by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, comprising a revamp of canteen, <b>air-conditioned</b> library, as well as the construction of the park square and a new 300 seat auditorium.|$|E
5|$|The 50-seat coaches {{featured}} 2x2 seating, with baggage racks in {{the vestibule}} end and separate men's and women's restrooms in the other. The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space devoted to a kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the car a maximum occupancy of 22. The sleeper-lounge-observation car included a compartment, five more double bedrooms, and a rear observation area which seated 22. The cars were <b>air-conditioned</b> throughout.|$|E
5|$|The current {{building}} sits on {{reclaimed land}} first {{occupied by the}} Marine Parade Community Centre, which {{was built in the}} early 1980s and later renamed to Marine Parade Community Club. In March 1995, the People's Association (PA) announced plans to spend S$9.56 million to upgrade 54 community centres and clubs that were over ten years old, adding facilities such as lifts, dance studios, karaoke rooms and multi-purpose <b>air-conditioned</b> activities rooms, to make community centres more user-friendly, with open concept offices and reception areas.|$|E
5|$|Troop {{hospital}} cars, {{also based}} on the troop sleeper carbody, transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each. Each had 38 berths for patients, 30 of which were arranged in the central section of the car in three tiers on each side. There was also a section with six berths {{which could be used}} for isolation cases as well as private compartments for special cases. Each unit was ice <b>air-conditioned</b> and came fitted with a shower room along with a modern kitchen with the latest equipment.|$|E
5|$|Buses, {{which are}} the most {{commonly}} used mode of transport, are run by government agencies and private operators. Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company. The slow-moving tram services are restricted to certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains that fall during the summer monsoon, can interrupt transportation networks. Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes, and yellow metered taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer <b>air-conditioned</b> radio taxis are also in service. In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips.|$|E
5|$|During {{the start}} of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, President Manuel Quezon hired Paris-trained Filipino {{architect}} Andrés Luna de San Pedro, son of painter Juan Luna, to take charge of the renovations of the Manila Hotel. It was done {{under the supervision of the}} renowned engineering firm Pedro Siochi and Company. The hotel was the residence of General Douglas MacArthur when he became the Military Advisor of the Commonwealth. Luna converted the hotel's top floor into an elegant penthouse and expanded the west wing northward – creating the <b>air-conditioned</b> annex - and designed some key public rooms like the Fiesta Pavilion, then the biggest function room of the hotel. The hotel was the site of festivities during the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth government in November, 1935.|$|E
5|$|Manila is {{the site}} of {{prominent}} Catholic churches and institutions. There are 113 Catholic churches within the city limits; 63 are considered as major shrines, basilicas, or a cathedral. The Manila Cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila and the oldest established church in the country. Aside from the Manila Cathedral, there are also three other basilicas in the city: Quiapo Church, Binondo Church, and the Minor Basilica of San Sebastián. The San Agustín Church in Intramuros is a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{and is one of the}} two fully <b>air-conditioned</b> Catholic churches in the city. Manila also has other parishes located throughout the city, with some of them dating back to the Spanish Colonial Period when the city serves as the base for numerous Catholic missions both within the Philippines and to Asia beyond.|$|E
5|$|Freshly {{relocated}} from Sacramento, the San Antonio Texans {{finally found}} {{success on the}} field in 1995 playing in the brand new Alamodome. The Alamodome offered two advantages over other U.S. facilities - it was a multi-purpose facility with retractable seating that could accommodate a full size CFL field, also, it was an indoor, <b>air-conditioned</b> facility which meant the teams playing there {{did not have to}} deal with the summer heat. The team continued to be bankrolled by the enthusiastic Fred Anderson. Archer, entering his fifth year as Anderson's quarterback, led the second best offence in the league; he nevertheless suffered an injury late in the season, prompting the team to hire 45-year-old Joe Ferguson (whom Stephenson had coached as a member of the Buffalo Bills) out of retirement to serve as a backup. They finished 12–6 and finally made the playoffs. In the first round they trounced Birmingham, 51–9, before falling to the Baltimore Stallions, 21–11, in the South Division final. Team attendance was around the same level Anderson had previously seen in Sacramento.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II the paintings were evacuated to various locations in Wales, including Penrhyn Castle and the university colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth. In 1940, as the Battle of France raged, a more secure home was sought, and there were discussions about moving the paintings to Canada. This idea was firmly rejected by Winston Churchill, who wrote in a telegram to the director Kenneth Clark, “bury them in caves or in cellars, but not a picture shall leave these islands”. Instead a slate quarry at Manod, near Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales, was requisitioned for the Gallery's use. In the seclusion afforded by the paintings' new location, the Keeper (and future director) Martin Davies began to compile scholarly catalogues on the collection, helped {{by the fact that}} the Gallery's library was also stored in the quarry. The move to Manod confirmed the importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity, something the Gallery's conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove. This eventually resulted in the first <b>air-conditioned</b> gallery opening in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Another {{initiative}} was {{to phase out}} non <b>air-conditioned</b> buses from its fleet. On 17 August 2002, NWFB's last non <b>air-conditioned</b> bus was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday 16 August 2006, {{the first}} <b>air-conditioned</b> 42-seat {{rear-view}} Northerner/Overlander car and its <b>air-conditioned</b> 49-seat day car running mate, {{were taken to}} Hutt Workshops and stored, their bogies went under the ex-British Rail cars for the Wairarapa Connection.|$|E
