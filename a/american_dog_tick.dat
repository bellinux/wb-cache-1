40|$|Ticks are {{the vector}} of many {{human and animal}} diseases; and host {{detection}} is critical to this process. Ticks have a unique sensory structure located exclusively on the 1 st pairs of legs; the fore-tarsal Haller’s organ, not found in any other animals, presumed to function like the insect antennae in chemosensation but morphologically very different. The mechanism of tick chemoreception is unknown. Utilizing next-generation sequencing and comparative transcriptomics between the 1 st and 4 th legs (the latter without the Haller’s organ), we characterized 1 st leg specific and putative Haller’s organ specific transcripts from adult <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>ticks,</b> Dermacentor variabilis. The analysis suggested that the Haller’s organ is involved in olfaction, not gustation. No known odorant binding proteins like those found in insects, chemosensory lipocalins or typical insect olfactory mechanisms were identified; with the transcriptomic data only supporting a possible olfactory G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signal cascade unique to the Haller’s organ. Each component of the olfactory GPCR signal cascade was identified and characterized. The expression of GPCR, Gαo and β-arrestin transcripts identified exclusively in the 1 st leg transcriptome, and putatively Haller’s organ specific, were examined in unfed and blood-fed adult female and male D. variabilis. Blood feeding to repletion in adult females down-regulated the expression of all three chemosensory transcripts in females but not in males; consistent with differences in post-feeding tick behavior between sexes and an expected reduced chemosensory function in females as they leave the host. Data are presented {{for the first time}} of the potential hormonal regulation of tick chemosensation; behavioral assays confirmed the role of the Haller’s organ in N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) repellency but showed no role for the Haller’s organ in host attachment.

50|$|While in Montana, Ricketts and his {{assistant}} discovered that the vector that carried the pathogen for Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick, the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni; some other species of ticks, such as the <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> or wood <b>tick,</b> Dermacentor variabilis, also are vectors). It was not at once clear what kind of organism the pathogen was; eventually it was named Rickettsia, {{the first of the}} Rickettsiales to be identified. However, for decades, until electron microscopy and other technologies became sufficiently advanced, it was not known whether Rickettsiales were bacteria, viruses, or something in between. They now are known to be bacteria specialised for intracellular parasitism.|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of tick-borne diseases {{has been increasing}} in the United States {{for the past couple}} decades. Studies have been conducted throughout the US identifying tick-borne disease pathogens as well as their hosts and prevalence. Research was conducted in Nebraska to determine the presence of some tick-borne disease pathogens, their vectors, and their hosts, with emphasis made on Borrelia spp., Rickettsia rickettsii, and Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Small rodents in southeast Nebraska were trapped and sampled at eight study sites using live capture traps. Captured rodents were assessed for active parasitism by ticks which were collected and placed in alcohol. Tissue samples were then taken and analyzed using PCR for Rickettsia rickettsii and Borrelia sp. spirochetes. All 504 ticks collected from the 212 various rodents were identified as either larval or nymphal <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>ticks,</b> Dermacentor variabilis (Say). Infestation prevalence was 51 % (109 / 212) total with highest prevalence seen in Peromyscus maniculatus (58 %), Peromyscus leucopus (51 %) and Mus musculus (35 %). No evidence of either pathogen was identified by PCR. Retropharyngeal lymph node samples from across Nebraska were taken from hunter-killed deer during the open rifle season and analyzed for the presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Borrelia sp. spirochetes by PCR. Lymph node samples from southeast Nebraska, south-central Nebraska, and mid-central Nebraska were selected for analysis. Ehrlichia chaffeensis was identified in lymph node samples from all three study sets. Southeast Nebraska had 10 positive samples (10 / 49 – 20 %), south-central had 14 positive samples (14 / 50 – 28 %) and mid-central had one positive result (1 / 50 – 2 %). The overall prevalence from all localities tested was 17 % (25 / 149). No positive PCR samples were identified containing Borrelia sp. DNA. This study demonstrates that lone star tick-associated pathogens are present in Nebraska wildlife. Transmission of these pathogens is probable as white-tailed deer are reservoirs for some of the pathogens demonstrated in this study. Further epidemiological and ecological studies are warranted as these organisms are of veterinary and public health importance. Advisor: Roberto Cortina...|$|R

5000|$|Tick {{paralysis}} {{is believed}} to be due to toxins found in the tick's saliva that enter the bloodstream while the tick is feeding. The two ticks most commonly associated with North American tick paralysis are the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) and the <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>tick</b> (Dermacentor variabilis); however, 43 tick species have been implicated in human disease around the world. Most North American cases of tick paralysis occur from April to June, when adult Dermacentor ticks emerge from hibernation and actively seek hosts.

50|$|This fungus usually {{occurs as}} a mold present in {{numerous}} {{different types of}} soil as well as various decaying types of organic matter. Microascus brevicaulis has a world-wide distribution, and occurs chiefly as a soil saprotroph. The species is also encountered with some frequency as a non-dermatophyte agent of nail infections (onychomycosis), particularly in toenails. Besides the typical soil life of a decomposer, this fungus is also known to live within the <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>tick,</b> Dermacentor variabilis. This relationship seems to be highly adapted but not as a classic host-parasite interaction. Studies have shown M. brevicaulis inhabits its host as an endosymbiont, and may provides protection against the insect-pathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae.|$|E

40|$|Ticks in the Ixodes ricinus-species complex {{have been}} implicated as vectors of Lyme disease spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi). A {{variety of other}} <b>ticks,</b> notably <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>ticks</b> (Dermacentor variabilis) and Lone Star ticks (Amblyomma americanum) in the U. S., appear {{incapable}} of transmitting Lyme disease spirochetes despite ingesting these bacteria. In this study, I confirmed that deer <b>ticks,</b> but not <b>dog</b> <b>ticks</b> or Lone Star ticks became infected with Lyme disease spirochetes after feeding on infected hosts. In addition, I assessed several potential physiologic factors that could affect the ability of ticks to acquire, maintain, and transmit B. burgdorferi. One factor in particular, found in tick saliva, appears responsible for preventing spirochete killing in I. scapularis but not D. variabilis or A. americanum. In one study, I assessed anti-microbial activity of the tick 2 ̆ 7 s immune system. In particular, I determined whether ticks exhibited measurable phenoloxidase and antimicrobial activity. Phenoloxidase activity in the hemolymph of larvae of the greater wax moth (Galleria me/lone/la L) was compared to phenoloxidase activity in I. scapularis, D. variabilis and A. americanum. Although activity was detected in wax moth hemolymph, no phenoloxidase activity was detected in three species of ixodid ticks. In addition, Enterobacter cloacae was used {{in an attempt to}} induce anti-microbial activity in punched cuticle of three species of ixodid ticks. Using this assay, no anti-microbial activity was detected in ticks. Moreover, no anti-microbial substances were found in the midgut of I. scapularis, D. variabilis and A. americanum. Factors associated with the tick 2 ̆ 7 s humoral immunity do not appear {{to play a role in}} vector competence for Lyme disease spirochetes. In another study, host-associated borreliacidal factors were examined in vitro. Spirochetes survived in the presence of pre-immune rabbit serum but were killed in the presence ofimmune rabbit serum. Heat-inactivation (56 °C, 1 hr) destroyed the killing effect of immune serum but the borreliacidal activity of heat-inactivated immune serum could be restored by the addition of pre-immune serum. Using a similar assay, spirochetes survived in tick midgut extract cultures when ticks were removed from preimmune hosts. Spirochetes also survived in I. scapularis midgut extract cultures, but not in D. variabilis or A. americanum midgut extract cultures when ticks were removed from immune hosts. As it did in immune serum, heat-inactivation destroyed the killing effect of D. variabilis and A. americanum midgut extract cultures. An indirect immunofluoresence assay indicated that anti-B. burgdorferi antibody concentrations were similar in both the host and the tick midgut extract. Taken together, these experiments suggest that borreliacidal activity of host immune serum is mediated by the activity of complement. Furthermore, this same activity is found in the midgut of D. variabilis and A. americanum feeding on immune hosts but is not found in I. scapularis. Since vector competence appeared to be related to the activity of host antibody and complement in the tick midgut, I determined whether substances existed in I. scapularis that might inhibit or inactivate antibody or complement. We tested for the presence of an antibody-cleaving enzyme in the gut extract of I. scapularis and were unable to demonstrate any activity in several dilutions of gut extract after 30 minutes at 37 oc. A spirochete survival assay was performed in cobra venom, which possesses powerful anticomplement activity, and in the saliva collected from I. scapularis, D. variabilis and A. americanum.

50|$|The brown <b>dog</b> <b>tick</b> (Rhipicephalus sanguineus), {{commonly}} called kennel <b>tick,</b> or pan-tropical <b>dog</b> <b>tick,</b> is {{a species of}} tick which is found worldwide, but more commonly in warmer climates. This species is unusual among ticks in that its entire life cycle can be completed indoors.|$|R
50|$|Ticks can {{contract}} R. rickettsii by many means. First, an uninfected tick {{can become}} infected when feeding {{on the blood}} of an infected vertebrate host; such as a rabbit, during the larval or nymph stages, this mode of transmission called transstadial transmission. Once a tick becomes infected with this pathogen, they are infected for life. Both the <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>tick</b> and the Rocky Mountain wood tick serve as long-term reservoirs for Rickettsia rickettsii, in which the organism resides in the tick posterior diverticulae of the midgut, the small intestine and the ovaries. In addition, an infected male tick can transmit the organism to an uninfected female during mating. Once infected, the female tick can transmit the infection to her offspring, in {{a process known as}} transovarial transmission.|$|E
50|$|The {{two major}} vectors of R. rickettsii in the United States are the <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>tick</b> and the Rocky Mountain wood tick. American dog ticks are widely {{distributed}} {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains and they also occur in limited areas along the Pacific Coast. Dogs and medium-sized mammals are the preferred hosts of an adult American dog ticks, although it feeds readily on other large mammals, including human beings. This tick is the most commonly identified species responsible for transmitting R. rickettsii to humans. Rocky Mountain wood ticks (Dermacentor andersoni) {{are found in the}} Rocky Mountain states and in southwestern Canada. The life cycle of this tick may require up to three years for its completion. The adult ticks feed primarily on large mammals. The larvae and nymphs feed on small rodents.|$|E
5000|$|The {{life cycle}} for Cytauxzoon felis {{has not been}} {{completely}} described. Bobcats become persistent carriers of the organism after they develop mild or subclinical infection and then serve as the reservoir host.

[...] Many other types of ticks may feed on the cats but the only other tick that {{has been shown to}} transmit the organism is the <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>tick</b> (Dermacentor variabilis) but only in a research setting. [...] In the past domestic cats were thought to always die from infection so they were considered terminal hosts or [...] "dead end hosts".

5000|$|Babesia bovis {{protozoa}} {{are transmitted}} by R. microplus and cause babesiosis or redwater fever in cattle throughout the tropics and subtropics wherever this boophilid species occurs. The less pathogenic Ba. bigemina is transmitted by R. microplus and R. decoloratorus. Development of Babesia in the tick {{is complex and}} includes sexual reproduction. These Babesia are transmitted from adult female boophilid ticks to the next generation, as larvae, by infection of the eggs. This is known as transovarian transmission; it provides the only opportunity for transmission through one-host ticks. Other species of Babesia are transmitted by three-host ticks in ways similar to Theileria protozoa, as described below. In cattle, infection of the red blood cells may grow rapidly to create a potentially fatal inflammatory crisis of the blood. The name redwater (coloured urine) derives from the hemoglobinuria caused by the destruction of red blood cells infected with the merozoite stage of Babesia; anemia results from the same destruction. Horses suffer babesiosis or biliary fever when infected by Ba. equi or B. caballi. This occurs in many countries where vector ticks are found, such as R. e. evertsi, Hy. truncatum, and D. nitens. Dogs are at risk from severe infection with Ba. canis and its subspecies, transmitted by the dog ticks R. sanguineus, D. reticulatus, and Ha. leachi. Domestic cats become infected with Ba. felis and Ba. cati from feeding ticks. Cytauxzoon felis is a protozoan related to Babesia and Theileria. It is transmitted by the <b>American</b> <b>dog</b> <b>tick,</b> Dermacentor variabilis. This microbe circulates between wild bobcats in southern USA, causing little apparent disease. If it infects domestic cats, it causes a cytauxzoonosis that is eventually fatal. 11Theileria annulata is a protozoan closely related to Babesia. In cattle, it causes the disease tropical theileriosis throughout a long arc of countries from Morocco across to China. [...] Theileria parva is the causative microbe of East Coast fever of cattle in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa. Theileria species infect monocytic white blood cells of their hosts. The infected cells are induced to divide by the Theileria, which then proliferates within each daughter cell, in a rapidly expanding infection. This causes multiple inflammatory crises, of which pulmonary edema is a predominant cause of death. Theileria annulata is transmitted by Hy. a. anatolicum, Hy. detritum, and other hyalommas. Theileria parva is transmitted predominantly by Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Because this is a three-host feeding tick, the opportunities for transmission are from infected cow to feeding larva then through the molt into the nymph which feeds and transmits. Similarly, also, transmission can be from feeding nymphs to infected adult. This is known as transstadial transmission, and no transovarian transmission occurs in this case. The development of Theileria in ticks includes sexual reproduction which enables generation of new variants that can evade the immune mechanisms of cattle.|$|E
