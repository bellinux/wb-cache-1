5|$|After lynching Sam Carter, the mob met Sylvester Carrier—Aaron's {{cousin and}} Sarah's son—on a road <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{to get out}} of town. Carrier refused, and when the mob moved on, he {{suggested}} gathering {{as many people as possible}} for protection.|$|E
5|$|According to Gary Oldman, {{very little}} was written about Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, {{a list of}} contacts, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to do his own research. Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters {{to prepare for the}} role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Jean-Pierre Lafitte {{defeated}} Bob Holly {{in a standard}} dark match. In the weeks preceding the event, the WWF ran a competition to win a house in Orlando, Florida. Todd Pettengill and Stephanie Wiand showed footage {{of the home and}} later hand-picked one of the entries. They phoned Matt Pomposelli of Henderson, Nevada <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he and his family had won the vacant home. The home was officially presented to Pomposelli on the May 22 episode of Raw.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{his early}} years, Linnæus {{seemed to have a}} liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which {{immediately}} calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> their names. Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Reverend Francis Dixon of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth, England, began hearing several testimonies {{from people}} who became Christians after Jenner accosted them on George Street, Sydney. The {{following}} year, Dixon met with Jenner in Australia <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about the people he had met who had become Christians {{as a result of}} Jenner's evangelism, and Jenner, then fifty years old, cried because he had not previously known that even one of the people he had talked to had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith.|$|E

5|$|In {{almost all}} {{versions}} of the tale, Ila wants to live as a man, but in the Skanda Purana, Ila desires to be a woman. The king Ela (Ila) entered Parvati's grove at Sahya mountain and became the woman Ilā. Ilā wished to remain a woman and serve Parvati (Gauri) and Ganga, the goddess of the Ganges river. However, the goddesses dissuaded him <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that life as a woman was a curse and full of sorrow. Ilā bathed in a sacred pool and returned as Ela, bearded and deep-voiced.|$|E
5|$|Police visited Brady {{in prison}} again <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of Hindley's confession, which {{at first he}} refused to believe.

5|$|Reich {{lost his}} {{position}} at the New School in May 1941 after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, to say he had saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator. Johnson was aware of Reich's claims that he could cure cancer, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also evicted from Kessel Street after his neighbours complained about the animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.|$|E

5|$|The French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier later {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} the new substance independently. Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele also posted a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it (a copy of the letter was found in Scheele's belongings after his death).|$|E
5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E
5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she was dying. He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00, as Scott's ships neared Cape Hunter at the {{northwest}} end of Guadalcanal, three of Scott's cruisers launched floatplanes. One crashed on takeoff, {{but the other}} two patrolled over Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and Ironbottom Sound. As the floatplanes were launched, Jojima's force was just passing around the mountainous northwestern shoulder of Guadalcanal, and neither force sighted each other. At 22:20, Jojima radioed Gotō <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that no U.S. ships were in the vicinity. Although Jojima's force later heard Scott's floatplanes overhead while unloading along {{the north shore of}} Guadalcanal, they failed to report this to Gotō.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the injury}} was still {{believed}} to be minor and Cloutier volunteered to continue playing in lieu of backup Mathieu Garon also being sidelined with a broken finger. When {{the pain in his}} hip quickly got worse, Cloutier appealed to team management. He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip labrum <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the injury could put his career in jeopardy. He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 miles away from the clinic. The Kings' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E
5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} leave, as Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from {{his work at the}} Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought that he might be more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1942, over 1,000 {{children}} {{that had been}} rounded up during the Kozara Offensive were being held at the Stara Gradiška concentration camp, itself a sub-camp of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Information {{about the plight of}} these children was passed to concerned citizens in the NDH capital, Zagreb, one of whom was Diana Budisavljević, an Austrian. Budisavljević approached an Ustaše-appointed {{member of the board of}} the Croatian Red Cross, Kamilo Brosler, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about the children at Stara Gradiška. Brosler was horrified, and with the support of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross began to place pressure on the NDH government to release the children. Budisavljević also used her contacts with the German Army to intervene with the Ustaše regime on behalf of the children.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Stafford {{stopped by}} Shepard's office <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that an {{otologist}} in Los Angeles {{had developed a}} cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.|$|E
5|$|In town, Creger {{watched as}} a forward element of the German {{infantry}} advanced, with weapons slung, into Lanzerath. They obviously {{did not expect to}} encounter any Americans. Creger radioed Bouck <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. As he returned to the American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E
