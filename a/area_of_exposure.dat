40|$|Despite marked {{national}} concern, {{the number}} of published public health investigations of organic chemical hazardous wastes is small. Moreover, the extant literature provides little or no convincing evidence, either positive or negative, as to the question whether waste sites are harmful to human health.

Nanoparticles may move inside the human body in different manners (via inhalation, ingestion or skin contact), cross the cell membranes and accumulate {{for long periods of}} time. Emerging approaches in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to nanomaterials and assessment of human health effects combine the use of in vitro cell systems and advanced analytical techniques to study the perturbation of the proteome. The appropriate use of these approaches has the potential to provide information on the possible de-regulation of essential physiological cellular processes. In the present study, we investigated the modification in the proteome of the cytoplasmatic compartment of the Balb/ 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast cell line after exposure to 5 and 15 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for 72 h. Protein separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DE) followed by protein identification high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) allowed us to study the differentially expressed proteome in order to explore underlying cellular mechanisms. Differentially expressed proteins were found to cover a range of functions including stress response, cell metabolism, cell growth and cytoskeleton organization. Remarkably, even small differences in particle size (10 nm) seemed to differently affect biological mechanisms. These findings consolidate existing knowledge and permit to get more insight to the cell mechanisms affected by AuNPs exposure.

40|$|Background: The retrochiasmatic {{region is}} one of the most {{challenging}} areas to surgically expose. The authors evaluated the transcrusal approach, which involves removal of the superior and posterior semicircular canal from the ampulla to the common crus, to expose the retrochiasmatic region and compared it with the retrolabyrinthine approach, both of which are a variation of the posterior petrosal approach with hearing preservation, with a special emphasis on the influence of temporal lobe retraction. Methods: Six sides of silicone-injected cadaveric heads were dissected using two approaches: the transcrusal approach and the retrolabyrinthine approach. For each craniotomy, 3 exposure parameters in the retrochiasmatic region were measured: (1) horizontal distance, (2) vertical distance, and (3) triangular <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> at three different levels of temporal lobe retractions: 0, 5, and 10 mm of retraction from the level of the tentorial incisura. Results: Without temporal lobe retraction, only the transcrusal and not the retrolabyrinthine approach provided a direct exposure of the retrochiasmatic region, especially in the horizontal distance (p < 0. 001). At all levels of temporal lobe retraction, the transcrusal approach provided greater exposure in the horizontal and vertical distances and in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> Nonetheless, in the horizontal distance, the difference between the transcrusal and retrolabyrinthine approaches decreased along with increased temporal lobe retraction, and almost no difference was obtained at 10 mm of retraction. Conclusions: Posterior petrosal approaches can provide an excellent exposure of the retrochiasmatic region. Of these two approaches, namely, transcrusal and retrolabyrinthine with hearing preservation, the transcrusal approach offers greater exposure than the retrolabyrinthine approach. The beneficial effect of partial labyrinthectomy of the transcrusal approach to the retrochiasmatic region is accentuated in the exposure of the horizontal distance with less temporal lobe retraction. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
