The adjective renal, meaning related to the kidney, is from the Latin rēnēs, meaning kidneys; the prefix nephro- is from the Ancient Greek word for kidney, nephros (νεφρός). For example, surgical removal of the kidney is a nephrectomy, while a reduction in kidney function is called renal dysfunction.|$|E

The whole structure bears some resemblance to the nests of the hangnests (Icteridae), with the exception that the cavity is at the top. Clearly these New Zealand chaffinches were at a loss for a design when fabricating their nest.

60|$|We may also, I think, {{see in the}} {{peculiar}} organization of the entire family of the Megapodidae or Brush Turkeys, a reason why they depart so widely from the usual habits of the Class of birds. Each egg being so large as entirely to fill up the abdominal cavity and with difficulty pass {{the walls of the}} pelvis, a considerable interval is required before the successive eggs can be matured (the natives say about thirteen days). Each bird lays six or eight eggs or even more each season, so that between the first and last there may be an interval of two or three months. Now, if these eggs were hatched in the ordinary way, either the parents must keep sitting continually for this long period, or if they only began to sit after the last egg was deposited, the first would be exposed to injury by the climate, or to destruction by the large lizards, snakes, or other animals which abound in the district; because such large birds must roam about a good deal in search of food. Here then we seem to have a case in which the habits of a bird may be directly traced to its exceptional organization; for it will hardly be maintained that this <b>abnormal</b> <b>structure</b> and peculiar food were given to the Megapodidae in order that they might not exhibit that parental affection, or possess those domestic instincts so general in the Class of birds, and which so much excite our admiration.|$|E
60|$|Several {{years ago}} I was much {{struck by a}} remark to the above effect made by Mr. Waterhouse. Professor Owen, also, seems to {{have come to a}} nearly similar conclusion. It is hopeless to attempt to {{convince}} any one of the truth of the above proposition without giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which cannot possibly be here introduced. I can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality. I am aware of several causes of error, but I hope that I have made due allowances for them. It should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part, however unusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in one species or in a few species in comparison with the same part in many closely allied species. Thus, the wing of the bat is a most <b>abnormal</b> <b>structure</b> in the class of mammals; but the rule would not apply here, because the whole group of bats possesses wings; it would apply only if some one species had wings developed in a remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same genus. The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner. The term, secondary sexual characters, used by Hunter, relates to characters which are attached to one sex, but are not directly connected with the act of reproduction. The rule applies to males and females; but more rarely to females, as they seldom offer remarkable secondary sexual characters. The rule being so plainly applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters, {{may be due to the}} great variability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner--of which fact I think there can be little doubt. But that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; I particularly attended to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this order, and I am fully convinced that the rule almost always holds good. I shall, in a future work, give a list of all the more remarkable cases. I will here give only one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application. The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ extremely little even in distinct genera; but in the several species of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification; the homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the individuals of the same species is so great that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties of the same species differ more from each other in the characters derived from these important organs, than do the species belonging to other distinct genera.|$|E

60|$|Had the {{question}} been, whether the parasites which I have now described, were simply the males of the Cirripedes {{to which they}} are attached, the present summary and discussion would perhaps have been superfluous; but it is so novel a fact, that there should exist in the animal kingdom hermaphrodites, aided in their sexual functions by independent and, as I have called them, Complemental males, that a brief consideration of the evidence already advanced, and of some fresh points, will not be useless. These parasites are confined to the allied genera Ibla and Scalpellum; but they do not occur in Pollicipes,--a genus still more closely allied to Scalpellum; and it deserves notice, that their presence is only occasional in those species of Scalpellum which come nearest to Pollicipes. In the genera Ibla and Scalpellum, the facts present a singular parallelism; in both we have the simpler case of a female, with one or more males of an <b>abnormal</b> <b>structure</b> attached to her; and in both the far more extraordinary case of an hermaphrodite, with similarly attached Complemental males. In the two species of Ibla, the complemental and ordinary males resemble each other, as closely as do the corresponding hermaphrodite and female forms; so it is with two sets of the species of Scalpellum. But the males of Ibla and the males of Scalpellum certainly present no special relations to each other, as might have been expected, had they been distinct parasites independent of the animals {{to which they are}} attached, and considering that they are all Cirripedes having the same most unusual habits. On the contrary, it is certain that the animals which I consider to be the males and complemental males of the two species of Ibla, if classed by their own characters, would, from the reasons formerly assigned, form a new genus, nearer to Ibla than to the parasites of Scalpellum: so, again, the assumed males of the three latter species of Scalpellum would form two new genera, both of which would be more closely allied to Scalpellum, than to the parasites of Ibla. With respect to the parasites of the first three species of Scalpellum, they are in such an extraordinarily modified and embryonic condition, that they can hardly be compared with other Cirripedes; but certainly they do not approach the parasites of Ibla, more closely than the parasites of Scalpellum; and in the one important character of the antennæ, they are identical both with the parasitic and ordinary forms of Scalpellum. That two sets of parasites having closely similar habits, and belonging to the same sub-class, should be more closely related in their whole organisation to the animals to which they are respectively attached, than to each other, would, if the parasites were really distinct and independent creatures, be a most singular phenomenon; but on the view that they differ only sexually from the Cirripedes on which they are parasitic, this relationship is obviously what might have been expected.|$|E
