5|$|The {{first ten}} years {{following}} Kenilworth Road's renovation saw average attendances of between 15,000 and 18,000; a huge improvement {{on what the}} club had previously been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract.</b> Floodlights were installed at the ground before the 1953–54 season, and used {{for the first time}} in a friendly against Turkish side Fenerbahçe on 7 October 1953. The Oak Road terrace was extended in 1955, and promotion to the First Division for 1955–56 saw the average attendance climb as high as 21,454.|$|E
5|$|As {{the format}} of Inside No. 9 {{requires}} new characters each week, the writers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> actors {{who may have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, who played lead actor Tony and understudy Jim respectively, the episode starred Lyndsey Marshal as Laura, Julia Davis as Felicity, Rosie Cavaliero as Kirstie, Roger Sloman as Bill, Di Botcher as Jean, and Richard Cordery as Nick. In addition, Bruce Mackinnon provided the voice of an actor playing Malcolm in Macbeth, and Jo Stone-Fewings provided the voice of an actor playing Macduff.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their young}} age, the three editors were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> collaborations from {{established}} Symbolist authors, active within Romania's own Symbolist movement. Alongside their {{close friend and}} mentor Adrian Maniu (an Imagist who had been Vinea's tutor), they included N. Davidescu, Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo, Emil Isac, Claudia Millian, Ion Minulescu, I. M. Rașcu, Eugeniu Sperantia, Al. T. Stamatiad, Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est, Constantin T. Stoika, {{as well as the}} journalist and lawyer Poldi Chapier. In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, Alexandru Macedonski. Simbolul also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and Iosif Iser.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to absorb other asteroids to make their planet grow enough to become a life planet; crashing against other objects will decrease the player's mass. At this point, life forms will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. Life forms will disappear, but the player will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> planets to form a solar system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi-star systems by selecting planets from their system and make them absorb asteroids until they become another star.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its gravitational force, {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will also be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> solar systems composed of stars with lower mass {{than that of the}} player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being reduced from small star to life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E
5|$|The 747-500X concept {{featured}} {{an increased}} fuselage length of 18ft (5.5m) to 250ft (76.2m) long, and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700nautical miles (10,000mi, 16,100km), with a gross weight of over 1.0Mlb (450tonnes). The 747-600X concept featured a greater stretch to 279ft (85m) with seating for 548 passengers, {{a range of}} up to 7,700nmi (8,900mi, 14,300km), and a gross weight of 1.2Mlb (540tonnes). A third study concept, the 747-700X, would have combined the wing of the 747-600X with a widened fuselage, allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400. The cost of the changes from previous 747 models, in particular the new wing for the 747-500X and -600X, {{was estimated to be}} more than US$5billion.

5|$|The {{heyday of}} the Free State was over by the 1940s. Because of {{conflicts}} with the United States Treasury, the Hollywood Dinner Club was shut down in the late 1930s. The local clubs found {{it increasingly difficult to}} attract major entertainment figures. Gambling had been legalized in Nevada in 1931 and this distinct advantage over Galveston, and other illegal gambling centers, gradually lured mob figures such as New York City's Bugsy Siegel to Las Vegas. The competition created by the up-and-coming entertainment center in the desert substantially challenged the island on the Gulf over the next several years. Still, even during its later years, the Balinese Room was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> the likes of Tony Bennett and Peggy Lee, among others. And as late as 1950 the annual income of the Maceo empire was reportedly $3.84 million ($ in today's terms).|$|E
5|$|The listroscelidine katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis of inland Australia {{is capable}} of {{attracting}} male cicadas of the Tribe Cicadettini by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas. This example of acoustic aggressive mimicry {{is similar to the}} Photuris firefly case in that the predator's mimicry is remarkably versatile – playback experiments show that C. leucoviridis is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> males of many cicada species, including Cicadettine cicadas from other continents, even though cicada mating signals are species-specific. The evolution of versatile mimicry in C. leucoviridis may have been facilitated by constraints on song evolution in duetting communication systems in which reply signals are recognizable only by their precise timing in relation to the male song (<< 100 ms reply latency).|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} fiction in Galaxy had dipped {{towards the end}} of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's {{difficult}} editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he would almost invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in Galaxy throughout the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{packaging}} {{is essential}} nowadays. However, the huge environmental problem caused by landfill disposal of non-biodegradable polymers {{in the end}} of life has to be minimized and preferentially eliminated. The solution may rely on the use of biopolymers, in particular polysaccharides. These macromolecules with film-forming properties are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> produce <b>attracting</b> biodegradable materials, possibly applicable in food packaging. Despite all advantages of using polysaccharides obtained from different sources, some drawbacks, mostly related to their low resistance to water, mechanical performance and price, have hindered their wider use and commercialization. Nevertheless, with increasing attention and research on this field, it has been possible to trace some strategies to overcome the problems and recognize solutions. This review summarizes some of the most used polysaccharides in food packaging applications...|$|R
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the French {{lost the}} Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference {{was held to}} {{determine}} the future of Indochina. The Viet Minh were given control of North Vietnam, while the State of Vietnam controlled the territory south of the 17th parallel. The Geneva agreements, which the State of Vietnam did not sign, called for reunification elections {{to be held in}} 1956. Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as his Prime Minister, hoping Diệm would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> American aid as the French withdrew from Southeast Asia. Diệm returned to Vietnam in June 1954 and took up the post on July 7, 1954. After a series of disagreements, Diệm deposed Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum on October 23, 1955, and declared himself president of the newly-proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later. Diệm received support from the US and other anti-communist countries {{in the midst of the}} Cold War. He refused to hold national reunification elections scheduled in 1956, and asserted that Ho would rig the ballots in the north, although he had done so himself in deposing Bảo Đại. In the meantime, Diệm continued to consolidate his rule and stabilize his new nation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the eighth}} season of The X-Files, David Duchovny {{announced}} that he would be completely leaving the show. As such, the future of the show was up in the air. Before greenlighting a ninth season, neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members knew if creator Chris Carter would return for another season. With this being said, he encouraged {{the other members of the}} crew to continue the series without him. Eventually, however, several crew members began to develop new scripts ideas for the ninth season, many of which excited Carter. This new-found enthusiasm eventually caused Carter to sign a contract with Fox for another year. Likewise, Anderson signed on at the last minute, with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002; she specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season. Due to the changes in the cast, during the ninth season Doggett and Reyes became the series' new leads. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season, if the show was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> an audience. However, the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox.|$|E
50|$|During the {{depression}} {{years of the}} 1930s many private golf clubs lost membership, but that of the Victoria Park Golf Club doubled between 1933 and 1937. In response to this expansion and <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> membership, the clubhouse was extended and remodelled in 1939 by City Architect, Harold Erwood. Wings were added {{to either side of}} the existing building, with the additions and alterations focussing on improved member and associate services and facilities, including new lounge and dining room areas with a timber dance floor upstairs; a doubling of locker space, toilet and shower facilities; private rooms; modern kitchen; independent access for women; and new exterior lighting. The upper floor also provided new living accommodation for the club secretary, in the eastern wing. The layout, incorporating facilities for women in the west wing and those for men in the east wing, reflected a marked social separation between the sexes. The extended building opened on 26 October 1939 and continued in use throughout the Second World War, despite the original 17th and 18th fairways being occupied as a military encampment. The lounge area of the clubhouse was extended in 1948 and the ground floor was refurbished in 1963.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Regions {{inhabited}} with an immobile {{population of}} disabled and <b>able</b> individu-als compete <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> mobile firms that provide jobs. The redistributive goal of regional governments {{is to support}} the disabled, who cannot work. Able individuals may work, be involuntary unemployed because of frictions in the labour market, or choose to be volun-tary unemployed. Labour force participation decisions depend on regional redistributive policies. Both the size of workforce and tax on firms affect profits and therefore, firms’ location decisions. Allowing regions to engage in tax competition may be efficient. If regions cannot tax firms, they compete by implementing inefficient redistributive policies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEmotional and self-relevant stimuli are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{automatically}} <b>attract</b> {{attention and}} their use in patients suffering from disorders of consciousness (DOC) might help detecting otherwise hidden signs of cognition. We here recorded EEG in three Locked-in syndrome (LIS) and four Vegetative State/Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (VS/UWS) patients while they listened {{to the voice of}} a family member or an unfamiliar voice during a passive. Data indicate that, in a passive listening condition, the familiar voice induces stronger alpha desynchronization than the unfamiliar one. In an active condition, the target evoked stronger alpha desynchronization in controls, two LIS patients and one VS/UWS patient. Results suggest that self-relevant familiar voice stimuli can engage additional attentional resources and might allow the detection of otherwise hidden signs of instruction-following and thus residual awareness. Further studies are necessary to find sensitive paradigms that are suited to find subtle signs of cognition and awareness in DOC patients...|$|R

40|$|Polymers that exhibit an {{affinity}} to metal ions {{are important for}} separation science and sensor applications. In this paper, we describe the creation of surface micropatterns with three plasma polymers, acrylic acid (ppAAc), allylamine (ppAAm) and tetraglyme (ppTG). Time-of-Flight Static Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SSIMS) imaging {{has been used to}} visualise the chemical specificity and selectivity of the plasma polymers as substrates for immoblised metal affinity protein separation. This technique provides the necessary spatial resolution to chemically resolve the multiple components present on these surfaces. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was also employed to confirm the biological specificity of these surfaces. The results clearly demonstrate that under the correct solvent conditions, ppAAc-modified surfaces coordinate gallium and are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> selectively <b>attract</b> phospho-proteins. Critically, it is possible to then remove the protein from the surface and regenerate the chemistry using a simple elevated pH washing step.
