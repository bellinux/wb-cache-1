40|$|Introduced CPT scheme as a block-based hiding scheme {{based on}} the ring of the {{integers}} modulo 2 r, which permits to embed r = âlog 2 (k+ 1) â secret bits in F by changing at most two entries, while {{the highest number of}} secret bits in any CPT-based schemes is MSDR 2 = âlog 2 (1 +k (k+ 1) / 2) â, approximately 2 r- 1. This ratio can be reached approximately in our proposed CPTE 1 scheme by using modules on the ring Z 2 of integers modulo 2, as an instance of <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>modules</b> over rings of small characteristics. As a consequence, a new modified scheme-CPTE 2 is to control the quality of stego-images. The CPTE 2 scheme gives 2 r- 2 embedded bits approximately, more than r- 2 bits by Tseng-Panâs scheme, while the quality is the same...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLet V be a {{vector space}} over a field or skew field F, and let U be its subspace. We study the {{canonical}} form problem for bilinear or sesquilinear formsU×V→F,(V/U) ×V→Fand linear mappings U→V, V→U, V/U→V, V→V/U. We solve it over F=C and reduce it over all F to the canonical form problem for ordinary linear mappings W→W and bilinear or sesquilinear forms W×W→F. Moreover, we give an algorithm that realizes this reduction. The algorithm uses only unitary transformations if F=C, which improves its numerical stability. For linear mapping this algorithm {{can be derived}} from the algorithm by Nazarova et al. [L. A. Nazarova, A. V. Roiter, V. V. Sergeichuk, V. M.

40|$|The {{expert system}} ELDAR was {{designed}} and tested for the automatic generation of basic data and for the prediction of property data of electrolyte solutions. ELDAR integrates extensive heterogeneous factual knowledge (12. 000 publications, 420. 000 measured data multiples, 1. 200 basic data, documentations of rules (10 subclasses) and modules (50 with 200 effects), thesaurus with the semantic relations of 42. 000 terms for a user friendly interface and for the inheritance and generalisation of knowledge) in a relational data base. It manages algorithmic knowledge normalized in modules (statistical modules, theoretical property equations of the chemical model {{for the production of}} consistent basic data, multiple empirical equations for the consistency check and the prediction) in the method base. A collection of rules for the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>modules,</b> for electrolyte properties (master equations, corresponding states of electrolyte solutions, correlation rules, solvation and association rules) and for the determination of single ion properties and their dependence on temperature and solvent properties was designed for the rule base. Rules coded in Prolog are used in the evaluation of queries via the data base - rule base interaction. The communication manager responds to the user query by automatical data base query, variable transformation, input supply of modules, activation of modules, mapping of the factual knowledge into Horn- clauses, and consultation of the rule base, if necessary in a recursive manner. ELDAR automatically generates basic data and calculates material properties of pure compounds and mixtures. (orig.)
