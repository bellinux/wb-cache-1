5|$|Curium {{isotopes}} <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> {{present in}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} with a concentration of about 20 g/tonne. Among them, the 245Cm–248Cm isotopes have decay times {{of thousands of years}} and need to be removed to neutralize the fuel for disposal. The associated procedure involves several steps, where curium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure, nuclear transmutation, while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for curium.|$|E
5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> impacted by noise).|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} boundary {{was drawn}} to include the highest concentration of historic resources. The street plan dates to 1787 {{and the most recent}} historic building dates to 1940, making those years the period of significance. While some newer buildings <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> located within the area, the boundary, where possible, excluded significant mid and late 20th-century buildings like the city hall, low-income housing projects, and the Uncle Sam Atrium, a large shopping mall downtown. All of the original five historic districts are included in full, along with other historic neighborhoods, for a total of 10% of the city's area.|$|E

5|$|There are six known genetic {{disorders}} in Arabian horses. Two <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia {{of the affected}} animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three {{are thought to be}} autosomal recessive conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not sex-linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance. Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, American Saddlebred, Appaloosa, Miniature horse, and Belgian.|$|E
5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E

25|$|On average, {{different}} {{individuals of}} the human population share about 99.9% of their genes.

25|$|Underwater sites <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> {{difficult}} to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order {{to access the}} site directly, diving equipment and diving skills are necessary. The depths that can be accessed by divers, {{and the length of}} time available at depths, are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, submarines or remote sensing equipment are needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) incineration is linked intimately {{to the history of}} landfills and other waste treatment technology. The merits of incineration <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> judged in relation to the alternatives available.

Since the 1990s alternative waste treatment technologies have been maturing and becoming viable.|$|E

25|$|Wastewater from metal {{mines and}} ore {{recovery}} plants <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> contaminated by the minerals {{present in the}} native rock formations. Following crushing and extraction of the desirable materials, undesirable materials may enter the wastewater stream. For metal mines, this can include unwanted metals such as zinc and other materials such as arsenic. Extraction of high value metals such as gold and silver may generate s containing very fine particles in where physical removal of contaminants becomes particularly difficult.|$|E
25|$|A {{recurring}} theme in contemporary martial arts books is to group characters into different schools and sects and to portrait heroics {{of the main}} characters {{in the context of}} historical rivalries between and schools of martial arts. Cha's novels are no exception to this. Many of the schools of martial arts portrayed by Cha's works, such as the Shaolin Monastery and the Quanzhen School, do exist in real life, though their details <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> subject to the artistic license of Cha; other cults, such as the Beggars' Sect, are less well documented. It should be noted that Cha's portrayal of the schools and sects are mostly in line with their contemporary image in martial arts literature, and new sects such as the Ming Cult are the exception, used specifically as a fictional lead into the next era after the Yuan dynasty into the Ming dynasty.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008 SNMM {{revealed}} that some time between October 2007 and April 2008 the Dalarö wreck site had been disturbed. Some items {{had been removed}} while others had been disturbed or damaged. Among the objects that have disappeared so far is the wooden frame of a pistol that was located on the weather deck. The ship is monitored by the coast guard, and the residents of Dalarö have been notified {{to be wary of}} attempts to plunder the wreck. As of 2009, objects recorded by archaeologists have disappeared and the wreck has been disturbed and to some extent damaged. Known wreck sites in the Baltic <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> plundered, and there have been public appeals to somehow protect the Dalarö wreck. Though illegal, there is little preventing individuals from performing private covert diving operations in order to bring up objects from the ship in order to sell them on the black market.|$|E

25|$|Appointments {{of judges}} and Judicial Commissioners (JCs) of the Supreme Court {{are made by}} the President, when, in his discretion, he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter. The Prime Minister thus {{possesses}} the {{primary power of appointment}} of judges of the Supreme Court. Although the Prime Minister must consult the Chief Justice when advising the President to appoint judges and JCs, and the President is empowered to veto judicial appointments, these are relatively small roles played in the final say as to who should be appointed to the judiciary. Thus, it is said that the judiciary may not be an effective check against the abuse of executive power since the executive is likely to appoint judges who believe in the same fundamental policies. This militates against the separation of powers. On the other hand, in a small jurisdiction like Singapore, the executive and judicial roles <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> intertwined as there will be very few potential appointees to the Supreme Court who have never been involved with the executive government.|$|E
25|$|Maerth {{asserted}} that the eating of brain produces an aphrodisiac effect (presumably due to the vast amount of hormones in it), and that this initially caused apes to become addicted to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped {{in a frenzy of}} brain-induced sex and violence. However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and intelligence while triggering the loss both of body hair and of our innate psychic abilities. Thus man gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago. Modern humans, alienated from their surroundings now that they've no telepathic contact with nature and each other as animals do, suffering from a distorted sexuality resulting from hormonal imbalances, and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing on the inside of their skulls, <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> destroying themselves with pollution, overpopulation, racial integration and ultimately, nuclear war. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future, and suggests that the reader should drop out of society, embrace a vegetarian diet, steep himself in the wisdom of the East and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the shape of his skull as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.|$|E

500|$|The English edition by Britten Austin is a {{selection}} of the Epistles, and is in rhyming verse in the original metre. Britten Austin describes the challenge of translation as difficult or impossible, and admits that in one way his translations <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> [...] "a little faint." [...] He explains this is because [...] "Bellman's colloquialisms which offended his contemporaries still strike Swedish ears as the language of everyday speech. My renderings, therefore, may seem a trifle too antique in flavour; but to have jumbled up, as Bellman brilliantly does, modern-sounding slang with the graces of Rococo diction, would have produced a horrid effect.|$|E
500|$|Textbooks {{and other}} sources {{produced}} {{in the last century}} <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> based on older classifications. Publications using versions of the APG system are now [...] appearing and the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew now uses the APG III system, as does the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website and hence the classification of the lilioid monocots shown in the cladogram below. The Kew botanists treat the monocots as falling into three major groupings: alismatid monocots (Acorales, Alismatales), lilioid monocots (the five other non-commelinid monocots) and commelinid monocots. They also organize their monocot research into two teams I: Alismatids and Lilioids and II: Commelinids. A similar approach is taken by Judd in his Plant systematics.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} {{berkelium}} readily assumes oxidation state +4 in solids, and is relatively stable {{in this state}} in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides. These <b>are</b> <b>inevitably</b> produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various oxidation agents {{can be applied to}} the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as bromates (...) , bismuthates (...) , chromates ( [...] and CrO), silver(I) thiolate (...) , lead(IV) oxide (...) , ozone (...) , or photochemical oxidation procedures. Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with ion exchange, extraction chromatography or liquid-liquid extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric scid), amines, tributyl phosphate or various other reagents. These procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides, except for the lanthanide cerium (lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains).|$|E
