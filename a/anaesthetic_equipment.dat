40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} an infection control educational programme in anaesthetic practice on the clinical performance of the personnel working in anaesthetic field and anaesthetic work place bacterial contamination. MethodsThis study was conducting on 35 personnel involved in 500 operations over two and half months. Their compliance towards handling of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipments,</b> wearing of protective tools and hand hygiene was evaluated using a 13 items check list pre and post delivering of an educational infection control programme (intervention). Of 500 operations 300 were randomly selected for evaluation of bacterial contamination. Two swabs were taken from anaesthetic place before induction of general anaesthesia (T 0) and 30 min intraoperative (T 1) pre and post intervention. Another swab was taking from anaesthetists’ hands 15 min after induction of anaesthesia (T 2). ResultsThe intervention programme influenced positively the attitude of junior anaesthetists and nurses regarding {{the proper use of}} protective tools, <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipments</b> and hand hygiene. Senior anaesthestists’ compliance with hand hygiene, frequency use of gloves and anaesthetic filter did not change after intervention. But their attitude towards handling of laryngoscope, anaesthetic face mask and catheter for suction improved after intervention. The adherence of housekeepers to hand hygiene, frequency of gloves use and anaesthetic equipments’ disinfection improved significantly after intervention. Ninety-two (63 %) swabs were positive for bacteria at T 0 before intervention. They reduced to 9 (6. 3 %) positive swabs after intervention. The number of positive swabs at T 1 was 121 (82. 9 %) before intervention, reduced to 68 (47. 2 %) after intervention. One hundred and eight (74 %) swabs from hands of anaesthetists were positive for bacteria before intervention. They lowered significantly to 55 (38. 2 %) after intervention. Bacterial cross infection between anaesthetic machine and anaesthetists’ hands existed pre and post intervention. In conclusion, infection control programme enhanced personnel clinical compliance and reduced bacterial contamination in anaesthetic place...|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} years of the 19th Century, the Incorporation had {{received}} a Royal Charter to become the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. The College saw its primary role as the teaching of anatomy and surgery, the training of surgeons, and examination of their acquired knowledge. Anatomy and pathology specimens were crucial to that function. The museum expanded dramatically with the acquisition of two large collections. John Barclay, a successful anatomy demonstrator in the extramural school of medicine donated his collection, while Sir Charles Bell, Professor of Surgery in the University of London and latterly in the University of Edinburgh sold his collection to the museum. These collections were much too large to be housed in the original 1697 Surgeons' Hall, and so the surgeons commissioned the leading Edinburgh architect William Playfair to build the present day Surgeons Hall, which opened in 1832. At first the entire upper floor of the building was devoted to the museum collections, which were open to the public and attracted large visitor numbers. Throughout the 19th and early 20th century the collection expanded as it became customary for surgeons and pathologists to donate not only specimens which they regarded as interesting or instructive, but surgical instruments and equipment. With the great scientific and technical advances of the time, the museum began to acquire <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipment,</b> histology slides, X-rays and photographs.|$|E

40|$|Phthalates are {{chemicals}} used {{extensively in the}} manufacture of plastics for their desirable physical characteristics. In addition to enhancing the performance of plastics, phthalates have a number of undesirable effects, principally endocrine disruptor effects, that may have adverse effects on reproductive development and functioning.

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), a {{teaching}} and national referral hospital, is undergoing major reforms {{to improve the}} quality of health care. We performed a retrospective descriptive study using a set of performance indicators for the surgical and laboratory services of MNH in years 2001 and 2002, to help monitor and evaluate the impact of reforms on the quality of health care during and after the reform process. Methodology: Hospital records were reviewed and information recorded for planned and postponed operations, laboratory equipment, reagents, laboratory tests and quality assurance programmes. Results: In the year 2001 a total of 4332 non-emergency operations were planned, 3313 operations were performed and 1019 (23. 5 %) operations were postponed. In the year 2002, 4301 non-emergency operations were planned, 3046 were performed and 1255 (29 %) were postponed. The most common reasons for operation postponement were “time-barred”, interference by emergency operations, no show of patients and inoperable <b>anaesthetic</b> machines. <b>Equipment</b> problems and supply and staff shortages together accounted for one quarter of postponements. In the laboratory, a lack of equipment prevented some tests, but quality assurance was performed for most tests.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesBackground: A new {{appreciation}} of relevant risks, {{as well as}} the increased availability of technologies that facilitate the use of regional techniques, have increased the number of patients that are allowed to breathe spontaneously during their procedures. The ever-growing caseload of surgical patients in resource poor environments demands an <b>anaesthetic</b> service and <b>equipment</b> capable of meeting with these demands. Methods: Patients were recruited to receive their general anaesthesia by means of either the Universal Anaesthesia Machine (UAM) or the standard plenum system available. Anaesthesia was administered according to a protocol and the consumption of electricity, carrier gases, volatile hypnotic agent and carbon dioxide absorbent was measured. The cost per minute was then calculated for each device respectively. Results: Our study recruited 50 patients (25 into each group) across several surgical specialties. We found that when calculated as a total South African Rand (ZAR) per minute cost (for our centre) the UAM was statistically significantly more expensive (R 0. 974 /min vs. R 0. 459 /min, p < 0, 00001). We were able to derive equations to predict the cost consumption of the respective devices, allowing the use of this data in a wide array of clinical settings. Conclusion: Whilst our finding is by no means surprising, it allowed us to produce formulae by which individual centres can calculate the implications of each option using the specific costs of the various consumables available to them...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} {{to the degree of}} {{contamination}} of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipment</b> and the responsibility resting upon anaesthetists for disinfecting all apparatus between cases. Possible methods of disinfection are briefly reviewed. Reasons of efficiency, conveni-ence, cost and practicability are given for suggesting that a domestic washing-up machine is the best form of disinfection so far devised. Although Ziegler and Jacoby (1956) suggested that corrugated tubing and reservoir bags may not be significantly contaminated with bacteria by patients, anaesthetists have become increas-ingly aware of the existence and dangers of such contamination of the equipment they use. The role played by this vehicle in postoperative in-fection has not yet been ascertained but it is now well known that ventilators used in inten-sive care can be responsible for both re-infection and cross-infection. An editorial on this matter (1964) leaves the reader in no doubt that the risk is real and that the anaesthetist must make it his duty to ensure that cross-infection will not occur. The editorial {{goes so far as to}} suggest that the same standards should be applied to the work of the anaesthetist as to that of the surgeon. Our interest in this problem was sharply stimulated by two recent outbreaks of post-operative chest infection which followed the opening of theatre suites. Before the introduction of the method of disinfection herein described, only the endotracheal tubes, connections and the pharyngeal airways received attention. These were thoroughly washed by hand, autoclaved and packaged. Laryngoscopes were washed under the tap by the theatre attendant. Under these circumstances bacteriological in-vestigation showed that parts of the <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipment</b> yielded profuse growths of Staph. aureus, Strep, faecalis, Esch. coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, as well as Ps. pyocyanea and Prot. vulgaris. The accepted methods of disinfection were considered, namely high and low temperature autoclaving, boiling, steeping in antiseptic, e. g. chlorhexidine (Stratford, Clark and Dixson, 1964), and hand washing in soap and water. All were rejected, for various reasons given below, in favour of some automatic device which would both wash and pasteurize...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the {{incidents}} related to awareness during general anaesthesia in the first 4, 000 cases reported to webAIRS an anaesthetic incident reporting system established in Australia and New Zealand in 2009. Included incidents were those in which the reporter selected "neurological" as the main category and "awareness/dreaming/ nightmares" as a subcategory, those where the narrative report included the word "awareness" and those identified by the authors as possibly relevant to awareness. Sixty-one awareness-related incidents were analysed: 16 were classified as "awareness", 31 were classified as "no awareness but increased risk of awareness" and 14 were classified as "no awareness and no increased risk of awareness". Among 47 incidents in the former two categories, 42 (89 %) were associated with low anaesthetic delivery and 24 (51 %) were associated with signs of intraoperative wakefulness. Memory of intraoperative events caused significant ongoing distress for five of the 16 awareness patients.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this review article is to bring up what has been known (practiced) about decontamination, disinfection, and {{sterilisation}} of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipment.</b> It also discusses how this evidence-based information on {{infection prevention and control}} impacts care of patient in routine anaesthesia practice. This review underscores the role played by us, anaesthetists in formulating guidelines, implementing the same, monitoring the outcome and training post-graduate trainees and coworkers in this regard. The article re-emphasises that certain guidelines when followed strictly {{will go a long way}} in reducing transmission of hospital acquired infection between patient and anaesthetist or between patients. Anaesthetists do not restrict their work to operating room but are involved in disaster management, interventional radiological procedures and in trauma care. They should ensure that the patients are cared for in clean and safe environment so as to reduce healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) simultaneously taking preventive measures against the various health hazards associated with clinical practice. They should ensure that the coworkers too adopt all the preventive measures while delivering their duties. For this review, we conducted literature searches in Medline (PubMed) and also searched for relevant abstracts and full texts of related articles that we came across. There is much to be learned from the western world where, health care organisations now have legal responsibility to implement changes in accordance with the newer technology to reduce health care associated infection. There is a need to develop evidence-based infection prevention and control programs and set national guidelines for disinfection and sterilisation of anaesthesia equipment which all the institutions should comply with...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Qualitative and {{quantitative}} tests {{have been carried}} out to assess the value of Cidexl, a glutaraldehyde solution, as a disinfectant. Most of the tests were qualitative and were carried out in conditions as closely resembling those found in hospital practice as possible. Recently used <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipment,</b> catheters, and a cysto-scope, which had been artificially contaminated with suspensions of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, and Esch. coli, were used in the tests. The results show Cidex to be a useful disinfectant with a valuable potential in disinfecting hospital articles which, due to their perishable nature or the fragility of component parts, cannot be treated by physical means. This paper presents results of several tests done on Cidex, an activated glutaraldehyde solution, to assess its effectiveness as a disinfecting agent. Pre-vious work by Pepper and Chandler (1963) has shown it to have a sporicidal effect and Borick, Dondershine, and Chandler (1964) have published details of work done on its viricidal properties. These aspects have not been examined in the present study. The purpose here is to assess the ability of this agent to kill organisms which cause the most trouble in hospital cross-infection, notably Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudo-monas pyocyanea, under conditions resembling those found in day-to-day hospital practice. METHODS OF TESTING DISINFECTANTS That no single test to date is universally used is proof that no single test is completely satisfactory. In 1903 Rideal and Walker described their 'phenol coefficient ' method. This test is valid only for fluids resembling phenol and is misleading and inaccurate for others. The Chick Martin test has many similar dis-advantages...|$|E
40|$|THE {{apparatus}} to {{be described}} represents an attempt to develop a simple, cheap halothane vaporizer {{which could be used}} without modifi-cation of existing <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipment</b> and which would allow accurate but economical use of halo-thane. An earlier version of this vaporizer has been described (Cole, 1959) and the present model has already been referred to (Cole, 1960). The aim of the present paper is to describe the vaporizer and to record experiences of performance after ex-tensive use by the writer and by a number of other anaesthetists to whom vaporizers have been supplied. The vaporizer (fig. 1) consists of a metal assembly into which is screwed a 100 -ml bottle with a suitable washer intervening. The pro-jecting side tube is the oxygen inlet. Oxygen enters here, passes through ducts drilled in the metal and then through a vertical tube 8. 25 cm long to escape through a jet 1. 5 mm in diameter 2 cm above the bottom of the bottle. A safety valve which is spring loaded to open at 5 lb. /sq. in., is set in the metal cap and is connected with the oxygen duct so that if the pressure exceeds that figure only oxygen escapes. The oxygen and halothane mixture leaves the apparatus through a metal tube which terminates in a yoke block. Before use the apparatus is filled with halothane to a level just below the inlet pipe (about 22 ml), screwed into the cyclopropane yoke, and connec-ted to a supply of oxygen. It is now possible to pass a halothane and oxygen mixture through the cyclopropane flowmeter. The amounts of oxygen and halothane vapour flowing per minute for different readings of the flowmeter are shown in table I. The readings were made with the halothane maintained at a temperature of 18. 3 *C (65 "F) as this was felt to be the most useful temperature for calibration. In use the concentrated halothane vapour is metered by the cyclopropane flowmeter and i...|$|E
40|$|Anaesthetic {{induction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} stressful experiences a child can have during hospitalization. High anxiety is seen in 50 – 60 % of the children and is associated with less compliance/cooperation during anaesthetic induction. It can also lead to behaviour problems after surgery. Important factors that are associated with high anxiety are younger age, withdrawn shy temperament, previous negative experience in the hospital and certain kinds of adult behaviour. This thesis has been done to further illuminate the anaesthetic process and gain more knowledge about child behaviour, parent and staff communication, nurse anaesthetist decision-making communication and the reactions of children after anaesthesia and surgery. Materials/Methods: One-hundred and two children between the ages of 3 – 6 that were scheduled for ENT surgery were video filmed. Screening instruments about child behaviour, fears and parental anxiety were used before the anaesthetic procedure. All children were video filmed during the process until they were at asleep. Parents were interviewed during the operation. Forty-nine children came 14 days after the surgery for a play session that also was video filmed. The video films were then analysed to identify critical situations and behaviours. Parents and nurse communication were categorized. Decision-making communications from the nurse anaethetist were also identified and categorized. Results: Four critical situations or reactions were identified, premedication, degree of sedation, compliance during needle insertion or mask on child´s face and the child’s reactions when going to sleep. Each of the situations influenced the next following situation, predicting a higher risk for developing a vicious circle. The first (taking the premedication) was predicted by earlier traumatic hospital experience, if the child placed him/herself nearby or in parent’s lap, hesitant eye contact and highly active parents. The most common type of decision-making category was information, followed by negotiation. Unwillingness to take premedication was associated with more negotiation and less information. A child who takes premedication unwillingly had more often avoidant reactions toward <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipment</b> and anaesthetic play after surgery. An anaesthetic induction process is complex and transactional. Previous experience will together with the process of anaesthesia create a new learning history...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} equipment handling problems of nurses on the Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation Department {{and training of}} new nurses for equipment handling. New nurses are therefore overloaded with lots of new information concerning nursing care, documentation, instruments, team etc. This dissertation consists of two parts ? theoretical and empirical one. The theoretical part deals with ARD description, monitoring, technical equipment, work of nurse on ARD and her adaptation process. The empirical part used a qualitative research method. Information was gathered from a semi-structured interview. The current state in context of nurse work with technical equipment on ARD was analysed {{in the first period}} of research. Tutorial material was created on the basis of gathered information which was applied in practice. Feedback on created tutorial material was found in the last period. The focus group was created by 10 respondents who work as general nurses on ARD in selected hospitals. Four goals and five research questions were stated during the investigation. The first goal was to map what technical equipment nurses on ARD are working with; the second goal was to find out how the training of new nurses on ARD is carried out; the third goal was to create training material concerning technology, not only for new nurses on ARD; and the fourth goal was to find out feedback on provided tutorial material from nurses on ARD. Research questions were: 1. What technical equipment do nurses operate on ARD? 2. How are new nurses on ARD trained? 3. What means are used during the training of new nurses? 4. According to nurses, what information regarding technology should a handbook for nurses on ARD contain? 5. What opinion do nurses on ARD have of created training material?The first goal was to map what technical equipment nurses on ARD are working with. From research results it is evident that nurses on ARD operate lots of equipment ? monitors, infusion pumps, linear pumps, ventilators, dialysis, suction bottles, defibrillators, laminar boxes, ICP monitors, patient lifters, medical heaters and coolers, nebulizers, plasmaferesis, PICCO, LIDCO, Vigileo, enternal pumps, anti-decubitus mattresses, <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>equipment,</b> EKG, haemoglobinmeters, glucometers, ABR analyser, bronchoscopes and Level. The second goal was to find out how the training of new nurses on ARD is carried out. Research results are different in this area. Every respondent undertook a different form of adaptation process in variously long intervals. The third goal was to create training material concerning technology not only for new nurses on ARD. Training material was created on the basis of discussion analysis with respondents and didactic principles had been kept during its creation (visualisation, connection theory with practise, scientism, adequacy, actuality, feedback, consciousness and activity, individualization and orderliness). The fourth goal was to find out feedback on provided tutorial material from nurses on ARD. Training material was given to all respondents for approximately 14 days and afterwards feedback was obtained. The result was that all respondents liked the training material very much. Research results will be provided to head nurses on ARD from chosen hospitals where the research was carried out. The created training material will be provided to ARD in hospital Pelhrimov, p. o. Specific training material for individual workplaces and equipment will be created for other hospitals on the basis of declared wishes of respondents. We anticipate that the training material will not only be beneficial for new nurses on ARD...|$|E
