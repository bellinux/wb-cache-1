40|$|The {{paper is}} meant {{to lead the way}} in the field of {{economic}} analysis in Romania, trying to evaluate by data the capacity of the Romanian economy to face the competition pressures from the Single European Market. Within the paper, the unit labor cost is approached as an indicator reflecting especially the competitiveness rather than measuring it. The methodological and calculation issues differentiate between the unit labor cost in nominal and real terms, emphasizing the conclusion that exceeding the compensation per employee (including the employer’s social contribution) beyond labor productivity, in real terms leads to an increase in the unit labor cost and, finally, to a loss of competitiveness. In addition, the paper includes the forecast of the unit labor cost in Romania, which has been developed {{for the first time since}} 2005. Subsequently, the estimates have been updated for each stage of forecasting. In this way, having in view the expected trends for the indicators involved in the estimate, the final conclusion of the paper is to maintain competitiveness and the current account within sustainable limits, despite the disinflation process under way. The finding is all the more eloquent, as the EC <b>autumn</b> <b>forecast</b> underlines this issue...|$|E
40|$|Pyrenopeziza brassicae, {{cause of}} light leaf spot of oilseed rape, has a complex {{polycyclic}} life cycle. It {{can be difficult}} to control light leaf spot in winter oilseed rape in the UK since {{it is not easy to}} optimise fungicide application timing. Early autumn infections are usually symptomless and recognisable lesions do not develop until the epidemic has progressed further by the spring. Light leaf spot often has a patchy distribution in winter oilseed rape crops and estimation of disease incidence can be difficult. There is evidence that epidemics are initiated primarily by ascospores produced from apothecia that survive the summer inter-crop period on infected debris. Subsequent development of the epidemic during the winter and spring is maintained by rain-splashed conidia that spread light leaf spot from initial foci. Understanding the relative roles of ascospores and conidia in the light leaf spot life cycle is crucial for forecasting epidemic severity and developing control strategies. The current web-based regional forecast system provides an <b>autumn</b> <b>forecast</b> of the incidence of light leaf spot that can be expected the following spring. This is based on survey data which assesses the occurrence of disease the previous July, and weather factors, such as deviations from summer mean temperature and winter rainfall. The forecast can be updated throughout the autumn and winter and includes crop-specific elements so that growers can adjust risks by inputting information about cultivar, sowing date and fungicide use. Crop-specific forecasts can be confirmed by assessing the incidence of light leaf spot. Such assessments will become easier when immunodiagnostic methods for detection of the disease become available. Incorporation of information on spore biology (e. g. apothecial maturation, ascospore release and infection conditions) is considered as a component of the interactive, continuously updated, crop-specific, web-based forecasts which are needed in the future...|$|E
40|$|Since mid- 1989 {{the upward}} trend of demand and output has become flatter. The rise in exports has lost momentum; {{industrial}} output and orders declined according to seasonally adjusted data for August and September; the slower pace of activity {{is confirmed by}} the WIFO composite index of leading indicators. Looking closer at all the information available suggests that the business cycle is taking a short break rather than starting a downward trend. Growth projections for Western Europe have been revised upward in the OECD <b>autumn</b> <b>forecasting</b> round. Liberalization in Eastern Europe may further strengthen the business climate while its actual impact on activity {{will take time to}} materialize. In Austria, private consumption has recently been the strongest source of growth, fuelled by the net income bonus stemming from the tax reform, rising exployment and high consumer confidence. Investors also continue to be optimistic according to the latest business surveys. Employment is rising unabated by more than 50, 000 year-on-year. As labour supply proves very elastic there is little change in unemployment and virtually no wage drift. Consumer prices are climbing {{at an annual rate of}} 2 ¾percent.

30|$|Inflation {{followed}} a broad downward trend until 2006, but turned around in 2007 – 08 {{and came down}} sharply in 2009 as {{the impact of the}} global financial crisis began to be felt. The pickup in inflation following euro adoption in 2007 was unanticipated. With inflation having bottomed out at 2.5  percent in 2005 – 06, the <b>Autumn</b> 2006 official <b>forecast</b> for annual average inflation in 2007 and 2008 was 2.7 percent and 2.5 percent respectively (Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (IMAD) 2006). However, actual inflation rose to 3.6 percent in 2007 and 5.7 percent in 2008, in part reflecting faster-than-potential economic growth and an associated rising positive output gap 11.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} <b>autumn</b> 2007, long-rage <b>forecast</b> models {{indicated}} that a La Niña would develop by December of that year. In general, this event results in increased sea surface temperatures near Australia. Following this, a strong Madden–Julian oscillation phase took shape, leading {{to the development of}} Tropical Cyclone Melanie off the coast of Western Australia and an area of low pressure over the Top End by 28December. Situated over land, the system initially embedded within a disorganised trough and to intensify as it slowly tracked eastward. By 30December, it separated itself from the trough and travelled towards the west. The following day, the interaction between the two systems allowed the low to significantly deepen, attaining a barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.32inHg). This strengthening was short-lived as wind shear over the low increased, displacing convection from its centre.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{availability}} of near-real time ozone observations from satellite instruments has recently initiated {{the development of}} ozone data assimilation systems. In this paper we present {{the results of an}} ozone assimilation and forecasting system, in use since <b>Autumn</b> 2000. The <b>forecasts</b> are produced by an ozone transport and chemistry model, driven by the operational medium range forecasts of ECMWF. The forecasts are initialised with realistic ozone distributions, obtained by the assimilation of near-real time total column observations of the GOME spectrometer on ERS- 2. The forecast error diagnostics demonstrate that the system produces meaningful total ozone forecasts for up to 6 days in the extratropics. In the tropics meaningful forecasts of the small anomalies are restricted to shorter periods of about two days with the present model setup. It is demonstrated that important events, such as the breakup of the South Pole ozone hole and mini-hole events above Europe can be successfully predicted 4 [...] 5 days in advance...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{interventions}} of the Commission comprise {{expenditures for}} objective 1, objective 2 and objective 3. The three priority {{objectives of the}} Structural Funds are: • promoting the development and structural adjustment of the regions whose development is lagging behind (objective 1); • supporting {{the economic and social}} conversion of areas facing structural difficulties (objective 2); • supporting the adaptation and modernisation of policies and systems of education, training and employment. (objective 3). The {{purpose of this study is}} to quantify the economic impacts of objective 1 interventions of the Structural Funds for the period 2000 – 2006. The expenditures of the Structural Funds for objective 2 and objective 3, the Cohesion Fund, the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession (ISPA) and loans which are granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) are not included in the analysis. The study quantifies how much of expected development can be attributed to objective 1 expenditures for • Community interventions (Structural Funds), • public interventions (Structural Funds, national public interventions) and • total interventions (Structural Funds, national public interventions, private participation). The study uses the <b>autumn</b> 2001 <b>forecast</b> and medium-term projection of Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission in order to calculate a baseline for the impact assessment. Today, the forecast itself seems rather optimistic. However, this does not cause problems for the analysis in this report, because the objective is to estimate the impact of the structural funds. In other words the objective is to estimate, for example, the additional growth caused by the structural funds and not to forecast growth as such. Therefore, whether the forecast as such will materialise is of no consequence for the impact analysis in this study...|$|R
40|$|The NL-BAM was {{developed}} as a web-based decision support tool {{to be used by}} the bird hazard avoidance experts in the ecology unit of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The NL-BAM will be used together with the ROBIN 4 radar system to provide BirdTAMS, for real time warnings and flight planning and to give an overview of the predicted bird hazards in the Netherlands to air traffic controllers, flight coordinators, squadron leaders and airfield bird control units. The NL-BAM {{was developed}} by a multidisciplinary team and through the cooperation of the people from the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) and the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam, the Royal Netherlands Air Force and SOVON, the Dutch Centre for field Ornithology. The NL-BAM is accessible to the general public on the Internet at [URL] The website and models are divided into two modules, 'migration prediction' and 'spatial distribution'. The migration module of the NL-BAM is a dynamic model and predicts the density of migrants during the day and at night for 3 consecutive days based on real-time and/or forecasted meteorological data. During the migration season, migration forecasts are updated daily by members of the RNLAF. Predictions are presented in figures on the NL-BAM website. The <b>autumn</b> nocturnal <b>forecasts</b> are based on three data-driven models: a log-linear regression model, a conceptual model and a neural network model. The spring forecasts include a log-linear regression model and a neural network model. Diurnal forecasts are based on nocturnal forecasts by the log-linear relationship between nocturnal and diurnal migration intensities. The spatial distribution module includes spatial density maps of the 62 bird species selected as most relevant for flight safety in the Netherlands in bi-weekly intervals, four time periods per day and at five altitude layers. This module is based on historic field observations and represents the density distribution expected in average circumstances. The key species were selected based on criteria such as total number of birdstrikes, number of damaging birdstrikes, availability of data, mass, behaviour of birds, expert knowledge on species and conservation importance. The spatial distribution of each species was modelled in relation to environmental conditions using a combination of regression models, spatial statistics and expert knowledge. Furthermore, the altitude distribution of several species of birds was modelled in relation to meteorological conditions. Expert knowledge and additional sources were used to complete information on the altitude distribution, temporal activity (daily), annual abundance and flight activity. The public access website includes composite maps of mass and separately for number of birds/km 2 for each time of year, time of day and altitude combination (480 combinations). An authorized access page, accessible only by team members, also includes individual maps for each species as well as a summary table including total numbers of the top 10 most abundant species per region for each time of year, time of day, altitude combinations. Finally, although much has been accomplished in the last few years, it is clear that much more can be still be achieved in the field of bird strike avoidance research. We hope that future projects will emerge and be as productive as this one, if not more...|$|R
