5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood and youth, {{reminding}} him of <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was more innocent. The boyhood scenes portray Scrooge's lonely childhood, {{his relationship with his}} beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig, who treated Scrooge like a son. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on a recent Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq {{in order to better}} man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried that he was not recognisable enough at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016.|$|E

5|$|Mulder has Melissa undergo {{regression}} hypnosis for her {{to recount}} her past lives. She implies that she and Mulder have met over their past lives, always to be separated or lost to each other. To confirm her events, Mulder has himself hypnotized and recalls <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was a Jewish woman with a son, who had the same soul as his sister Samantha; his deceased father, who was Scully, is dead. Melissa was his husband in this life, and had been taken to a Nazi concentration camp by a Gestapo officer who was The Smoking Man. Mulder also recalls his past life from the Civil War, {{when he was a}} man named Sullivan Biddle, while Melissa was Sarah Kavanaugh; Scully, Mulder claims, was his sergeant. Scully finds pictures of Biddle and Kavanaugh in the county's hall of records and gives them to Mulder. He wears Confederate uniform in the photo.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg's {{resources}} were worn out after {{over a decade}} of continuous war. Alfonso and the pope could not provide for him fully, while Venice continued to undermine Skanderbeg. The latter considered war with Skanderbeg since he maintained his alliance with Aragon. Relations with the Italian state worsened further when Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's elusive ally in the north, captured Dagnum. Even though Skanderbeg {{did not participate in}} this, Venice used it as a casus belli to launch an expedition against Skanderbeg. War never started but Albanian-Venetian relations sunk to their lowest point. The Venetian rectors continued to provoke Skanderbeg at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had grown relatively weak due to his nephew and one of his most important officers, Hamza Kastrioti, deserting and joining the Ottomans. Hamza had become dissatisfied with Skanderbeg's growing power and, upon being received by the sultan, was offered control over much of Albania once conquered. Stung by the betrayal, Skanderbeg offered an ultimatum to Venice where they had to halt their provocations or begin war. Since a crusade was anticipated against the Ottomans, Venice did not want to seem pro-Ottoman and eased their stance towards Albania.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's second (or third) wife, Maria of Mangup, was of {{the family}} of the princes of Theodoro. She was {{probably}} also cousins with the Muscovite Grand Princess Sophia Palaiologina, and was related to Trebizond's royal couple, Emperor David and Empress Maria. The Stephen–Maria marriage took place in September 1472, but she died in December 1477. During her brief stay in Moldavia, Maria supported the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, contributing to the friendly contacts between Stephen and Catholic powers. Stephen's third (or fourth) wife, Maria Voichița, was the daughter of Radu the Fair, Voivode of Wallachia. She was the mother of Stephen's immediate successor, Bogdan, and a daughter named Maria Cneajna. The latter married into the House of Sanguszko. Stephen is known to have fathered two other sons who died in childhood, at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was married to Maria Voichița: Bogdan died in 1479, and Peter (Petrașco) in 1480. Scholars are divided as to whether their mother was Evdochia or Maria. Archivist Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu believes that Bogdan also had a twin, Iliaș.|$|E

5|$|The same year, Grant {{acquired}} a slave from his father-in-law, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones. In March 1859, Grant freed William, worth about $1,500, instead of selling him at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> desperately needed money. Grant moved to St. Louis, {{taking on a}} partnership with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs working in real estate business as a bill collector, again without success, and at Julia's recommendation dissolved his partnership. In August, Grant applied for a position as county engineer, believing his education qualified him for the job. His application came with thirty-five notable recommendations, but Grant correctly assumed the position would be given {{on the basis of}} political affiliation and was passed over as he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments. In April 1860, Grant and his family moved north to Galena, accepting a position in his father's leather goods business run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil. In a few months, Ulysses paid off the debts he acquired in Missouri. Ulysses and family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena.|$|E
5|$|With the {{approval}} of Diệm, Nhu used the declaration of martial law to order armed men into the Buddhist pagodas. Nhu chose <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> knew the American Embassy was leaderless. Frederick Nolting {{had returned to the}} United States and his successor Lodge was yet to arrive. As the high command of the ARVN worked closely with American military advisers deployed in the country, Nhu used the combat police and Tung's Special Forces, who took their orders directly from him. The men were dressed in standard army uniforms, such as paratroop attire, to frame the regulars for the raids. Nhu's motive was to avoid responsibility for a violent operation— which would anger the Vietnamese public and the American leadership. In falsely implicating the army in the attacks, Nhu intended to dent the confidence of the Vietnamese populace and the Americans in the senior officers who were plotting against him. Nhu evidently hoped the Buddhist majority and the Americans would blame the army for the raids and become less inclined to support a coup by the generals. In the past, Nhu's tactics in playing the generals against one another had kept conspirators off-balance and thwarted coup attempts. The raids were not unexpected, as the Buddhists had prepared themselves for the attacks, as had journalists, who were watching military installations for signs of movement.|$|E

5000|$|The emails were {{condemned}} by MPs Tracey Crouch and Gloria de Piero. Crouch, a qualified football coach {{and manager of}} a girls' football team, said that, [...] "It's disappointing at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> trying to encourage more women to play football that he is using derogatory terminology like this...it's important that somebody who is promoting the women's game shouldn't be using this sort of language." [...] The emails were also criticised by Minister for Sport and the Olympics Helen Grant.|$|R

25|$|Acromegaly is an {{alternative}} diagnosis. From photographs of Rachmaninov in the 1920s and his portrait by Konstantin Somov in 1925 (Figure 1), at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was recording his four piano concerti, the coarse facial features of acromegaly are not immediately apparent.

25|$|Besides Historia, he {{published}} Miraculum naturae sive uteri muliebris fabrica in 1672 and Ephemeri vita, in 1674.

25|$|Many saw Birt's role in {{government}} as controversial, since {{as a special}} advisor, rather than a civil servant, he was not formally obliged to face questions from House of Commons Select committees.
