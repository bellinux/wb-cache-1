25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E

Clinton suggests not putting cigars into any woman's vagina, a reference to his alleged sexual act with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky during the Lewinsky scandal. David Letterman says, [...] "When they <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> money, pay them", {{a reference to the}} October 2009 scandal in which CBS producer Joe Halderman attempted to blackmail Letterman with information about his sexual affairs.|$|E
2500|$|Abdel Qadir, an Afghan refugee who {{returned}} to Afghanistan, says Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence {{had asked him to}} either receive training to join the Afghan Taliban or for him and his family to leave the country. He explains: [...] "It is a step by step process. First they come, they talk to you. They <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the information.... Then gradually they <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> people they can train and send .... They say, 'Either you do what we say, or you leave the country.'" ...|$|E

60|$|BLANCO. I didnt steal it. I distrained on it <b>for</b> what <b>you</b> owed me. I {{thought it}} was yours. I was a fool {{to think that you}} owned {{anything}} but other people's property. You laid your hands on everything father and mother had when they died. I never <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a fair share. I never <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> all the money I'd lent you from time to time. I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> mother's old necklace with the hair locket in it. You wouldn't give me that: you wouldn't give me anything. So as you refused me my due I took it, just to give you a lesson.|$|R

2500|$|At the {{sentencing}} hearing, defense attorneys {{argued for a}} sentence of life {{with the possibility of}} parole, arguing that he was a troubled man who snapped, not a [...] "cold-blooded murderer". [...] Bales took to the stand to issue an apology to his victims, saying he would bring them back to life if he could. Lt. Col Jay Morse, {{who is a member of}} the US Army Trial Counsel Assistance Program, was the lead prosecutor in the Bales case. The prosecution, seeking life without the possibility of parole, closed their arguments with: [...] "In just a few short hours, Sgt. Bales wiped out generations. Sgt. Bales dares to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> mercy when he has shown none." ...|$|E

[...] For instance, Mulvaney justified cuts to block grants that go towards spending on Meals on Wheels because it was [...] "just not showing any results."

Other beneficial outcomes include increased socialization opportunities, improvement in dietary adherence, and higher quality of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The young priestess enters, {{concerned}} at how pale Norma looks. Norma makes her swear {{to do everything}} she asks and, upon her agreement, tells her that she is entrusting the two children to her care and states {{that they should be}} taken to the Roman camp to their father Pollione, a man whom she hopes will make a better mate for Adalgisa than he was for her.

Adalgisa tells her that she'll never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, look at your dear children of yours on your knees. Be moved by pity for them, even if you have no pity for yourself.") They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realises that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta: Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: Si fino all'ore estreme, compagna tua m'avrai / [...] "Yes, you will have me as your friend until your last hour; the world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us together.") ...|$|E
