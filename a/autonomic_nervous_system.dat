5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> and spares the sympathetic <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|There are {{circadian}} {{variations in}} CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, but potentially relating {{to differences in}} the activation of the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> {{over the course of}} the day.|$|E
5|$|The sensory ganglia are {{directly}} correspondent to {{dorsal root ganglia}} of spinal nerves and are known as cranial sensory ganglia. Sensory ganglia exist for nerves with sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X. There are also parasympathetic ganglia, which {{are part of the}} <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> for cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X.|$|E

50|$|Anaesthetic agents may be {{administered}} by various routes, including inhalation, injection (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), oral, and rectal. Once {{they enter the}} circulatory system, the agents are transported to their biochemical sites of action in the central and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Normal {{micturition}} is {{a complex}} process dependent on a co-ordinated interplay between intact somatic and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> and appropriately functioning bladder, urethral and pelvic floor muscles. Laparoscopic surgery to treat severe endometriosis invariably involves extensive pelvic dissection. The effect of this surgery on bladder function is unknown.|$|R
5|$|Three-quarters {{of people}} with LEMS also have {{disruption}} of the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> This may be experienced as a dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|Alterations in the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> {{can lead}} to orthostatic {{hypotension}} (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
50|$|Gravitational neuromorphology {{studies the}} effects of altered gravity on the {{architecture}} of the central, peripheral, and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems.</b> This subfield aims to expand the current understanding of the adaptive capabilities of <b>nervous</b> <b>systems,</b> and specifically examines how environmental effects can alter <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> structure and function. In this case environmental manipulations generally include exposing neurons to either hypergravity or microgravity. It is a subset of gravitational biology.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Disturbances of the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> (ANS) are not {{uncommon}} in stroke patients, attributed to damage of the central autonomic networks. The resultant alternation in autonomic dynamics caused an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone.

50|$|In 2012, {{the global}} {{pharmaceutical}} company GlaxoSmithKline announced an initiative in bioelectric medicine {{in which the}} <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system's</b> impact on {{the immune system and}} inflammatory disease might be treated through electrical stimulation rather than pharmaceutical agents. The company's first investment in 2013 involved a small startup company, SetPoint Medical, which was developing neurostimulators to address inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|R
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas disease {{are due to}} cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E
5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomic}} or involuntary nervous system, {{which is}} involved in the control of body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure, is affected in two thirds of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but the impact is variable. Twenty percent may experience severe blood-pressure fluctuations and irregularities in the heart beat, sometimes {{to the point that the}} heart beat stops and requiring pacemaker-based treatment. Other associated problems are abnormalities in perspiration and changes in the reactivity of the pupils. <b>Autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> involvement can affect even those who do not have severe muscle weakness.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of nicotine poisoning {{are caused by}} excessive stimulation of nicotinic cholinergic neurons. Nicotine is an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor which {{are present in the}} central and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems,</b> and the neuromuscular junction. At low doses nicotine causes stimulatory effects on these receptors, however, higher doses or more sustained exposures can cause inhibitory effects leading to neuromuscular blockade.|$|R
50|$|The {{psychological}} {{basis for}} TRT {{stems from the}} fact that the brain exhibits a high level of plasticity. In turn, this allows it to adjust to any sensory signals as long as they do not lead to negative effects. TRT is imputed to work by interfering with the neural activity causing the tinnitus at its source, in order to prevent it from spreading to other <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> such as the limbic and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E
5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E
40|$|Familial dysautonomia (FD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by developmental arrest in the sensory and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> and by Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. We previously had mapped the defective gene (DYS) to an 11 -cM segment of chromosome 9 q 31 - 33, flanked by D 9 S 53 and D 9 S 105. By using 11 new polymorphic loci, {{we now have}} narrowed the location of DYS to 98 % of FD chromosomes by their haplotype...|$|R
50|$|Sympathetic preganglionic fibers {{tend to be}} {{shorter than}} {{parasympathetic}} preganglionic fibers because sympathetic ganglia are often closer to the spinal cord than are the parasympathetic ganglia. Another major {{difference between the two}} ANS (<b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems)</b> is divergence. Whereas in the parasympathetic division there is a divergence factor of roughly 1:4, in the sympathetic division there can be a divergence of up to 1:20. This is due to the number of synapses formed by the preganglionic fibers with ganglionic neurons.|$|R
40|$|Neuromodulation is an {{important}} and frequent therapy applied, among others, {{in the management of}} chronic pain. Neuromodulation is defined as ¿a therapeutic alteration of activity in the central, peripheral or <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems,</b> electrically or pharmacologically, by means of implanted devices¿. It encompasses a focal, minimal invasive and reversible approach. Due to its invasive character with some more risks than other modalities of pain treatment, neuromodulation is generally applied as the last option when all other therapies have failed.

40|$|The {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} ret protooncogene (RET) is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases and in several developmental defects, particularly those in neural crest–derived structures and the genitourinary system. In order to further elucidate RET-mediated mechanisms that contribute to these diseases and decipher the basis for specificity in the pleiotropic effects of RET, we characterized development of the enteric and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> in mice expressing RET 9 or RET 51 isoforms harboring mutations in tyrosine residues that act as docking sites for the adaptors Plcγ, Src, Shc, and Grb 2. Using this approach, we found that development of the genitourinary system and the enteric and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> is dependent on distinct RET-stimulated signaling pathways. Thus, mutation of RET 51 at Y 1062, a docking site for multiple adaptor proteins including Shc, caused distal colon aganglionosis reminiscent of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). On the other hand, this mutation in RET 9, which encodes an isoform that lacks the Grb 2 docking site present in RET 51, produced severe abnormalities in multiple organs. Mutations that abrogate RET-Plcγ binding, previously shown to produce features reminiscent of congenital anomalies of kidneys or urinary tract (CAKUT) syndrome, produced only minor abnormalities in the <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Abrogating RET 51 -Src binding produced no major defects in these systems. These studies {{provide insight into the}} basis of organotypic specificity and redundancy in RET signaling within these unique systems and in diseases such as HSCR and CAKUT...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of Psyche and Soma {{are well known}} and this interaction happens through a complex network of feedback, medication, and modulation among the central and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems,</b> the endocrine system, the immune system, and the stress system. These systems, which were previously considered pristinely independent, in fact, interact at myriad levels. Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is an emerging discipline that focuses on various interactions among these body systems and provides the underpinnings of a scientific explanation for what is {{commonly referred to as}} the mind-body connection.

50|$|Polyneuropathy: The {{nerve damage}} is usually symmetrical, located in distal extremities, {{and due to}} the nerve losing its fatty myelin coating and axonal damage. Neurons of the Sensory, motor and <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> are all affected. The typical {{symptoms}} are therefore numbness, tingling, and weakness in the feet, later affecting the legs and hands. Pain is unusual, but the weakness may eventually become severe and disabling. The autonomic neuropathy may cause excessive sweating and erectile dysfunction; hormonal changes may {{also contribute to the}} latter. It is usually the symptoms of neuropathy which prompt a person with POEMS syndrome to seek medical attention.|$|R
25|$|Three notable {{bases for}} resilience, self-confidence, {{self-esteem}} and self-concept, all have roots {{in three different}} nervous systems—respectively, the somatic nervous system, the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> and the central nervous system.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is responsible}} for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the <b>autonomic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones.|$|E
40|$|Gastrointestinal (GI) {{symptoms}} {{are a common}} comorbidity in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Many studies have shown alterations {{in the composition of}} the fecal flora and metabolic products of the gut microbiome in patients with ASD.
