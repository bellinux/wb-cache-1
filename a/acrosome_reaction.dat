40|$|BACKGROUND: Fertilization in mammals {{comprises}} the sequential interactions of the sperm with the cumulus oophorus, zona pellucida, and oocyte plasma membrane. Here we investigate proteasome activity in human sperm and its possible involvement during the fertilization process. METHODS: Proteasome activity {{was measured in}} intact sperm and in sperm extracts using the ¯uorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, in {{the presence or absence}} of the speci®c proteasome inhibitor, clasto-lactacystin b-lactone. The participation of the proteasome was evaluated during (i) sperm±zona binding using the hemizona assay; (ii) zona pellucida-induced <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions</b> with a pulse and chase design; (iii) progesterone-induced <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions</b> incubating overnight capacitated sperm with progesterone; and (iv) progesterone-induced Ca 2 + in¯ux using fura- 2 AM. RESULTS: Intact sperm and sperm extracts possessed proteasome activity, which was susceptible to inhibition by clasto-lactacystin b-lactone. Sperm±zona binding was not inhibited by clasto-lactacystin b-lactone. However, both zona pellucida- and progesterone-induced <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions</b> were inhibited by clasto-lactacystin b-lactone. The proteasome inhibitor also blocked the sustained phase of the Ca 2 + in¯ux provoked by progesterone but not the peak. CONCLUSION: The human sperm proteasome is involved in the exocytosis of the acrosome, perhaps in events upstream of the plateau phase of the Ca 2 + in¯ux.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Compounds with estrogenic {{activity}} can affect reproductive function in mammals. This study investigated possible effects of 17 b-estradiol (E 2) and three weakly estrogenic environmental estrogens on mamma-lian sperm capacitation and fertilizing ability in vitro. METHODS: Uncapacitated and capacitated mouse sperm sus-pensions were incubated for 30 min {{in the presence}} of E 2, genistein (Gen), 8 -prenylnaringenin (8 -PN) and nonylphenol (NP), and then assessed using chlortetracycline (CTC) ¯uorescence analysis. In addition, treated unca-pacitated sperm suspensions were tested for changes in fertilizing ability. RESULTS: In uncapacitated cells, E 2 at> 1 mmol/l and Gen, 8 -PN and NP at> 0. 001 mmol/l, signi®cantly stimulated capacitation and <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions.</b> Hydroxytamoxifen (an estrogen antagonist) did not inhibit responses to any of these compounds. In capacitated cells, E 2 had no effect, but the other three compounds signi®cantly stimulated <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions.</b> Added to uncapa-citated suspensions, 10 mmol/l E 2, 0. 1 mmol/l Gen and 0. 1 mmol/l 8 -PN all signi®cantly stimulated sperm fertilizing ability (~ 76 % oocytes fertilized) compared with untreated control sperm (~ 36 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study pro-vides the ®rst evidence that E 2 and environmental estrogens can signi®cantly stimulate mammalian sperm capacita-tion, <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions</b> and fertilizing ability, with the environmental estrogens being much more potent than E 2. The inability of hydroxytamoxifen to block these responses suggests that classical estrogen receptors may not be involved.

The evaluation of 20 sperm heads from each of the 36 samples analyzed ensured that a large number of cells were investigated. The data were subjected to analysis of variance at a level of significance of 5 %.

40|$|Sperm {{adhesion}} to egg zonae pellucidae initiates sperm <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions,</b> an exocytotic {{event that}} is an early step during fertilization. Previously, {{it was suggested that}} zona pellucida-evoked Ca 2 + entry into sperm through low voltage-activated Ca 2 + channels is an essential step in <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions,</b> based on the inhibitory effects of Ca 2 + channel antagonists. However, analysis of this channel is limited by the inability to apply electrophysiological methods directly to sperm. In this report, optical methods of determining membrane potential and internal Ca 2 + levels were used to demonstrate that (i) contact with zonae pellucidae activates a transient Ca 2 + response in sperm that has a time course and antagonist sensitivity anticipated of low voltage-activated Ca 2 + channels; (ii) these channels are unavailable for opening in uncapacitated sperm because of voltage-dependent, steady state inactivation; (iii) membrane hyperpolarization during sperm capacitation is sufficient to recruit channels into a closed state, from which they are available for opening during fertilization; and (iv) channel conductance state may be a factor in determines the efficacy with which channel antagonists inhibit fertilization. This study provides evidence for the activation of sperm Ca 2 + channels during gamete adhesion and offers a mechanism that may account for aspects of the regulation of sperm fertility during capacitation through the control of channel availability.

40|$|Bovine {{spermatozoa}} {{that have}} been exposed to seminal plasma possess more binding sites for heparin than sperm from the cauda epididymis that have not been exposed to accessory sex gland secretions. Seminal plasma exposure enables sperm, following incubation with heparin, to undergo zonae pellucidae-induced exocytosis of the acrosome. In this study, the regulatory role of seminal plasma heparin-binding proteins in capacitation of bovine spermatozoa by heparin was investigated. Plasma membranes from sperm exposed to seminal plasma in vivo or in vitro contained a series of acidic 15 - 17 kDa proteins not found in cauda epididymal sperm. Western blots of membrane proteins indicated that these 15 - 17 kDa proteins bound [125 IJ-heparin. Heparin-binding proteins were isolated by heparin affinity chromatography from seminalplasma from vasectomized bulls. Gel electrophoresis indicated that the heparin-binding peaks contained 14 - 18 kDa proteins with isoelectric variation, a basic 24 kDa protein, and a 31 kDa protein. Western blots probed with [/ 25 I]-heparin confirmed the ability of each of these proteins to bind heparin. Each of these proteins, as well as controlproteins, bound to epididymal sperm. The seminalplasma proteins were peripherally associated with sperm since they were removed by hypertonic medium and did not segregate into the detergent phase of Triton X- 1 14. Seminal plasma heparin-binding proteins potentiated zonae pellucidae-induced <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions</b> in epididymal sperm.

Fluorescent signals were corrected for contributions of mitochondrial potentials and apparent VM values were obtained by calibrations in sperm selectively permeabilized with valinomycin or with gramicidin D. The calculated VM values of uncapacitated mouse and bovine sperm were approximately - 35 and - 30 mV, respectively. In contrast, capacitated populations of mouse and bovine sperm have VM values of - 50 to - 60 mV. Membrane hyperpolarization {{is due in part}} to an enhanced K+ permeability.

Percoll separation and washing were the best methods for removing seminal constituents, but sperm velocity and linearity were lower after Percoll separation and washing than after Sephadex separation. During 3 hours of incubation, there was an additional decrease in the motility, vi-ability (exclusion of supravital dye), velocity, linearity, and intact acrosomes of Percoll-separated sperm, indicating that Percoll separation may not be suitable for cryopreserved sperm.

40|$|AbstractThrough {{the use of}} a {{functionally}} unbiased {{signal peptide}} trap screen, we have discovered an ATP-dependent aminophospholipid transporter that is exclusively expressed in the acrosomal region of spermatozoa; it is about 62 % similar to the flippase, FIC 1. We disrupted the transporter gene and found that the size of litters from male null mice was slightly smaller than found with wild-type males. Sperm morphology and motility were the same between null and wild-type littermates, but agents (merocyanine and annexin) that measure phospholipid packing or phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer membrane leaflet showed that PS already existed in the outer leaflet of null spermatozoa before sperm capacitation. Fertilization rates were normal when null spermatozoa were added to zona pellucida-free eggs, but {{in the presence of the}} extracellular matrix, fewer transporter−/− spermatozoa bound tightly or penetrated the zona pellucida (ZP), and fewer underwent <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions.</b> In vitro fertilization was compromised, especially at early time points or at low sperm concentrations after mixing null spermatozoa and eggs.

50|$|The zona pellucida, a {{thick layer}} of {{extracellular}} matrix that surrounds the egg and is similar {{to the role of the}} vitelline membrane in sea urchins, binds with the sperm. Unlike sea urchins, the sperm binds to the egg before the acrosomal reaction. ZP3, a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida, is responsible for egg/sperm adhesion in mice. The receptor galactosyltransferase (GalT) binds to the N-acetylglucosamine residues on the ZP3 and is important for binding with the sperm and activating the <b>acrosome</b> <b>reaction.</b> ZP3 is sufficient though unnecessary for sperm/egg binding. Two additional sperm receptors exist: a 250kD protein that binds to an oviduct secreted protein, and SED1, which independently binds to the zona.

50|$|The {{aforementioned}} process {{describes the}} physiologically relevant events.

50|$|Spermatozoon is {{the male}} gamete. After {{ejaculation}} this cell is not mature, so it can't fertilize the oocyte. To {{have the ability}} to fertilize the female gamete, this cell suffers capacitation and <b>acrosome</b> <b>reaction</b> in female reproductive tract. The signaling pathways best described for spermatozoon involve these processes. The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway leads to sperm cells capacitation; however, adenilyl cyclase in sperm cells is different from the somatic cells. Adenilyl cyclase in spermatozoon doesn't recognize G proteins, so it is stimulated by bicarbonate and Ca2+ ions. Then, it converts ATP into cAMP, which activates PKA. PKA leads to protein tyrosine phosphorylation.Phospholipase C (PLC) is involved in <b>acrosome</b> <b>reaction.</b> ZP3 is a glycoprotein present in zona pelucida and it interacts with receptors in spermatozoon. So, ZP3 can activate G protein coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors, that leads to production of PLC. PLC cleaves the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 is released as a soluble structure into the cytosol and DAG remains bound to the membrane. IP3 binds to IP3 receptors, present in acrosome membrane. In addition, calcium and DAG together work to activate protein kinase C, which goes on to phosphorylate other molecules, leading to altered cellular activity. These actions cause an increase in cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ that leads to dispersion of actin and consequently promotes plasmatic membrane and outer acrosome membrane fusion.Progesterone is a steroid hormone produced in cumulus oophorus. In somatic cells it binds to receptors in nucleus; however, in spermatozoon its receptors are present in plasmatic membrane. This hormone activates AKT that leads to activation of other protein kinases, involved in capacitation and acrosome reaction.When ROS (reactive oxygen species) are present in high concentration, they can affect the physiology of cells, but when they are present in moderated concentration they are important for <b>acrosome</b> <b>reaction</b> and capacitation. ROS can interact with cAMP/PKA and progesterone pathway, stimulating them. ROS also interacts with ERK pathway that leads to activation of Ras, MEK and MEK-like proteins. These proteins activate protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) that phosphorylates various proteins important for capacitation and <b>acrosome</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

We have used the Alexa 488 fluorophore conjugated to solubilized porcine zona pellucida proteins to observe zona receptors on live boar sperm. Zona proteins bound live, acrosome-intact sperm on the anterior portion of the sperm head, concentrated in a thin band over the acrosomal ridge. When sperm membranes were permeabilized by fixation or <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions</b> induced by the ionophore A 23187, zona binding was extended to a broad area covering the entire acrosomal region.

40|$|Lipid is an {{important}} constituent of cell membrane. Membrane lipid composition of spermatozoa has been correlated to different function. Many researchers have related membrane lipid with survival success after cryopreservation or cold shock. Sperm maturation and <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions</b> are natural phenomenon, but cryopreservation or cold shock is not. Therefore, sperm cells are not programmed for such change and undergo stress. So the change in membrane lipid composition due to cold shock or cryopreservation may be looked upon as response of spermatozoa to a certain stressed condition.

40|$|AbstractThe TRPC cation channel {{family has}} been implicated in receptor- or {{phospholipase}} C (PLC) -mediated Ca 2 + entry into animal cells. These channels are present in mammalian sperm and are assigned a role in ZP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + influx that drives <b>acrosome</b> <b>reactions.</b> However, the mechanisms controlling channel activity and coupling Ca 2 + entry through these channels to cellular responses are not well understood. A yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out to identify TRPC-interacting proteins that would be candidate regulators or effectors. We identified a novel protein, enkurin, that is expressed at high levels in the testis and vomeronasal organ and at lower levels in selected other tissues. Enkurin interacts with several TRPC proteins (TRPC 1, TRPC 2, TRPC 5, but not TRPC 3) and colocalizes with these channels in sperm. Three protein–protein interaction domains were identified in enkurin: a C-terminal region is essential for channel interaction; an IQ motif binds the Ca 2 + sensor, calmodulin, in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner; and a proline-rich N-terminal region contains predicted ligand sequences for SH 3 domain proteins, including the SH 3 domain of the p 85 regulatory subunit of 1 -phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase. We suggest that enkurin is an adaptor that functions to localize a Ca 2 + sensitive signal transduction machinery in sperm to a Ca 2 +-permeable ion channel...|$|R
