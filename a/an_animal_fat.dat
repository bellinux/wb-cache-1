40|$|AbstractThe steep rise {{of demand}} of {{petroleum}} based fuel {{is because of}} rapid and fast industrialization of automotive sector. There are limited reserves for petroleum based fuels. These limited reserves {{are located in the}} certain regions of the world. Therefore the countries those are not having the sufficient stock of petroleum based fuel, are facing the problems of increase cost of fuel which mainly due to the cost involved in the import of the petroleum based fuel. Hence it is required to find out and investigate the other resources of the alternative fuels, which can be produced from nearby and locally available sources such as Alcohol, Biodiesel, Vegetable oil etc. Methyl or ethyl esters of fatty acids produced from vegetable oil or <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> is called biodiesel. Non edible oil or animal fats are the main recourses for production of biodiesel such as Jatropha, Palm, Marine fish oil, Soybean, Cottonseed etc. Biodiesel blends are prepared in any proportion with diesel to use in a conventional diesel engine. By using biodiesel in an engine there is a significant reduction in the harmful pollutants in the environment. This paper reviews the production, properties, performance and emission analysis of different feedstock of blends of biodiesel and experimental work carried out in the various parts of the world...|$|E

However, as dietary <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> increased, the body weight gain in broilers tended to increase.

40|$|Eight {{different}} types of Bologna type cooked sausages apart from the control were produced {{in order to reduce}} the fat content (15 %, 30 %, 45 %), replace the animal fat by olive oil (3 %, 6. 5 % and 10 %) as well as concomitant reduction and replacement of animal fat (30 % of fat reduction with 2 % of olive oil as <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> replacer). Quality attributes such as texture, water binding and color were monitored. Texture and water binding of fat reduced and fat replaced samples were quite similar to the control while color was strongly affected by the fat reduction and replacement. Fat reduction led to a redder cooked sausage and the addition of olive oil to a more yellow product. Chemical analysis revealed no major changes among samples apart from protein and fat content and fatty acid profile. Noteworthy, cooked sausage with more than 6. 5 % of olive oil achieved the World Health Organization’s recommendation on the nutritional fat index ((polyunsaturated + monounsaturated) /saturated fatty acid ≥ 2) which is very relevant to the development of heal-thier formulations. Cooked sausages with 45 % of fat reduction and 30 % fat reduced with 2 % of olive oil were considered as the best by the panelists, which in addition had a balanced nutritional content by a lower caloric content. We concluded that fat reduction (up to 45 %) and replacemen...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} addition of safflower seed (Carthamus tinctor-ius L.) on the physicochemical properties of ground pork as <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> replacer. Three types of ground pork were evaluated: 20 % pork fat added (control), 10 % pork fat and 10 % safflower seed pow-der added (10 % SS), and 20 % safflower seed powder added (20 % SS). The moisture, protein, and ash contents were highest in 20 % SS, and the fat content was highest in the control (p< 0. 05). The cooking yield, moisture retention, fat retention, and water-holding capacity were highest in 20 % SS, and the control showed a reduction in the diameter (p< 0. 05). The external and internal L-, a-, and b-values of the control were higher than those of the 10 % SS and the 20 % SS (p< 0. 05). The cholesterol content of the control, the 10 % SS, and the 20 % SS was 50. 85, 21. 77, and 17. 91 mg/ 100 g, respectively, and that of the 20 % SS was lowest among the samples (p< 0. 05). The linoleic acid content of the control, the 10 % SS, and the 20 % SS was 28. 68 %, 41. 04 %, and 54. 26 %, respectively.

40|$|Milk {{production}} in ruminants necessitates renovation of least available plant materials into most enriched nutrients. This involves pregastric microbial rumen fermentation of plant cells {{and production of}} volatile fatty acids (VFA) as substrates for mammary milk lactose, fat and protein synthesis. Thus, milk contains numerous bioactive substances functioning beyond solely their nutritive value. Essential amino acids, specialized casein, lactalbumins and globulins, peptides, nucleosides, nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acids, sphingomyelins, fat soluble vitamins and minerals of mainly calcium are principal examples. Whey proteins are insulinotropic, medium chain fatty acids improve insulin sensitivity, and calcium favorably influences fat distribution. Peptides and calcium can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol. Dairy consumption benefits folate availability and lowers blood homocystein and heart attack risks. Very early (< 3 mo of age) neonatal cow milk intake has been related to insulin-dependent diabetes. Non- breast milk intake during early stages of life is unarguably uncommon. Modern nutrition does in no standard circumstances authorize feeding such quite young neonates non-breast milks. Milk sufficiency for neonatal brain, nervous and immune systems, and bone development and tissue growth for even up to 2 yr without major needs for alternative foods is an evolutionary verification for its irreplaceable role in human nutrition. However, the increasing concerns of cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, and related complexities in modern populations due to improper nutrition have contributed to forming a fallacious public perception about milk in general and milk fat in particular as a possible risk factor. Despite such a functional nature of milk in improving human health, the confusion exists where education is suboptimal. Insightful education on milk science must accompany research to enable the public to discern a pseudo- science that unconsciously disregards milk as <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> food with serious health risks. With limited saturated fat intake from non-milk sources, increased milk consumption could bear a multitude of positive impacts on health even with high fat content.

50|$|The three {{fatty acids}} (RCO2H, R′CO2H, R″CO2H {{in the above}} equation) are usually different, but many kinds of {{triglycerides}} are known. The chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides vary, but most contain 16, 18, or 20 carbon atoms. Natural fatty acids found in plants and animals are typically composed of only even numbers of carbon atoms, reflecting the pathway for their biosynthesis from the two-carbon building-block acetyl CoA. Bacteria, however, possess the ability to synthesise odd- and branched-chain fatty acids. As <b>a</b> result, ruminant <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> contains odd-numbered fatty acids, such as 15, due to the action of bacteria in the rumen.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{sources of}} fatty alcohols {{have largely been}} various vegetable oils and these remain <b>a</b> large-scale feedstock. <b>Animal</b> <b>fats</b> (tallow) were of historic importance, particularly whale oil, however {{they are no longer}} used on a large scale. Tallows produce a fairly narrow range of alcohols, predominantly C16-C18, the chain lengths from plant sources are more variable (C6-C24) making them the preferred source. The alcohols are obtained from the triglycerides (fatty acid triesters), which form the bulk of the oil. The process involves the transesterification of the triglycerides to give methyl esters which are then hydrogenated to give the fatty alcohols. Higher alcohols (C20-C22) can be obtained from rapeseed oil or mustard seed oil. Midcut alcohols are obtained from coconut oil (C12-C14) or palm kernel oil (C16-C18).|$|R
