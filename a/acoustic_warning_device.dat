40|$|This {{project is}} based on the {{construction}} of a model simulating a home automation with different operation modes which can be controlled also by a mobile application. To achieve this objective, a scale house that captures different signals, both digital and analog, has been developed. To approach the house to a real home automation application the variables under study and control are interior temperature and lighting, movement around the house and water level of the pool. The house has three main operating modes. In automatic mode, it performs the measurement and executes the control of the variables, regulating itself according to the conditions to which it is exposed. In contrast, the remote mode is achieved using the mobile application that allows user to modify the variables. Finally, in alarm mode it controls the parameters that assure the security of the house when proprietor is away from home. To capture the signals, the prototype has temperature, lighting, movement and water level sensors installed, and for the regulation and control it has a fan, some LED, an <b>acoustic</b> <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and a water pump. The core is an Arduino Mega board that allows the application operation and receives, from an Android mobile application, operating modes commands and, if it is operating remotely, orders to individually control the different actuators. For the data transmission from the mobile to the board, is used communication via Bluetooth...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the simulation-based design methodology {{used in the}} eVADER project {{for the development of}} targeted <b>acoustic</b> <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> for increased detectability of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (HEVs) while, at the same time, reducing urban noise pollution compared to conventional <b>acoustic</b> pedestrian <b>warning</b> systems. A key component of this system is an external warning signal generator capable of projecting the warning signals to a contained area in front of the vehicle where potential at-risk situations are detected. Using acoustic beam forming principles a suitable warning strategy and an initial layout for realizing such a system is defined. Starting from this information, acoustic Finite and Boundary Element models of the transducer array allow assessing more realistically the performance impact of the system integration and of the most critical changes in the acoustic environment in which the signal generator needs to operate...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>warning</b> {{signals are}} {{necessary}} to promptly alert workers of events which can compromise safety. Failure to react to warning signals can {{increase the risk of}} accidents in the workplace. Unfortunately, the use of warning signals in industry is poorly regulated and submitted to intuitive installation practices, often with little regard to the many factors contributing to an efficient use. This research presents {{the development of a new}} software tool called "AlarmLocator" to automate the process of installing auditory <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> in a given setting, in terms of the characteristics of the devices to use and their optimal location in the plant. The software tool, when use in combination with psychoacoustic model "Detectsound" (Zheng et al., 2006), produces a solution to two practical installation problems: (1) selecting a suitable number of <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> and <b>acoustic</b> power for a given work area, and (2) specifying the location of the devices in the plant in such a way that the signals emitted are clearly audible by all workers at all workstations. Thus, a solution to the problem of installing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> is provided in a format that can be easily understood and used in the workplace. A simple hybrid method, combining the mirror image technique and the classical room acoustics theory was used in this research to compute the sound pressure level generated by acoustic alarm devices. The former technique accounts for wall-placement directivity effects by using a relatively low order of virtual sources to simulate early reverberation. The classical theory of room acoustics is used for late reverberation. The method only requires specification of the overall room dimensions and the estimated or measured reverberation time; however it is currently limited to rectangular-shaped rooms. It was validated in a classroom at the University of Ottawa to verify that sound pressure level predictions by "AlarmLocator" would provide realistic solutions of optimal installation of <b>acoustic</b> <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> in the workplace. The validation was carried out over 125 arrangements (source, receiver, frequency) and average errors of 0. 15 and 2. 2 dB were noted for estimated and measured reverberation time conditions. This is well within the design range (13 dB) for the warning sound level window under "Detectsound".

Major reasons for electrocution {{in the construction}} industries are workers contact with the power line or material handling equipment contact with the power line.
