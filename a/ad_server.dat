50|$|Ad serving {{describes}} {{the technology and}} service that places advertisements on Web sites. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Web sites and advertisers to serve ads, count them, choose the ads {{that will make the}} Web site or advertiser most money, and monitor progress of different advertising campaigns. Ad servers are divided into two types—publisher <b>ad</b> <b>servers</b> and advertiser (or third party) <b>ad</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R

Examples of such solutions include web analytics, campaign analytics, audience measurement, personalization, A/B testing, <b>ad</b> <b>servers,</b> retargeting, and conversion tracking.|$|R
5000|$|Ad {{relevance}}: More {{often than}} not, the ads {{were out of}} relevance with the website content as a fall out of point 1, and also because there weren’t intelligent contextual engines built into the <b>ad</b> <b>servers</b> (the server system that churns out the ads) of these ad networks.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2004, Adtech {{interprets the}} banner {{requests}} to their <b>ad</b> <b>servers</b> for periodical Web analyses in Europe.

50|$|An {{advertiser}} {{can buy a}} run {{of network}} package, or a run of category package within the network. The advertising network serves advertisements from its central <b>ad</b> <b>server,</b> which responds to a site once a page is called. A snippet of code is called from the <b>ad</b> <b>server,</b> that represents the advertising banner.|$|E
5000|$|The first central <b>ad</b> <b>server</b> was {{released}} by FocaLink Media Services and introduced on July 17, 1995, for controlling the delivery of online advertising or banner ads. Although most contemporary accounts are no longer available online, the Weizmann Institute of Science published an academic research paper documenting {{the launch of the}} first <b>ad</b> <b>server.</b> The original motherboard for the first <b>ad</b> <b>server,</b> assembled in June 1995, is also preserved. [...] Focalink re-launched the <b>ad</b> <b>server</b> under the name SmartBanner in February 1996. [...] The company was founded by Dave Zinman, Andrew Conru and Jason Strober, and based in Palo Alto, California. In 1998, the company changed its name to AdKnowledge, and was purchased by CMGI in 1999. [...] The AdKnowledge name was subsequently purchased by a company in Kansas City in 2004, which now operates under the brand name AdKnowledge.|$|E

50|$|Viewable Impressions were {{developed}} as an {{improvement of the}} online impression metrics measured by first <b>ad</b> <b>servers</b> developed in the mid-1990s, which analyze HTTP requests in a server log and cannot provide information on events fired by a viewer’s browser; thus, they cannot measure whether ad content was actually visible to a viewer.|$|R

The application is implemented using Ruby on Rails framework...|$|R

50|$|With the {{development}} of the first <b>ad</b> <b>servers</b> in 1995-1996 the assumption was that a requested ad was always available to the viewer of a requested web page. This allowed for the utilization of the server log file for collection of metadata to deliver a metric called the Online Impression that in traditional media meant an impression on a viewer.|$|R

50|$|The first central <b>ad</b> <b>server</b> {{was created}} in July 1995 by Focalink Communications, which enabled the management, targeting, and {{tracking}} of online ads. A local <b>ad</b> <b>server</b> quickly followed from NetGravity in January 1996. The technology innovation of the <b>ad</b> <b>server,</b> together with the sale of online ads on an impression basis, fueled a dramatic rise in the proliferation of web advertising and provided the economic foundation for the web industry from the period of 1994 to 2000. The new online advertising model {{that emerged in the}} early years of the 21st century, introduced by GoTo.com (later Overture, then Yahoo! and mass marketed by Google's AdWords program), relies heavily on tracking ad response rather than impressions.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types of ad servers. There is an <b>ad</b> <b>server</b> for publishers that helps them to launch a new ad on a website by listing the highest ads' price on its and to follow the ad's growth by registering how many users it has reached. There is an <b>ad</b> <b>server</b> for advertisers that helps them by sending the ads {{in the form of}} HTML codes to each publisher. In this way, it is possible to open the ad in every moment and make changes of frequency for example, at all times. Lastly, there is an <b>ad</b> <b>server</b> for ad networks that provides information as in which network the publisher is registering an income and which is the daily revenue.|$|E

50|$|Appelman joined AOL in 1993 {{to head up}} all of AOL server {{and host}} {{development}} efforts. He authored many innovations and patents: an instant messaging system, a highly scalable email system, <b>ad</b> <b>servers,</b> TCP/IP enabled browsers, among many others. Barry Appelman and his former colleagues from T.J. Watson Matt Korn and Mike Connors who also came to AOL, were crucial to taking AOL from a distant third position in online services {{to that of a}} formidable leadership within 2-3 years.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} play a video ad in a video player, the video player sends a request to a VAST <b>ad</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
50|$|Using a DNS {{sinkhole}} {{by manipulating}} the hosts file exploits {{the fact that}} most operating systems store a file with IP address, domain name pairs which is consulted by most browsers before using a DNS server to look up a domain name. By assigning the loopback address to each known <b>ad</b> <b>server,</b> the user directs traffic intended to reach each <b>ad</b> <b>server</b> to the local machine or to a virtual black hole of /dev/null or bit bucket.|$|E
50|$|Web banners or banner ads {{typically}} are graphical ads displayed within a web page. Many banner ads are delivered by a central <b>ad</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The LiftDNA core {{technology}} solution enabled accurate impression and {{user level}} pricing for blind tag-based network demand which fed RTB / exchanges to bid accurately in the adserver. [...] "Predictive Pricing" [...] was a breakthrough that enabled publishers to host super auctions within their <b>ad</b> <b>servers,</b> with real-time bidders and traditional ad networks competing simultaneously for impressions the moment an ad call occurs. All of LiftDNA publisher clients came from existing SSP, where they subsequently saw revenue increases ranging from 50-150%.|$|R
50|$|Display {{advertising}} conveys its {{advertising message}} visually using text, logos, animations, videos, photographs, or other graphics. Display advertisers frequently target users with particular traits {{to increase the}} ads' effect. Online advertisers (typically through their <b>ad</b> <b>servers)</b> often use cookies, which are unique identifiers of specific computers, to decide which ads to serve to a particular consumer. Cookies can track whether a user left a page without buying anything, so the advertiser can later retarget the user with ads from the site the user visited.|$|R
50|$|Behavioral {{targeting}} {{may also}} be applied to any online property {{on the premise that}} it either improves the visitor experience or it benefits the online property, typically through increased conversion rates or increased spending levels. The early adopters of this technology/philosophy were editorial sites such as HotWired, online advertising with leading online <b>ad</b> <b>servers,</b> retail or other e-commerce website as a technique for increasing the relevance of product offers and promotions on a visitor by visitor basis. More recently, companies outside this traditional e-commerce marketplace have started to experiment with these emerging technologies.|$|R
