2500|$|He {{has long}} been a fan of Hollywood action man Steven Seagal, who he had {{mentioned}} several times on radio, and remarked that he would love to meet. However, when Seagal rang O'Connell the relationship and understanding between the two was quite difficult and left O'Connell feeling disappointed. Seagal did not understand O'Connell's ironic personality and sense of humour and much of the recorded interview had to be removed from the radio broadcast. The Observer described the interview as, [...] "a spectacularly terrible interview in which O'Connell's questions dropped into a seemingly bottomless well of apathy." [...] O'Connell described the interview remarking; [...] "It was the single worst thing I've ever done on radio. And the other week I was having a go at Michael Parkinson, saying he used to be fantastic but sadly now he's become too fawning, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the Seagal thing and I thought: I should just leave." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I pricked up my ears at that; I don't deny it. Anybody would. Besides, I knew {{it would}} be doing him a {{kindness}} to hand 'im back to 'is father. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a bit o' thinking to see 'ow it was to be done.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't mind {{if it was}} {{a little}} bigger. I like it though; only the fact is the devil gets into me sometimes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want to bolt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mr. Crawley; not two {{or three}} times a week; very seldom above once, <b>I</b> think. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe he does it more with the view of being with Lord Lufton than {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could hold}} my head up under two thousand, of a sartainty. I wish {{the place was}} a little nearer Clawbonny, say eight or ten miles off; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think <b>I</b> should {{talk to the people}} about a trade." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He and Mr. Lemington {{stayed in}} the town, {{trying to make up}} their minds as to what they'd do next. I got a chance to ship, and, as they didn't seem to want me any more, I sailed away, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> as I've told you before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. He {{heard me}} crying about you, and he bitterly taunted me; and called you by a foul name; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. My heart {{could not bear}} it. He had nagged me about you before. And then I dressed myself and came away to find you." ...|$|E
6000|$|I debated a moment, looking him {{squarely}} in the eyes. I had seen the frightful treatment of the cabin-boy, and knew that I should very probably receive the same, if not worse. As I say, I debated with myself, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> what I consider the bravest act of my life. I ran to the side, waving my arms and shouting: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! but, uncle," [...] said Leo, quickly, [...] "you {{must not}} suppose that I give {{him all the}} hard work. We share it between us, you know. Benjy {{sometimes}} shoots <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the retrieving. You've no idea how good a shot he is becoming." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gondry's {{vision and}} career began with his {{emphasis}} on emotion. Much of his inspiration, he says, came from the film Le voyage en ballon. He stated: [...] "When I watch this movie, I dream I'm flying <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> stories where people are flying. I think it's directly influencing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't it funny?" [...] she said. [...] "I mostly {{lets them}} run {{the length of}} their tether but {{sometimes}} I has to pull them up, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>does</b> it with a jerk. Now, {{you can take your}} time about dressing, my dears, and I'll go down and keep them in order, the mean scalawags." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, you and Jean {{were seated}} {{alone at the}} little window in the Candlemaker Raw last night about ten o'clock, and I was {{standing}} by a tombstone in the Greyfriars Churchyard admiring you. I {{did not like to}} present myself just then, for fear of alarming the dear girl too much, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not dare to come here to-day till the gloamin'. I only arrived yesterday." ...|$|E
60|$|I acquiesced with a nod, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a thing I {{had never}} done since Leo was a little boy. I turned and put my arm round him, {{and kissed him on}} the forehead. It sounds rather French, but as a fact I was taking my last {{farewell}} of a man whom I could not have loved more if he had been my own son twice over.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, not the words. But {{the voices}} they sounded awful. And one other gentleman 'e come along from the dining-room, {{and asked me}} what the noise was about. There ain't many members now at the Veterans', sir, and being a foggy night we was partik'lar quiet. But this gentleman 'e was curious about the noise, so 'e just opened the smoking room door and peeped in, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> 'ear a few words." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is harm {{to be so}} ugly. It disfigures the church; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} distinctions of that sort are proper for the house of God. I know this ever has been my grandmother's opinion; but finding her {{father-in-law}} and husband desirous of such an ornament, she consented in silence, during their lives." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not glance his way. After a {{time his}} voice {{came up from}} the main deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what we will do, M. Henri," [...] said Chapeau, {{speaking}} to his master, [...] "we will put a mark upon them, so that if we catch them again, we may know them; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think {{it would be all right}} to hang them; or perhaps for the second time we might cut off their ears, and hang them the third time." ...|$|R
60|$|Don Jose. My darling, Don Alexandro. Motherless {{from her}} infancy. A little wild, and {{inclined}} to gayety, but I hope not seeking {{for more than}} these walls afford. I have checked her but seldom, Don Alexandro, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not let her see {{my hand on the}} rein that held her back. I do not ask her confidence always: I only want her to know that when the time comes it can be given to me without fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ran against}} him by accident," [...] Wulf said, looking up fearlessly in the prelate's face. [...] "I apologized, though I know not that I was more in fault than he; {{but instead of}} taking my apology as one of gentle blood should do, he spoke like a churl, and {{threatened}} me with chastisement, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> say that I hoped he and all other Normans in the land would some day be packed across the Channel." ...|$|E
60|$|So I said it again, and he {{said his}} again, and I said mine again, and then he did, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and then he did, and we kept on doing it, and doing it, and I never had such a good time, {{and he said}} the same. In my opinion there isn't {{anything}} that is as killing as one of those dear old ripe pensioners {{if you know how to}} snatch it out in a kind of a fresh sort of original way.|$|E
5000|$|... “I do {{remember}} a time when there weren’t any freeways, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> remember the neighborhood, whole city blocks abandoned, then chewed up, our neighbors disappeared.It devastated, amputated East LA. {{from the rest of the}} city. The bulldozers resembled the conqueror’s ships coming to colonize a second time and I felt a real desire to portray the lives of those who disappeared.”Helena Maria Viramontes in an interview with La Bloga.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have a {{few that}} bear reading pretty often, and Mr. Hope as lent me some. I've been {{trying to keep up}} my Greek, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe there's some way of {{simplifying}} those accounts by logarithms, if I could but work it out. But my mother told me to walk, and I assure you <b>I</b> <b>do</b> take a constitutional as soon as I come out at half-past four every day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Oh! don’t be afraid,’ said Mr. Evans, {{with a very}} self-satisfied air; ‘I shall {{fall with}} my head “off,” <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can’t <b>do</b> any harm.’ ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{made it up}} {{by eating}} some salt beef and biscuit, which I {{found to be the}} invariable accompaniment of every meal; the sailors sitting cross-legged on their chests in a circle, and {{breaking}} the hard biscuit, very sociably, over each other's heads, which was very convenient indeed, but gave me the headache, at least for the first four or five days till I got used to it; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not care much about it, only it kept my hair full of crumbs; and I had forgot to bring a fine comb and brush, so I used to shake my hair out to windward over the bulwarks every evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Belamour, smiling, [...] "my little friend Eugene, ay, and {{my nephew}} himself, {{are hoping to}} hear I was {{released}} from fetters and a heap of straw, but I took care to give them no opportunity. I merely told them they were under a mistake, and had better take care. I gave them a reference or two, but I saw plainly that was of no use, though they promised to send, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> exactly as they bade me, so as to deprive them of all excuse for meddling with me, letting them know that I could pay for decent treatment so long as I was in their hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{ran away}} from me some time ago," [...] he went on, [...] "sick to death of me she was. She thought she'd got all my money. She hadn't. There's plenty more, plenty more. She ran away and left me with Mathers. She was paying him so much a week to keep me quiet, not {{to let me go}} {{anywhere}} where I should talk, to keep me away from her so that she could live up here and see all her friends and spend my money. And at first I didn't mind, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> mind, and I got angry with Mathers, and Mathers wouldn't let me come away, and three nights ago I killed Mathers." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{spirituality of}} Filippo Neri, {{who lived in}} Rome {{at the same time}} as Ignatius, was {{practically}} oriented, too, but totally opposed to the Jesuit approach. Said Filippo, [...] "If I have a real problem, I contemplate what Ignatius would <b>do</b> ... <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the exact opposite". As a recognition of their joint contribution to the spiritual renewal within the Catholic reformation, Ignatius of Loyola, Filippo Neri, and Teresa of Ávila were canonized on the same day, March 12, 1622.|$|R
6000|$|I will {{strengthen}} me with breakfast, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> my terrible work. Madam Mina still sleeps, and God be thanked! She is calm {{in her sleep}} [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, [...] "not {{unless she}} was passionately {{attached}} {{to the man who}} wished to take her out, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> my utmost to dissuade her." ...|$|R
6000|$|He went: I {{watched the}} light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very softly, unclosed the {{staircase}} door {{with as little}} noise as possible, shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, {{in spite of the}} cloak; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. [...] "I hope it is he," [...] thought I, [...] "and not something worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you," [...] I said, in {{the absence}} of this leading; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what else to say. Tedham {{seemed to me to be}} looking very well, but I could not notify this fact to him, in the circumstances; he even looked very handsome; he had aged becomingly, and a clean-shaven face suited him as well as the full beard he used to wear; but I could speak of these things as little as of his {{apparent}} health. I did not feel that I ought even to ask him what I could do for him. I did not want to have anything to do with him, and, besides, I have always regarded this formula as tantamount to saying that you cannot, or will not, do anything for the man you employ it upon.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Every word I spoke was {{spoken with}} an object--calculated.... Yes, even the pauses. I {{tried to make}} them tell, too. I knew you, you see, Peter. I knew you through and through, because I loved you, and I knew the effect those tales would have on you. Oh, they were all true. I was honest {{as far as that}} goes. But they had the mean motive at the back of them. I was playing on your feelings. I knew how kind you were, how you would pity me. I set myself to create an image which would stay in your mind and kill the memory of the other girl; the image of a poor, ill-treated little {{creature}} who should work through to your heart by way of your compassion. I knew you, Peter, I knew you. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a meaner thing still. I pretended to stumble in the dark. I meant you to catch me and hold me, and you did. And ...' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} at Bellaggio twice before, but {{nevertheless}} I was ignorant of their system of police. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> again, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what was the Italian for the word.|$|R
5000|$|... "The album {{started the}} same way as every other album really. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> most of my writing on the road, on tour <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> just <b>do</b> a series of demos and see which ones work." [...] —Kelly Jones ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do not fear, Madame, it {{will soon}} be over,' said Darpent. 'It is a little {{amusement}} in which they daily indulge. The torrent will soon pass by, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> myself the honour of escorting you home.' ...|$|R
