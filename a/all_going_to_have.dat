We're {{at a time of}} great change, what {{advertising}} means on the Internet is changing in a very big way, sort of like you're seeing on television with DVRs making standard ads obsolete. Business {{is going to have to}} change, and we're <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to adapt to move forward and keep going for the years to come. People that stand by as existing ad formatsget less and less useful are going to feel the brunt of stuff like this. Jeff Gerstmann, March 16, 2012 Giant Bomb is credited with being an innovator within video game journalism, avoiding many of its downfalls and continuing growth where other companies in the medium have had to downsize or close down completely. Due to ad filtering, the advertisements that have been common in video game journalism websites are becoming less viable. Websites such as Giant Bomb, ScrewAttack, and Penny-Arcade have received praise for their success in their paid subscription models. In addition, as print-based gaming journalism was superseded by web-based gaming journalism, large gaming journalism websites such as IGN and GameSpot are now under threat from YouTube celebrities and video game players creating their own live-streaming channels on Twitch. [...] This is the reality of the current industry we are in and it’s something that Jeff Gerstmann predicted back in the day when he talked about the bylineand the fact that the person writing the review was just as, if not more important, than the actual text of the review itself, or of course the video of it. It seems that some sites are attempting to adapt to the modern landscape by either creating personalities or pushing already existing nascent personalities on their staff. Either the most camera-friendly person or the most interesting person, giving them a show or along those lines. We see sites like GameSpot doing that a lot, they’re really chasing after the dream of what Giant Bomb did years ago and it’s the reason why Giant Bomb is extremely relevant at this point because they saw that coming.

When the pension reform is carried out <b>all</b> employees are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> savings both in mutual and bond funds. But only if the fund overperforms the market it is worth investing. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore if Swedish mutual funds have generated higher returns than market portfolio in the late nineties. Research method: Returns of the mutual funds have been examined by four different measures. These are return on investment, the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio and Jensens alpha. Results: According to the results from my study only one mutual fund has performed better than the market on the average. Some funds had higher return than expected under some years but no extraordinary performance was found. Even lower return than expected was found in some mutual funds...|$|R

Whole Life Cycle assessment provides decision makers with cost {{estimates for the}} installation phase and over the entire service life of the system, including disposal. The OLE projects face a particular problem when analysing the best option for overbridges. Much of the rail infrastructure has not traditionally had to consider overhead clearances and therefore many of the bridges are only a little taller than the rolling stock. In addition to the difficulties in assessing the Life-Cycle costs of assets that have historically been used in very limited scales, the Whole Life Cycle assessment must consider the various engineering options that are available for projects. The three competing options (bridge rebuild, track lowering, reduced clearance) are <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> very different capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) costs.

I thought that you {{probably}} would try but someone said there weren’t any telephones except in town and since you were restricted didn’t think that you’d be able to. Not sure what time you called. Mrs. M said about an hour after I’d left. That must have been about six your time. About then Doris + Betty Jo + I were waiting for Julie to get ready. I thought about you all day + night, honey. Didn’t find out about your calling until this morning. It’s hard to write because I’m lying {{out in the back}} yard in the sun trying to get a suntan. Probably won’t get anything more than sunstroke. Lord it sure is hot. Golly, darling, I wish you’d get through that fool course in ten days. That would be marvelous. But it will undoubtedly pour or snow or something. How many hours do you have to have before they send you back to Craig? You really should get overseas pay. There should be something done about that. Every time the sun goes behind the cloud I write some more. Well, it’s too hot for me. Had to go sit on the front porch in the shade. It’s nice and cool here. Let’s see, where was I – oh, yes, I don’t suppose there’s much chance of your getting back in ten days? Golly, that would be marvelous. I just don’t want to think about it. Last night after the movies, we went to see “Murder my Sweet”. We went to the hotel. Just on the change that there might be save mail + sure enough. I almost died. There were two letters from you. What a surprise. Well, honey loads of things have been happening to me lately. Golly, I’ve met more people! Can’t remember any of their names but they were all so nice. Julie has a boyfriend named George Harvey + what a car. It’s almost a block long, light green “convertible” of course. Gee, it’s sharp. We’ll have to get a car, honey. Oh, if we go home on your leave, we could get one there + the ration board would give us enough gas to drive back to your next Post. Cars down here are awfully expensive. Golly, talk about an arm + a leg. They want the whole body! You were saying they send out a man to get the papers. That reminded me – Since we left Pelham I haven’t seen more than two papers. Haven’t the slightest idea how the war is going. Yesterday saw “Blondie” but outside of that I’m worse off than you are. I’m very contented here in silence. Like it a lot and would be awfully happy if you were here. It’s really a nice place. Of course the food is supposed to be awful but I didn’t think it was so bad. All the Officers say the food in the Officer’s Club is lousey [sic]. They bring their lunch. It’s a riot. Everyone says {{you should be able to}} live off the Post, honey, as long as you pay for your BOQ + get back in time. You’re supposed to fire 3, 000 rounds in the 17 days? Golly, darling, you’ll be there forever at that rate. How many have you fired so far. You’d have to fire 300 rounds a day to get through in ten days. Guess there’s not much chance of that. How long does it take to shoot a hundred? It sounds like hard work but probably is fun. Gee, I wish you’d hurry home. Oh, do they go by the number of hours you fly down there? How soon do you think you’ll be home? Seventeen days? How’s the weather? Golly, darling, I miss your not coming home at nights + getting up at those ungodly hours of the night to get you back to camp on time. Your pajama tops are going to be worn out soon. You’d better hurry home if you ever want to wear them again. You’ve probably gotten my letter by now. You must have since you called here telling you where I’m staying. Mrs. M. has been real nice to me + if her daughter-in-law doesn’t come we’ll probably stay here. I’d rather get the apartment across the street if possible because we’d have a private bath + we’d be more alone there. That Lt. sure looks sharp on the envelope. I love addressing envelopes now- writing Lt. + Mrs. That I like. Golly darling in another forty minutes we’ll have been married eight days! Still don’t think we should count until you get back because we’re not together + haven’t been long enough to make it fair. We’ll have to start all over again. How are Tom + D. A. ? Does Tom still like Janet? Haven’t heard him speak of her in ages. Say hello to them both for me. I’m beginning to have trouble- meeting people. They’re beginning to conflict. They all want to do something at the same time. Like tonight. Supposed to see Julie, Bettie Jo + Doris + the girls next door. It’s going to be confusing. Last night the girls next door were out with two captains. One was from N. Y. + the other knew Dick Mullineaux- He’d been in China with him. Did you know Dick? He was reported missing over Jap territory last June, I think. It seemed so funny to see someone who knew where Pelham was. I was really amazed. One of the captains- think his name was Cook- instructs the French. Anyway I had been telling one of the girls that you could speak a little French or something so she told the captain. He wanted to know your name but I wouldn’t tell him. He said they need French instructors. All you have to do is say one word with a slight accent + you were it. But I told him you wouldn’t like it + probably couldn’t speak French anymore. I know you probably wouldn’t want to be an instructor because you want to go over so much. Didn’t know what to say but told him you wouldn’t like it. Would you? I’d love it- But I know you sorta want to go over. Of course you really could do much more as an instructor than you could as a pilot overseas. Because as an instructor you’d be able to train several men to fight + as a pilot overseas there’d be just you. Oh well, I suppose you know all that. But you did say you’d like to try it. I’d like you to be an instructor here now that I know so many people. Besides, I could be with you longer but of course you are the one who counts most about that. All this is just day dreaming. But you should be used to the way I ramble by now. Golly, darling, I’ve gotten a sunburn. You should see me. The front of my legs are real red but the backs are exactly the same. At least I look healthy from the front. Gee, I love you so, honey. It’s so awful to have to be away from you now, Judd. I miss you more + more every day. What have you been doing? Anything unusual. Wonder how long you’ll be stationed around here, darling. Hope you’re not sent over for years. Gee, honey, does it seem as though we’d been married for eight days to you? It just isn’t fair. It seems as though you’d been away for years. How long do you think you’ll be there? If you’re going to come home early let me know if possible so that I can wash my hair + look half way decent. Oh, honey, I wish that I were here when you called. Let me know if you have any plants for calling again so that I’ll be here. Golly I was so disappointed when I heard about it. Didn’t think you knew where I was yet. Well, darling, I guess I’d better get ready to go to town to eat. I love you so much, Judd. More than I’d ever dreamed possible. It’s wonderful to be so much in love but horrible to be separated. Well, darling, be a good little boy + hurry up + finish everything down at Eglin + come back to me real quick. You’re so wonderful, Judd. I love you so much, honey. Being in love with you is the nicest thing that ever happened to me. Golly, I’m glad we’re married. Oh, are you getting rested? What do you do when you don’t fly? Try to catch up on your sleep, honey, I just don’t enjoy going to bed anymore. It’s terrible. Golly, I’ll be glad when you’re back again. Every minute we’re apart seems so long. There’s four girls around here that I met today + they’re <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> baby. The people are awful here- If you don’t have a dog or a baby they won’t rent you a room. Great isn’t it. Well, darling, I hope you’re back real soon. I miss you so. You’re so sweet, darling and I love you. Wish you were here now. Miss your arms + being kissed + you. It shouldn’t be long now, honey, but it will seem like a million years.

Well, I’ve been kept pretty busy all week but nothing can take your place, honey.

They eat a real big meal at lunch here + suppers not small by any means. We had hot biscuits last night + I must have eaten ten. They were so good. Every once in a while I can’t understand people. When they start talking fast but mostly I like their accent. They have some queer expressions, down here- all the girls “get tickled” when something’s funny. It sure is funny the different expressions that everyone uses. The girls next door are awfully nice + want me to do something with them today but since Julie insisted I stay there for lunch I don’t know how I’ll do it. That’s what always happens. I get involved in more things, honey. Las night was another mess. Nothing important though. Gee, darling, I’m so lonesome every night sleeping by myself. That would sound bad if we weren’t married. But golly, I almost feel as if we aren’t. How’s the weather down there- I sure hope it’s decent and that everyone finished before the 17 days. It would be awful if you had to stay there longer. That I won’t think about. Going to eat breakfast. Wait a sec. How do you like Eglin, honey? Like “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo? Everyone says Aux Co. is the worst place in the world to be. We certainly are lucky. It’s awful how long seventeen days can be. It already seems way over a year. I’ll have to write to everyone soon. Oh, don’t forget to send me Nanny’s address so that I can write her. How do you like being a Lieutenant now, honey? Still [?] as proud? Golly, I wish you’d get back here so that we could be together. Did I tell you that some fool maid over at the hotel threw away my box for Mr. O’Leery + Pinkie? And she also threw away our book. (Together reminded me of the sense of oneness). You should have seen me trying to move with all the junk I had. Your B- 4 bag is really marvelous. We’ll really need a foot locker for me. That will help loads. If it doesn’t take a year to get there. Monday My darling husband, Honey, I’m so mad that I wasn’t home when you called last night. I thought that you probably would try but someone said there weren’t any telephones except in town and since you were restricted didn’t think that you’d be able to. Not sure what time you called. Mrs. M said about an hour after I’d left. That must have been about six your time. About then Doris + Betty Jo + I were waiting for Julie to get ready. I thought about you all day + night, honey. Didn’t find out about your calling until this morning. It’s hard to write because I’m lying out in the back yard in the sun trying to get a suntan. Probably won’t get anything more than sunstroke. Lord it sure is hot. Golly, darling, I wish you’d get through that fool course in ten days. That would be marvelous. But it will undoubtedly pour or snow or something. How many hours do you have to have before they send you back to Craig? You really should get overseas pay. There should be something done about that. Every time the sun goes behind the cloud I write some more. Well, it’s too hot for me. Had to go sit on the front porch in the shade. It’s nice and cool here. Let’s see, where was I – oh, yes, I don’t suppose there’s much chance of your getting back in ten days? Golly, that would be marvelous. I just don’t want to think about it. Last night after the movies, we went to see “Murder my Sweet”. We went to the hotel. Just on the change that there might be save mail + sure enough. I almost died. There were two letters from you. What a surprise. Well, honey loads of things have been happening to me lately. Golly, I’ve met more people! Can’t remember any of their names but they were all so nice. Julie has a boyfriend named George Harvey + what a car. It’s almost a block long, light green “convertible” of course. Gee, it’s sharp. We’ll have to get a car, honey. Oh, if we go home on your leave, we could get one there + the ration board would give us enough gas to drive back to your next Post. Cars down here are awfully expensive. Golly, talk about an arm + a leg. They want the whole body! You were saying they send out a man to get the papers. That reminded me – Since we left Pelham I haven’t seen more than two papers. Haven’t the slightest idea how the war is going. Yesterday saw “Blondie” but outside of that I’m worse off than you are. I’m very contented here in silence. Like it a lot and would be awfully happy if you were here. It’s really a nice place. Of course the food is supposed to be awful but I didn’t think it was so bad. All the Officers say the food in the Officer’s Club is lousey [sic]. They bring their lunch. It’s a riot. Everyone says you should be able to live off the Post, honey, as long as you pay for your BOQ + get back in time. You’re supposed to fire 3, 000 rounds in the 17 days? Golly, darling, you’ll be there forever at that rate. How many have you fired so far. You’d have to fire 300 rounds a day to get through in ten days. Guess there’s not much chance of that. How long does it take to shoot a hundred? It sounds like hard work but probably is fun. Gee, I wish you’d hurry home. Oh, do they go by the number of hours you fly down there? How soon do you think you’ll be home? Seventeen days? How’s the weather? Golly, darling, I miss your not coming home at nights + getting up at those ungodly hours of the night to get you back to camp on time. Your pajama tops are going to be worn out soon. You’d better hurry home if you ever want to wear them again. You’ve probably gotten my letter by now. You must have since you called here telling you where I’m staying. Mrs. M. has been real nice to me + if her daughter-in-law doesn’t come we’ll probably stay here. I’d rather get the apartment across the street if possible because we’d have a private bath + we’d be more alone there. That Lt. sure looks sharp on the envelope. I love addressing envelopes now- writing Lt. + Mrs. That I like. Golly darling in another forty minutes we’ll have been married eight days! Still don’t think we should count until you get back because we’re not together + haven’t been long enough to make it fair. We’ll have to start all over again. How are Tom + D. A. ? Does Tom still like Janet? Haven’t heard him speak of her in ages. Say hello to them both for me. I’m beginning to have trouble- meeting people. They’re beginning to conflict. They all want to do something at the same time. Like tonight. Supposed to see Julie, Bettie Jo + Doris + the girls next door. It’s going to be confusing. Last night the girls next door were out with two captains. One was from N. Y. + the other knew Dick Mullineaux- He’d been in China with him. Did you know Dick? He was reported missing over Jap territory last June, I think. It seemed so funny to see someone who knew where Pelham was. I was really amazed. One of the captains- think his name was Cook- instructs the French. Anyway I had been telling one of the girls that you could speak a little French or something so she told the captain. He wanted to know your name but I wouldn’t tell him. He said they need French instructors. All you have to do is say one word with a slight accent + you were it. But I told him you wouldn’t like it + probably couldn’t speak French anymore. I know you probably wouldn’t want to be an instructor because you want to go over so much. Didn’t know what to say but told him you wouldn’t like it. Would you? I’d love it- But I know you sorta want to go over. Of course you really could do much more as an instructor than you could as a pilot overseas. Because as an instructor you’d be able to train several men to fight + as a pilot overseas there’d be just you. Oh well, I suppose you know all that. But you did say you’d like to try it. I’d like you to be an instructor here now that I know so many people. Besides, I could be with you longer but of course you are the one who counts most about that. All this is just day dreaming. But you should be used to the way I ramble by now. Golly, darling, I’ve gotten a sunburn. You should see me. The front of my legs are real red but the backs are exactly the same. At least I look healthy from the front. Gee, I love you so, honey. It’s so awful to have to be away from you now, Judd. I miss you more + more every day. What have you been doing? Anything unusual. Wonder how long you’ll be stationed around here, darling. Hope you’re not sent over for years. Gee, honey, does it seem as though we’d been married for eight days to you? It just isn’t fair. It seems as though you’d been away for years. How long do you think you’ll be there? If you’re going to come home early let me know if possible so that I can wash my hair + look half way decent. Oh, honey, I wish that I were here when you called. Let me know if you have any plants for calling again so that I’ll be here. Golly I was so disappointed when I heard about it. Didn’t think you knew where I was yet. Well, darling, I guess I’d better get ready to go to town to eat. I love you so much, Judd. More than I’d ever dreamed possible. It’s wonderful to be so much in love but horrible to be separated. Well, darling, be a good little boy + hurry up + finish everything down at Eglin + come back to me real quick. You’re so wonderful, Judd. I love you so much, honey. Being in love with you is the nicest thing that ever happened to me. Golly, I’m glad we’re married. Oh, are you getting rested? What do you do when you don’t fly? Try to catch up on your sleep, honey, I just don’t enjoy going to bed anymore. It’s terrible. Golly, I’ll be glad when you’re back again. Every minute we’re apart seems so long. There’s four girls around here that I met today + they’re <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> baby. The people are awful here- If you don’t have a dog or a baby they won’t rent you a room. Great isn’t it. Well, darling, I hope you’re back real soon. I miss you so. You’re so sweet, darling and I love you. Wish you were here now. Miss your arms + being kissed + you. It shouldn’t be long now, honey, but it will seem like a million years. I love you + will love you always- more + more every day. Your devoted wife, Dottie P. S. I love you, my darling husband- I can’t believe it. Golly especially when you’re so far away! I love you.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of PhilosophyThis thesis {{explores the}} {{barriers}} that are preventing {{large numbers of}} permanent resident overseas-trained doctors (PROTDs) from working as general practitioners (GPs) in rural New South Wales (NSW). It focuses specifically on doctors from non-English speaking backgrounds who are permanent residents of Australia or Australian citizens, and who migrated to Australia {{for reasons other than}} employment. This thesis explores the views and perceptions of PROTDs and does not specifically consider the views of other stakeholders. Archival, qualitative and quantitative research techniques <b>have</b> been used <b>to</b> determine the suitability of the policies and practices governing the appointment and registration of PROTDs in NSW, and to identify any policy changes required. This research demonstrates that the policies governing medical registration in NSW have frequently been driven by political factors, and have, at times, been used to control the size of the medical workforce. As a consequence of these policies, many PROTDs have been prevented from working as a doctor in NSW. Of particular concern is the lack of training or clinical experience available to PROTDs and their difficulties preparing for, and passing, the Australian Medical Council (AMC) examinations. The lack of accurate information regarding the requirements and opportunities for medical practice in NSW is also a major problem. PROTDs in NSW are unable to get the training and support they need to meet the requirements for medical registration in NSW and are rapidly losing their confidence, and their clinical skills. Not <b>all</b> PROTDs are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> or be able to acquire, the skills and knowledge required for general practice in rural NSW. However the need for additional doctors is sufficiently great to warrant a proactive approach from governments and relevant agencies. In the seven years it <b>has</b> taken <b>to</b> complete this research, most of the discriminatory aspects of the assessment and registration of PROTDs in NSW have been removed. However the legacy of previous policies and practices remains and a large number of PROTDs remain out of the medical workforce...|$|R
