5|$|The Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the {{original}} fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, attempted {{to build on the}} character, and a number of scheduled film adaptions were shelved when they could not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, Jennifer Lee, were ultimately <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As much as Anna’s struggle is external, Elsa’s is internal. This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.|$|E

He is the protagonist of Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf Howled, which explores Sasuke's reflections after Itachi's death and his decision to destroy Konoha. In Sakura Hiden, an older and reformed Sasuke continues his redemption journey, but returns to Konohagakure on hearing rumors that Sakura has been abducted. There, he learns the rumors are wrong, and parts on friendly terms with Sakura. In Akatsuki Hiden, Sasuke meets two children who tell him stories about Akatsuki, {{and the three of}} them discuss Itachi's legacy. He is also the protagonist of Sasuke Shinden, where he agrees to aid Konohagakure by investigating a rash of disappearances. With help of Taka and a ninja named Sai, Sasuke is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the case and, after receiving a letter from Naruto, he decides to return to the village to meet Sakura.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Kudo (Japanese: Shinichi Kudo) is a {{high school}} detective who {{sometimes}} works with the police to solve cases. During an investigation, he is attacked by members of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. They force him to ingest an experimental poison, but instead of killing him, the poison transforms him into a child. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mouri) and her father Richard (Kogoro), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard's cases, but when he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> one, he uses a tranquilizer needle to put Richard to sleep, and impersonates his voice to reveal {{the solution to the}} case. He also enrolls in a local elementary school where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective club (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with a variety of characters, including his professor friend Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena (Sonoko), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), various police detectives from different regions, and the Kaito Kid.|$|E
5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his brother and the entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E

In another example, one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray, while the other pulled the tray out from the test apparatus. Both would then feed. The birds were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized. The parrots appeared to express individual preferences as to which of the other test birds they would work with.|$|E
25|$|It is {{well known}} that strict churches are strong and growing in the {{contemporary}} United States, whereas liberal ones are declining. For Iannaccone's religious experience is a jointly produced collective good. Thus members of a church face a collective action problem. Strict churches, which often impose costly and esoteric requirements on their members, are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> this problem by weeding out potential free riders, since only the very committed would join the church {{in the face of such}} requirements. Consistent with the notion that religious experience is a collective good, Iannaccone et al. show that churches that extract more resources from their members (in the form of time and money) tend to grow in membership.|$|E
