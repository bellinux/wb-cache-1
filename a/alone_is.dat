5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} oral and written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this <b>alone</b> <b>is</b> not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E

After Rousseau is killed in the fourth season, the American actress Melissa Farman portrayed a younger version of the character in the fifth season. Furlan later reappears for one episode in the sixth season. Rousseau is a recurring on-island character who has appeared in nineteen episodes in seasons one through four, as well as one episode where her voice <b>alone</b> <b>is</b> heard, and her final episode in the sixth season.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level <b>alone</b> <b>is</b> not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection <b>alone</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP <b>alone</b> <b>is</b> effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E

It is also a little slimmer and has a smaller head than the scarlet robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female scarlet robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and the spot on the crown above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides <b>alone</b> <b>is</b> not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E
