Steric sea level has also increased with an average change of 1 mmyr 1 from the 1970 s to 1990 s.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that ocean bottom pressure (OBP) can be used to measure the transport variability of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The OBP observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) are used to calculate transport along the choke point between Antarctica and Australia. Statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the uncertainty of the GRACE observations using a simulated data set. There has been some evidence to suggest that Southern Hemisphere winds and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) or the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) {{play a significant role in}} accelerating/decelerating ACC transport, along with some contribution from buoyancy forcing. We will examine whether average zonal wind stress, wind stress curl, local zonal winds, or the SAM are representative of the low frequency zonal mass transport variability. Preliminary studies suggest that seasonal variation in transport across the Australia-Antarctica choke point is driven by winds along and north of the northern front of the ACC, the Sub Tropical front (STF). It also appears that interannual variations in transport are related to wind variations centered south of the Sub <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Front</b> (SAF). We have observed a strong negative correlation/positive correlation across the STF of the ACC in the Indian Ocean, which suggests wind stress curl may also be responsible for transport variations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground : In {{the open}} ocean, eddies and {{associated}} structures (fronts, filaments) have strong {{influences on the}} foraging activities of top-predators through the enhancement {{and the distribution of}} marine productivity, zooplankton and fish communities. Investigating how central place foragers, such as penguins, find and use these physical structures is crucial to better understanding their at-sea distribution. In the present study, we compared the travel heading and speed of the world’s most abundant penguin, the Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus), with the distribution of surface physical structures (large-scale fronts, eddies and filaments). Results : The study was performed during December 2012 in the Crozet Archipelago (46. 42 ° S; 51. 86 ° E), South Indian Ocean. Six males at incubation stage were equipped with GPS loggers to get their trajectories. We used Eulerian and Lagrangian methods to locate large-scale fronts, mesoscale eddies (10 – 100 km) and part of the sub-mesoscale structures (< 10 km, filaments) at the surface of the ocean. By comparing the positions of birds and these structures, we show that Macaroni penguins: i) target the sub Antarctic Front; ii) increase their foraging activity within a highly dynamic area, composed of eddy fields and filamentary structures; and iii) travel {{in the same direction as}} the predominant currents. Conclusions : We show that penguins adjust their travel speed and movement during their whole trips in relation with the oceanographic structures visited. At a large scale, we hypothesize that Macaroni penguins target the sub <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Front</b> to find profitable patches of their main prey. At finer scale, Macaroni penguin may adopt a horizontal drifting behavior in strong currents, which could be a way to minimize costs of displacement...|$|E
40|$|The general {{circulation}} in the Southern Ocean plays {{a significant role}} in the global climate, as it connects all the major world basins, carrying anomalies around the globe through the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). A better understanding of the physical mechanisms that take place in this region can help improve the knowledge of the global ocean circulation. In this context, this thesis deals with the dynamics of the Southern Ocean and of the ACC by means of a numerical model approach. Results obtained from the primitive equation sigma-coordinate Princeton Ocean Model (POM) concerning both the mean circulation and the intrinsic variability in the Southern Ocean are presented and discussed. Preliminary simulations are performed in order to set up a consistent circulation for the Sothern Ocean, i. e. with a realistic structure of the ACC fronts and with acceptable values of the volume transport across the Drake Passage. Steady wind stress and heat fluxes are imposed based on climatological data in a periodic channel with realistic coastlines and bathymetry. In order to investigate the role of the bottom form drag on the dynamical balance of the ACC, a hierarchy of model implementations for a homogeneous ocean are first developed using both a flat-bottom and an idealized topography. Baroclinicity is also considered: in particular, the meridional density gradient is found to be a significant element, as it activates the JEBAR effect and prevents a total topographic steering. A consistent model for the ACC is finally proposed using realistic bottom topography and background stratification. An overview of the simulations in an eddy-permitting resolution shows evidence of intrinsic variability of the ACC. The latter is found to be strongly sensitive to the bottom topography, eddy viscosity and stratification. By analyzing the results of these numerical experiments we investigate the statistical interrelationships between different regions in the Southern Ocean, and give a first estimate of teleconnections in the Southern Ocean dynamics. Both the variability and the connectivity are found to be very significant in the Argentine Basin, a crucial region where strongly contrasted water masses encounter and mix. Recent observations in this region have evidenced a clear variability of the flow associated with the Zapiola Anticyclone, a strong counterclockwise current that encircles the Zapiola Rise (the main topographic feature located in the middle of the basin). Our simulations does show such a dynamical feature, along with the existence of two markedly different regimes of the circulation associated with the Zapiola Anticyclone on long-term time scales. In particular, the analysis of transport and sea surface height signals evidence a weakly variable regime related to a quasi-steady circulation around the Zapiola Rise, and a highly variable regime associated with fluctuations of the main flow and with a strong eddy activity. An abrupt transition from one state to the other characterizes such a behavior. Moreover, the counterclockwise topographic circulation around the Zapiola Rise occasionally collapses when, within the highly variable regime, the northern branch of the ACC frontal system (the Sub <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Front)</b> is able to shed this structure away. Interesting agreement is also found when comparing model results with altimeter data...|$|E

While G. inflata was until now {{regarded}} as a single species, we show that it rather constitutes a complex of two pseudo-cryptic species. Our study is based on SSU and ITS rDNA sequence analyses and genotyping of 497 individuals collected at 49 oceanic stations covering the worldwide range of the morpho-species. Phylogenetic analyses unveil the presence of two divergent genotypes. Type I inhabits transitional and subtropical waters of both hemispheres, while Type II is restricted to the Antarctic subpolar waters. The two genetic species exhibit a strictly allopatric distribution {{on each side of}} the <b>Antarctic</b> Subpolar <b>Front.</b> On the other hand, sediment data show that G. inflata was restricted to transitional and subtropical environments since the early Pliocene, and expanded its geographic range to southern subpolar waters ∼ 700 kyrs ago, during marine isotopic stage 17.

The analysis of satellite data from the modern Southern Ocean indicates that phytoplankton are limited by the availability of the micronutrient iron in most areas.

Here, we analyzed sediments of four regions in the Southern Atlantic Ocean along the <b>Antarctic</b> Polar <b>Front</b> that had different exposures to phytoplankton bloom derived organic matter. We investigated the microbial communities in these sediments using high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA molecules to determine microorganisms that were active and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization to infer their abundance and distribution.

Benthic deep-sea NOR 5 were abundant, diverse, distinct from pelagic NOR 5 and likely specialized on the degradation of phytoplankton-derived organic matter, occupying a similar niche as their pelagic relatives. Algal detritus seemed to not only fuel the benthic microbial communities of large areas in the deep-sea, but also to influence communities locally, as we found a peak in Flavobacteriaceae-related clades that also include degraders of algal biomass.

All fishing was to the south of the <b>Antarctic</b> Polar <b>Front.</b> Data were collected on sea surface temperature, catch per unit of effort, size, sex, maturity status and stomach contents of the catch and a sample of squid was aged by counting putative, daily microgrowth increments in the sectioned statolith. All squid were caught by jigs operating at depths from 80 to 100 [*]m to the surface. Catch per unit of effort per drift varied between 1. 0 and 21. 9 [*]kg[*]min− 1 and there was no by-catch. Greatest numbers of squid were caught at dusk and dawn. Mantle length fell in the range 220 – 350 [*]mm (males) and 212 – 370 [*]mm (females). Most males were sexually mature (Lipinski's stages IV–V) and most females were immature (stage II).

The relationships between Cd isotope ratios and concentrations display two negative correlations, separating the ACC and Weddell Gyre into two distinct Cd isoscapes. These arrays are consistent with Rayleigh fractionation and imply a doubling of the isotope effect due to biological consumption of Cd during water transport from the Weddell Gyre into the ACC. The increase in magnitude of Cd isotope fractionation can be accounted for by differences in the phytoplankton biomass, community composition, and their physiological uptake mechanisms in the Weddell Gyre and ACC, thus linking Cd isotope fractionation to primary production and the global carbon cycle. ...|$|R

The 1 D-model version comprises two compartments of each phyto- and zooplankton, nitrate, ammonium, silicate and three compartments of detritus. The model is forced by annual cycles of the mixed layer depth at different positions which are derived from a 3 D-ocean-model with (1 / 3) ^∘ resolution. Model results indicate that {{at least part of the}} ecosystem's regional variability is covered by the impact of different annual cycles of the mixed layer depth. However, mesoscale features of the hydrography and biological processes which are not covered in the "traditional" model concept appear to play an important role as well...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} that {{determine}} the distribution of taxa at various spatial scales is a crucial challenge {{in the context of}} global climate change. This holds particularly true for polar marine biota that are composed of both highly adapted and vulnerable faunas. We analysed the distribution of 2 Antarctic echinoid species, Sterechinus antarcticus and S. neumayeri, at the scale of the entire Southern Ocean using 2 niche modelling procedures. The performance of distribution models was tested with regard to the known ecology of the species. The respective contributions of environmental parameters are discussed along with the putative roles played by biotic interactions and biogeographic processes. Depth was the parameter that contributed most to both distribution models, whereas sea ice coverage and sea surface temperature had significant contributions for S. neumayeri only. Suitability maps of the 2 species were mostly similar, with a few notable differences. The Campbell Plateau and Tasmania were predicted as suitable areas for S. antarcticus only, while S. neumayeri was restricted to the south of the <b>Antarctic</b> Polar <b>Front.</b> However, numerous sampling data attest that S. antarcticus is absent from the Campbell Plateau and from Tasmania. Different hypotheses are formulated to explain the mismatch between observed and modelled distribution data. They stress the putative roles played by both oceanographic barriers to dispersal (<b>Antarctic</b> Polar <b>Front),</b> biotic factors (species exclusion patterns) and biogeographic processes (ongoing dispersal) ...|$|R
