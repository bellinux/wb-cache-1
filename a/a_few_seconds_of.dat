SBK inserted [...] "Popscene" [...] between [...] "Turn It Up" [...] and [...] "Resigned"; Blur had refused to include [...] "Popscene" [...] on the British version of Modern Life, disappointed by the tepid response it received when it was released as a single.

With [...] remaining in the stage-concluding climb to Luz Ardiden, the elder Schleck brother broke free of the group of the race's top riders in pursuit of two down the road. He did not quite reach them, finishing ten seconds back on the day, but the ride moved him up to second place overall, 28 seconds ahead of his brother and 17 the better of Evans. The brothers both missed an important move in stage 16, ending on the descent from the second-category Col de Manse. Contador, Sánchez, and Evans rode the most aggressive descent, a tactic which gained them a solid measure of time. Evans took 21 seconds out of Fränk Schleck to re-assume second place overall; the younger Schleck brother lost a full minute and six seconds to the veteran Australian.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes."

Fifty five cars planned to take the start following {{the withdrawal of the}} No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette, but the No. 23 Nissan missed the opening laps while undergoing repairs to its clutch.

Despite resuming driver Patrick Pilet pulled to the side of the track further down the Mulsanne Straight as the engine compartment soon caught fire. The No. 42 Strakka Dome-Nissan of Jonny Kane and Alexandre Imperatori in the No. 13 Rebellion car were caught off guard by Pilet's oil and collided with one another in the chicane, stranding the Rebellion in the gravel trap while the Dome returned to the pit lane for repairs.|$|E
500|$|In the Starry Messenger, Galileo {{reported}} that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope {{revealed to be}} discs. But shortly thereafter, in his Letters on Sunspots, he {{reported that}} the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be [...] "quite round". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> arc in diameter. He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems, his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of {{the width of the}} rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point. In his Dialogue, he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5/6 arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion (see seeing disk or Airy disk), and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by Tycho Brahe (see Magnitude) and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable. Other astronomers such as Simon Marius, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, and Martinus Hortensius made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument.|$|E
