5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the development batteries with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} current an <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> can deliver is roughly {{proportional}} to its physical size. This {{is a result}} of decreasing internal resistance as the internal surface area of the cell increases. A rule of thumb is that an AA <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> can deliver 700 mA without any significant heating. Larger cells, such as C and D cells, can deliver more current. Applications requiring currents of several amperes, such as powerful flashlights and portable stereos, will require D-sized cells to handle the increased load.|$|E
5000|$|In {{consumer}} applications, Ni-Cd batteries compete {{directly with}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries.</b> A Ni-Cd cell {{has a lower}} capacity than that of an equivalent alkaline cell, and costs more. However, since the <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery's</b> chemical reaction is not reversible, a reusable Ni-Cd battery has a significantly longer total lifetime. There have been attempts to create rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries,</b> or specialized battery chargers for charging single-use <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries,</b> but none that has seen wide usage.|$|R
25|$|<b>Alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> {{account for}} 80% of {{manufactured}} batteries in the US and over 10 billion individual units produced worldwide. In Japan <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> account for 46% of all primary battery sales. In Switzerland <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> account for 68%, in the UK 60% {{and in the}} EU 47% of all battery sales including secondary types.|$|R
50|$|Rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> are {{developed}} from primary <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries,</b> designed to resist leakage that a recharge could cause, {{so they can}} be safely recharged many times.|$|R
25|$|Battery {{life can}} be {{extended}} by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a refrigerator or freezer, which slows the side reactions. Such storage can {{extend the life of}} alkaline batteries by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type. To reach their maximum voltage, batteries must be returned to room temperature; discharging an <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> at 250 mA at 0°C is only half as efficient as at 20°C. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> manufacturers such as Duracell do not recommend refrigerating batteries.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> is strongly {{dependent on the}} load. An AA-sized <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the cut-off voltage of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads. On a heavy load, capacity is reduced on continuous discharge compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E
25|$|The <b>{{alkaline}}</b> <b>battery</b> {{gets its}} name {{because it has}} an alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide, instead of the acidic ammonium chloride or zinc chloride electrolyte of the zinc-carbon batteries. Other battery systems also use alkaline electrolytes, but they use different active materials for the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{disposable}} batteries increases by 5–6% every year. In the past, used batteries {{ended up at}} landfill sites, but in 2004, disposal of <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> at landfill sites was forbidden by an EU regulation. EU member countries are committed to recycling 50% of <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> by 2016. The need for recycling thus equals to 125,000 tons per year. The share of <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> is approximately 80% of the whole.|$|R

25|$|Capacity of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> {{is greater}} than an equal size Leclanché cell or zinc-chloride cell because the {{manganese}} dioxide is purer and denser, and space taken up by internal components such as electrodes is less. An alkaline cell can provide between three and five times capacity.|$|E
25|$|Batteries with {{alkaline}} (rather than acid) electrolyte {{were first}} developed by Waldemar Jungner in 1899, and, working independently, Thomas Edison in 1901. The modern alkaline dry battery using the zinc/manganese dioxide chemistry {{was invented by}} Canadian engineer Lewis Urry in the 1950s while working for Union Carbide's Eveready Battery division in Cleveland, OH, building on earlier work by Edison. On October 9, 1957, Urry, Karl Kordesch, and P.A. Marsal filed US patent (2,960,558) for the <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery.</b> It was granted in 1960 and {{was assigned to the}} Union Carbide Corporation.|$|E
25|$|A common {{dry cell}} is the zinc–carbon battery, {{sometimes}} called the dry Leclanché cell, with a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts, {{the same as the}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> (since both use the same zinc–manganese dioxide combination). A standard dry cell comprises a zinc anode, usually {{in the form of a}} cylindrical pot, with a carbon cathode in the form of a central rod. The electrolyte is ammonium chloride in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide, the latter acting as a depolariser. In some designs, the ammonium chloride is replaced by zinc chloride.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s it was {{discovered}} that illuminated organic dyes can generate electricity at oxide electrodes in electrochemical cells. In an effort to understand and simulate the primary processes in photosynthesis the phenomenon was studied at the University of California at Berkeley with chlorophyll extracted from spinach (bio-mimetic or bionic approach). On the basis of such experiments electric power generation via the dye sensitization solar cell (DSSC) principle was demonstrated and discussed in 1972. The instability of the dye solar cell was identified as a main challenge. Its efficiency could, during the following two decades, be improved by optimizing the porosity of the electrode prepared from fine oxide powder, but the instability remained a problem. A modern DSSC is composed of a porous layer of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, covered with a molecular dye that absorbs sunlight, like the chlorophyll in green leaves. The titanium dioxide is immersed under an electrolyte solution, above which is a platinum-based catalyst. As in a conventional <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery,</b> an anode (the titanium dioxide) and a cathode (the platinum) are placed on either side of a liquid conductor (the electrolyte).|$|E

Unlike rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries,</b> NiMH batteries can endure anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand (or more) deep discharge cycles, resulting in a long useful life; their limitation is now more usually by age rather than cycles. Capacity of NiMH batteries is close to that of <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries.</b> Unlike all <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> (rechargeable or otherwise), internal resistance is low.
