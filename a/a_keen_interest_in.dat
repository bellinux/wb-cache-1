Based on a rumor of police killing a black teenager, it left four dead and caused over $1 million in property damage in Father Divine's neighborhood. Father Divine's outrage at this and other racial injustices fueled <b>a</b> <b>keener</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics. In January 1939, the movement organized the first-ever [...] "Divine Righteous Government Convention", which crafted political platforms incorporating the Doctrine of Father Divine.

5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{focused on}} the foundations of general relativity {{as well as on}} the theory's applications to astrophysics. He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and proved the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework of general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity. In addition, Ehlers had <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> both the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science.|$|E

In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. In Nazi Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Social {{commentary}} was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E

It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father was hoping for his son {{to return to the}} farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was not strong. However, Reitz did go to London, and finished his studies successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867. During his time in England Reitz became interested in politics, and regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons. Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe.|$|E
