5|$|Tourism is an {{important}} industry in Moncton and historically owes its origins {{to the presence of}} two natural attractions, the tidal bore of the Petitcodiac River (see above) and the optical illusion of Magnetic Hill.

Magnetic Hill, on the city's northwest outskirts, is the city's most famous attraction.
