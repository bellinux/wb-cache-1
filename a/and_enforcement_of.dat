5|$|The loop was {{originally}} proposed in 1986 {{as part of}} a downtown revitalization effort. Almost from the beginning before the highway was commissioned in 1989, it was affected by controversial proposals. The first was related to suggestions by community leaders to rename city streets in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Another controversy dealt with rebuilding the streets {{as part of a}} downtown beautification project; the downtown business community protested the original scope of construction, and the Lansing City Council threatened to cancel the project in response to the controversy. In 2010, additional controversies surfaced regarding the posting <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> speed limits on city streets in Michigan, including the streets that make up the Capitol Loop.|$|E

5|$|Grimshaw {{was born}} in or around Great Harwood, Lancashire, in 1824 or 1825 {{and was one of}} six {{children}} brought up in a working-class family. His father, Thomas, had a reputation as a radical public speaker {{in the early part of}} the 19th century. Grimshaw initially worked as a cotton weaver before becoming a full-time activist and agitator. He first came to prominence in the village of Royton, near Oldham, in 1852 as a campaigner for the improvement <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> the Factory Acts, to improve the working conditions of those employed in the cotton mills. In the same year he became editor of the anti-Whig broadsheet, the Royton Vindicator. He criticised the suppression of local political activists and supported the alliance of the Chartist movement with the Tories against the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a radical}} public speaker and orator, Grimshaw's early campaigns were centred on the {{improvement}} of working conditions for the mill-workers {{in the village of}} Royton <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> the Factory Acts. He was an outspoken critic of the Whig Party and an advocate of the Chartist movement, in particular of their anti-Whig alliance with the Tory Party. Strikes among mill-workers began to break out during the early 1850s and Grimshaw was one of the leaders, along with George Cowell, of the strike in Preston in 1853. The strikers were fruitless in their demands for a ten per cent wage increase, and Grimshaw found himself with no further role in the workers' unions. He and his fellow conspirators were charged with conspiring to prevent people working in the mills, although the charges were later dropped.|$|E
5|$|The central {{government}} soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right {{of several of}} the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit. By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s the {{central government}} officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing). Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In that year of 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region. However, the government still needed masses of paper product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of 3-year's time. The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency of paper money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver. The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. In later dynasties, the use <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> paper currency was a method undertaken by the government {{as a response to the}} counterfeiting of copper coins.|$|E
