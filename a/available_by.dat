5|$|Current {{research}} indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–Pg boundary, despite the environment niches made <b>available</b> <b>by</b> the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–Pg boundary, including Chiroptera (bats) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even-toed ungulates), although recent research concludes that only marsupial orders diversified after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to foreign dignitaries, the President's Guest House {{has traditionally been}} made <b>available</b> <b>by</b> the outgoing President of the United States to the President-elect in the five days prior to his inauguration. In 1992, Bill Clinton chose {{to stay at the}} Hay–Adams Hotel instead of the guest house and, in 2009, a request by President-elect Barack Obama to take-up residence at the President's Guest House two weeks early was rejected because of its prior commitment to former Australian prime minister John Howard.|$|E

5|$|After {{extensive}} research {{that began in}} the 90s, a second push took place in March 2003, when the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen launched to the market the first full flexible-fuel car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. Several months later was followed by other Brazilian automakers, and by 2010 General Motors, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, Nissan and Kia Motors were producing popular models of flex cars and light trucks. The adoption of ethanol flex fuel vehicles was so successful, that production of flex cars went from almost 40 thousand in 2003 to 1.7 million in 2007. This rapid adoption of the flex technology was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place, as around 27,000 filling stations countrywide were <b>available</b> <b>by</b> 1997 with at least one ethanol pump, a heritage of the Pró-Álcool program.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of development, Slither.io was {{released}} for browsers and iOS on March 25, 2016, with servers supporting up to 500 players. Two days after the iOS/browser versions' release, an Android version was made <b>available</b> <b>by</b> Lowtech Studios. The only way Howse could make revenue was to display advertising in the app after the player's snake died; this option could be removed for US$3.99. He chose not to sell virtual currency or power-ups so that those who paid would not have an advantage over players who didn't. As {{there was no money}} to advertise for the game, the only way to advertise was the various let's plays by players on YouTube, including PewDiePie, who had more than 47 million subscribers at the time.|$|E
