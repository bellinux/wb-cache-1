On the August 23 episode of Talking Smack, The Miz went on a highly praised tirade against SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan for calling him a coward, with Miz calling Bryan a [...] "coward" [...] for not returning to the ring when he promised the fans he would. At Backlash, Miz successfully defended the title against Dolph Ziggler after Maryse sprayed an unknown substance at Ziggler while the referee was distracted. Afterwards, The Miz continued to blame Bryan. He vowed not to defend his Intercontinental Championship on any show until he was granted a contract [...] "renegotiation". On the September 20 episode of SmackDown, Miz retained the Intercontinental title against Ziggler in a rematch after he used the same spray on Ziggler. On October 9, at No Mercy, Miz lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ziggler in a title vs career match after Maryse and The Spirit Squad (Kenny and Mikey), were ejected from ringside, ending Miz's reign at 188 days. On the October 18 episode of SmackDown, Miz and the Spirit Squad defeated Ziggler, Slater and Rhyno. The Miz initially refused Ziggler's offer for a rematch for the Intercontinental title, but on November 8 episode of SmackDown, Maryse accepted Bryan's offer to Miz face Ziggler the following week for the Intercontinental Championship in the 900th episode of SmackDown. Later that night, Bryan would state on Talking Smack that if Ziggler successfully retained the championship, The Miz and Maryse would be traded to Raw for someone else. On SmackDowns 900th episode on November 15, Maryse helped Miz to win the championship for the sixth time. Miz would go on to defend the title against Raw's Sami Zayn at Survivor Series, where Miz would defeat Zayn after Maryse prematurely rang the bell, causing a distraction. On the November 22 episode of SmackDown, Miz successfully retained his championship against Kalisto after Kalisto was distracted by Baron Corbin and later Miz himself was attacked by Ziggler. Later that night, General Manager Daniel Bryan scheduled The Miz to defend the championship against Ziggler at TLC in a ladder match which Miz won, thus ending their feud. On December 6 episode of SmackDown, Miz again had a successful title defense against Dean Ambrose after interference from Maryse and distraction from James Ellsworth.|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular adaptations during {{pregnancy}} are normally well tolerated in healthy women. However, 2 % to 4 % {{of women of}} childbearing age have some degree of concomitant heart disease, and these changes may compromise cardiac function. Of these, a few who do not respond to medical treatment may require surgical correction. In this setting, ma-ternal mortality rate has improved to levels similar to those in non-pregnant counterparts. However, the fetal mortality rate remains high (up to 33 %). Factors contributing to high fetal mortality rates include the timing of the operation, the urgency of the operation, and the fetal/fetoplacental response to cardiopulmonary bypass. Modulation of the fetoplacen-tal response to cardiopulmonary bypass may prevent placental dysfunction and sustained uterine contractions, which underlie fetal hypoxia and acidosis. In this article, we review cardiovascular adaptations to pregnancy and the pathophysi-ologic effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on the mother, fetus, and fetoplacental unit, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> whether manipulation of these responses can help in improving fetal out-come.

In French, the term is significant: peace is considered a slice of life between two conflicts. Thus, we speak of the early 20 th century as the «Belle Époque» <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the «interwar period», which implies the failure of peace. Twenty {{years after the end}} of the Great War, another, even more terrible conflict began. At the same time, an inversion of values took place in European minds that along with the horrors of war made it very difficult for any Franco-German reconciliation to take place. We would have to wait for the end of the Second World War and its consequences to speak of peace as a realistic utopia. This volume brings together a number of articles in Portuguese, French and English – on topics such as «thinking peace», intellectuals and peace, federalism and universalism, religiosity and secularism, women and peace, and campaigns and mobility – from many prestigious experts and young researchers.

Now, project leaders can coordinate and manage any project more efficiently and increase productivity. However, there is still is a gap of productivity, when we talk about BIM on Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) projects. When we are in a BIM environment <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> time, we are entering in another dimension of BIM, the 4 D (3 D + time). The 4 D simulation, which is the sequencing of the different stages of the construction, can help managers make better decisions or workarounds more efficiently, comparing various possibilities of embracing the work, but it will also help in managing spaces, keeping schedules updated and improving communication between the different participants in the project. In {{the point of view of}} a BIM manager the 3 D model is nothing more then a visual data base that can be managed to get to fulfill reports and to track the construction status. This is why the "I" of BIM is so important. Having in mind the last sentence, in this thesis the main goal is to find one workflow, between different software, that can increase productivity when managing MEP projects...|$|E
