5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E

Just before he dies, the Ood's eyes turn red <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> lunge for the Doctor and startles him with his ferocity. The Doctor surmises that the Ood was being influenced by a being near them. They find a nearby industrial complex called Ood Operations, {{a company that has}} been harvesting and selling the Ood as servants. The Doctor discovers that they are on the Ood-Sphere in the year 4126, close to the Sense-Sphere of the Sensorites. The [...] "Red Eye" [...] phenomenon begins affecting other Ood on the planet and several people are killed in the weeks before the Doctor arrived. The possessed Ood keep stating that [...] "the circle must be broken". Ood Operations consider the phenomenon to be a disease similar to foot-and-mouth disease. The CEO of Ood Operations, Klineman Halpen, tells the Doctor the method of killing each time is identical: the victims are electrocuted by the Ood's translation spheres.|$|E

However, J. A.

[...] In an interview with media website Digital Spy, Santer discussed the reasoning behind his decision to reintroduce Sam: [...] "What makes Sam interesting for me is that she's Ricky's first love and first wife. As Bianca and Ricky spend more time together [...] the inevitability of them at some point coming together increases. What's stopping them? Well, it's Sam. Sam and Ricky had a good thing going all those years ago.

There are quite a number of men between the ages of 30 and 40, but the great majority are from 20 to 30. They are all fine, upstanding fellows, and most of them have had college educations.

2500|$|Peter Lever (3/43) had Ken Eastwood caught {{behind by}} Alan Knott and John Snow (1/68) removed Keith Stackpole's off stump {{with a ball}} that came back a foot after {{pitching}} to leave Australian 13/2 {{at the end of}} the first day. Bob Willis (3/58) caught the nightwatchman Rod Marsh and bowled Ian Chappell the next morning and they were 66/4, but Ian Redpath (59) and Doug Walters (42) added 81. Walters was stumped on 41 by Knott, who made 6 dismissals in the match, but 'when Umpire Rowan ruled Walters not out, Knott stood on the edge of the popping crease as if paralysed with unbelief. Walters was stumped off Underwood (2/39) on 42 and given out by Umpire O'Connell and the spinner caught and bowled Ian Redpath. When Kerry O'Keeffe was out at 178/7 Greg Chappell (65) was left alone with the tail, but Terry Jenner retired hurt when he ducked into a [...] on 8. Rowan warned the fast bowler for intimidatory bowling yet again, but Snow and Illingworth objected strongly, the captain saying [...] "That's the only bouncer he's bowled" [...] and that he would complain to the ABC, but Snow had bowled three other short balls at Jenner earlier in the over and Bob Willis had been brought in for the mis-hit. Rowan later claimed that Illingworth and Snow swore at him, which they denied. The bowler was loudly booed and [...] "when he returned to his fielding position at long-leg Snow was pelted with bottles, cans and partially eaten pies". Some of the crowd wanted to shake his hand, but then he was [...] at Paddington Hill who was forced to let go by other spectators. In 1998 the eighty-year-old Trevor Guy told the Sydney Morning Herald that he was the man who had grabbed Snow in order to tell him what he thought about him hitting Jenner. Guy and Snow, in Australia for the 1998–99 Ashes series, agreed that they had no hard feelings about the matter. To avoid injury to his team Illingworth took his men back to the dressing room without the permission of the umpires, an unprecedented move in Test cricket. He later justified his action by saying [...] "I've seen people hit by bottles <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> bloody mess of them". The England manager David Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field and Lou Rowan told them that if they did not immediately return they would forfeit the match (and the Ashes) and was supported by Alan Barnes of the ABC. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down. Furthermore, he strongly objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. It took seven minutes for the groundstaff to move the debris, during which one was hit on the head with a beer-can and had to be taken to hospital, though most of the 40 cans were for soft drinks. The Australian batsmen Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee remained at the crease throughout the incident. Jenner returned to bat at 235/8 and made a brave 30, last man out on 264 to give Australia a lead of 80 runs.|$|E
