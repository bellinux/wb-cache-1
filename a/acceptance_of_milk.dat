40|$|AbstractWith {{the aim of}} {{comparing}} the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> obtained from cloned, genetically modified (GM) and conventionally bred cows among working adults and university students, and identifying and characterizing typologies among both subsamples {{in terms of their}} preferences, a survey was applied to 400 people in southern Chile, distributed using a simple allocation among the subsamples. Using a conjoint analysis, it was found that consumers preferred milk from a conventional cow. Using a cluster analysis, in both subsamples two segments sensitive to production technology were identified. Rejection of cloning was greatest among university students, whereas a higher proportion of working adults rejected GM. The segments differed in terms of area of residence, knowledge about GM, and milk consumption habits. Contrary to what was expected, no differences were found according to education, gender or degree of satisfaction with food-related life...|$|E
40|$|Findings of {{research}} and experiences gained in commercial practice reveal needs for efforts in order to reinforce further development in {{the subject matter of}} calving difficulty and stillbirth in dairy cattle with special emphasis on causes and effects. Direct costs such as loss of calf, death of dam, labour, veterinary assistance and other ones influencing economics in longer term e. g. higher culling rate, reduced milk yield and fertility have to be evaluated and interpreted. The effects of non-genetic factors, parity, sex of calf, age at first calving, season, level of nutrition during gestation and their supposed modes of action has to be considered. In the genetic model for calving traits estimates the following components has to be included such as direct, maternal, and direct-maternal interaction. Thus, accurate and complete reporting of calving ease and stillbirth data is critical for several reasons: increase the accuracy of sire calving ease and daughter calving ease evaluations; allow the development of national stillbirth evaluations; the farmer can enhance future sire selection opportunities for the herd. The aim is to reduce economic losses, improve welfare status of animals, meeting increased concern of consumer <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and dairy products...|$|E

40|$|This article reports {{results from}} a framed market {{experiment}} conducted to examine whether milk choices are responsive {{to changes in the}} nutritional characteristics <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> products. Using a random-effect Tobit model, we analyzed experimental data collected from 160 participants in urban Ethiopia. It shows that sensory properties {{play a key role in}} the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> reduced-fat <b>milk</b> while the provision of nutrition information has a mixed effect on a price premium. Further, a substantial percentage of participants were found to have a strong preference for whole milk while only 19 % of them prefer reduced-fat milk with 2. 8 % price premium. The study unveils a heterogeneous preference for the nutritional quality <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> products. Consumers' health problems and socio-demographic characteristics influence their preference for the nutritional quality <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> products.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{extensively}} hydrolysed formulas (eHF) and amino acid-based formula (AAFs) {{have been}} demonstrated effective {{for the treatment of}} CMA. However, in clinical practice, parents complain that hydrolysates are rejected by children due to their bad taste. Flavor of hydrolysed formulas has been poorly investigated although it affects the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> over all the other attributes. The aim {{of the present study was}} to understand the factors underlying the unpleasant flavor of hydrolysed 25 formulas and amino acid-based formula. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty trained panelists performed a randomized-double-blind test with different milks. The smell, texture, taste and aftertaste of each formula were evaluated on a scale ranging from - 2 (worst) to 2 (best). RESULTS: Formulas showed significant difference, as compared to cow's milk, in smell, texture, taste and aftertaste. Overall, whey eHFs were judged of better palatability than casein eHF and the AAFs (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Whey eHF showed significant differences among them for sensory attributes, especially for taste and aftertaste. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a broad range of flavor exists among the hydrolysed formulas. Further studies, adequately designed to investigate the relationship between milks' flavor and nutrient profile of hydrolysed formulas are warranted...|$|E
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} examines {{determinants of}} farmers' decision behavior to approve or disapprove process quality schemes in food production. A key methodology {{used in this}} study is discrete choice experiments (DCE) that are applied to reveal farmers' preferences and willingness-to-accept for production schemes. Although many people are critical towards modern agricultural practices and some consumers are willing to pay price increments for certain process qualities, the availability of milk that is produced without using GMO and high-welfare meat remain limited. The private sector as well as the German government responds with the establishment of production schemes and standards to meet consumers’ demand. However, there is a perception that incentives for farmers are not sufficient to encourage the desired changes of farming practices. This study examines farmers’ <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> production without GM-feedstuff (Chapter 2), as well as improved housing conditions and animal-friendly livestock handling in dairy and pig farming (Chapter 3 and 4). Furthermore, estimates of consumers’ willingness-to-pay for high welfare cutlets were used to simulate markets for pork produced in accordance with defined farm animal welfare standards (Chapter 4). In addition, farmers’ support of cooperation between dairies {{in the form of the}} joint milk collection to the production of cost-effective and more environmentally friendly was subject of the study in Chapter 5. The results of the case studies show that not only economic indicators are relevant for a farmers’ decision making, but also "soft factors", such as the general attitude towards animal welfare or genetic engineering and also the perception of the supplier relationship quality between the dairy company’s management and the farmer. This information can be used to design production concepts more efficient and thus achieve a greater degree of acceptance...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{oxidized}} flavour (SOF) is an off-flavour in milk {{that has received}} attention {{in only a few}} countries, primarily due to lack of monitoring. The poly unsaturated fatty acids in milk are considered to make it more prone to oxidize, with effects like shorter shelf life of dairy products and a reduction in consumer <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> On the other hand, unsaturated fatty acids have a reputation of being healthier than the saturated fatty acids. Means to optimize the fatty acid composition of milk include breeding measures, why acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT 1), a major gene for milk fat content, has lately attracted a lot of research efforts. The risk of milk to develop SOF showed a strong and positive association with milk concentrations of both the well known prooxidant copper and its substrate the poly unsaturated milk fatty acids. The observed statistical interaction between copper and fatty acid composition suggests that SOF will not develop as easily in milk with high copper content unless sufficient amounts of substrate is available to promote the oxidation process. Breed and selection for fat content had an effect on the composition of milk fat where milk from Swedish Holstein cows generally had larger amounts of poly unsaturated fatty acids compared to the Swedish Red cows in the two selection lines in the SLU research herd. Selection for high milk fat content was associated with lower concentration of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). The selection for fat content created differences in allele frequencies of the DGAT 1 gene between selection lines, with a higher frequency of the 232 A allele within the low fat line. DGAT 1 genotype was associated with both composition of milk fat and occurrence of SOF, with the A allele being associated with a higher proportion of the polyunsaturated fatty acid CLA and an increased susceptibility of milk to develop SOF. The observed genetic variation in occurrence of SOF indicates that it may become a milk quality issue should bulls become selected that happen to carry genotypes predisposing for milk sensitive to oxidation...|$|E

40|$|Multi-criteria {{decision}} aid {{has emerged}} from the operational research field as the answer given {{to a couple of}} important questions encountered in complex decisions problems. Firstly, as decision aiding tools, such methods do not replace the decision maker with a mathematical model, but support him to construct his solution by describing and evaluating his options. Secondly, instead of using a unique criterion capturing all aspects of the problem, in the multi-criteria decision aid methods one seeks to build multiple criteria, representing several points of view. This work explores the application of multi-criteria decision aid methods for optimising food chain countermeasure strategies after a radioactive release to the environment. The core of the thesis is dedicated to formulating general lines {{for the development of a}} multi-criteria decision aid model. This includes the definition of potential actions, construction of evaluation criteria and preference modelling and is essentially based on the results of a stakeholders’ process. The work is centred on the management of contaminated milk in order to provide a concrete focus and because of its importance as an ingestion pathway in short term after an accident. Among other issues, the public <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> countermeasures as a key evaluation criterion is analysed in detail. A comparison of acceptance based on stochastic dominance is proposed and, based on that, a countermeasures’ acceptance ranking is deduced. In order to assess “global preferences” taking into account all the evaluation criteria, an ordinal method is chosen. This method allows expressing the relative importance of criteria in a qualitative way instead of using, for instance, numerical weights. Some algorithms that can be used for robustness analysis are also proposed. This type of analysis is an alternative to sensitivity analysis in what concerns data uncertainty and imprecision and seeks to determine how and if a model result or conclusion obtained for a specific instance of a model’s parameters holds over the entire domain of acceptable values for these parameters. The integrated multi-criteria decision aid approach proposed makes use of outranking and interactive methodologies and is implemented and tested through a number of case studies and prototype tools.

40|$|Foaming can be {{beneficial}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} temperature at/to which milk is foamed. For instance, foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is beneficial when making Italian style coffee such as cappuccino where steam from a steam generator is injected into milk to create a foam and to simultaneously heat the milk to ~ 65  70 °C. Foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is undesirable during operations such as pumping of cold (5 °C) milk in a dairy processing plant. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop an understanding of the foaming patterns <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and the factors that affect the foaming properties in the temperature range 5  85 °C and use this understanding to devise treatments and additives to improve/reduce the foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> depending on the end stage application. A review of literature showed that very little information was available on the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as a function of temperature. Moreover a clear gap existed between an understanding of the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> proteins in single or binary systems and the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> per se. Foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> over a broad temperature range were studied using a specially designed foaming apparatus, which enabled foams to be produced under standardised conditions. Foaming patterns of a range <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> which included raw whole milk, pasteurised homogenised full-cream milk, pasteurised skim milk, UHT homogenised full-cream milk, UHT skim milk and reconstituted milks made from low-, medium- and high-heat skim milk powder, were established as a function of temperature (5  85 °C). The foaming properties <b>of</b> a given <b>milk</b> were largely determined by the temperature at which milk was foamed, its fat content, and the processing conditions used during its manufacture. Skim milks had a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C when foamed over a temperature range of 5  85 °C. Image analysis <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams, as observed under a light microscope, showed that the surface <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams coarsened over time. This occurred most rapidly in foams produced at 5 °C and least rapidly in those produced at 45 °C. The foaming properties <b>of</b> full-cream <b>milks</b> were largely determined by the physical state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat. Milk fat was detrimental to foam formation and stability <b>of</b> full-cream <b>milks</b> when milk fat globules contained both solid and liquid fat i. e. in the temperature range 5  40 °C. The extent of whey protein denaturation had a positive effect on the foam stability <b>of</b> reconstituted <b>milks</b> at lower temperatures (< 45 °C) and a negative correlation with foam stability at higher temperatures When skim milk was separated into its micellar, ultracentrifugal and defatted ultracentrifugal fractions, the foaming pattern <b>of</b> the parent <b>milk</b> as a function of temperature (5  85 °C), resembled that of the micellar fraction, with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. The foaming pattern of the serum phase <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> could not be determined due to precipitation of calcium, when the defatted ultracentrifugal supernatant was heated to temperatures G 45 °C. The sedimentable interfacial material isolated by low-speed centrifugation <b>of</b> collapsed skim <b>milk</b> foams was made up of large-sized casein micelles; particle size measurements and electrophoretic analysis of this material showed that the stability <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams was mainly determined by the ability of micellar caseins to adsorb and form a stabilising network at the air serum interface of the foams. Addition of calcium-chelating agents, which increased the non-micellar casein content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> decreased foam stability, while addition of calcium salts, which increased the micellar casein content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> increased foam stability, reinforcing the observation that adsorption of micellar caseins is required for the stability <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams. The role of whey proteins in the stabilisation <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams could not be determined from a study of the sedimentable interfacial material, as they were lost in the supernatant during low speed centrifugation <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams. Lipolysis as measured by the FFA content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> had a negative effect on the steam foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> with foamability and foam stability decreasing and the coarseness of foam increasing with an increase in the FFA content. The destabilising effect of the products of lipolysis was higher when milk was foamed at lower temperatures. A good correlation was observed between surface tension, FFA content and foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> However, natural variations in other surface active components <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> such as fat, protein and phospholipids, tend to mask the effect of changing FFA content on the surface tension value <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and as a result it was difficult to arrive at an absolute surface tension value <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> below which foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> were adversely affected. Increasing the total solids content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> decreased foamability and increased foam stability due to an increase in the viscosity coupled with an increase in the amount of protein available for adsorption at the airserum interface <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foams. As in the case of increasing total solids content, addition of H-carrageenan decreased foamability and increased the foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> due to an increase in viscosity <b>of</b> the <b>milk.</b> Emulsification <b>of</b> oils such as olive, canola and sunflower oils in skim milk using a microfluidiser resulted in a pronounced increase in the foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The foaming patterns <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> containing oil instead <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat resembled that <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. This suggested that lipids which are fully liquid above 0 °C are not detrimental to the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foamed in the temperature range 5  85 °C. The higher foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> containing added oil, when compared to the parent skim milk, was attributed to an increase in the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as a result of the added oil. Pre-heat treatment <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> to temperatures G 65 °C altered the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The foamability <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> increased with an increase in the temperature of preheat treatment from 65 to 85 °C, while the foam stability was highest when milk was subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. Lowering of the measurable FFA content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> by the likely binding of FFA to BSA and I-lactoglobulin, and the lack of whey protein denaturation, could be responsible for the higher foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. The present study represents a significant step forward in understanding the foaming behavior <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> which is determined by the complex interplay between temperature, the structure, conformation and distribution <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> proteins, and the nature of other components <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> such as fat, mineral salts and FFAs. An understanding of the importance of caseins in the stabilisation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foams and the effect of the physical state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat on the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> achieved in the present study, opens up exciting avenues for the manipulation of the foaming behavior <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> especially to produce specialty milks with improved foaming properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{research}} on finding the causes and preventing the formation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> deposit are described in this paper. During the heat treatment <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> an unwanted phenomenon occurs; the formation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> deposit on heating surfaces of heat exchangers. This phenomenon causes the decrease of heat transfer coefficient {{as well as the}} pressure drop, it restricts the flow <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> and causes additional production costs and increases production loss. The formation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> deposit is a result of complex processes caused by thermal treatment of proteins and mineral substances in milk. Factors which cause milk deposit are: pH - value, the amount of proteins and mineral substances in milk, dissolved gases in <b>milk,</b> characteristics <b>of</b> heating surface, the difference in temperatures <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and heating surfaces, and the regime <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> circulation. The chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> can not be influenced, but the standards of heat treatment in order to minimise this phenomenon can, and that is precisely the topic of the latest researches...|$|R

This research aimed to evaluate {{the effect of the}} supplementation of increasing amounts of Lactobacillus acidophilus (0, 0. 4, or 0. 8 g/L <b>of</b> <b>milk)</b> on the physicochemical parameters and sensory <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> Minas fresh cheese. In addition, the sensory <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> probiotic cheeses was assessed using a consumer test and compared with commercial cheeses (conventional and probiotic). High counts (9. 11 to 9. 42 log cfu/g) of L. acidophilus were observed throughout the shelf life, which contributed to the maintenance of its probiotic status and resulted in lower pH values and greater production of organic acids. The probiotic cheeses presented lower scores for appearance, aroma, and texture compared with conventional cheeses. Internal preference mapping explained almost 130 % of the total variation of the data and showed a large number of consumers concentrated near the conventional cheeses, demonstrating greater preference for these samples. The findings indicated that some negative sensory effects could occur when high level of supplementation with L. acidophilus is used in probiotic cheese processing...|$|R

40|$|Frozen yogurt is {{a frozen}} {{fermented}} dessert which presents structural characteristics similar to {{ice cream and}} nutritional and sensorial properties which resemble to yogurt. The acidification of ice cream mix by means of lactic bacteria can influence the properties of frozen yogurt. For that reason, the present work aimed to evaluate the influence of pH on the physicochemical and sensorial characteristics of strawberry frozen yogurt. The formulation consisted of 6 % <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat, 10 % <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> solids-not-fat, 11 % of sucrose, 3 % of corn syrup, 0. 3 % of emulsifiers and 0. 5 % of stabilizers. The frozen yogurt mixes were made with different fermentation endpoints, pH values of 4. 5, 5. 0 and 5. 5. The strawberry fruit mixture {{was added to the}} fermented frozen yogurt mix at a level of 4 % (w/w). According to the results, the pH of the frozen yogurt mix did not influence the concentrations of protein, fat and ash whereas the contents of acidity, reducing, non-reducing and total sugars underwent influence of pH due to fermentation. The acceptability of frozen yogurt in relation to the attributes flavor, texture, overall acceptance and ideal acidity was evaluated. It was found that pH influenced the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> frozen yogurt; the treatments with final pH of 5. 0 and 5. 5 presented higher acceptability for all the treatments evaluated and acidity close to the ideal. By means of the principal component analysis, {{it was found that the}} physicochemical characteristics acidity content and sugar concentration (reducing, non-reducing and total) had effect on the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the product. In conclusion, the strawberry frozen yogurts with pH 5. 0 and 5. 5 demonstrated good sensorial acceptance and thus, presented potential of being better explored by the ice cream industries...|$|R
