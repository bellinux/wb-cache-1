5|$|Goldman grouped four {{subspecies}} of couesi {{from the}} interior plateaus of central Mexico together—albiventer, crinitus, aztecus, and regillus. Three of those (albiventer from Jalisco, crinitus from the Distrito Federal, and aztecus from Morelos) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described regillus from Michoacán in 1915. According to Goldman, aztecus is pale and large-toothed, crinitus is large, dark and large-toothed, regillus is large <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> albiventer is large and relatively pale.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
25|$|Like other Cyclura iguanas, Ricord's iguanas {{have evolved}} a white photosensory organ {{on the top}} of their heads called the parietal eye, which are also called third eye, pineal eye or pineal gland. This “eye” does not work the same way as a normal eye does as it has only a {{rudimentary}} retina and lens and thus, cannot form images. It is however sensitive to changes in light <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> can detect movement.|$|E
25|$|The south {{church is}} a square room surmounted by a dome, and {{surrounded}} by two deambulatoria, an esonarthex and a parekklesion (added later). The north deambulatorium is the south parekklesion of the north church. This multiplication of spaces around {{the central part of}} the church is typical of the late Palaiologian architecture: the reason of that was the need for more space for tombs, monuments erected to benefactors of the church, etc. The central room is divided from the aisles by a triple arcade. During the mass the believers were confined in the deambulatoria, which were shallow <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> could barely see what happened in {{the central part of the}} church.|$|E

25|$|Many {{species of}} centipedes lack eyes, but some possess a {{variable}} number of ocelli, which are sometimes clustered {{together to form}} true compound eyes. However, these eyes are only capable of discerning light <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> have no true vision. In some species, the first pair of legs at the head end of the centipede acts as sense organs similar to antennae, but unlike the antennae of most other animals, theirs point backwards. Unusual sense organs found in some groups are the organs of Tömösváry. These are located {{at the base of}} the antennae, and consist of a disc-like structure with a central pore surrounded by sensory cells. They are probably used for sensing vibrations, and may even provide a sense of hearing.|$|E

Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally." [...] He also lauded {{the quality of the}} iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15" [...] model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.|$|E

He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging <b>and</b> <b>dark.</b> <b>And</b> I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers.

500|$|Over eleven years, Tubman {{returned}} {{repeatedly to}} the Eastern Shore of Maryland, rescuing some 70 slaves in about thirteen expeditions, including her three other brothers, Henry, Ben, and Robert, {{their wives and}} some of their children. She also provided specific instructions to 50 to 60 additional fugitives who escaped to the north. Tubman's dangerous work required tremendous ingenuity; she usually worked during winter months, to minimize the likelihood that the group would be seen. One admirer of Tubman said: [...] "She always came in the winter, when the nights are long <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> people who have homes stay in them." [...] Once she had made contact with escaping slaves, they left town on Saturday evenings, since newspapers would not print runaway notices until Monday morning.|$|E
500|$|Colby Hall of Mediaite {{called the}} {{sequence}} [...] "a jaw-dropping critique of global corporate licensing, worker exploitation and over-the-top dreariness of how western media companies (in this case, 20th Century Fox) {{takes advantage of}} outsourced labor in developing countries." [...] Melissa Bell of The Washington Post felt Banksy's titles had helped revive The Simpsons [...] "edge", but after [...] "the jarring opening, the show went back to its regular routine of guest cameos, self-referential jokes and tangential story lines." [...] Marlow Riley of MTV wrote [...] "as satire, [...] a bit over-the-top. What is shocking is that Fox ran Banksy's ballsy critique of outsourcing, The Simpsons, and the standards and human rights conditions that people in first world nations accept. It's uncomfortable <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> not what's expected from the modern Simpsons, which mainly consists of 'Homer hurts himself' jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|The title California is {{representative}} of the band's home state, and was picked after the band members realized that they had written multiple songs relating to its cities and culture. The title was also inspired by the season and Feldmann's studio: [...] "It was a perfect California winter, and it was sunny and hot every single day. John's studio, it's basically indoor-outdoor with palm trees everywhere." [...] Though he refrained from dubbing it a concept album, Skiba considered the songs linked thematically: [...] "big and bright and huge <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> twisted, everything that California is." [...] "The title of this album {{was one of the most}} difficult things I've done in my entire life," [...] said Hoppus. Alternate titles for the album included No Future, which was dropped because it seemed too negative, and the joke titles OB-GYN Kenobi, Nude Erection, and No Hard Feelings. D*Face also reported that the titles Los Angeles and Riot were nearly used.|$|E

While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, for me because I had to tell the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done.

Unlike in Holochilus brasiliensis, which occurs in the same area, the tail is longer than the head and body. It is sparsely haired <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> there is no difference in color between the upper and lower side. The coat, which is long, dense, and soft, is yellow–brown at the sides, but becomes darker on the upperparts and lighter on the underparts. The large hindfeet are characterized by conspicuous interdigital webbing, but they lack tufts of hair on the digits and several of the pads are reduced. As in some other semiaquatic oryzomyines, fringes of hair are present along the plantar margins and between some of the digits. The forefeet also lack tufts on the digits and show very long claws, a character unique among oryzomyines. The female has four pairs of teats, and the gall bladder is absent, both important characters of oryzomyines.

500|$|The initial {{location}} for principal photography for True Detective was Arkansas; however, Pizzolatto later opted to film in southern Louisiana {{to capitalize on}} generous statewide tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape, which he felt illustrated a striking paradox. [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all," [...] the native Louisianan noted. [...] "Everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> impenetrable. On the other hand you have {{the beauty of it}} all from a distance." [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] and subsequent episodes were shot in 35 mm film, and principal photography for the season consumed 100 consecutive days. The crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside of Erath, Louisiana which, because it was partially burned, inspired a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for corresponding scenes. Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw, previously director of photography for Top of the Lake, as project cinematographer and employed minimalistic lighting for layering composition. Also involved in production was Alex DiGerlando, who Fukunaga had previously worked with on Benh Zeitlin Glory at Sea (2008). The director remarked in an interview, [...] "I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money, how much more amazing he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, True Detective {{first season}} {{was due to}} shoot in Arkansas, but Pizzolatto later chose to film in Louisiana to take {{advantage}} of state tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape: [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all...everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> impenetrable. On the other hand you have the beauty of it all from a distance." [...] Principal photography took three months (between 100 and 110 days), from January to June 2013. Approximately five minutes of film were shot per day. Production staff constructed various set pieces, among them a scorched chapel, Joel Theriot's tent revival, and the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division offices, the last of which they built inside an abandoned light bulb warehouse near Elmwood. For the Dora Lange crime scene, the crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside Erath which, because it was partially burned, inspired what DiGerlando called a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for the corresponding interior scenes. The scene in which Cohle, taking Ginger hostage, escapes a housing complex amidst gunfire, was captured in Bridge City as a single six-minute tracking shot, a technique Fukunaga had employed in Sin Nombre (2009) and Jane Eyre (2011). Shot in seven takes, preparation for the scene was extensive and demanding: McConaughey trained with Mark Norby to master a fighting style for his character, {{and the nature of the}} shoot required a team of stunt coordinators, make-up artists, and special effects crew on hand during its entire course. Elsewhere, shooting took place at the old Kenner High School campus and nineteenth-century Fort Macomb, located outside New Orleans.|$|E
500|$|Rhys {{said that}} [...] "if there's {{a song that}} sums up the album in terms of mood", perhaps it is [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon", typifying its [...] "wintery persona". The track has been {{described}} by Rhys as a celebration of the band's love of The Beach Boys, Love, and Ennio Morricone, featuring layered vocal harmonies. [...] "Pan Ddaw'r Wawr" [...] features a [...] "wheezing harmonium" [...] and [...] "perishing trumpet swirl", and has been compared to the music of XTC, Ennio Morricone, and [...] "psychedelic-era" [...] Rolling Stones. According to Rhys, the music of [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] was written to provide the soundtrack to a fictional journey, [...] "cruising down the A5 to Rome in a two-door chariot". The song has been called [...] "evil personified" [...] <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> has been likened to the sound of [...] "an approaching Roman army". The [...] "folky", eerily melancholic [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] has been compared to the Tori Amos single [...] "Cornflake Girl". [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] {{has been described as a}} [...] "brass-soaked" [...] cross between the music of Herb Alpert and The Doors, featuring [...] "maudlin horns and military beats", while Rhys has said that the song is a combination of Nick Drake, Gladys Knight, and The Velvet Underground's third album. [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] and the album's opening track, [...] "Drygioni", have been singled out as the only songs on Mwng that are [...] "distinctly cheery". Both display glam rock influences and have been compared to Roxy Music, with Rhys describing [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] as [...] "old time pop music" [...] with vocal harmonies that are a tribute to late 1960s groups such as the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes.|$|E
