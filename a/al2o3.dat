5|$|Arc {{discharge}}: {{this is a}} {{high power}} thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in metallurgical processes. For example, {{it is used to}} smelt minerals containing <b>Al2O3</b> to produce aluminium.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is {{employed}} to saturate broken ("dangling") bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties. It {{is also a}} potential electron donor in various oxide materials, including ZnO, SnO2, CdO, MgO, ZrO2, HfO2, La2O3, Y2O3, TiO2, SrTiO3, LaAlO3, SiO2, <b>Al2O3,</b> ZrSiO4, HfSiO4, and SrZrO3.|$|E
5|$|It {{has some}} {{properties}} that are {{unusual for a}} metal; taken together, these are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding. Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide <b>Al2O3</b> is amphoteric, and a conditional glass-former. Aluminium can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide <b>Al2O3</b> in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{aluminate}} cements are {{hydraulic cements}} made primarily from limestone and bauxite. The active ingredients are monocalcium aluminate CaAl2O4 (CaO · <b>Al2O3</b> or CA in Cement chemist notation, CCN) and mayenite Ca12Al14O33 (12 CaO · 7 <b>Al2O3,</b> or C12A7 in CCN). Strength forms by hydration to calcium aluminate hydrates. They are well-adapted {{for use in}} refractory (high-temperature resistant) concretes, e.g. for furnace linings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Al2O3</b> films {{prepared}} using O3 show 10–100 times lower {{leakage current}} density {{compared with those}} prepared by H2O.|$|E
25|$|Pyrrole is {{prepared}} industrially by treatment of furan with ammonia {{in the presence}} of solid acid catalysts, like SiO2 and <b>Al2O3.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mineral dust {{is mainly}} {{constituted}} of the oxides (SiO2, <b>Al2O3,</b> FeO, Fe2O3, CaO, and others) and carbonates (CaCO3, MgCO3) {{that constitute the}} Earth's crust.|$|E
25|$|Bioceramic {{prosthetics}} {{are made}} of aluminium oxide (<b>Al2O3).</b> Aluminium oxide is a ceramic biomaterial {{that has been used}} for more than 35 years in the orthopedic and dental ﬁelds for a variety of prosthetic applications because of its low friction, durability, stability, and inertness.|$|E
25|$|Soda-lime-silica glass, window glass: silica + {{sodium oxide}} (Na2O) + lime (CaO) + {{magnesia}} (MgO) + alumina (<b>Al2O3).</b> Is transparent, easily formed and {{most suitable for}} window glass (see flat glass). It has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat (500–600°C). It is used for windows, some low-temperature incandescent light bulbs, and tableware. Container glass is a soda-lime glass that is a slight variation on flat glass, which uses more alumina and calcium, and less sodium and magnesium, which are more water-soluble. This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} {{catalysts}} {{are based on}} iron promoted with K2O, CaO, SiO2, and <b>Al2O3.</b> The original Haber–Bosch reaction chambers used osmium as the catalyst, but it was available in extremely small quantities. Haber noted uranium was almost as effective and easier to obtain than osmium. Under Bosch's direction in 1909, the BASF researcher Alwin Mittasch discovered a much less expensive iron-based catalyst, which is still used today. Some ammonia production utilizes ruthenium-based catalysts (the KAAP process). Ruthenium forms more active catalysts that allows milder operating pressures. Such catalysts are prepared by decomposition of triruthenium dodecacarbonyl on graphite.|$|E
25|$|Silica glass can be doped {{with various}} materials. One purpose of doping {{is to raise}} the {{refractive}} index (e.g. with germanium dioxide (GeO2) or aluminium oxide (<b>Al2O3))</b> or to lower it (e.g. with fluorine or boron trioxide (B2O3)). Doping is also possible with laser-active ions (for example, rare-earth-doped fibers) {{in order to obtain}} active fibers to be used, for example, in fiber amplifiers or laser applications. Both the fiber core and cladding are typically doped, so that the entire assembly (core and cladding) is effectively the same compound (e.g. an aluminosilicate, germanosilicate, phosphosilicate or borosilicate glass).|$|E
25|$|One {{emerging}} {{alternative and}} promising technology {{is based on}} an organic-inorganic hybrid solar cell made of methylammonium lead halide perovskites. Perovskite PV cells have progressed rapidly {{over the past few years}} and have become one of the most attractive areas for PV research. The cell structure includes a metal back contact (which can be made of Al, Au or Ag), a hole transfer layer (spiro-MeOTAD, P3HT, PTAA, CuSCN, CuI, or NiO), and absorber layer (CH3NH3PbIxBr3-x, CH3NH3PbIxCl3-x or CH3NH3PbI3), an electron transport layer (TiO, ZnO, <b>Al2O3</b> or SnO2) and a top contact layer (fluorine doped tin oxide or tin doped indium oxide).|$|E

Each of these compounds are stable, but thallium oxide decomposes at temperatures higher than 875°C.|$|E
25|$|Rubies have a {{hardness}} of 9.0 on the Mohs {{scale of}} mineral hardness. Among the natural gems only moissanite and diamond are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling {{somewhere in between}} corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are α-alumina, the most stable form of <b>Al2O3,</b> in which 3 electrons leave each aluminum ion to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O2− ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminum ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.|$|E
25|$|At the hospital, the 99mTc {{that forms}} through 99Mo decay is {{chemically}} {{extracted from the}} technetium-99m generator. Most commercial 99Mo/99mTc generators use column chromatography, in which 99Mo {{in the form of}} water-soluble molybdate, MoO42− is adsorbed onto acid alumina (<b>Al2O3).</b> When the 99Mo decays, it forms pertechnetate TcO4−, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized 99MoO42− elutes the soluble 99mTcO4−, resulting in a saline solution containing the 99mTc as the dissolved sodium salt of the pertechnetate. One technetium-99m generator, holding only a few micrograms of 99Mo, can potentially diagnose 10,000 patients because it will be producing 99mTc strongly for over a week.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{borosilicate}} glass, Pyrex: silica + boron trioxide (B2O3) + soda (Na2O) + alumina (<b>Al2O3).</b> Stands {{heat expansion}} {{much better than}} window glass. Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car head lamps, etc. Borosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) have as main constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical soda-lime glass), making them more dimensionally stable. The lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.|$|E
25|$|Normally the anode foil {{is covered}} by the {{dielectric}} aluminum oxide (<b>Al2O3)</b> layer, which protects the base aluminum metal against the aggressiveness of aqueous alkali solutions. However, some impurities or weak points in the oxide layer offer the possibility for water-driven anodic corrosion that forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). In e-caps using an alkaline electrolyte this aluminum hydroxide will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The weak point remains and the anodic corrosion is ongoing. This corrosive process can be interrupted by protective substances in the electrolyte known as inhibitors or passivators. Inhibitors—such as chromates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, fluorides, benzoates, soluble oils, and certain other chemicals—can reduce the anodic and cathodic corrosion reactions. However, if inhibitors are used in an insufficient amount, they tend to increase pitting.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{valuable}} {{minerals and}} rocks {{are referred to}} as industrial minerals. For example, muscovite, a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator. Ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or cassiterite (SnO2), an ore of tin. Gems are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, ruby and sapphire are both corundum, <b>Al2O3.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{crystalline}} artificial diamond simulants were synthetic white sapphire (<b>Al2O3,</b> pure corundum) and spinel (MgO·Al2O3, pure magnesium aluminium oxide). Both {{have been}} synthesized {{in large quantities}} since {{the first decade of}} the 20th century via the Verneuil or flame-fusion process, although spinel was not in wide use until the 1920s. The Verneuil process involves an inverted oxyhydrogen blowpipe, with purified feed powder mixed with oxygen that is carefully fed through the blowpipe. The feed powder falls through the oxy-hydrogen flame, melts, and lands on a rotating and slowly descending pedestal below. The height of the pedestal is constantly adjusted to keep its top at the optimal position below the flame, and over a number of hours the molten powder cools and crystallizes to form a single pedunculated pear or boule crystal. The process is an economical one, with crystals of up to 9 centimeters (3.5nbsp&inches) in diameter grown. Boules grown via the modern Czochralski process may weigh several kilograms.|$|E
25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over <b>Al2O3.</b> Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, <b>Al2O3,</b> Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E
500|$|Borosilicate glass, {{which is}} {{typically}} 12–15% B2O3, 80% SiO2, and 2% <b>Al2O3,</b> {{has a low}} {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} giving it a good resistance to thermal shock. Schott AG's [...] "Duran" [...] and Owens-Corning's trademarked Pyrex are two major brand names for this glass, used both in laboratory glassware and in consumer cookware and bakeware, chiefly for this resistance.|$|E

2500|$|In 1837, Gaudin {{made the}} first {{synthetic}} rubies by fusing potash alum at a high temperature with a little chromium as a pigment. In 1847, Ebelmen made white sapphire by fusing alumina in boric acid. In 1877, Frenic and Freil made crystal corundum from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and Auguste Verneuil manufactured artificial ruby by fusing BaF2 and <b>Al2O3</b> with a little chromium at red heat. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this flame fusion process.

2500|$|Fused quartz is a glass {{made from}} chemically-pure silica. It has {{excellent}} resistance to thermal shock, {{being able to}} survive immersion in water while red hot.

One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, [...] "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (<b>Al2O3)</b> are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.|$|E
