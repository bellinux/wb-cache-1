40|$|Currently, adrenal {{corticosteroids}} (steroids) {{are used}} {{for a wide variety}} of clinical conditions. Steroids are known to cause many pathologic effects, including chemically induced diabetes, psychological changes, musculoskeletal (including avascular) necrosis, sup-pression of the adrenals, and significant effects on the eye. Considering the important risk factors involved with the use of these toxic, yet essential medications, pharmacists have a serious responsibil-ity to monitor their use for indications, dosage, interactions, and side effects. &copy; 1989 by W. B. Saunders Company. DESIRED EFFECT OF STEROIDAL AGENTS THE NATURALLY occurring adrenal corti-cal steroids (Table 1) have both antiinflam-matory (glucocorticoid) and salt-retaining (min-eralocorticoid) properties. Corticosteroids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addi-tion, they modify the body’s immune responses to diverse stimuli. These compounds, including hy-drocortisone (cortisol) and cortisone, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states and may be used for their antiinflamma-tory effects. The synthetic steroid compounds prednisone, prednisolone, and fludrocortisone also have both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity. Prednisone and prednisolone are used primarily for their glucocorticoid effect. 1 Corticosteroids are all useful for the allevia-tion of a wide variety of conditions, including the following (Table 2). Endocrine Disorders In primary or secondary adrenal cortical insuf-ficiency, hydrocortisone or cortisone is the drug of choice. Steroids may also be used in patients having congenital adrenal hyperplasia, nonsup-purative thyroiditis, and hypercalcemia associated with cancer. Steroidal drugs of choice are admin-istered parenterally in <b>acute</b> <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency,</b> preoperatively or in the event of serious trauma or illness with known <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> or when <b>adrenal</b> cortical reserve is doubtful, and in shock unresponsive to conven-tional therapy if <b>adrenal</b> cortical <b>insufficiency,</b> exists or is suspected...|$|R

40|$|Cardiac {{function}} was evaluated by ventricular function curves during the cardiovascular collapse observed in <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> A progressive decline in peak cardiac work {{was observed in}} the acutely adren-alectomized cat (303; decrease at 1. 8 hours and 50 % at 3. 5 hours after adren-alectomy).

Cortisol and d-aldosterone, and the volume-expander, dextran, prevented a significant fall in mean arterial blood pressure and in peak cardiac work.

40|$|Abstract Isolated ACTH {{deficiency}} (IAD) {{is a rare}} disorder, {{characterized by}} secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (AI) with low or absent cortisol production, normal secretion of pituitary hormones other than ACTH {{and the absence of}} structural pituitary defects. In adults, IAD may appear after a traumatic injury or a lymphocytic hypophysitis, the latter possibly due to autoimmune etiology. Conversely, a genetic origin may come into play in neonatal or childhood IAD. Patients with IAD usually fare relatively well during unstressed periods until intervening events spark off an <b>acute</b> <b>adrenal</b> crisis presenting with non specific symptoms, such as asthenia, anorexia, unintentional weight loss and tendency towards hypoglycemia. Blood chemistry may reveal mild hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and normal-high potassium levels, mild anemia, lymphocytosis and eosinophilia. Morn-ing serum cortisol below 3 µg/dl are virtually diagnostic for <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> whereas cortisol values comprised between 5 - 18 µg/dl require additional investigations: insulin tolerance test (ITT) is considered the gold standard but— when contraindicated—high or low dose-ACTH stimulation test with serum cortisol determination provides a viable alternative. Plasma ACTH concentration and prolonged ACTH infusion test are useful in differential diagnosis between primary and secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> For some patients with mild, near-to-asymptomatic disease, glucocorticoid replacement therapy may not be required except during stressful events; for symptomatic patients, replacement doses i. e., mean daily dose 20 mg (0. 30 mg/kg...|$|R
30|$|Pituitary {{production}} of corticotropin (ACTH) will be suppressed by exogenous steroids, {{which leads to}} atrophy of the adrenal cortex and <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Diagnosis is confirmed by low early morning serum cortisol levels and subnormal response to standard ACTH stimulation test. An early morning serum cortisol levels < 3 mcg/dL (80  nmol/L) strongly suggests <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> whereas levels > 15  mcg/dL (415  nmol/L) predicts a normal response of serum cortisol to ACTH stimulation test (Hagg et al. 1987; Le Roux et al. 2002). Patients with low or equivocal serum cortisol levels in whom <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is suspected should undergo standard or low dose synthetic ACTH (Cosyntropin) stimulation test. Suboptimal response to Cosyntropin stimulation test is diagnostic of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Simultaneous measurement of plasma ACTH helps in differentiation of primary from secondary or tertiary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> ACTH levels tend {{to be higher than}} normal in primary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> whereas low or low normal in patients with secondary and tertiary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test further differentiate secondary from tertiary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (Schulte et al. 1984).|$|R

50|$|This test {{is used to}} {{diagnose}} or exclude primary and secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> Addison's disease, and related conditions.

The Insulin tolerance test is recognized as the gold standard assay of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> but due to the cumbersome requirement for a two-hour test and the risks of seizures or myocardial infarction, the ACTH stimulation test is commonly used as an easier, safer, though not as accurate, alternative. The test is extremely sensitive (97% at 95% specificity) to primary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> but less so to secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (57-61% at 95% specificity); while secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> may thus be dismissed by some interpreters {{on the basis of}} the test, additional testing may be called for if probability of secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is particularly high.|$|R
