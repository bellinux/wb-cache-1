5|$|Browne's {{interest}} in Amazing declined when {{the project to}} turn it into <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> magazine was derailed. Although he stayed involved with Fantastic Adventures, another Ziff-Davis magazine, he left the editing work on Amazing to William Hamling and Lila Shaffer. In December 1950, when Ziff-Davis moved their offices from Chicago to New York, Hamling stayed behind in Chicago, and Browne revived his involvement with the magazine.|$|E

The shorts are available on the complete series DVD set.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{the most}} popular kind of country music was the Nashville Sound, which was <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> and pop-oriented style. Many musicians {{preferred}} a rougher sound, leading {{to the development of}} the Lubbock Sound and Bakersfield Sound. The Bakersfield Sound was innovated in Bakersfield, California in the mid to late 1950s, by performers like Wynn Stewart, who used elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, along with a honky tonk vocal style. He was followed by a wave of performers like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, who popularized the style.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a rotational molding process.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of John combined with an approaching cold front to produce moderate amounts of rainfall across the southwest United States, including a total of 8inches (200mm) in Whitharral and more than 3inches (75mm) in El Paso, Texas. The rainfall flooded many roads in southwestern Texas, including a Â½mile (800m) portion of Interstate 10 in El Paso. <b>A</b> <b>slick</b> runway at El Paso International Airport delayed a Continental Airlines jet when its tires were stuck in mud. Rainfall from John in El Paso, combined with an unusually wet year, resulted in twice the normal annual rainfall, and caused 2006 to be the ninth wettest year on record by September. Damage totaled about $100,000 (2006USD) in the El Paso area from the precipitation. In northern Texas, the rainfall alleviated a severe drought, caused the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River to swell and Lake Alan Henry to overflow. The Texas Department of Transportation closed numerous roads due to flooding from the precipitation, including a portion of U.S. Route 385 near Levelland. Several other roads were washed out.|$|E

5000|$|While {{covering}} {{a selection of}} recent books for children in The Canberra Times in 1962, a reviewer {{was not at all}} impressed with the book: [...] "Its plot and characters, similar to the previous two books by Miss Woodberry, follow the cheap [...] "formula" [...] pattern of the comic book, in which <b>a</b> group of <b>slick</b> youngsters, chattering <b>a</b> lot of <b>slick</b> slang, embark on <b>a</b> series of <b>slick</b> adventures. It offers only escape entertainment of the most mediocre kind." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of Friday 31 August 2012 <b>an</b> oil <b>slick</b> was spotted on the coast, fouling nearby beaches and oiling {{hundreds}} of seabirds. It is suspected that rough seas caused the wreck to shift resulting in <b>a</b> kilometer-long oil <b>slick</b> that washed up on the beach. The Koeberg nuclear power station was placed on alert due to {{the proximity of the}} spill to its intake basin.|$|R
25|$|Labour ran <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> campaign, which {{emphasised}} the splits {{within the}} Conservative government, {{and argued that}} the country needed a more centrist administration. Labour ran a centrist campaign that was good at picking up dissatisfied Tory voters, particularly moderate and suburban ones. Tony Blair, highly popular, was very much the centrepiece of the campaign, and proved a highly effective campaigner.|$|E

His first action was as the guest referee in the main event at Spring Stampede, which was won by Diamond Dallas Page (DDP).

The Brisbane Times said that Karen Matthews and Kate McCann represented two sides of the social class coin in Britain. The Daily Telegraph speculated that had Shannon been part of a middle-class family, in which articulate parents were conversant with the mechanics of mobilising <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> public awareness campaign, then more public attention would have been focused on the effort to find her.|$|E
25|$|Fig {{also played}} all the drums {{on the next}} album, Unmasked, {{although}} he was uncredited, and Criss appeared on the cover. Showcasing <b>a</b> <b>slick,</b> contemporary pop sound, Unmasked (released May 20, 1980) had the dubious {{distinction of being the}} first Kiss album since Dressed to Kill to not achieve platinum sales. Soon after the album's release, Criss' departure was officially announced. Fig was considered a member of KISS for one day following the departure of Criss; he was fired by Stanley and Simmons, who felt he was not a good fit for the band.|$|E
25|$|Color field, curiously {{enough or}} perhaps not, became a viable way of {{painting}} {{at exactly the}} time that acrylic paint, the new plastic paint, came into being. It {{was as if the}} new paint demanded a new possibility in painting, and the painters arrived at it. Oil paint, which has a medium that is quite different, which isn't water-based, always leaves <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> of oil, or puddle of oil, {{around the edge of the}} color. Acrylic paint stops at its own edge. Color field painting came in at the same time as the invention of this new paint.|$|E
50|$|Around 80 km off Table Bay, South Africa, it {{exploded}} {{and proceeded to}} burn.

25|$|A new {{sewage system}} {{was built on}} Don's orders in 1815, but this was so poorly {{designed}} that it actually worsened Gibraltar's sanitary problems. It had no ability to be flushed and was insufficiently inclined to keep the sewage flowing out to the bay. As a result, the system merely brought sewage down from {{the upper part of}} the town to the lower part, where it piled up under the main streets. The sewage remained there until the winter rains dislodged it and flushed it into the bay. Because the outfalls were so short, however, the sewage simply washed back up onto the shoreline and resulted in the seafront being coated in <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> of effluent.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the first}} season roles were {{a result of the}} {{executive}} producers' liking of various actors. The main character Jack was originally going to die in the pilot, and the role was planned for Michael Keaton. However, ABC executives were adamant that Jack live. Before it was decided that Jack would live, Kate was to emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors; she was originally conceived as a middle-aged businesswoman whose husband had apparently died in the crash, a role later fulfilled by the recurring character Rose. Dominic Monaghan auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> suit-wearing city con man. The producers enjoyed Monaghan's performance and changed the character of Charlie, originally an over-the-hill former rock star, to fit him. Jorge Garcia also auditioned for Sawyer, and the part of Hurley was written for him. When Josh Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked the edge he brought to the character (he reportedly kicked a chair when he forgot his lines and got angry in the audition) and his southern accent, so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway's acting. Yunjin Kim auditioned for Kate, but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin, portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim, to be her husband. Sayid, played by Naveen Andrews, was also not in the original script. Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind. Emilie de Ravin, who played Claire, was originally cast in what was supposed to be a recurring role. In the second season, Michael Emerson was contracted to play Ben ("Henry Gale") for three episodes. His role was extended to eight episodes because of his acting skills and eventually, for the whole of season three and later seasons.|$|E

50|$|It {{is likely}} that <b>an</b> oil <b>slick</b> dropped by Mieres' Porsche caused a tragic {{accident}} at the 1958 Cuban Grand Prix, in which at least four {{people were killed and}} fifty more injured.

50|$|Underway {{from the}} harbor before 0900, for {{offshore}} patrol, Ramsay made sound {{contact with a}} submarine at 1120. She released 10 depth charges, and then watched <b>an</b> oil <b>slick</b> spread over the attack area. She had damaged, and possibly had sunk one of the midget submarines used by the Japanese in the attack. Eight days later, while escorting a merchant ship off Kauai, she made her second contact. During two runs over the enemy, she dropped her depth charges and again was rewarded {{by the appearance of}} <b>an</b> oil <b>slick</b> on the surface indicating damage to her quarry.|$|R
500|$|A 1980s-inspired midtempo synthpop ballad, [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] {{features}} a light keyboard during its intro through its break, a guitar, synthetic strings and <b>a</b> <b>slick</b> sheen.

The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who noted it as an improvement over her last singles, while praising its tempo and highlighting her vocals.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Hit" [...] is an up-tempo {{dance and}} R song, with {{a length of}} four minutes and four seconds (4:04).

500|$|As a {{political}} leader, White received strong {{support in the}} Native Hawaiian community. During his terms in the legislature, he became known by the nickname of [...] "Pila Aila" [...] or [...] "Bila Aila" [...] (Oily Bill) {{for his ability to}} speak to and humorously charm large crowds. He embraced this moniker although his opponents used it negatively to denigrate him as <b>a</b> <b>slick,</b> smooth-talking demagogue who negatively influenced his constituents. In the Hawaiian tradition, his skills as an orator were attributed to the kuleana (responsibility) of his family as descendants of Kaiakea.|$|E
50|$|T-Bones {{made his}} first major TV {{appearance}} as an executioner, hospital orderly and barber during the 1995-1996 season of Saturday Night Live, when Koechner was a cast member on the long-running comedy program. He made numerous appearances there and served as {{the focal point of}} the sketches, making sly jokes and showcasing his redneck mentality as he annoyed others around him. T-Bones became recognizable by his signature appearance of <b>a</b> <b>slicked</b> comb over, long mutton chop sideburns, tight brown T-shirt, and underbite. In the midst of making clever comments, T-Bones often reveals his utter foolishness and speaks with a hint of southern accent.|$|R
