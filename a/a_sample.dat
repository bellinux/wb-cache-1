The first and second signal sections have a similar section that is sampled. The sampled signals resulting from sampling {{of the first and}} second signal sections have a difference and the sampling error is detected based on the sampled first and second signal sections. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is made for a method {{for detecting}} <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> error in <b>a</b> <b>sampled</b> received signal. USE - Detection and correction of <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> error in <b>a</b> signal received by a receiver that requires precise block or sampling synchronization, e. g. in ODFM signals (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing).

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, pure,single {{phase and}} high {{crystalline}} zeolite 4 <b>A</b> <b>samples</b> were synthesized by hydrothermal treating by-products of polysilicon production process. The influence of crystallization {{time and the}} molar ratio of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 on degree of crystallinity of synthesized zeolite 4 <b>A</b> <b>samples</b> was studied. The degree of crystallinity, skeleton structure and particles morphology of zeolite 4 <b>A</b> <b>samples</b> were characterized by XRD,FT-IR,SEM,respectively.

50|$|Autosamplers {{normally}} {{consist of}} a robotic device that can either bring the <b>sample</b> to <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> station, or bring <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> device to the sample that stays on a tray (or carousel) along with other samples.|$|R
5|$|To {{determine}} {{the age of}} <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to {{the activity of the}} standard must be found. To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for. The most common standard sample material is oxalic acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000lb of which was prepared by NIST in 1977 from French beet harvests.|$|E
5|$|A more area-selective {{method is}} {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy, which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a {{transmission electron microscope}} when it interacts with a portion of <b>a</b> <b>sample.</b> The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.|$|E
