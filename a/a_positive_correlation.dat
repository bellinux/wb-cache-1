5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E
5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> between the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure {{can not be the}} cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{research}} the correlation factor of the anterior segment values of eyes with different axial lengths. METHODS: In this study, 697 cases 697 eyes were included. According to axial length we divided {{all the cases}} into short axial length group, normal axial length group, mild long axial length group, moderate long axial length group and severe long axial length group. The relevant indicators of the anterior segment values of patients in the five groups was comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: In the short axial length group, the anterior chamber volume(ACV) showed a significantly negative correlation with age; anterior chamber depth(ACD) showed a significantly negative correlation with age. In the normal axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative correlation with age and <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with axial length(AXL); the anterior chamber angle(ACA) showed a significantly negative correlation with age and <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with AXL, and <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with corneal curvature; the ACD showed a significantly negative correlation with age and <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with AXL. In the mild long axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative correlation with age and <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with AXL, and a significantly negative correlation with corneal curvature; the ACA showed a significantly negative correlation with age and <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with AXL, and <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with corneal curvature; the ACD showed a significantly negative correlation with age and <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with AXL. In the moderate long axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative correlation with age; the ACA showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with AXL; the ACD showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> with AXL.

The static domain of the research is composed of the staff of the mentioned university. In gathering the data the field method has been used and the measuring tools of emotional intelligence (EI), Questionary of Siber and vertical self-efficacy Questionary of Sherer and colleagues have been used. The data have been analyzed with the help of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Pearson Correlation, co efficacy of Espirmen Watson test and linear analysis of Verrison.
