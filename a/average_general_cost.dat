40|$|In this paper, a novel {{technique}} for finding a point-by-point (deterministic) attitude solution {{of a vehicle}} using Global Positioning System phase difference measurements is presented. This technique transforms a <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> function into a more numerically efficient form by determining three-dimensional vectors in either the body or reference coordinate system. Covariance relationships for the new algorithm, as well as methods which minimize the <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> function, are also derived. The equivalence of the <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> function and transformed cost function is shown for the case of orthogonal baselines or sightlines. Simulation results are shown which demonstrate {{the usefulness of the}} new algorithm and covariance expressions. Introduction The utilization of phase difference measurements from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers provides a novel approach for three-axis attitude determination and/or estimation. These measurements have been successfully used to determine the att [...] ...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{coverage}} by {{the press and the}} accounting profession about how nonprofits report their management and <b>general</b> <b>costs.</b> There has also been growing attention by some donors, perhaps made most famously by claims by some donors that nothing should go to administration. While this area of nonprofit management has caught the attention of the public, it has largely escaped the research lens of scholars. This paper is a first step to understanding and explaining what management and <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> look like in the nonprofit sector and whether or not various institutional characteristics such as mission, size, age, sources of revenues, and/or accounting practices can help explain some of the variation in management and general expenses. We find that these institutional characteristics do matter quite a bit in explaining differences in management and <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> in nonprofits...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{consumer}} search with learning in which cost shocks have different short- and long-range effects on prices. In the short run, consumers confuse <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> shocks, common to all firms in the industry, with firm-specific shocks. In {{the case of a}} <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> increase, this promotes an excessive propen-sity to search, restraining the amount by which prices increase in the short run. Conversely, {{in the case of an}} idiosyncratic cost increase, consumers search too little, causing the prices of high-cost firms to overshoot...|$|R

40|$|Operator cost {{partitioning}} is {{a well-known}} technique to make admissible heuristics additive by distributing the operator costs among individual heuristics. Planning tasks are usually defined with non-negative operator costs and therefore it appears natural to demand {{the same for the}} distributed costs. We argue that this requirement is not necessary and demonstrate the benefit of using <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> partitioning. We show that LP heuristics for operator-counting constraints are cost-partitioned heuristics and that the state equation heuristic computes a cost partitioning over atomic projections. We also introduce a new family of potential heuristics and show their relationship to <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> partitioning...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} maximum {{achievable}} differential entropy at {{the output of}} a system assigning to each input X the sum X+N, with N a given noise with probability law absolutely continuous {{with respect to the}} Lebesgue measure and where the input and the noise are allowed to be dependent. We consider fairly <b>general</b> <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> constraints in the input, as well as amplitude constraints. It is shown that the corresponding search for the optimum may be performed over joint distributions for the input and the noise concentrated in lower dimensional geometrical objects represented by graphs of sufficiently regular functions in the associated noise-input plane. The results are then applied to correspondingly characterize the independent input and noise case, so providing bounds for channel capacity. Analysis of achievable bounds and associated capacity-achieving input distributions is also provided. General conditions for the existence of a maximum achievable entropy at the output are provided for such a system, {{as well as for the}} independent input and noise case, so establishing conditions for capacity to be achievable. The laws of such capacity-achieving input distributions are also uniquely specified. A general approximation to capacity scheme is also provided, showing that in the not achievable case the corresponding noise can be written as the limit of a sequence of noise random variables with associated channels being capacity achievable, and whose capacities converge to the capacity of the original channel. The relationship between our results for this input and noise dependent setting and the notion of feedback capacity are also explored...|$|R

Our objective was to examine the impact of newly opened physician-owned specialty orthopaedic hospitals on individual competing general hospitals. We used Medicare Part A administrative data to identify all physician-owned specialty orthopaedic hospitals performing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between 1991 and 2005. We identified newly opened specialty hospitals in three representative markets (Durham, NC, Kansas City, and Oklahoma City) and assessed their impact on surgical volume and patient case complexity for the five competing general hospitals located closest to each specialty hospital. The <b>average</b> <b>general</b> hospital maintained THA and TKA volume following the opening of the specialty hospitals. The <b>average</b> <b>general</b> hospital also did not experience an increase in patient case complexity. Thus, based on these three markets, we found no clear evidence that entry of physician-owned specialty orthopaedic hospitals resulted in declines in THA or TKA volume or increases in patient case complexity for the <b>average</b> competing <b>general</b> hospital...|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{literature on}} the cost structure of multiproduct firms (e. g., public utilities providing in combination gas, water, and electricity) traditionally assumes a common technology across different products and stages of production, letting the issue of poolability unexplored. The appropriateness of this assumption is tested here by estimating a <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> function for samples of UK specialized and sewerage-diversified water utilities. The results show the existence of both aggregate scale economies and diseconomies of scope; more interestingly, {{the hypothesis that the}} two groups of water companies share the same technological parameters is rejected. Given the implications of this finding in terms of optimal industry configuration and possible restructuring policies (e. g., mergers and/or divestitures), our test suggests caution in pooling samples when undertaking empirical studies on data which refer to multiproduct technologies.
