5|$|Chavrusa-style {{learning}} is particularly suited to Talmud study, {{as the latter}} is a text filled with conflicting opinions and seemingly contradictory statements on principles of Jewish law. Besides tracking the back-and-forth debates, a student of Talmud must be able to analyze each opinion and present hypotheses to reconcile it in light of the others. The chavrusa relationship gives each student a platform to clarify <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> his position to a partner; then the two go on to question, defend, convince, amend, fine-tune, and even arrive at new conclusions through rigorous intellectual collaboration.|$|E

Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> the actions of the monks.

The invitation was viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui perbedaan kemampuan pemahaman konsep IPA siswa yang menggunakan pembelajaran dengan Model Student Facilitator <b>and</b> <b>Explaining</b> (SFAE) dan menggunakan pembelajaran konvensional. Penelitian ini dilaksanakan di SDN Serdang I dengan menggunakan metode kuasi eksperimen. Hasil dari penelitian inidiperolehrata-rata pretes kelas eksperimen 61, 02 meningkat menjadi 76, 28 pada nilai postes, sedangkan rata-rata pretes kelas kontrol 57, 01 meningkat menjadi 64, 07 pada nilai postes. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan siswa pada kelas eksperimen yang menggunakan  Model Student Facilitator <b>and</b> <b>Explaining</b> (SFAE) memperoleh hasil yang lebih baik dari siswa pada kelas kontrol yang hanya menggunakan metode konvensional. Dengan demikian, terdapat pengaruh Model Student Facilitator <b>and</b> <b>Explaining</b> (SFAE) terhadap kemampuan pemahaman konsep IPA siswa.   Kata Kunci : model student {{facilitator}} <b>and</b> <b>explaining</b> (sfae), pemahaman konsep       Abstact. This eksperimen aims {{to determine}} {{the differences in the}} ability of understanding the concept of science students who use the Model Student Facilitator <b>and</b> <b>Explaining</b> (SFAE) <b>and</b> using conventional learning. This eksperimen was conducted in Serdang I SDN by using a quasi-experimental methods. Results from this eksperimen were obtained an average of 61. 02 experimental class pretest increased to 76. 28 in posttest value, while the average class pretest control 57. 01 increased to 64. 07 in posttest value. Based on the results of this eksperimen concluded that students in the experimental class using the Model Student Facilitator <b>and</b> <b>Explaining</b> (SFAE) obtain better results than students in the control class using only conventional methods. Thus, there is the influence of Model Student Facilitator <b>and</b> <b>Explaining</b> (SFAE) on the ability of students' understanding of science concepts.   Keywords : a model student facilitator <b>and</b> <b>explaining</b> (SFAE),  understanding concepts </p...|$|R

5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E

Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> his role during the war.

5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E
