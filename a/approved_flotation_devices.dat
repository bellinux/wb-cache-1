50|$|Because of the hazards, dam {{opponents have}} called {{for the removal of}} roller dams. Sixteen people have died by {{drowning}} at the roller dam on the Fox River near Yorkville, Illinois since its construction in 1960. Most recently in a single accident on May 28, 2006, three persons died. Similar dams have already been removed on the Fox River at Aurora, Illinois and near Batavia, Illinois, but Yorkville residents successfully petitioned to maintain the roller dam near their town because of tradition. In July 2009, a man died at a roller dam on the Cedar River in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{describe}} the types and circumstances of traumatic work related fatalities in Australian commercial fishermen. METHODS [...] Work related traumatic fishing fatalities were studied {{as part of}} a larger study of all work related traumatic fatalities in Australia from 1982 to 1984. Data on 47 cases were obtained from inspection of coroners' files. RESULTS [...] The incidence of fatality of 143 / 100, 000 person-years was 18 times higher than the incidence of fatality for the entire workforce, and considerably higher than that of the mining and agricultural workforces. 68 % of decedents drowned and 13 % died from physical trauma. Rough weather, non-seaworthy vessels, inadequate use of personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices,</b> and inexperience were associated with many of the fatal incidents. DISCUSSION [...] Improved vessel and equipment maintenance, better training of workers, greater use of personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices,</b> and development of improved clothing and personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> are recommended...|$|R
40|$|DE 10134406 C UPAB: 20030214 NOVELTY - Process for {{monitoring}} the flotation of particles dispersed in a liquid in a <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> (1) comprises detecting the gas bubbles introduced into a flotation tank (3) using ultrasound sensors (29, 31); and producing starting {{signals from the}} sensors. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device {{for monitoring}} the flotation of particles dispersed in a liquid in a <b>flotation</b> <b>device.</b> Preferred Features: Spreading of the gas bubbles in the tank {{is determined by the}} sensors monitoring the content of the tank. Gas bubble formation and spread is regulated depending on the starting signals of the ultrasound sensors. The presence of the gas bubbles is detected in the whole flotation tank. USE - Used for monitoring the flotation of particles dispersed in a liquid in a <b>flotation</b> <b>device.</b> ADVANTAGE - The process is automated...|$|R
