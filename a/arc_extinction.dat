40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} {{is to improve the}} {{understanding}} of the heating of copper cathodes under the action of a nonstationary electric arc in air. An experimental method is proposed for the measurement of the surface temperature distribution just after a very fast arc-controlled <b>arc</b> <b>extinction.</b> The arc current intensity is about 60 - 70 A, and the arc duration is in the range of 2. 5 - 5 ms. Different kinds of surface temperature distributions have been observed depending on the arc root behavior. The measurement of the temperature decrease after the <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> was used to estimate the cathode surface temperature just at the moment of <b>arc</b> <b>extinction.</b> Two-dimensional thermal modeling taking into account phase changes is used to estimate the power balance at the cathode surface and to propose a second estimation of the surface temperature at the point of <b>arc</b> <b>extinction.</b> The comparisons between experimental results and thermal modeling lead in the present experimental conditions to a volt equivalent at the cathode in the range 6. 7 - 10. 7 V, to a surface power density in the range 0. 6 × 109 - 2. 5 × 109 W/m 2 and to a maximum surface temperature in the range 850 °C- 1300 °C...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{distribution}} network reliability {{can be increased}} if distributed generators (DGs) are allowed to operate in both grid-connected and islanded operations when the network has a high DG penetration level. However, the current utility regulations do not allow for the islanded operation. The arc faults are {{the one of the}} major issues preventing the islanded operation, since the arc will not extinguish if the DGs are not disconnected. In this paper, the effect of a converter interfaced DG on an arc fault is investigated by considering different control strategies for the converter. The foldback current control characteristic is proposed to a converter interfaced DG to achieve quick <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> and self-restoration without disconnecting the DG {{in the event of an}} arc fault. The results are validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulations. Index Terms — arc fault, <b>arc</b> <b>extinction,</b> current limiting, foldback current I...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work is mainly concerned {{about dealing with}} temporary short circuit faults in power system transmission lines. In fact, {{there are two types}} of electrical faults in power systems, namely temporary and permanent. When a fault is permanent, the only way to clear it is to de-energize the transmission line by opening the associated circuit breakers. However, in many cases the fault is not solid and is caused by objects such as flying birds or broken branches of trees. For these cases, electrical arc plays a major role. For such fault cases, it is also possible to de-energize the faulted phase, temporarily, and re-energize it after a short delay by reclosing the opened circuit breakers. This operation is called single-phase reclosing. There is a chance that the fault becomes clear by natural extinction of the arc after the faulted phase isolation in case the fault is temporary. There are two considerable challenges regarding traditional single-phase reclosing in transmission lines. The first challenge is the determination of the fault type, i. e., permanent or temporary, as there is no guarantee that the fault is temporary. This is crucially important as reclosing-on-fault, i. e., reclosing the opened breakers while the fault still stands, is harmful for both power system stability and power system equipment. The second challenge which is regarding temporary faults only, is that there is still no guarantee that the arc is extinguished by the moment of reclosing. In such cases, reclosing leads in re-striking of arc and therefore, an unsuccessful reclosing. This {{research work}} is conducted in two phases. At the first phase, two adaptive methods are developed to improve the traditional reclosing method upon the two challenges mentioned in the second paragraph. The developed methods are capable of recognition of the fault type in a reasonable amount of time after single-phase isolation of the line. Therefore, the protection system will be able to block the reclosing function in case the fault is recognized as permanent and to issue three-phase-trip signal as the next action. For temporary faults, re-energizing of the isolated phase by reclosing the opened breakers is the next action which has to be performed after the <b>arc</b> <b>extinction.</b> The developed methods also have the capability of detection of the <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> and therefore, a better performance for temporary fault cases is guaranteed. This is the second feature required for an adaptive reclosing method. The second phase of the research project is to estimate the <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> time well in advance in case the fault is temporary. The idea is that three-phase tripping could be the right action if the <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> time is too long as working under unbalanced conditions for an unnecessarily long time duration is harmful for the power system. Both of the proposed adaptive single-phase reclosing methods in this research work employ local voltage information. Therefore, communication facilities are not needed for implementation of the proposed methods. It is shown in the thesis that the proposed methods are able to quickly detect the fault type and also the <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> if the fault is temporary. Also, the two proposed <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> time prediction methods are capable of prediction of the <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> time well in advance and with acceptable precision. All four proposed methods are effective for various system configurations including ideally-transposed, untransposed and partially-transposed transmission lines and also for transmission lines with different compensation conditions including with and without shunt reactor. Superior performance of the proposed methods have been verified using 550 case studies simulated in PSCAD and Matlab, and also a field recorded temporary fault case associated with a 765 kV transmission line. The 550 simulated case studies include 100 ideally-transposed, 240 untransposed and 210 partially-transposed line cases. The performances of the two proposed reclosing methods are also compared with two of the existing adaptive reclosing methods where considerable improvements are observed...|$|E

External magnetic fields were dynamically applied to GTAW arcs in constant current mode to verify their resistance to extinction as a function of current level and direction of deflection. High-speed filming was carried out as an additional tool to understand the extinction mechanism.

The performance of the silver cadmium oxide contacts (Ag. CdO, 85 / 15 %) is evaluated over a range of currents from 1 to 10 amps, for make and break operations. The arc at break {{is found to be}} the predominant factor contributing to the erosion of the contacts for the range of currents used. Tests using a high speed camera show that the energy dissipated in the arc between the contacts can be evaluated from equations describing the arc in terms of its voltage, current and length as functions of time. Subsequently work is carried out to develop the relation between arc energy and contact erosion, with specific regard to the distribution of energy between the two contact surfaces and the arc column. This is related to the power dissipation in the two electrode fall regions, and the resulting direction of net material transfer is thought to be influenced by the length achieved by the <b>arc</b> before <b>extinction.</b> Erosion is generally in the form of anodic loss and cathodic gain and the reasons for the directional bias in this type of switch are suggested.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a plasma discharge which is generated between two diverging electrodes and extended into a gliding arc in non-equilibrium condition by an air flow at atmospheric pressure. Effects {{of the air}} flow rates on the dynamics, ground-state OH distributions and spectral characterization of UV emission of the gliding arc were investigated by optical methods. High-speed photography was utilized to reveal flow-rate dependent dynamics such as ignitions, propagation, short-cutting events, extinctions and conversions of the discharge from glowtype to spark-type. Short-cutting events and ignitions occur more frequently at higher flow rates. The anchor points of the gliding arc are mostly steady {{at the top of}} the electrodes at lower flow rates whereas at higher flow rates they glide up along the electrodes most of the time. The afterglow of fully developed gliding arcs is observed to decay over hundreds of microseconds after being electronically short-cut by a newly ignited <b>arc.</b> The <b>extinction</b> time decreases with the increase of the flow rate. The frequency of the conversion of a discharge from glow-type to spark-type increases with the flow rate. Additionally, spatial distributions of ground-state OH were investigated using planar laser-induced fluorescence. The results show that the shape, height, intensity and thickness of ground-state OH distribution vary significantly with air flow rates. Finally, UV emission of the gliding arc is measured using optical emission spectroscopy and it is found that the emission intensity of NO γ (A-X), OH (A-X) and N 2 (C-B) increase with the flow rates showing more characteristics of spark-type arcs. The observed phenomena indicate the significance of the interaction between local turbulence and the gliding arc.

An assessment of the current interruption capability {{has been made in}} terms of the arcing duration and the contact gap length at which critical <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> is achieved. These observations are supported by measurements of the magnitude of extinction and re-ignition voltage peaks. Most previous and other current experimental work on gas filled circuit breaker design follows conventional wisdom in investigating arcing behaviours at elevated gas pressures (usually up to 6 bar). But in this work we concentrate on the effects of using low gas pressures (less than 1 bar) {{in the presence of a}} close-fitting shield of ablatant polymer material (PTFE) that surrounds the electrode assembly of an experimental high power circuit breaker. We demonstrate that for several different gases, <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> capability compares well under these conditions with SF 6, suggesting that SF 6 could be replaced entirely in this novel system by more environmentally friendly gases. Moreover, the critical contact gap lengths at extinction are only slightly greater than when using SF 6 at 6 bar.

40|$|The arc {{behavior}} in the current zero region is critical {{in the case of}} very steep rising TRV, such as after clearing a short-line fault. Therefore, intensive and abundant short-line fault tests (L 90) of a 245 kV SF 6 circuit breaker were performed at the KEMA High Power Laboratory. For the purpose of a comparative analysis three different sets of data were obtained during the tests: 1) High-resolution measurements of near current-zero arc current and voltage were carried out. The current zero measurement system (CZM) works as a standalone system in addition to the standard laboratory data acquisition system. The arc conductance shortly before current zero and the <b>arc</b> voltage <b>extinction</b> peak give a clear indication of the interrupting capability of the breaker under test. 2) From the measured traces of every individual test, arc parameters (3 time constants and 3 cooling-power constants) were extracted for the composite black box arc model, which has been developed by KEMA High Power Laboratory and is based on more than 1000 high-resolution measurements during tests of commercial high-voltage circuit breakers. Its aim is to simulate interruption phenomenon in SF 6 gas, evaluate performance of HV SF 6 circuit breakers in testing and enable the prediction of the performance under conditions other than those tested. 3) After each test, using specially developed computer software, based on a simplified physical enthalpy flow arc model, the values of the arcing contact distance, gas mass flow through the nozzle throat and pressure inside the compression cylinder were calculated. The values of these characteristic quantities at the current zero are relevant indicators for successful interruption. In the comparative analysis, mathematical relations and statistical correlations between the evaluated parameters of the composite black box arc model and the characteristic output quantities are established and discussed.

The experimental techniques employed utilised commercially available video cameras to capture images of element disruptions during disintegration of fuse elements subjected to low short-circuit and high overload currents. Specialist experimental image capturing techniques and hardware implementations were developed to enable investigation of element disintegration caused by high short-circuit fault currents. Disintegration phenomena of fuse elements for all fault cases were compared within different time domains, which included specialist techniques to investigate disintegration of elements in sand and against glass substrates.

The Stefan-Boltzman equation is coupled with the heat equation, and both equations are solved simultaneously in order to follow the evolution of the arc voltage and the conductance of the thermal plasma. The obtained results are found in good agreement with experimental recordings...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the evolution of}} electrical contact erosion in low voltage 42 V DC (24 A) applications. The aim is to describe the erosion mechanisms of a single arc discharge at both contact surfaces during operation. To this end the experiments conducted are designed to produce results that enable close examination of the surface profile changes, volumetric contact material movements, and relative quantities of metallic and gaseous species in the arc discharge. The experimental procedure is arranged so that the contacts undergo a low number of operation cycles in order to limit the cumulative effects of arc erosion. To obtain results portraying the evolution of arc erosion in a 42 V system the apparatus allows for interruption of the arc at any desired voltage level. A series of tests are conducted at specified voltage steps from <b>arc</b> initiation to <b>extinction.</b> The samples collected are analysed using a non-contact laser profile apparatus giving 2 D and 3 D surface scans. During each arc discharge a record of spectral emissions is collected by a spectrometer and later analysed to show the constituents of the arc. The data is represented with reference to voltage level and shows how the erosion evolution from a low number of operation cycles is related to arc phenomena. In addition the voltage profiles of the arc are recorded and represented by amplitude modulation. It {{has been found that}} the erosion site dimensions are related to the arc voltage fluctuations. In these tests a marked change of voltage slope is seen but is not found {{to be related to the}} metallic to gaseous phase transition as often thought. It is determined that the anodic to cathodic arc transition is not due to a metallic to gaseous phase transition. Changes in surface profile at the cathode occurring during the cathodic arc phase, and before gaseous phase initiation, are affected by density per unit area of ions impacting the surface. The vaporization of the cathode requires a critical ion density. This determines the anodic to cathodic transition point. Conversely the anode is thought to endure intense electron sputtering throughout the arc lifetime and its volumetric loss is greater than that of the cathode.

40|$|Circuit {{breakers}} are {{an important}} safety feature in most electrical circuits, and they act to prevent excessive currents caused by short circuits, for example. Low-voltage current limiting circuit breakers are activated by a trip solenoid when a critical current is exceeded. The solenoid moves two contacts apart to break the circuit. However, {{as soon as the}} contacts are separated an electric arc forms between them, ionising the air in the gap, increasing the electrical conductivity of air to that of the hot plasma that forms, and current continues to flow. The currents involved may be as large as 80, 000 amperes. Critical {{to the success of the}} circuit breaker is that it is designed to cause the arc to move away from the contacts, into a widening wedge-shaped region. This lengthens the arc, and then moves it onto a series of separator plates called an arc divider or splitter. The arc divider raises the voltage required to sustain the arcs across it, above the voltage that is provided across the breaker, so that the circuit is broken and the arcing dies away. This entire process occurs in milliseconds, and is usually associated with a sound like an explosion and a bright ash from the arc. Parts of the contacts and the arc divider may melt and/or vapourise. The question to be addressed by the Study Group was to mathematically model the <b>arc</b> motion and <b>extinction,</b> with the overall aim of an improved understanding that would help the design of a better circuit breaker. Further discussion indicated that two key mechanisms are believed to contribute to the movement of the arc away from the contacts, one being self-magnetism (where the magnetic field associated with the arc and surrounding circuitry acts to push it towards the arc divider), and the other being air flow (where expansion of air combined with the design of the chamber enclosing the arc causes gas flow towards the arc divider). Further discussion also indicated that a key aspect of circuit breaker design was that it is desirable to have as fast a quenching of the arc as possible, that is, the faster the circuit breaker can act to stop current flow, the better. The relative importance of magnetic and air pressure effects on quenching speed is of central interest to circuit design...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} network reliability {{can be increased}} if distributed generators (DGs) are allowed to operate in both grid-connected and islanded operations when the network has a high DG penetration level. However, the current utility regulations do not allow for the islanded operation. The arc faults are {{the one of the}} major issues preventing the islanded operation, since the arc will not extinguish if the DGs are not disconnected. In this paper, the effect of a converter interfaced DG on an arc fault is investigated by considering different control strategies for the converter. The foldback current control characteristic is proposed to a converter interfaced DG to achieve quick <b>arc</b> <b>extinction</b> and self-restoration without disconnecting the DG {{in the event of an}} arc fault. The results are validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulations. ...|$|E
