It is a fixed frequency controller that can operate in continuous or discontinuous conduction modes. The NCP 1651 provides a low cost, low component count solution for isolated AC-DC converters with mid-high output voltage requirements. The NCP 1651 eases the task of meeting the IEC 1000 - 3 - 2 harmonic requirements for converters in the range of 50 W- 250 W.

40|$|The {{electrical}} energy {{available in the}} utility grid is not suitable for direct use in many applications. In particular, applications requiring DC source must involve an interface device between the AC power line and the load requiring the DC voltage. Conventional AC/DC conversion involves diode rectifiers with large capacitor to reduce DC voltage ripple. The filter capacitor reduces the ripple present in the output voltage but draws non-sinusoidal line current which reduces the power factor. So power factor correction (PFC) techniques are gaining increasing attention. The most popular topology for active PFC is boost converter as it draws continuous <b>input</b> <b>current.</b> This <b>input</b> <b>current</b> can be manipulated by <b>average</b> <b>current</b> mode control technique.

40|$|A hybrid {{lamp power}} control scheme for {{dimmable}} electronic ballast is proposed. Apart from adjusting {{the brightness of}} the lamp, the proposed method can also minimize the ambient temperature effect on affecting the light output. Instead of regulating the lamp current, the proposed method is based on regulating the power supplying to the lamp. First dimming operation is achieved by regulating the dc voltage at the ballast inverter input. Second variation of the lamp power (due to the temperature effect) is regulated by sensing the inverter <b>average</b> <b>input</b> <b>current</b> to adjust the switching frequency of the inverter.

40|$|A {{document}} {{discusses the}} changes {{made to a}} standard push-pull inverter circuit to avoid saturation effects in the main inverter power supply. Typically, in a standard push-pull arrangement, the unsymmetrical primary excitation causes variations in the volt second integral of each half of the excitation cycle {{that could lead to}} the establishment of DC flux density in the magnetic core, which could eventually cause saturation of the main inverter transformer. The relocation of the filter reactor normally placed across the output of the power supply solves this problem. The filter reactor was placed in series with the primary circuit of the main inverter transformer, and is presented as impedance against the sudden changes on the <b>input</b> <b>current.</b> The reactor <b>averaged</b> the <b>input</b> <b>current</b> in the primary circuit, avoiding saturation of the main inverter transformer.

40|$|A two-stage, {{two-wire}} TRIAC dimmable {{electronic ballast}} for fluorescent lamps {{is presented in}} this paper. It is constructed by using a flyback converter as the input power factor corrector to supply a half-bridge series-resonant parallel-loaded inverter to ballast the lamp. The flyback converter is operated in discontinuous conduction mode so that the filtered <b>input</b> <b>current</b> profile is same as the TRIAC-controlled voltage waveform. The switches in the inverter are switched at a constant frequency slightly higher than the resonant frequency of the resonant tank. Based on the constant <b>average</b> <b>input</b> <b>current</b> characteristics of the inverter, dimming operation is simply achieved by pulse-width-modulation control {{of the magnitude of}} the flyback converter output voltage. No synchronization network is required between the input and output stages. In addition, a novel power equalization scheme is developed so that the dc link voltage (and hence the lamp power) is in linear relationships with the firing angle of the TRIAC. The average output voltage of the dimmer controls the equalized flyback converter output voltage. Modeling, analysis, and design of the ballast will be described. A prototype has been implemented to verify the experimental measurements with the theoretical predictions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new three-phase dc-ac inverter {{based on the}} basic Cuk converter. The main feature of the proposed topology {{is the fact that}} the energy storage elements as inductors and capacitors values can be reduced in order to improve the reliability, reduce the size, and the total cost. Moreover, the bucking-boosting inherent nature of the Cuk converter, depending on the time-varying duty ratios, provides more flexibility for stand-alone and grid connected applications when the required output AC voltage is lower or greater than the DC side voltage. This property is not found in the conventional current source inverter (CSI) when the DC <b>input</b> <b>current</b> is always greater than the ac output one or in the conventional voltage source inverter (VSI) as the output ac voltage is always lower than the dc input one. Averaged large and small signal models are used to study the Cuk nonlinear operation. Basic structure, control design, and MATLAB/SIMULINK results are presented in this paper. The new three-phase DC-AC inverter is very convenient for PV applications where continuous <b>average</b> <b>input</b> <b>currents</b> are required for appropriate Maximum power Point Tracking (MPPT) operations...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the inverse problem of recovering an isotropic electrical conductivity from interior {{knowledge of the}} magnitude of one current density field generated by applying current on a set of electrodes. The required interior data can be obtained by means of MRI measurements. On the boundary we only require knowledge of the electrodes, their impedances, and the corresponding <b>average</b> <b>input</b> <b>currents.</b> From the mathematical point of view, this practical question leads us to consider a new weighted minimum gradient problem for functions satisfying the boundary conditions coming from the Complete Electrode Model of Somersalo, Cheney and Isaacson. This variational problem has non-unique solutions. The surprising discovery is that the physical data is still sufficient to determine the geometry of the level sets of the minimizers. In particular, we obtain an interesting phase retrieval result: knowledge of the <b>input</b> <b>current</b> at the boundary allows determination of the full current vector field from its magnitude. We characterize the non-uniqueness in the variational problem. We also show that additional measurements of the voltage potential along one curve joining the electrodes yield unique determination of the conductivity. A nonlinear algorithm is proposed and implemented to illustrate the theoretical results. Comment: 20 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{individual}} neurons to modulate the gain of their input-output function {{is important for}} information processing in the brain. In a recent study (Mitchell & Silver, 2003), shunting inhibition was found to modulate the gain of cerebellar granule cells subjected to simulated currents through AMPA receptor synapses. Here we investigate the ef-fect on gain modulation resulting from adding the currents mediated by NMDA receptors to a compartmental model of the granule cell. With only AMPA receptors, the changes in gain induced by shunting inhibition de-creased gradually with the average firing rate of the afferent mossy fibers. With NMDA receptors present, this decrease was more rapid, therefore narrowing the bandwidth of mossy fiber firing rates available for gain modulation. The deterioration of gain modulation {{was accompanied by a}} reduced variability of the <b>input</b> <b>current</b> and saturation of NMDA recep-tors. However, when the output of the granule cell was plotted as a func-tion of the <b>average</b> <b>input</b> <b>current</b> instead of the input firing frequency, both models showed very similar response curves and comparable gain mod-ulation. We conclude that NMDA receptors do not directly impair gain control by shunting inhibition, but the effective bandwidth decreases {{as a consequence of the}} increased total charge transfer. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{power factor correction}} circuit has a fixed output voltage. However, in some applications, a PFC circuit with a wide output voltage range is needed. A single phase power factor correction circuit with wide output voltage range is developed in this work. After a comparison of two main power stage candidates (Buck+Boost and Sepic) in terms of efficiency, complexity, cost and device rating, the buck+boost converter is employed as the variable output PFC power stage. From the loss analysis, this topology has a high efficiency from light load to heavy load. The control system of the variable output PFC circuit is analyzed and designed. Charge <b>average</b> <b>current</b> sensing scheme has been adopted to sense the <b>input</b> <b>current.</b> The problem of high <b>input</b> harmonic <b>currents</b> at low output voltage is discussed. It is found that the current loop gain and cross over frequency will change greatly when the output voltage changes. To solve this problem, an automatic gain control scheme is proposed and a detailed circuit is designed and added to the current loop. A modified <b>input</b> <b>current</b> sensing scheme is presented to overcome the problem of an insufficient phase margin of the PFC circuit near the maximum output voltage. The charge <b>average</b> <b>current</b> sensing circuit will be bypassed automatically by a logical circuit when the output voltage {{is higher than the}} peak line voltage.

5000|$|The {{conceptual}} {{model of the}} buck converter is best {{understood in terms of}} the relation between current and voltage of the inductor. Beginning with the switch open (off-state), the current in the circuit is zero. When the switch is first closed (on-state), the current will begin to increase, and the inductor will produce an opposing voltage across its terminals in response to the changing current. This voltage drop counteracts the voltage of the source and therefore reduces the net voltage across the load. Over time, the rate of change of current decreases, and the voltage across the inductor also then decreases, increasing the voltage at the load. During this time, the inductor stores energy {{in the form of a}} magnetic field. If the switch is opened while the current is still changing, then there will always be a voltage drop across the inductor, so the net voltage at the load will always be less than the input voltage source. When the switch is opened again (off-state), the voltage source will be removed from the circuit, and the current will decrease. The decreasing current will produce a voltage drop across the inductor (opposite to the drop at on-state), and now the inductor becomes a Current Source. The stored energy in the inductor's magnetic field supports the current flow through the load. This current, flowing while the input voltage source is disconnected, when concatenated with the current flowing during on-state, totals to current greater than the <b>average</b> <b>input</b> <b>current</b> (being zero during off-state). The [...] "increase" [...] in <b>average</b> <b>current</b> makes up for the reduction in voltage, and ideally preserves the power provided to the load. During the off-state, the inductor is discharging its stored energy into the rest of the circuit. If the switch is closed again before the inductor fully discharges (on-state), the voltage at the load will always be greater than zero.|$|R
