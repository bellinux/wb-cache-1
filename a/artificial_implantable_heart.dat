40|$|In the {{development}} of an <b>artificial</b> <b>implantable</b> <b>heart</b> it is necessary to make use of both medical and engineering information. Because the field is fairly new, much of the desired information has not yet been gathered and the purpose of this investigation was to collect some of this information. Studies were made of the heat transfer properties of a blood-Silastic interface and hemolysis tests were made {{to determine the effects of}} pumping, turbulence, and temperature on the red blood cells. It was found that a film of biological material built up at the interface and that this film greatly hindered the flow of heat. Studies were made of the growth of this film under various conditions. The hemolysis rate was found to be essentially independent of the amount of turbulence. The studies were made for Reynolds numbers up to approximately 6000. Using a centrifugal pump, it was found that faster impeller rotation speeds resulted in higher hemolysis rates. Higher temperatures generally produced higher hemolysis rates...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Worldwide {{cardiovascular}} diseases {{are the major}} cause of death. Aside from heart transplants, which are limited due to the availability of human donor hearts, artificial hearts are the only therapy available for terminal heart diseases. For various reasons, a total <b>implantable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>heart</b> is desirable. But the limited space in the human thorax sets rigorous restrictions on the weight and dimensions of the device. Nevertheless, the appropriate functionality of the artificial heart must be ensured and blood damage must be prevented. These requirements set further restrictions to the drive of this device. In the this paper, two optimization methods, namely, the manual parameter variation and Differential Evolution algorithm, are presented and applied to match the specifications of an artificial heart...|$|R
40|$|Transcutaneous energy {{transmission}} (TET) {{is the most}} promising noninvasive method for supplying driving energy to a totally <b>implantable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>heart.</b> Induction-heating (IH) cookers generate a magnetic flux, and if a cooker is operated near a transcutaneous transformer, the magnetic flux generated will link with its external and internal coils.

In this paper, we present the design and development of a coil to be used for a magnetic immunity test, and we detail the investigation of the magnetic immunity of a transcutaneous transformer. The experimental coil, with five turns like a solenoid, was able to generate a uniform magnetic field in the necessary bandwidth.

40|$|Abstract—The {{axial flow}} maglev blood pump (AFMBP) {{has become a}} global {{research}} focus and emphasis for artificial ventricular assist device, which has no mechanical contact, mechanical friction, compact structure and light weight, can effectively solve thrombus and hemolysis. Magnetic suspension and impeller is two of the important parts in the axial flow maglev blood pump, and their structure largely determines the blood pump performance. The research adopts electromagnetic and fluid finite element analysis, and puts forward a method to design the magnetic suspension and impeller of axial flow blood pump, which tacks into account the small volume of axial blood pump. The magnetic bearing’s characteristics are evaluated by electromagnetic finite element analysis. The Blades have been designed by calculating aerofoil bone line, and make simulation analysis for different thicken ways of blade by Fluent software, and make a conclusion that the blade thickened with certain rules has better characteristics in the same conditions. The results will provide some guidance for design of axial flow maglev blood pump, and establish theoretical basis for application of the <b>implantable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>heart</b> pump...|$|R

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute selected him as a member of the first NIH committee to deal with ethical, social and legal issues of a developing medical technology, the totally <b>implantable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>heart</b> (1972-73). The U.S. Congress established the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1974-78), charged with formulating regulations governing the use of humans in research. Jonsen was a Commissioner and participated in development of regulations regarding use of the human fetus, children and mentally incapacitated persons as research subjects; he also assisted in the writing of the Belmont Report, the statement of ethical principles that has become the leading statement on research ethics. In 1979, Jonsen was appointed to the successor body, the President's Commission on the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine (1979-82) which devised reports on brain death, foregoing life-support, informed consent and other topics that have become the main subjects of bioethics.|$|R

40|$|The Gyro {{centrifugal}} pump {{developed as a}} totally <b>implantable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>heart</b> was designed with a free impeller, in which the rotational shaft (male bearing) of the impeller was completely separated from the female bearing. For this type of pump, {{it is very important}} to keep the proper magnet balance (impeller-magnet and actuator-magnet) in order to prevent thrombus formation and/or bearing wear. When the magnet balance is not proper, the impeller is jerked down into the bottom bearing. On the other hand, if magnet balance is proper, the impeller lifted off the bottom of the pump housing within a certain range of pumping conditions. In this study, this floating phenomenon was investigated in detail. The floating phenomenon was proved by observation of the impeller behavior using a transparent acrylic pump. The impeller floating phenomenon was mapped on a pump performance curve. The impeller floating phenomenon is affected by the magnet-magnet coupling distance and rotational speed of the impeller. In order to keep the proper magnet balance and to maintain the impeller floating phenomenon at the driving condition of right and left pump, the magnet-magnet coupling distance was altered by a spacer which was installed between the pump and actuator. It became clear that the same pump could handle different conditions (right and left ventricular assist), by just changing the thickness of the spacer. When magnet balance is proper, the floating impeller phenomenon occurs automatically in response to the impeller rev. It is called "the dynamic RPM suspension"...|$|R

40|$|Through a Lewis CommTech Program {{project with}} the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the NASA Lewis Research Center {{is playing a}} key role in the design and {{development}} of a permanently <b>implantable,</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>heart</b> pump assist device. Known as the Innovative Ventricular Assist System (IVAS), this device will take on the pumping role of the damaged left ventricle of the heart. The key part of the IVAS is a nonpulsatile (continuous flow) artificial heart pump with centrifugal impeller blades, driven by an electric motor. Lewis is part of an industry and academia team, led by the Ohio Aerospace Institute (OAI), that is working with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to make IVAS a reality. This device has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year, since 80 percent of heart attack victims suffer irreversible damage to the left ventricle, the part of the heart that does most of the pumping. Impeller blade design codes and flow-modeling analytical codes will be used in the project. These codes were developed at Lewis for the aerospace industry but will be applicable to the IVAS design project. The analytical codes, which currently simulate the flow through the compressor and pump systems, will be used to simulate the flow within the blood pump in the artificial heart assist device. The Interdisciplinary Technology Office heads up Lewis' efforts in the IVAS project. With the aid of numerical modeling, the blood pump will address many design issues, including some fluid-dynamic design considerations that are unique to the properties of blood. Some of the issues that will be addressed in the design process include hemolysis, deposition, recirculation, pump efficiency, rotor thrust balance, and bearing lubrication. Optimum pumping system performance will be achieved by modeling all the interactions between the pump components. The interactions can be multidisciplinary and, therefore, are influenced not only by the fluid dynamics of adjacent components but also by thermal and structural effects. Lewis-developed flow-modeling codes to be used in the pump simulations will include a one-dimensional code and an incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow code. These codes will analyze the prototype pump designed by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. With an improved understanding of the flow phenomena within the prototype pump, design changes to improve the performance of the pump system can be verified by computer prior to fabrication in order to reduce risks. The use of Lewis flow modeling codes during the design and development process will improve pump system performance and reduce the number of prototypes built in the development phase. The first phase of the IVAS project is to fully develop the prototype in a laboratory environment that uses a water/glycerin mixture as the surrogate fluid to simulate blood. A later phase of the project will include testing in animals for final validation. Lewis will be involved in the IVAS project for 3 to 5 years...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous tissue {{engineering}} approaches to create heart valves {{have been limited}} by the structural immaturity and mechanical properties of the valve constructs. This study used an in vitro pulse duplicator system to provide a biomimetic environment during tissue formation to yield more mature <b>implantable</b> <b>heart</b> valves derived from autologous tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: Trileaflet heart valves were fabricated from novel bioabsorbable polymers and sequentially seeded with autologous ovine myofibroblasts and endothelial cells. The constructs were grown for 14 days in a pulse duplicator in vitro system under gradually increasing flow and pressure conditions. By use of cardiopulmonary bypass, the native pulmonary leaflets were resected, and the valve constructs were implanted into 6 lambs (weight 19 +/- 2. 8 kg). All animals had uneventful postoperative courses, and the valves were explanted at 1 day and at 4, 6, 8, 16, and 20 weeks. Echocardiography demonstrated mobile functioning leaflets without stenosis, thrombus, or aneurysm up to 20 weeks. Histology (16 and 20 weeks) showed uniform layered cuspal tissue with endothelium. Environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed a confluent smooth valvular surface. Mechanical properties were {{comparable to those of}} native tissue at 20 weeks. Complete degradation of the polymers occurred by 8 weeks. Extracellular matrix content (collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and elastin) and DNA content increased to levels of native tissue and higher at 20 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates in vitro generation of <b>implantable</b> complete living <b>heart</b> valves based on a biomimetic flow culture system. These autologous tissue-engineered valves functioned up to 5 months and resembled normal heart valves in microstructure, mechanical properties, and extracellular matrix formation...|$|R

40|$|For the {{treatment}} of severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis, minimally invasive heart valve prostheses are increasingly used, especially for elderly patients. The current generation of devices is based on xenogenic leaflet material, involving limitations with regard to calcification and durability. Artificial polymeric leaflet-structures re-present a promising approach for improvement of valve performance. Within the current work, finite-element ana-lysis (FEA) design studies of polymeric leaflet structures were conducted. Design of an unpressurized and axially-symmetric trileaflet heart valve was developed based on nine parameters. Physiological pressurization in FEA was specified, based on in vitro hydrodynamic testing of a commercially available heart valve prosthesis. Hyper-elastic constitutive law for polymeric leaflet material was implemented based on experimental stress strain curves resulting from uniaxial tensile and planar shear testing. As a result of FEA, time dependent leaflet deformation of the leaflet structure was calculated. Obtained leaflet dynamics were comparable to in vitro performance of the analyzed prosthesis. As a major design parameter, the lunula angle has demonstrated crucial influence {{on the performance of}} the polymeric leaflet structures.

40|$|Heart valve tissue {{engineering}} offers a promising alternative for current treatment and replacement strategies, e. g., synthetic or bioprosthetic heart valves. In vitro mechanical conditioning {{is an important}} tool for engineering strong, <b>implantable</b> <b>heart</b> valves. Detailed knowledge of the mechanical properties of the native tissue {{as well as the}} developing tissue construct is vital for a better understanding and control of the remodeling processes induced by mechanical conditioning. The nonlinear, anisotropic and inhomogeneous mechanical behavior of heart valve tissue necessitates a mechanical characterization method that is capable of dealing with these complexities. In a recent computational study we showed that one single indentation test, combining force and deformation gradient data, provides sufficient information for local characterization of nonlinear soft anisotropic tissue properties. In the current study this approach is validated in two steps. First, indentation tests with varying indenter sizes are performed on linear elastic PDMS rubbers and compared to tensile tests on the same specimen. For the second step, tissue constructs are engineered using uniaxial or equibiaxial static constrained culture conditions. Digital image correlation (DIC) is used to quantify the anisotropy in the tissue constructs. For both validation steps, material parameters are estimated by inverse fitting of a computational model to the experimental results...|$|R
