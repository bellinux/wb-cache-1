25|$|In February of 2017, then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn named Fontes, a {{colleague}} from {{his tenure as}} Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, {{to be the next}} senior director for India, Pakistan and Central Asian Affairs at United States National Security Council (NSC). Anonymous sources within the Government of India told The Telegraph that they were hopeful Fontes's appointment in the White House would help convey New Delhi's concerns. Senior officials familiar with Fontes commented upon her understanding of India's security concerns vis-à-vis China and Pakistan; that she would be a friendly face among a Trump Administration cabinet mostly unknown to India. With Flynn's subsequent ouster, Fontes's assignment to the NSC was cancelled and the position was filled by Lisa Curtis (a former CIA analyst and fellow <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Heritage</b> Foundation) at the behest of Flynn's replacement, H. R. McMaster.|$|E
25|$|A Washington-based {{think tank}} has {{claimed that the}} US is {{supportive}} of India's efforts to close missile gap with China and is comfortable with the progress being made by New Delhi in this regard. Lisa Curtis, senior research fellow for South Asia, and Baker Spring, research fellow in National Security Policy, <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Heritage</b> Foundation, a conservative think tank said in a commentary, “The lack of US condemnation of India's latest missile test demonstrates that the US is comfortable with Indian progress in the nuclear and missile fields and appreciates India's need to meet the emerging strategic challenge posed by rising China.” “It is telling that no country has criticised India's missile test,” the US experts wrote. “The US change in position with regard to Indian missile capabilities demonstrates how far the US-India relationship has evolved over the last decade,” Curtis and Spring said.|$|E

500|$|Tom Waits {{began his}} musical career in 1970, {{performing}} every Monday night at The Troubadour, a venue in Los Angeles, California. Waits' setlist at these series of shows, described as [...] "hootenanny nights", consisted primarily of Bob Dylan covers, although it included songs which would later appear on Closing Time and its successor, The Heart of Saturday Night (1974). Among the songs performed were [...] "Ice Cream Man", [...] "Virginia Avenue", [...] "Ol' '55", [...] "I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love with You", [...] "Shiver Me Timbers" [...] and [...] "Diamonds on my Windshield." [...] Around this time, Waits began {{working as a}} doorman at a San Diego, California, club, The Heritage, which was a coffee house by day. In November 1970, Waits performed his first paid show <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Heritage,</b> earning $25 for his performance. At a Troubadour performance in summer 1971, Herb Cohen inadvertently spotted Waits and became his manager. Through Cohen's contacts, Waits recorded demos in Los Angeles in late summer 1971 with producer Robert Duffey, later released as The Early Years in two volumes, against Waits' wishes. In order to focus on his career, Waits relocated from San Diego to Los Angeles in early 1972 and performed more frequently at The Troubadour, where David Geffen discovered him performing [...] "Grapefruit Moon." [...] The performance, which [...] "floored" [...] Geffen, led Geffen to negotiate with Waits' manager Cohen, and Waits signed to Asylum Records within a month.|$|E
