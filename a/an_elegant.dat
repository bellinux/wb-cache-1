For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals. Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in fear processing.|$|E

5|$|During {{the start}} of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, President Manuel Quezon hired Paris-trained Filipino {{architect}} Andrés Luna de San Pedro, son of painter Juan Luna, to take charge of the renovations of the Manila Hotel. It was done {{under the supervision of the}} renowned engineering firm Pedro Siochi and Company. The hotel was the residence of General Douglas MacArthur when he became the Military Advisor of the Commonwealth. Luna converted the hotel's top floor into <b>an</b> <b>elegant</b> penthouse and expanded the west wing northward – creating the air-conditioned annex - and designed some key public rooms like the Fiesta Pavilion, then the biggest function room of the hotel. The hotel was the site of festivities during the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth government in November, 1935.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centre}} of York, in St Helen's Square, there is the York branch of Bettys Café Tea Rooms. Bettys founder, Frederick Belmont, {{travelled}} on the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into <b>an</b> <b>elegant</b> café in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt {{of the thousands of}} airmen stationed around York.

5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide <b>an</b> <b>elegant</b> straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E

That same year, Stephenson {{was elected to}} his first public office, the Illinois State Senate, after which he sought an appointment to the Land Office in Galena. From December 1834 until April 1835 Stephenson was absent from Galena. He spent time in St. Louis, where he married Ellen Kyle in December, then traveled on to Edwardsville and Vandalia, Illinois; the couple eventually had two children. In April 1835 the couple returned to Galena where James took office as Register of Lands at Galena and Chicago, and they lived <b>an</b> <b>elegant</b> lifestyle.|$|E

The bishop’s throne or “cathedra” was designed by Scott to complement the choir stalls. It was constructed by Farmer and Brindley in 1876. The reredos and the floor mosaic date from 1876, and were designed by J.R.Clayton.

5|$|The {{general layout}} of the home's {{interior}} has remained basically the same throughout the remodelings; the rooms on each floor are accessed via a large central hallway which ends in <b>an</b> <b>elegant</b> rotunda. However, {{some of the changes}} made in 1910 and 1911 did alter the interior appearance. The parlor was converted into the library and the library was converted into the dining room after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large kitchen was added, on the second-floor, the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.|$|E
5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is <b>an</b> <b>elegant</b> ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E

The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
