She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> not my job.|$|E
500|$|The {{verdict was}} {{received}} with pleasure {{by the majority}} of the populace, with the principle of constructive treason [...] "widely regarded as highly threatening and injurious to public freedoms"; as a result, juries became far less willing to convict people for constructive treason, and the government resorted to amending the Treason Act to incorporate the judicially invented concept of constructive treason into statute law. Erskine's speech, more than <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> <b>is</b> considered to be the source of this acquittal; Lloyd Paul Stryker in his biography of Erskine notes that he [...] "had held his jury spellbound-not the jury only, but the whole courtroom also. His logic, his sincerity, and his fire had driven in his close-knit arguments with hammer blows". Erskine later became Lord Chancellor in the Ministry of All the Talents and was renowned as an excellent, albeit unorthodox, advocate. Kenyon, on the other hand, became Lord Chief Justice. Gordon, the defendant in the case, had a less successful subsequent career; he was later excommunicated and sent to prison, where he died of typhoid in 1793.|$|E
500|$|While it {{eventually}} became a bestseller in the United States, The Red Badge of Courage was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when {{it was published in}} late 1895. Crane was delighted with his novel's success overseas, writing to a friend: [...] "I have only one pride {{and that is that the}} English edition of The Red Badge of Courage has been [...] with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win." [...] Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a [...] "masterpiece", applauding Crane's ability to [...] "stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre." [...] Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that [...] "If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all". Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel's treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy, Émile Zola and Victor Hugo, all of whose works he believed to be [...] "positively... cold and ineffectual" [...] when compared to The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E

2500|$|Some Dunhuang {{documents}} say that, {{as well as}} {{his sister}} Sad-mar-kar (or Sa-tha-ma-kar), Songtsen Gampo had a younger brother who was betrayed and died in a fire, sometime after 641. Apparently, according to one partially damaged scroll from Dunhuang, there was hostility between Sa-tha-ma-kar and Songtsen Gampo's younger brother, bTzan-srong, who, as a result, was forced to settle in gNyal (an old district to the southeast of Yarlung and across the [...] Yartö Tra Pass, which bordered on modern Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh in India). Little, if <b>anything,</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> known about this brother.|$|E
2500|$|I am {{shocked by}} Ruth Herschberger's {{malicious}} account of my play Benito Cereno[...] [...]It is perfectly clear that I am {{horrified by the}} American tendency to violence when in panic, {{and that is what}} the ending of my play--the killing of the slaves and their leader on the mutinied ship--means[...] [...]Ruth Herschberger's notion that I am Captain Delano and wish to put down the present Negro revolt either by guns or by <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> slanderous. In my poem [...] " [...] the Union Dead" [...] I lament the loss of the old abolitionist spirit; the terrible injustice, in the past and in the present, of the American treatment of the Negro is of the greatest urgency to me as a man and as a writer.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has also}} been {{discovered}} {{that there is no}} scientific research that directly links naturally high testosterone levels to women’s success in sports. [...] Most people assume that women with high levels of testosterone will be more athletic because they know that men have higher levels of testosterone and are usually seen to have more athletic prowess than their female counterparts. [...] Even though testosterone can be a factor in athletic ability, so can a number of other factors, like “physique, thermoregulation, biomechanics, oxygen uptake, training, and genetics, as well as the psychological and the social”. [...] The policy also does not distinguish between natural and enhanced testosterone, and many believe that only doping on testosterone should be regulated against because regulating <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> just another form of covert discrimination.|$|E

However, the statement of the problem as posed in her column is ambiguous. The answer depends on what strategy the host is following. If [...] the host operates under a strategy of only offering a switch if the initial guess is correct, it would clearly be disadvantageous to accept the offer. If the host merely selects a door at random, the question is likewise {{very different from the}} standard version. Savant addressed these issues by writing the following in Parade Magazine, [...] "the original answer defines certain conditions, the most significant of which is that the host always opens a losing door on purpose. <b>Anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> a different question." ...|$|E
