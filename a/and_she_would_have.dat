She quit the sport after being told that neither insurance nor the Australian Paralympic Committee would cover her against injury during a tour in the United States, as her tendonitis was considered a there, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to pay the costs for injury treatment herself. She quit wheelchair basketball. She had a child, which caused a recurrence of her original illness.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{visited the}} {{president}} at the White House {{for the first time}} as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before Roosevelt's third swearing-in. The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done so herself had she been aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, and gave his former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, Winston Churchill. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie's mission. He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22.|$|E

Normal practice of the time was for the ship's company to leave the ship upon decommissioning, {{with the exception of}} a few specialists, including the shipwright and gunner, who would have been accommodated in another vessel. The dockyard would have taken her in hand for a refit, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> recommissioned, with a new captain and crew, on completion.|$|E

Metacomet, unleashed from Hartford, captured Selma. Fire from the gunboats holed Gaines, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sunk had she not been beached; she was then burned by her crew.

25|$|Blankers-Koen {{was born}} Francina Elsje Koen on 26 April 1918 in Lage Vuursche (near Baarn) to Arnoldus and Helena Koen. Her {{father was a}} {{government}} official who competed in the shot put and discus. She had five brothers. As a teenager, she enjoyed tennis, swimming, gymnastics, ice skating, fencing and running. Standing , she was a natural athlete. It soon became clear she was a sports talent, {{but she could not}} decide which sport to pick. A swimming coach advised her to do track because there were already several top swimmers in the Netherlands at that time (such as Rie Mastenbroek), <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a better chance to qualify for the Olympics in a track event.|$|E
25|$|Pompey married Cornelia, a {{daughter}} of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio. Some people disliked this because Cornelia was much younger <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a better match for his sons. There were also people who thought that Pompey gave priority to his wedding over dealing with {{the crisis in the}} city. Pompey was also seen as being partial in the conduct of some trials. He succeeded in restoring order and chose his father-in‑law as his colleague for the last five months of the year. Pompey was granted an extension of his command in his provinces and was given an annual sum for the maintenance of his troops. Cato warned Pompey about Caesar’s manoeuvres to increase his power by using the money he made from the spoils of war to extend is patronage in Rome and urged him to counter Caesar. Pompey hesitated, and Cato stood for the consulship in order to deprive Caesar of his military command and have him tried. However, he was not elected.|$|E

Prince Philip said of his mother's sheltering of persecuted Jews, [...] "I suspect that {{it never occurred to}} her that her action was in any way special. She was a person with a deep religious faith, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress."

500|$|The wedding {{took place}} in 1908. According {{to a number of}} Mao's biographers, the {{ceremony}} would have likely followed traditional rural Hunanese custom. Thus, it probably would have begun with a feast in the groom's home on the day before the ceremony, to which friends and relatives were invited. The next day, the bride would have been dressed in red, with a red veil over her face, and carried by red palanquin to the groom's family home. [...] There, her veil would have been removed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been expected to express unhappiness and dissatisfaction with the groom by publicly insulting him. According to tradition, a display of fireworks would probably have taken place, before both bride and groom would have kowtowed to each guest, to the groom's ancestral altar, to the spirits, and to one another, concluding the ceremony.|$|E

[...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R.

500|$|Obedient to Palmer's instructions, Peddle sent Leech {{sketches}} of a seated Isabella, {{with the long}} inscription on the reverse; she hoped the Mint Director would allow her to shorten it. [...] Leech was unhappy with the reverse, and decided that Barber would design {{that side of the}} coin. [...] Barber and Bosbyshell wrote to Leech that Isabella's legs would appear distorted if the seated figure were used and advocated a head in profile. [...] Carlisle agreed, stating that he had only given permission for a head of Isabella. [...] Peddle was informed that Barber would produce the reverse, though the design would be sent to her for approval, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to change her obverse. [...] Meanwhile, Palmer was growing increasingly anxious: with a timeline of two months from design approval to the availability of the actual coins, she feared that the pieces would not be available for sale until well into the fair's May to October run.

500|$|Two {{years after}} the album's release, as she was leaving her house to attend a Nashville Predators hockey game with Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood, Hardwick {{appeared}} at her driveway. A car parked and, out of it, exited Hardwick {{and a friend of}} his. After {{two and a half years}} of not speaking, the two conversed: [...] "He was like, 'Hey, how's it going?' And I'm like, 'Wow, you're late. Good to see you.' But we were civilized." [...] Swift conjectured multiple theories as to why Hardwick appeared at her house. One of them was that he was attempting to prove to his friend that he was indeed the subject of [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar". Other possibilities was that he wanted to amend their friendship or believed Swift was still pining away from him. Swift said it would have been poetic if he approached her upon the album's release <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> accepted, but that she had already moved on. Swift cited [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] as an example of how she expresses her sentiments in songs and sometimes in no other manner. She was not afraid of using Hardwick's first name on the track and, therefore, believed it was very honest and susceptible, something she adored.|$|E

2500|$|According to biographer Janet Todd, Behn did {{not oppose}} slavery per se. She {{accepted}} {{the idea that}} powerful groups would enslave the powerless, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> grown up with Oriental tales of [...] "The Turk" [...] taking European slaves. Although {{it has never been}} proven that Behn was actually married, the most likely candidate for her husband is Johan Behn, who sailed on The King David from the German imperial free city of Hamburg. This Johan Behn was a slaver whose residence in London later was probably a result of acting as a mercantile cover for Dutch trade with the English colonies under a false flag. One could argue that if Aphra Behn had been opposed to slavery as an institution, it is not very likely that she would have married a slave trader. At the same time, it is fairly clear that she was not happy in marriage, and Oroonoko, written twenty years after the death of her husband, has, among its cast of characters, no one more evil than the slave ship captain who tricks and captures Oroonoko.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Honeymooners" [...] {{made its}} debut on October 5, 1951, as a six-minute sketch. Ensemble cast member Art Carney made a brief {{appearance}} {{as a police officer}} who gets hit with flour Ralph had thrown out the window. The tone of these early sketches was much darker than the later series, with Ralph exhibiting extreme bitterness and frustration with his marriage to an equally bitter and argumentative middle-aged woman (Kelton was nine years older than Gleason). The Kramdens' financial struggles mirrored those of Gleason's early life in Brooklyn, and he took great pains to duplicate on set the interior of the apartment where he grew up (right down to his boyhood address of 328 Chauncey Street). The Kramdens—and later the Nortons when those characters are added—are childless, an issue only occasionally explored, but a condition on which Gleason insisted. Ralph and Alice did legally adopt a baby girl whom they named Ralphina (because he actually wanted a baby boy he could name after himself but {{fell in love with the}} baby girl the agency had placed with them). However, the biological mother requested to have her baby returned, and the agency asked whether the Kramdens would be willing to do so even though they were the legal parents. Ralph agreed and stated that they would visit her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a real-life Santa Claus every Christmas. A few later skits had ralph mistakenly believe for a while that Alice was pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, Kay was {{watching}} the sixth [...] hour of The Today Show (an apparent jab at NBC's decision to extend it {{at the expense of}} the Passions timeslot) when it was interrupted with a news report that Luis had been arrested. In one August 2007 episode, Tabitha said that a certain soap opera was starting on DirecTV <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to tell her friends not to call her between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 pm, blatantly referring to Passions itself. At the beginning of the show's final week on NBC, as Whitney was preparing to move to New Orleans, Theresa asked if she was sure she wanted to go, and Whitney commented that she had already arranged to have her DirecTV hooked up in Louisiana so she could [...] "keep up on everything happening in Harmony." [...] And also in 2007, Endora flat-out made a reference to the [...] "audience" [...] in one of her thought balloons, prompting Norma to look in the camera and respond, [...] "Audience? What audience?" [...] Endora also pointed out in one of her thought balloons that when Miguel returned to Passions, he looked nothing like Jesse Metcalfe ("Nope, not even close!"). In May 2008 while Juanita was looking for clues in a bookstore as to where Pilar was, the bargain shelf was full of copies of Hidden Passions. In [...] June 2008, Tabitha mentions the fourth hour of Today being a ratings-grabber, poking fun as to how they canceled the soap making way for this fourth hour trying to bring the ratings on NBC up.|$|E
2500|$|Parallel to {{the slow}} {{development}} of common law duress, {{the courts of}} equity allowed escape from a contract if any form of undue influence was used against a contracting party. [...] "Actual undue influence" [...] is now essentially {{the same thing as}} duress in its wider form. In these [...] "class 1" [...] cases, a claimant proves they were actually put under undue influence. Most relevant are the cases on [...] "presumed undue influence", of which there are two sub-classes. [...] "Class 2A" [...] cases involve someone being in a pre-defined relation of trust and confidence with another, before which they enter a very disadvantageous transaction. In Allcard v Skinner, Miss Allcard joined a Christian sect, the [...] "Protestant Sisters of the Poor", run by her spiritual adviser, Miss Skinner. After taking vows of poverty and obedience she gave the sect almost all her property. Lindley LJ held that if she had not been barred from the claim by letting 6 years lapse, it could be presumed that Miss Allcard was unduly influenced <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to rescind the transfer. Other class 2A relationships include doctor and patient, parent and child, solicitor and client, or any fiduciary relation (but not wife and husband). Where the relation does not fall into one of these, it stands with [...] "class 2B" [...] cases. Here, a claimant may first prove that there was in fact a strong relation of trust and confidence. If that is done, and there is a disadvantageous transaction, it will be presumed to result from undue influence. It will then be up to the recipient of the property to rebut the presumption. This takes on greatest significance in cases involving banks typically lending money to a husband for his business, and securing a mortgage over the husband and wife's jointly owned home. Significant problems arose, particularly after the early 1990s housing, stock market and currency crashes, where the husband's business failed, the bank attempted to repossess the house, and the wife claimed she never understood the implications of the mortgage or was pressured into it. Even though a bank may have played no illegitimate role, if it had [...] "constructive notice" [...] of undue influence (i.e. if it was aware that something was potentially wrong) the bank would lose its security and could not repossess the house. In Royal Bank of Scotland plc v Etridge the House of Lords decided that in such situations a bank should ensure that the spouse has been independently advised by a solicitor, who in turn confirms in writing there is no question of undue influence, before giving out a loan.|$|E
