The {{purpose of the}} study was to compare the <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> Neer classification with the <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> treatment recommendations. Methods We conducted a multi-centre observer-study. Five experienced shoulder surgeons independently assessed a consecutive series of 193 radiographs at two occasions three months apart. All pairs of radiographs were classified according to Neer. Subsequently, the observers were asked to recommend one of three treatment modalities for each case: non-operative treatment, locking plate osteosynthesis, or hemiarthroplasty. Results At both classification rounds mean kappa-values for inter-observer <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> treatment recommendations (0. 48 and 0. 52) were significantly higher than the <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> Neer classification (0. 33 and 0. 36) (p[*] Conclusions We found a significantly higher <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> treatment recommendations compared to <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> fracture classification.
