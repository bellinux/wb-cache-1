The {{purpose of the}} study was to compare the <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> Neer classification with the <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> treatment recommendations.

All pairs of radiographs were classified according to Neer. Subsequently, the observers were asked to recommend one of three treatment modalities for each case: non-operative treatment, locking plate osteosynthesis, or hemiarthroplasty. Results At both classification rounds mean kappa-values for inter-observer <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> treatment recommendations (0. 48 and 0. 52) were significantly higher than the <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> Neer classification (0. 33 and 0. 36) (p[*] Conclusions We found a significantly higher <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> treatment recommendations compared to <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> fracture classification.
