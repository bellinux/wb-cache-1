40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} PANEL, a position-based <b>aggregator</b> node election {{protocol for}} wireless sensor networks. The novelty of PANEL {{with respect to}} other <b>aggregator</b> node election protocols is that it supports asynchronous sensor network applications where the sensor readings are fetched by the base stations after some delay. In particular, the motivation {{for the design of}} PANEL was to support reliable and persistent data storage applications, such as TinyPEDS [13]. PANEL ensures load balancing, and it supports intraand inter-cluster routing allowing sensor to <b>aggregator,</b> <b>aggregator</b> to <b>aggregator,</b> base station to <b>aggregator,</b> and <b>aggregator</b> to base station communications. We also compare PANEL with HEED [42] in the simulation environment provided by TOSSIM, and show that, on the one hand, PANEL creates more cohesive clusters than HEED, and, on the other hand, that PANEL is more energy efficient than HEED...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the following problem, which arises {{in the context of}} distributed Web computations. An <b>aggregator</b> aims to combine specific data from n sources. The <b>aggregator</b> contacts all sources at once. The time for each source to return its data to the <b>aggregator</b> is independent and identically distributed according to a known distribution. The <b>aggregator</b> at some point stops waiting for data and returns an answer depending only on the data received so far. If the <b>aggregator</b> returns the aggregated information from k of the n sources at time t it obtains a reward R k (t) that grows with k and decreases with t. The goal of the <b>aggregator</b> is to maximize its expected reward. We prove that for certain broad families of distributions and broad classes of reward functions, the optimal plan for the <b>aggregator</b> has a simple form and hence can be easily computed. # Supported in part by an Alfred P.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} optimal bidding {{strategy}} for demand response (DR) <b>aggregator</b> in day-ahead (DA) markets. Because of constraint of minimum power quantity requirement, small-sized customers {{have to become}} indirect participants of electricity markets via the DR <b>aggregator,</b> who could offer various contracts accessing customers' demand reduction capacity in advance. In day-ahead markets, DR <b>aggregator</b> schedules those contracts and submits accumulated DR offers to the system operator. The objective is to maximize the profit of the DR <b>aggregator.</b> The key element affecting the bidding decision and <b>aggregator's</b> profit is the uncertain hourly DA prices. The stochastic programming adopts scenario-based approach for helping the profit-seeking DR <b>aggregator</b> control uncertainties.

25|$|The {{decline in}} {{advertising}} revenues affected both the print and online media {{as well as}} all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of online advertising are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the web) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by crowdsourcing both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, journalism (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of news <b>aggregators,</b> which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of web traffic. Increasing paywalling of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the Ordinari Post Tijdender, which was established in Stockholm in 1645.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the nature}} of the {{intelligence}} architecture in Afghanistan was seen as the issue that had the biggest impact on HTT performance. Because the intelligence architecture did not value sociocultural knowledge and was not built to provide it, HTTs themselves had to be the ground sensors, a role they had not been designed to fulfill. HTTs were intended to be the <b>aggregators</b> of knowledge at the Brigade level to synthesize information to commanders directly. If HTTs had been built to be the sensors, {{they would have had to}} be multiplied in size and number many times over. By utilizing the HTTs as the primary interviewers and data analysts, their effectiveness was constrained. Since HTT members had relatively short tours (9–12 months), and would usually have a new Brigade arrive in the middle of their tour, their effectiveness was further reduced by their constant need to train new units on area features. The NDU team concluded that had soldiers themselves been the primary sensors on the ground, as recommended in LTG Michael T. Flynn’s Fixing Intel monograph, HTTs would have better been able to perform the role they were originally intended to serve.|$|E
