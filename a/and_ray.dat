5|$|During the winter, {{they played}} for the Fitzroy Baseball Club, often {{competing}} in matches played as curtain raisers to the elite Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day's cricket for Fitzroy, and Plant, Liddicut and other club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular. In 1942–43, Neil broke into Fitzroy's First XI, joining his older brothers Merv, Mick, <b>and</b> <b>Ray.</b> During that season, the family held down the first four batting positions for Fitzroy; Merv and Mick opened the batting <b>and</b> <b>Ray</b> and Neil came in after them. The four brothers entered the Victorian team in the 1940s; Merv in 1940–41, Neil in 1946–47, <b>and</b> <b>Ray</b> and Mick in successive seasons thereafter.|$|E

50|$|Sharks <b>and</b> <b>rays</b> {{are both}} {{cartilaginous}} fishes {{which can be}} contrasted with bony fishes. Rays are adapted for feeding on the bottom.

25|$|Other new {{characters}} in this revamped version were Sidney Livingstone as Bert Daley, Arthur's gullible, over-trusting brother (<b>and</b> <b>Ray's</b> father), who views Arthur {{as a successful}} businessman and not a con-man <b>and</b> entrusts <b>Ray</b> into his care; Bert's wife <b>and</b> <b>Ray's</b> mum, Doreen (Lill Roughley); <b>and</b> <b>Ray's</b> recurring girlfriend Gloria (Emma Cunningham), who is frustrated with Ray being torn between her and Arthur's lackey. The new police nemesis was Detective Sergeant Michael Morley (Nick Day), paired with D.C. Park (Stephen Tompkinson) in series 8, who in turn, was replaced by D.C. Field (Jonty Stephens) in series 9.|$|R

5|$|Neil and Merv {{retained}} {{their positions}} for Victoria’s first two matches of the 194748 season, against India and South Australia respectively. Again, Merv was out before Neil came in, {{so they did}} not bat together. The brotherly selection pairing was broken up for Victoria’s next match, as Neil was rewarded with selection for an Australian XI for a Test trial match against the Indians, while Merv continued to represent the state. Neil returned to the Victorian team for the match against New South Wales at the SCG the following week, <b>and</b> <b>Ray</b> was selected to make his first-class debut, so three Harveys were in the state team for the first time. Merv opened, while Neil <b>and</b> <b>Ray</b> batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships. Merv opened and made 45 before being dismissed at 2/99, prompting Neil's entrance to replace him at the crease. Neil then top-scored with 61 before falling at 4/200, <b>and</b> <b>Ray</b> then came in at 5/208 to make 43. Victoria ended with 331 and the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on, and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat {{together for the first}} time at first-class level. Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine-wicket win. Merv <b>and</b> <b>Ray</b> ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively.|$|E

5|$|A {{national}} tour began in Cleveland, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran {{for five years}} and starred Richard Eastham as Emile, Janet Blair as Nellie <b>and</b> <b>Ray</b> Walston as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them. Jeanne Bal and Iva Withers were later Nellies on this tour. A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.|$|E
