Additionally, it will examine whether the vineyards and wineries in these counties adhere to the <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-assessment</b> procedures proposed by the California Code of Sustainable Winegrowing Practices when growing and producing organic wine. Finally, this study will discuss what lessons these three counties can learn from each other about sustainable wine production.

Findings show that of the wineries in these three counties, Mendocino and Napa County have gone beyond the requirements of the California Code of Sustainable Winegrowing Practices, while Sonoma County appears to be lagging behind.

This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, British Journal of Radiology and is also available at: [URL] UK Breast Screening Programme has recently expanded the age range for invitation in the prevalent round to 70 years. In contrast, fewer radiologists now choose to specialise in the area of breast cancer screening. In response to this depletion in film-reading personnel, an increasing number of radiographers have been trained as advanced practitioners in order to film read alongside the current radiologists. As part of the quality assurance programme for the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP), each film-reader can participate in a <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-assessment</b> scheme (PERFORMS) which consists of a number of recent challenging breast screening cases that are amassed nationally and distributed bi-annually. The scheme produces anonymous data on any areas of difficulties that individual participants have; these data can then be aggregated over groups of participants or over specific types of screening cases. In this paper the areas of difficulty experienced by groups of advanced practitioners and radiologists on the PERFORMS cases were investigated to determine whether there were occupational group differences in reading skills in terms of case classification and feature type. Identifying if such problematic areas exist would be the first step to provide training sets specially tailored to the needs of particular occupational groups. As a bench mark for which cases could be problematic, the types of cases that a panel of experienced radiologists deemed as difficult was first examined in order to compare the performance of both film-reading groups against this panel standard. Secondly, any differences in performance error and case characteristics (classification, difficulty level and feature type) between radiologists and advanced practitioners were examined. The decisions of 15 experienced ‘panel’ radiologists and approximately 400 film readers (including radiologists and advanced practitioners) were compared on 180 cases, over a number of years. This study employed a matched design which controlled for any differences between radiologists and advanced practitioners in terms of real-life factors such as volume of cases read per week and years of radiological experience. The results elucidate the type of cases most appropriate for advanced mammographic training.

While most initiatives work with outcome indicators that are generally associated with limited direct policy relevance, a minority of tools focuses on sustainability-related processes and particularly local government policies. In this article, we explore the benefits, limitations and conditions under which this approach can function. While several process-oriented tools offered to European local governments have lacked participation and foundered, the Local Sustainability Meter (LSM) has been widely used in the Netherlands, with close to 90 % of all Dutch municipalities participating since 1999 in some of its multi-year editions. An evaluative case study {{presented in this article}} shows that the LSM stimulated competition for policy performance, conceptual learning and the strengthening of local governance and inter-municipal networks. The LSM's design choices of combining <b>voluntary,</b> transparent <b>self-assessments</b> at periodic intervals with public rankings and awards proved to be an effective – and economic – way of disseminating sustainability policies. Its limitations include an inherent focus on generic, standardized policy prescriptions and little knowledge on actual sustainability outcomes.

40|$|Abstract Background Injecting {{drug users}} (IDU) remain an {{important}} {{population at risk}} for blood-borne infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the Netherlands, a program is being implemented to offer <b>annual</b> <b>voluntary</b> screening for these infections to opioid drug users (ODUs) screened in methadone care. At two care sites where the program is now operating, our study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence among ODUs screened for HIV, HBV and HCV; to evaluate HBV vaccination coverage; and to assess the feasibility of monitoring seroprevalence trends by using routine annual screening data. Methods Opioid drug users on methadone treatment are routinely offered voluntary screening for infectious diseases such as HIV, HBV and HCV. Data on uptake and outcome of anti-HIV, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV screening among ODUs receiving methadone were obtained from two regions: Amsterdam from 2004 to 2008 and Heerlen from 2003 to 2009. Findings Annual screening uptake for HIV, HBV and HCV varied from 34 to 69 %, depending on disease and screening site. Of users screened, 2. 5 % were HIV-positive in Amsterdam and 11 % in Heerlen; 26 % were HCV-positive in Amsterdam and 61 % in Heerlen. Of those screened for HBV, evidence of current or previous infection (anti-HBc) was found among 33 % in Amsterdam and 48 % in Heerlen. In Amsterdam, 92 % were fully vaccinated for HBV versus 45 % in Heerlen. Conclusion Annual screening for infectious diseases in all ODUs in methadone care is not fully implemented in the Netherlands. On average, {{more than half of}} the ODUs in methadone care in Heerlen and Amsterdam were screened for HIV, HBV and HCV. In addition, screening data indicate that HBV vaccination uptake was rather high. While the HIV prevalence among these ODUs was relatively low compared to other drug-using populations, the high HCV prevalence among this group underscores the need to expand annual screening and interventions to monitor HIV, HBV and HCV in the opioid drug-using population. </p...|$|R
