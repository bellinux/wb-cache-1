40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} {{correlation}} between cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> and cancer-related death in gastric cancer patients. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six gastric cancer patients after operation at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University were enrolled in this study. Their clinical data including demographic characteristics, operation time, tumor size, pathological type and staging, tumor metastasis, outcome of chemotherapy or CIK cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy,</b> survival time or time of death were collected with a standard structured questionnaire. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median survival time, and the 2 - and 5 - year survival rates. Hazard risk (HR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) of CIK cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> for gastric cancer were calculated using the two-stage time-dependent covariates Cox model. RESULTS: The survival time of gastric cancer patients was longer after CIK cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> than after chemotherapy (χ 2 = 10. 907, P = 0. 001). The median survival time of gastric cancer patients was also longer after CIK cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> than after chemotherapy (49 mo vs 27 mo, P < 0. 05). The 2 - and 5 -year survival rates of gastric cancer patients were significantly higher after CIK cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> than after chemotherapy (73. 5 % vs 52. 6 %, 40. 4 % vs 23. 9 %, P < 0. 05). A significant difference was observed in the survival curve for patients who received CIK cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> (0, 1 - 10, 11 - 25, and over 25 frequencies) (χ 2 = 14. 534, P = 0. 002). The frequencies of CIK cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> were significantly related with the decreasing risk of death in gastric cancer patients after adjustment for sex and age of the patients, tumor stage and relapse (HR = 0. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 36 - 0. 80) when the first stage Cox model was used to define the subjects who remained alive beyond 36 mo as survivors. However, no correlation was observed between the frequencies of death in CIK cells <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> {{and the risk of}} gastric cancer patients (HR = 1. 09, 95 % CI: 0. 63 - 0. 89) when the second stage Cox model was used to define the subjects who survived for more than 36 mo as survivors.

40|$|<b>Adoptive</b> T-cell <b>immunotherapy</b> {{has shown}} promise in the {{treatment}} of human malignancies, but the challenge of isolating T cells with high avidity for tumor antigens in each patient has limited application of this approach. The transfer into T cells of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes encoding high-affinity TCRs recognizing defined tumor-associated antigens can potentially circumvent this obstacle. Using a well-characterized murine model of <b>adoptive</b> T-cell <b>immunotherapy</b> for widely disseminated leukemia, we demonstrate that TCR gene–modified T cells can cure mice of disseminated tumor. One goal of such adoptive therapy is to establish a persistent memory response to prevent recurrence; however, long-term function of transferred TCR-transduced T cells is limited due to reduced expression of the introduced TCR in vivo in quiescent resting T cells. However, by introducing the TCR into a cell with a known endogenous specificity, activation of these T cells by stimulation through the endogenous TCR can be used to increase expression of the introduced TCR, potentially providing a strategy to increase the total number of tumor-reactive T cells in the host and restore more potent antitumor activity...|$|R

40|$|Lymphopenia {{enhances the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> by facilitating expansion of transferred T cells but also limits the T-cell repertoire available to mediate immune responses and, in humans, is associated with chronic immune dysfunction. Previous studies concluded that lymphopenia augments <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> by diminishing Tregs and increasing homeostatic cytokines. We sought to determine whether targeted therapies that replicate the physiology of lymphopenia in lymphoreplete hosts could provide a similarly supportive milieu. Pmel- 1 T cells were transferred to B 16 -bearing lymphopenic versus lymphoreplete mice receiving αCD 25 and/or recombinant human interleukin- 7. Although CD 25 -based Treg depletion was inefficient because of peripheral expansion of CD 4 +CD 25 −FOXP 3 + cells, outcomes were better in αCD 25 -treated lymphoreplete hosts than in lymphopenic hosts, and <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> was most effective in lymphoreplete hosts receiving αCD 25 plus recombinant human interleukin- 7. Lymphopenic hosts supported increased proliferation of adoptively transferred antigen-specific T cells, but cells transferred to lymphoreplete recipients receiving targeted therapies showed superior function. Further, determinant spreading was substantial in lymphoreplete hosts but absent in lymphopenic hosts. These results demonstrate that targeted therapies delivered to mimic the “physiology of lymphopenia” enhance the efficacy of <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> in lymphoreplete hosts and provide a potentially superior alternative to the induction of lymphopenia...|$|E

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this issue for patients with postoperative NSCLC. Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> with control therapies in postoperative NSCLC patients. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) was estimated and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a fixed-effect model. Compared with control therapies, analyses of 4 randomized controlled trials (472 patients) showed a significant benefit of <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> on survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 84, p = 0. 002), and a 39 % reduction in the relative risk of death (no evidence of a difference between trials; p = 0. 16, I² = 42 %). In subgroup analyses by treatment cycles and treatment regimen, significant OS benefit was found in combination therapy of AI with chemotherapy, regardless of whether or not the treatment cycles were more than 10 cycles. <b>Adoptive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> has the potential to improve overall survival in postoperative NSCLC. The findings suggest this is a valid treatment option for these patients. Further randomized clinical trials are urgently needed...|$|E

40|$|The tumor is {{a hostile}} {{microenvironment}} for T lymphocytes. Indeed, irregular blood flow and endothelial cell (EC) anergy that characterize most solid tumors hamper leukocyte adhesion, extravasation and infiltration.

In this review, we will summarize on {{recent advances in}} our understanding of the characteristics of tumor associated neoangiogenic vessels {{as well as of the}} tumor metabolism that may impact on T cell trafficking and fitness of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In particular, we will focus on how advances in knowledge of the characteristics of tumor ECs have enabled identifying strategies to normalize the tumor vasculature and/or overcome EC anergy, thus increasing leukocyte-vessel wall interactions and lymphocyte infiltration in tumors.

40|$|The {{importance}} of CD 4 T cells in orchestrating {{the immune system}} and their role in inducing effective T cell-mediated therapies for the treatment of patients with select established malignancies are undisputable. Through a complex and balanced array of direct and indirect mechanisms of cellular activation and regulation, this functionally diverse family of lymphocytes can potentially promote tumor eradication, long-term tumor immunity and aid in establishing and/or rebalancing immune cell homeostasis through interaction with other immune cell populations within the highly dynamic tumor environment. However, recent studies have uncovered additional functions and roles for CD 4 T cells, some of which are independent of other lymphocytes, that can not only influence and contribute to tumor immunity but paradoxically promote tumor growth and progression. Here, we review the recent advances in our understanding of the various CD 4 T cell lineages and their signature cytokines in disease progression and/or regression.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of hematological malignancies remain limited in treatment options. Immune system modulation serves as a promising therapeutic approach to eliminate malignant cells.
