5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect, Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed, {{in a report}} to the House of Representatives, a {{criminal}} appeal similar to that in England: a writ of error <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> in non-capital cases, and no writs of error in capital cases. Randolph's report was referred to the Committee of the Whole, which took no action.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of criminal {{appeals to the}} Supreme Court by means of writs of error from the circuit courts was perhaps an open question prior to More.

25|$|The {{right of}} a {{prisoner}} to make an application to the High Court is abolished. Previously an application {{could be made to}} the Crown Court and the High Court <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right.</b> The right to make a bail application by way of judicial review remains, although only if its more stringent tests applicable are satisfied. The Crown Court is now effectively the final arbiter of bail in criminal cases. Prosecution appeals against Magistrates' Courts decisions to grant bail are extended to all imprisonable criminal offences.|$|E

25|$|Both {{an order}} for {{specific}} performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating {{for the most part}} in equity. Neither is available <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance. Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as laches, the bona fide purchaser rule, or unclean hands) may act as a bar to specific performance.|$|E
25|$|After intense {{lobbying}} both in Australia {{and in the}} United Kingdom, the Imperial Parliament finally {{approved the}} draft constitution, albeit with an altered section 74, which represented a compromise between the two sides: {{there would be a}} general right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council, except that the Parliament of Australia would be able to make laws restricting this avenue, and also that appeals in inter se matters (matters concerning the boundary between and limits of the powers of the Commonwealth and the powers of the states) were not <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right,</b> but had to be certified by the High Court.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review of detention differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention is issued <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right.</b> The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, while mayor, {{he wrote}} his first book, The Social Worker, which set out many of the {{principles}} that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30:In a civilised community, {{although it may be}} composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right,</b> or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right,</b> regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is off set by the fact that students are accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative or friend living in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace or similar that they live in the school zone, which makes it impossible for a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false statutory declaration is punishable by up to three years' imprisonment).|$|E
25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right,</b> unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E

500|$|At first, {{every member}} of the Commonwealth {{retained}} the same monarch as the United Kingdom, but when the Dominion of India became a republic in 1950, it would no longer share in a common monarchy. Instead, the British monarch was acknowledged as [...] "Head of the Commonwealth" [...] in all Commonwealth member states, whether they were realms or republics. The position is purely ceremonial, and is not inherited by the British monarch <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> but is vested in an individual chosen by the Commonwealth heads of government.

500|$|Lee {{insisted that}} he was not opposed to Malay special rights or Article 153, saying: [...] "if the {{immigrant}} communities ... do not see the problems, if they can't feel {{what it is like to}} be a poor Malay, and don't feel for him, then I can say very soon he will manifest his disaffection in a very decisive way and the whole country will be thrown into turmoil." [...] Few from the Alliance took this claim seriously. UMNO politicians insisted that a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia" [...] implied total equality, entailing the removal of Malay privileges. Senu Abdul Rahman, a federal Minister, felt Lee's advocacy of equality would deny the Malays the possibility of economic participation: [...] "What we want is opportunity, the opportunity to obtain economic wealth for our people." [...] Condemning Lee for stating he was a Malaysian by his own right, Senu asked: [...] "The right which Lee is enjoying today did not fall from the sky or out of the blue. It was given to him. Doesn't he have some feeling of gratitude to the natives of this country?" [...] Lee answered: [...] "No, I am not enjoying anyone's hospitality. I am here <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right.</b> And 61 per cent of the people of Malaysia have to stand by that or it is lost. Without it they would have no future." [...] Some, such as Syed Jaafar Albar, took Senu's stance further and referred to the Malays, as the Bumiputra, as [...] "masters of the house", whose hospitality was being abused by the bangsa asing (aliens) or orang tumpangan (lodgers) such as Lee. This provoked a response from Cabinet member Lim Swee Aun insisting [...] "we are co-owners, not lodgers, not guests." ...|$|E
