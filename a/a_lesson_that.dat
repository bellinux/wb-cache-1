5|$|The war also {{undermined}} French military superiority and the Napoleonic image. The Battle of Aspern-Essling was {{the first}} major defeat in Napoleon's career and was warmly greeted by much of Europe. The Austrians had also shown that strategic insight and tactical ability were no longer a French monopoly. The French themselves were actually suffering from tactical shortcomings; the decline in tactical skill of the French infantry led to increasingly heavy columns of foot soldiers eschewing all manoeuvre and relying on sheer weight of numbers to break through, a development best emphasised by MacDonald's attack at Wagram. The Grande Armée lost its qualitative edge partly because raw conscripts replaced many of the veterans of Austerlitz and Jena, eroding tactical flexibility. Additionally, Napoleon's armies were more and more composed of non-French contingents, undermining morale. Although Napoleon manoeuvred with customary brilliance, as evidenced by overturning the awful initial French position, the growing size of his armies stretched even his impressive mental faculties. The scale of warfare grew too large for even Napoleon to fully cope with, <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> would be brutally repeated during the invasion of Russia in 1812.|$|E

But before long you will get a slight ducking.|$|E

25|$|To be sure, Estimé had hastened his own demise {{in several}} ways. His {{nationalization}} of the Standard Fruit banana concession sharply reduced the firm's revenues. He alienated workers by {{requiring them to}} invest between 10 percent and 15 percent of their salaries in national-defense bonds. The president sealed his fate by attempting to manipulate the constitution in order to extend his term in office. Seizing on this action and the popular unrest it engendered, the army forced the president to resign on 10 May 1950. The same junta that had assumed power {{after the fall of}} Lescot reinstalled itself. An army escort conducted Estimé from the National Palace and into exile in Jamaica. The events of May 1946 made an impression upon the deposed minister of labor, François Duvalier. The lesson that Duvalier drew from Estimé's ouster was that the military could not be trusted. It was <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> he would act upon when he gained power.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{used the}} 1982 cult science fiction film Blade Runner {{as a source}} of {{inspiration}} for Batman Begins. He screened Blade Runner to cinematographer Wally Pfister and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film's world as [...] "an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn't appear to have any boundaries", <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> he applied to the production of Batman Begins.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{graduated}} from the Naval Academy in June 1958; he was fifth from the bottom in class rank, 894th out of 899. [...] Despite his difficulties, McCain later wrote that he never defamed the more compelling traditions of the Academy – courage, resilience, honor, and sacrifice for one's country – and he never wavered in his desire to show his father and family that he was of the same mettle as his naval forebears. Indeed, Slew and Jack McCain had not had sterling records at the Academy themselves, finishing in the bottom third and bottom twentieth respectively. McCain realized later that the Academy had taught him that [...] "to sustain my self-respect for a lifetime {{it would be necessary}} for me to have the honor of serving something greater than my self-interest", <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> he would need to carry him through a [...] "desperate and uncertain" [...] time a decade later.|$|E

500|$|Milo's {{trip through}} the lands beyond the tollbooth teaches the {{previously}} bored child to appreciate both journey and destination. This is <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> had been unlearned by the citizens of Wisdom, as exemplified by the described fate of the twin cities of Reality and Illusions. Although the city of Illusions never actually existed, Reality was lost as its residents concentrated on getting to their destination as quickly as possible, and, unappreciated, the city withered away, unnoticed by the busy people who still hasten along its former streets. Milo meets his trials by defining himself as different from the kingdom's inhabitants, who either demand or accept conformity, as enforced by the kingdom's laws, which discourage (and even outlaw) thought. Milo cannot accept such laws, beginning when, in the Doldrums, he thinks, thus violating a local ordinance and separating himself from the thoughtless inhabitants. Liston opined that because the Kingdom of Wisdom's [...] "laws require the impossible, they contradict {{what it means to}} be fully human".|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 2015, he {{was found}} guilty of being an {{accessory}} to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews. Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are trying to teach <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> if you commit such a crime, you will be punished. But I do not think the court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is too late for that kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. I would like the court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E
500|$|Since García Márquez's {{parents were}} more or less strangers to him for {{the first few years of}} his life, his {{grandparents}} influenced his early development very strongly. His grandfather, whom he called [...] "Papalelo", was a Liberal veteran of the Thousand Days War. The Colonel was considered a hero by Colombian Liberals and was highly respected. He was well known for his refusal to remain silent about the banana massacres that took place the year after García Márquez was born. The Colonel, whom García Márquez described as his [...] "umbilical cord with history and reality," [...] was also an excellent storyteller. He taught García Márquez lessons from the dictionary, took him to the circus each year, and was the first to introduce his grandson to ice—a [...] "miracle" [...] found at the United Fruit Company store. He would also occasionally tell his young grandson [...] "You can't imagine how much a dead man weighs", reminding him that there was no greater burden than to have killed a man, <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> García Márquez would later integrate into his novels.|$|E

2500|$|On 29 May, a Sudanese al-Jazeera {{cameraman}} who {{had been}} held without charge at Guantanamo Bay since 2001 issued a statement through his lawyer asking for Johnston's release.

2500|$|According to Syrian media, anti-government rebels {{initiated}} the fighting, who [...] "pounced on our comrades while sleeping {{in their homes}} and killed whomever they could kill of women and children, mutilating the bodies of the martyrs in the streets, driven, like mad dogs, by their black hatred." [...] Security forces then [...] "rose to confront these crimes" [...] and [...] "taught the murderers <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> has snuffed out their breath".|$|E

Too excited to make a [...] "kill", Gabreski learned that he had to keep calm during a mission, <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> served him well later in the war. He later spoke with great esteem about the Polish pilots and the lessons they taught him. In all, Gabreski flew 20 missions with the Poles, engaging in combat once.|$|E

2500|$|The Timbuktu {{historian}} al Sadi {{cast the}} Moroccan incursion in negative terms: [...] "The Sudan {{was one of}} God's most favored countries in prosperity and fertility {{at the time the}} expeditionary force entered the country. Now, all that has changed. Security has given place to danger, prosperity to misery and calamity. Disorder spreading and intensifying has become universal." [...] The invasion shows the transformational power of firearms in Africa where wielded by disciplined troops, often to dire effect on local peoples and polities.
