The samples were characterized by ICP-OES, N- 2 volumetry, XRD, XPS, aberration-corrected (S) TEM, CO-DRIFTS and microRaman spectroscopy. The SCS catalysts were evaluated in CO oxidation and preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in H- 2 excess, and compared to PtiCeO(2) and Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The glycine fuel yields better results than ODH in terms of Pt dispersion and catalytic performance. The fresh Cl-containing catalysts consist of PtO nanopartides poorly active in CO oxidation, while the catalysts synthesized from Pt nitrate contain highly active Pt delta+ (0 < delta < 2) species in interaction with ceria. Consistently, the most efficient catalyst for H- 2 -free CO oxidation is the one synthesized from glycine and Pt nitrate. For PROX, the selectivity to CO 2 is 100 % at low temperature and decreases {{in a similar way}} for all the Pt-CeO 2 catalysts above ca. 100 degrees C. With respect to H- 2 -free conditions, the CO PROX activity of the Pt-CeO 2 catalysts is considerably enhanced (<b>activity</b> <b>multiplied</b> by up to 60 at 110 degrees C), while the activity gairvis comparatively minor for Pt/Al 2 O 3.

Coffee is not planted by the richest farmers and the gains from higher coffee prices accrued to poorer and richer coffee farmers alike. Nor were poorer farmers hurt disproportionately when prices fell. In addition, we find strong spillovers from coffee production to other agriculture, which tends to favor the poor, and to nonagricultural <b>activities.</b> These <b>multiplier</b> effects are concentrated in coffee regions. In an economic environment characterized by a booming agricultural sector, coffee farmers were able to accommodate the negative price shock, in particular through agricultural diversification. General agricultural growth also cushioned possible negative multiplier effects in coffee regions.

40|$|Tobacco (cv. Xanthi) XD cells cultured {{for more}} than a year on urea as the sole source of {{nitrogen}} have urease activities about four times higher than cells which have been cultured on nitrate. When cells which had always been grown on nitrate were transferred to urea, the urease activity in these cells remained at a lower level for eight transfers (40 generations), then gradually increased 4 -fold during the next seven to 10 transfers. Cells with high urease <b>activity</b> <b>multiplied</b> 19 % more rapidly and accumulated less urea than cells with low urease activity. These findings suggest that elevated urease accelerates urea assimilation; therefore, urea limited growth. Clones of cells with low urease activity responded in the same way as uncloned populations when transferred from nitrate to urea, indicating that high urease cells originate from low urease cells, rather than from a preexisting subpopulation of high urease cells. The urease levels in clones of cells from a population with high urease activity were three to seven times the low urease level. The observed dependence of urease activity on generations of growth on urea was matched with a model in which high urease cells originated at mitosis of low urease cells at a frequency of 8 × 10 − 5, then multiplied 19 % more rapidly than low urease cells. This frequency is about 103 greater than that of other biochemical variants previously isolated from XD cells. The high urease activity gradually declined in cells transferred from urea to other nitrogen sources, but rose rapidly when such cells were returned to urea, indicating the existence within the cells of some form of record of their ancestors' growth on urea. The data indicate the existence of a mechanism for generation, at unusually high frequency, of metastable variants with high urease activity. This mechanism, coupled with enrichment for the variants' progeny by virtue of their higher multiplication rate on urea, can account for the observed slow increase in urease activity of the population. It is suggested that the molecular basis of the urease increase may be gene amplification, based on animal cell models. An alternative hypothesis, namely a specific response induced in all cells by urea and manifested as a very slow adaptive increase in urease, has not been ruled out...|$|R

The GLTEQ measures leisure time exercise behaviors for a typical week. Participants completed a four-item questionnaire of usual leisure-time exercise habits. As an example, a typical question regarding strenuous activity was: “Considering a 7 -day period (a week), how many times, on the average, do you do the following kinds of exercise for more than 15  min during your free time: a) strenuous exercise (hearts beats rapidly [i.e., running, jogging, football, soccer, squash, basketball, cross country skiing, judo, roller skating, vigorous long distance bicycling.])”.
