40|$|Gas phase {{pressure}} {{effects on}} the <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of a JSC- 1 A/air mixture have been experimentally investigated under steady state thermal conditions from 10 kPa to 100 kPa. The result showed that <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of the JSC- 1 A/air mixture decreased when pressure was lowered to 80 kPa. At 10 kPa, the conductivity decreased to 0. 145 W/m/degree C, which is significantly lower than 0. 196 W/m/degree C at 100 kPa. This {{finding is consistent with}} the results of previous researchers. The reduction of the <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> at low pressures is ascribed to the Knudsen effect. Since the characteristic length of the void space in bulk JSC- 1 A varies over a wide range, both the Knudsen regime and continuum regime can coexist in the pore space. The volume ratio of the two regimes varies with pressure. Thus, as gas pressure decreases, the gas volume controlled by Knudsen regime increases. Under Knudsen regime the resistance to the heat flow is higher than that in the continuum regime, resulting in the observed pressure dependency of the <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity...</b>|$|E
30|$|We ascribe the {{differences}} between measured and simulated temperatures to the inaccuracy of the numerical model. We have not included the casing of the sensor boards or the protection films in the numerical simulation, as the dimensions of those parts are at or below {{the size of the}} grid cells. They affect not only the thermal properties of the TSM but also the position of the sensors. Those parts influence the <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> and, due to their fabrication, cause displacement of the sensors from ideal cylindrical coordinates. The displacement of a sensor by 3.2  mm, which corresponds to the cell size of the model, causes a temperature change of up to 0.2  K in the numerical simulation.|$|R

Observations of pore-fluid temperature and bromide concentration were made at seven points within 3. 1 meters of a partially-penetrating injection well. Results show that temperature may be used effectively in the determination of aquifer heterogeneity and aquifer transport and thermal properties. Aquifer porosity was determined to be between 0. 35 to 0. 61. Longitudinal mass and thermal dispersivities were computed to have been between 0. 012 to 0. 124 meters, and <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> were 3. 4 to 25. 9 times greater than the bulk <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of the aquifer.

40|$|Our aim is {{to measure}} and explain the {{seasonal}} changes in soil ice content in the frost boils of Galbraith Lake, Alaska. Instruments were installed in a frost boil to monitor the ground surface position and soil state {{over a period of}} 4 years. By comparing the subsidence and thaw rates, we calculate the soil ice content as a function of depth. Measured soil temperatures, liquid water contents and bulk <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> are used to estimate latent heat production and release in the soil. The frost boil heaves during freezing and settles during thaw while the surrounding tundra heaves negligibly, but subsides measurably. Despite large changes in freezing rates from year to year, total heave and its distribution across the frost boil are similar between years. Winter air temperature and snow depth influence the freezing rate and ice distribution as a function of depth, but not the overall heave. This suggests that heave is controlled by water availability rather than the rate of heat removal from the soil. Areal ground subsidence rates between 2 and 5 cm/yr are due to the disappearance of ice {{at the base of the}} active layer, raising the possibility of ongoing thermokarst expansion around Galbraith Lake...|$|R

These measurement results are analyzed here to evaluate and eliminate the errors caused by the extrinsic thermal contact resistance. It is noted that the room-temperature thermal resistance measured in a recent work increases linearly with the suspended length of the single-layer graphene samples synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and that such a feature does not reveal the failure of Fourier’s law despite the increase in the reported <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> with length. The re-analyzed <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of a single-layer CVD graphene sample reaches about 1680 ± 180 W m− 1 [*]K− 1 at room temperature, which is close to the highest value reported for highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. In comparison, the <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> values measured for two suspended exfoliated bi-layer graphene samples are about 880 ± 60 and 730 ± 60 Wm− 1 K− 1 at room temperature, and approach that of the natural graphite source above room temperature. However, the low-temperature thermal conductivities of these suspended graphene samples are still considerably lower than the graphite values, with the peak thermal conductivities shifted to much higher temperatures. Analysis of the thermal conductivity data reveals that the low temperature behavior is dominated by phonon scattering by polymer residue instead of by the lateral boundary...|$|E

The pressure, temperature, and concentration dependences of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> have been studied. The <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> shows an almost linear dependence on pressure and concentration. Along each isobar, at a given concentration, the lsol ^ T curves show a <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> maximum at temperatures between 405 K and 420 K depending on pressure and concentration.

Gas-Filled Panels, or GFPs, are thermal insulating devices that retain {{a high concentration of}} a low- conductivity gas, at atmospheric pressure, within a multilayer infrared reflective baffle.

Calorimetric measurements have also shown total resistance levels of about R- 12. 6 h{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F/Btu for a 1. 0 -inch thick krypton panel, R- 25. 7 h{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F/Btu for a 2. 0 -inch krypton panel, and R- 18. 4 f{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F/Btu for a 10 -inch xenon panel.

40|$|Heat {{conduction}} in semiconductors and dielectrics involves cumulative {{contributions from}} phonons with different frequencies and mean free paths (MFPs). Knowing the phonon MFP distribution {{allows us to}} gain insight into the fundamental microscopic transport physics and {{has important implications for}} many energy applications. The key metric that quantifies the relative contributions of different phonon MFPs to <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> is termed <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> accumulation function. In this thesis, we advance a <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> spectroscopy technique based upon experimental observation of non-diffusive thermal transport using wire grid linear polarizer in conjunction with time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) pump-and-probe measurement setup. Consistent algorithm based on solution from the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is also developed to approximately extract the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> accumulation functions in materials studied. The heat flux suppression function appropriate for the experimental sample geometry relates the measured <b>apparent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> to the material's phonon MFP distributions. We develop a multi-dimensional thermal transport model based on the gray phonon BTE to find the suppression function relevant to our spectroscopy experiment. The simulation results reveal that the suppression function depends upon both the heater size and the heater array period. We also find that the suppression function depends significantly on the location of the temperature measurement. Residual suppression effect is observed for finite filling fractions (ratio of heater size to heater array period) due to the transport coupling in the underlying substrate induced by the neighboring heaters. Prior phonon MFP spectroscopy techniques suffer from one or several of the following limitations: (1) diffraction limited to micrometer lengthscales by focusing optics, (2) applying only to transparent materials, or (3) involving complex micro-fabrications. We explore an alternate approach here using wire grid linear polarizer in combination with TDTR measurement. The wire grid polarizer is designed with sub-wavelength gaps between neighboring heaters to prevent direct photo-excitation in the substrate while simultaneously functioning as heaters and thermometers during the measurement. The spectroscopy technique is demonstrated in crystalline silicon by studying length-dependent thermal transport across a range of lengthscales and temperatures. We utilize the calculated heat flux suppression functions and the measured size-dependent effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> to reconstruct the phonon MFPs in silicon and achieve reasonably good agreement with calculation results from first principle density function theory. Knowledge of phonon MFP distributions in thermoelectric materials will help design nanostructures to further reduce lattice <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> to achieve better thermoelectric performance in the next-generation thermoelectric devices. We apply the developed wire grid polarizer spectroscopy technique to study phonon MFP distributions in two thermoelectric materials: Nb 0. 95 Ti 0. 05 FeSb and boron-doped nanocrystalline Si 80 Ge 20 B. We find that the dominant phonon MFPs that contribute to <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> in those two materials are in the a few tens to a few hundreds of nanometers. The measurement results also shed light on why nanostructuring is an effective approach to scattering phonons and improve the thermoelectric behavior. by Lingping Zeng. Thesis: Ph.

The first {{is the development of}} smart materials with embedded vasculatures that provide multiple functionality: volumetric cooling, selfhealing, enhanced <b>apparent</b> (effective) <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity,</b> and mechanical strength. Vascularization is achieved by using tree-shaped (dendritic) flow architectures.

The second development is the distributing of energy systems over a given territory. The distribution of heating is used as an example. The architecture emerges from the balancing of the losses concentrated in the production centers and the losses distributed along the conduits that distribute and collect every thing that flows on the landscape.

The Thermal Response Test (TRT) is a {{well known}} {{experimental}} technique for assessing the behaviour of borehole heat exchangers (BHE) for Ground Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHP) applications {{which is based on}} the injection of a constant heat rate in the ground while the carrier fluid is circulated in a pilot BHE. The TRT technique is here further developed in order to cope with non constant heat injection rates, according to a new method submitted for Italian patenting. The measurements have been carried out in the Savona Campus of the University of Genova, where a high efficiency new building is going to be realized. The experimental method revealed to be able to reconstruct the ground and BHE thermal properties also when a long series of heat pulses is applied for several days, thus simulating the real operating conditions of GCHPs. The measurements revealed particularly high values of the <b>apparent</b> ground <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> as could be expected due to the particular geological configuration of the alluvial measuring site. In spite of this specific condition (groundwater presence) the method demonstrated to be reliable for inferring the ground thermal properties under heating cycles similar to those pertaining the real GCHP working mode...|$|R
40|$|Salt {{formations}} {{may be used}} as repositories {{for long}} term isolation of nuclear waste. Excavating drifts in a subsurface salt formation produces granular salt spoils, which could be used as sealing material for boreholes and drifts. In drifts, the backfilled salt would conduct heat from the waste load to the host rock salt. The efficiency of heat dissipated from the backfill will depend on the thermal properties of the backfill. The results of this study show how these thermal properties evolve with the porosity of consolidating granular salt. Thermal properties and porosity of laboratory-consolidated salt and in situ partially consolidated salt were determined. The laboratory-consolidated salt was consolidated under a range of hydrostatic stresses with temperature and moisture conditions relevant to a potential repository environment. Additional measurements were made on an intact salt crystal and dilated polycrystalline host rock salt from the WIPP facility. Thermal properties in this study were measured using a transient plane source method at temperatures ranging from 50 ˚C to 250 ˚C. Porosity and grain density were measured using a porosimeter; granular salt porosities ranged from 0. 005 to 0. 33, with an average grain density of 2. 161 g/cc. <b>Thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of granular salt was shown to be dependent on temperature as well as porosity; <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> decreased with increase in temperature and porosity. <b>Thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of dilated salt was lower than consolidated salt at comparable porosities. This is believed to be caused by the pervasive crack network present in the dilated salt which is expected to inhibit flow of heat more than the pores present in the consolidated salt. Specific heat of granular salt at lower temperatures decreased with increasing in porosity. At higher temperatures, porosity dependence was not <b>apparent.</b> The <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> and specific heat data were fit to empirical models and compared with results presented in literature. At comparable densities, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of granular salt samples consolidated hydrostatically in this study were greater than those measured previously on samples formed by quasi-static pressing. Photomicrographs of thin sections suggested that the method of consolidation influenced the nature of the porosity of the samples (e. g., crack vs. pore), and this may account for the variation of measured <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> between the two consolidation methods.
