25|$|Early {{attempts}} at <b>a</b> <b>Navajo</b> orthography {{were made in}} the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One such attempt was based on the Latin alphabet, particularly the English variety, with some Arabic letters. Anthropologists were frustrated by Navajo's having several sounds that are not found in English and lack of other sounds that are. Finally, the current Navajo orthography was developed between 1935 and 1940. The first Navajo-capable typewriter was developed in preparation for <b>a</b> <b>Navajo</b> newspaper and dictionary created in the 1940s. The advent of early computers in the 1960s necessitated special fonts to input Navajo text, and the first Navajo font was created in the 1970s. Navajo virtual keyboards were made available for iOS devices in November 2012 and Android devices in August 2013.|$|E

In October 1994, Lee confessed to, and was convicted of, sexually molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1989. It is not known if church leaders had knowledge of this crime during the excommunication process.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of friction between Americans and Navajo groups between 1846 and 1863. Manuelito and Barboncito reminded the Navajo that the Army was bringing in troops to wage war, it had flogged <b>a</b> <b>Navajo</b> messenger, and opened fire on tribal headsman Agua Chiquito, during talks for peace. They argued that the army had refused to bring in feed for their many animals at Ft. Defiance, took over the prime grazing land, and killed Manuelito's livestock that was there. On April 30, 1860, Manuelito and Barboncito with 1,000 Navajo warriors attacked the fort and almost took control.|$|E

25|$|The first Dilophosaurus {{specimens}} were {{uncovered by}} Sam Welles {{in the summer}} of 1942 in the Kayenta Formation in Arizona. The site had been found by <b>a</b> <b>Navajo,</b> Jesse Williams, in 1940. Three individuals were present but one of these was too weathered to make an excavation worthwhile. Two specimens were brought back to Berkeley for cleaning and mounting by the team of Wann Langston, the holotype UCMP 37302 (specimen on which a name is based), and a second skeleton, the paratype UCMP 37303. They were given the name Megalosaurus wetherilli in 1954 by Welles. The specific name honoured John Wetherill who had explored the area of the find.|$|E
