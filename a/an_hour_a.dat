5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> day.|$|E

A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>a</b> group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all {{former high}} {{officials}} of the Nazi regime, were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard. The prisoners were taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what became West Berlin, where they were designated by number, with Speer given Number Five. Initially, the prisoners were kept in solitary confinement for all but half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> day, and were not permitted to address each other or their guards. As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months in four that the three Western powers were in control; the four occupying powers took overall control on a monthly rotation. Speer considered himself an outcast among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at Nuremberg.|$|E

5|$|The Hunter F.1 entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>A</b> tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} diamond synthesis {{was achieved}} on February 16, 1953 in Stockholm by ASEA (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed {{a team of}} five scientists and engineers {{as part of a}} top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by Baltzar von Platen and Anders Kämpe. Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4GPa for <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>A</b> few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size. The work was not reported until the 1980s. During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in Korea, a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating trade secrets from GE via a Korean former GE employee.|$|E

After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E

5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>A</b> third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. Franchitti was fastest in the first practice session with a time of one minute and 3.0885 seconds; Dixon was second and Power third. Hélio Castroneves was fourth-fastest, ahead of Justin Wilson and Paul Tracy. Ryan Briscoe, Ryan Hunter-Reay, E. J. Viso and Takuma Sato rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was stopped twice: firstly for Milka Duno who lost control of her car and went into the turn ten tire barrier damaging her front wing, and then Bertrand Baguette spun after hitting a chicane kerb which caused to him to drive through an advertising billboard. In the second practice session, Power set the fastest time of the day with a lap of one minute and 1.6689 seconds, with his teammates Briscoe in second and Castroneves third. Franchitti recorded the fourth-quickest time; Sato was fifth and Dixon sixth. Wilson, Viso, Tracy and Tony Kanaan followed in the top ten. Three caution flags came out; Baugette crashed, Duno stalled after she spun and Tomas Scheckter slid into a tire barrier.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>A</b> third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. The first session provided limited opportunities to the drivers due to heavy rain and standing water on the course. As a result, only 11 of the 25 entrants participated in the session, of which Takuma Sato set the fastest time. Conditions improved during the second practice, and all 25 drivers set times. Will Power was quickest; marginally over a tenth of a second faster than Wilson. Ryan Briscoe, Simon Pagenaud and Tony Kanaan completed the top five, all recording times within half a second of Power. In the third practice, Scott Dixon recorded the fastest time, trailed by Power and Ryan Hunter-Reay. Briscoe and Wilson also lapped the track in under 72 seconds to finish among the five quickest drivers.|$|E

In fact, almost half of the Sub-Saharan households that according to WHO/UNICEF 'have access to improved water supply', spend more than half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> day collecting the water. Although this loss of time is mentioned in the WHO/UNICEF report, it does not affect their 'improved' vs. 'non-improved' distinction.|$|E

25|$|God-fearers are {{considered}} to be of significant importance to the popularity of the Early Christian movement. They represented a group of gentiles who shared religious ideas with Jews, to one degree or another. However, they were not converts, but a separate gentile community, engaged in Judaic religious ideas and practices. Actual conversion to Judaism would require adherence to all of the Laws of Moses, which includes various prohibitions (kashrut, circumcision, Sabbath observance etc.) which were generally unattractive to would-be gentile (largely Greek) converts. The rite of circumcision was especially unpopular in Classical civilization because it was the custom to spend <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> day or so exercising in the nude in the gymnasium and males {{did not want to be}} seen in public deprived of their foreskins.|$|E
25|$|If {{that same}} plant had no cooling tower and used {{once-through}} cooling water, {{it would require}} about 100,000 cubic metres <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>A</b> large cooling water intake typically kills millions of fish and larvae annually, as the organisms are impinged on the intake screens. A large amount of water {{would have to be}} continuously returned to the ocean, lake or river from which it was obtained and continuously re-supplied to the plant. Furthermore, discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem. Elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms (see thermal pollution), or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of zebra mussels or algae. A cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water. Evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used.|$|E

25|$|Hutton {{returned}} to England by boat; {{the rest of}} the team travelled by air. On his arrival, he was made an honorary member of the M.C.C., which changed its rules to allow a current professional to join the club. The selectors appointed him as England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, on the condition he reduced time wasting by the team. Usually, captains were appointed for one or two matches; the only other captain to be appointed for a whole summer was C. B. Fry in 1912. However, Hutton's form was uncertain at the start of the 1955 season. He captained M.C.C. against the tourists, but had to withdraw from the final day of the match with lumbago. With his health uncertain, he resigned from the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector. Hutton continued to play for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours. His last 100 runs came in <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>a</b> very fast rate of scoring, but this was his final first-class century. After the following match, his back became too painful to continue and he did not play again that season. That June, he was knighted for services to cricket. Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. At 39, he was considered at the time to be young to retire.|$|E
25|$|The semifinals of the Masters Cup, {{now in a}} {{knockout}} stage, took place on November 15, first opposing doubles Gold Group winners, ATP No. 2 Daniel Nestor (2007 champion, 1998 and 2006 runner-up) and Nenad Zimonjić (2005 finalist), undefeated in the event, to Red Group seconds Pablo Cuevas and Luis Horna (in their first year-end event appearance). The two teams had only met once before this match, in the French Open final, where the South Americans had upset the Canadian-Serbian pair, defeating them 6–2, 6–3 {{in less than an}} hour to win their first Grand Slam title. Nestor and Zimonjić eased through the Roland-Garros rematch, providing no break opportunities on their serve, but taking their opponents' four times, to score a 6–1, 6–3 victory {{in less than an hour}}-and-a-half, and qualify for their first final together. Red Group top pair and current World No. 1 Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan next faced Gold Group seconds, Erlich and Ram's substitutes Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski. The semifinal was preceded by a five-match history, with the Bryans leading the head-to-head 4–1, having played in 2004 in Acapulco (won by Bryan/Bryan), in 2007 in Madrid (won by Bryan/Bryan), and in 2008 in Barcelona (won by Bryan/Bryan), Cincinnati (won by Bryan/Bryan), and Paris (won by Fyrstenberg/Matkowski). Bob and Mike Bryan dominated the encounter, serving strongly throughout the meeting, and breaking once in each set, to clinch, after little more than <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>a</b> 6–4, 6–4 victory, and reach their third final at the year-end event after winning their two previous ones in 2003 and 2004.
