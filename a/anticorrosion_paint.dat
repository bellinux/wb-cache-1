40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} and graphene show considerable {{promise for}} composites, particularly in aerospace, {{due to their}} intriguing combination of physical properties (Figure 1). At low loadings these materials {{may be used as}} matrix modifiers, imparting electrical conductivity (e. g. for anti-static lightning strike and EM shielding applications), thermal conductivity and health monitoring. At higher loadings, these materials may act as the main structural reinforcing elements taking advantage of their high modulus (~ 1 TPa) [1]. The uptake for these materials however has been frustrated in obtaining suitable material and then formulating them into a bulk system. I will initially present our work on establishing the design rules for low dimensional carbon nanocomposites in terms of electrical, thermal and structural reinforcement and then show how these design rules can be transferred to bulk systems. Figure 1 : The potential applications of nanotubes and graphene in composites. Carbon nanotubes are excellent fillers for electrically conducting composites, where the nanotubes form a percolated network that acts as a conducting pathway to carry current through the insulating polymer matrix. The properties of these composites are found to depend significantly on the aspect ratio and processing of the carbon nanotubes, as predicted by theory. We have found that that electrical percolation can be achieved at loadings as low as 0. 0025 wt % [2] and the conductivity of such networks are high sensitive to strain as deformation pulls the networks apart, providing potential routes to health monitoring [3]. We have studied the micromechanics of graphene composites using Raman spectroscopy to map the strain in model composite systems comprising of single graphene flakes [4, 5, 6]. The graphene behavior in these systems can be modelled by conventional composite theory despite being an Structural Reinforcement c. f. carbon/glass fibre replacement Total Barrier Coating In food packing, <b>anticorrosion</b> <b>paint</b> Electrical conductivity c. f. carbon black Antistatic plastics, lightening strike protection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the here}} {{discussed}} presentation, the authors propose the applying {{of a new}} eddy current probe to non-destructive surface weld testing through the <b>anticorrosion</b> <b>painting.</b> The probe developed by the authors has a conspicuous feature of generating very little probe lift-off noise. The experimental results in the laboratory have indicated that so performed eddy current testing can pick-up longitudinal and transversal flaws in weld zones at a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. Thus the authors deem the eddy current weld inspection using the new probe as a promising replacement magnetic particles testing...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{tests have}} been {{performed}} to evaluate the corrosion-prevention capabilities of an experimental paint of the type described in Water-Borne, Silicone-Based, Primerless Paints, NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 26, No. 11 (November 2002), page 30. To recapitulate: these paints contain relatively small amounts of volatile organic solvents and were developed as substitutes for traditional <b>anticorrosion</b> <b>paints</b> that contain large amounts of such solvents. An additional desirable feature of these paints {{is that they can}} be applied without need for prior application of primers to ensure adhesion. The test specimens included panels of cold-rolled steel, stainless steel 316, and aluminum 2024 -T 3. Some panels of each of these alloys were left bare and some were coated with the experimental water-borne, silicone-based, primerless paint. In addition, some panels of aluminum 2024 -T 3 and some panels of a fourth alloy (stainless steel 304) were coated with a commercial solvent-borne paint containing aluminum and zinc flakes in a nitrile rubber matrix. In the tests, the specimens were immersed in an aerated 3. 5 -weight-percent aqueous solution of NaCl for 168 hours. At intervals of 24 hours, the specimens were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and measurements of corrosion potentials. The specimens were also observed visually. As indicated by photographs of specimens taken after the 168 -hour immersion (see figure), the experimental primerless silicone paint was effective in preventing corrosion of stainless steel 316, but failed to protect aluminum 2024 -T 3 and cold-rolled steel. The degree of failure was greater {{in the case of the}} cold-rolled steel. On the basis of visual observations, EIS, and corrosion- potential measurements, it was concluded that the commercial aluminum and zinc-filled nitrile rubber coating affords superior corrosion protection to aluminum 2024 -T 3 and is somewhat less effective in protecting stainless steel 304...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{synthesise}} anticorrosion pigments containing molybdenum for paints intended for corrosion protection of metals. Design/methodology/approach - The anticorrosion pigments were prepared by high-temperature solid-state synthesis from the appropriate oxides, carbonates and calcium metasilicate. Stoichiometric molybdates and core-shell molybdates with a non-isometric particle shape containing Ca, Sr, Zn, Mg and Fe were synthesised. The pigments were examined by X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Paints {{based on an}} epoxy resin and containing the substances at a pigment volume concentration of 10 volume per cent were prepared. The paints were subjected to physico-mechanical tests and to tests in corrosion atmospheres. The corrosion test results were compared {{to those of the}} paint with a commercial pigment, which is used in many industrial applications. Findings - The molybdate structure of each pigment prepared was elucidated. The core-shell molybdates exhibit a non-isometric particle shape. The pigments prepared were found to impart a very good anticorrosion efficiency to the <b>paints.</b> A high <b>anticorrosion</b> efficiency was found with the pigments Fe- 2 (MoO 4) (3) and Fe- 2 (MoO 4) (3) /CaSiO 3 and with Mg and Zn molybdates. Practical implications -The pigments can be used for the formulation of paints intended for the corrosion protection of metals. The pigments also improve the paints' physical properties. Originality/value - The use of the pigments in <b>anticorrosion</b> <b>paints</b> for the protection of metals is new. The benefits include the use and the procedure of synthesis of the anticorrosion pigments which are free from heavy metals and are acceptable from the aspect of environmental protection. Moreover, the core-shell molybdates, whose high efficiency is comparable to that of the stoichiometric molybdates, have lower molybdenum contents. Práce se zabývá studiem antikorozní účinnosti pigmentů s obsahem Mo, které byly testovány v organických povlacích. Laboratorně byly připraveny stechiometrické molybdenany a jádrové molybdenany vysokoteplotní syntézou v pevné fázi. Jako jádro, to znamená jako nosič vrstvy molybdenanu, byl zvolen metakřemičitan vápenatý, wollastonit. Pro studium korozně-inhibičních vlastností molybdenanů byly formulovány modelové nátěrové hmoty na bázi vodouředitelné epoxidové pryskyřice. Antikorozní účinnost připravených pigmentů byla hodnocena na základě odolnosti nátěrů ve zrychlených korozních zkouškách v atmosféře s obsahem SO 2, v atmosféře s kondenzací vodní páry a v atmosféře s obsahem 5 % neutrální mlhy NaCl. Antikorozní účinnost syntetizovaných pigmentů byla porovnávána s komerčně vyráběným pigmentem na bázi molybdenanu vápenatého.

40|$|A new alkyd <b>paint</b> <b>anticorrosion</b> smart coating was {{developed}} by using silica nanoparticles as corrosion inhibitor nanocontainers. Silica particles were mixed with the paint at different concentrations to study their performance and ensure their free transportation to the damaged metal. The filling up of silica particles was done preparing three solutions: distilled water, acetone, and a mixture of both, with Fe(NO 3) 3 and silica particles immersed {{in each of the}} solutions to adsorb the inhibitor. Acetone solution was the best alternative determined by weight gain analysis made with the inhibitor adsorbed in silica nanocontainers. Steel samples were painted with inhibitor silica nanocontainer coatings and immersed in an aqueous solution of 3 % sodium chloride. Polarization curves and electrochemical noise techniques were used to evaluate the corrosion inhibitor system behavior. Good performance was obtained in comparison with samples without inhibitor nanocontainer coating...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{titanate}} was synthesized from {{titanium dioxide}} and calcium carbonate at high temperature. The obtained pigment {{was characterized by}} means of X-ray diffraction, particle size distribution measurement, and scanning electron microscopy. The obtained pigment was further characterized {{with regard to the}} parameters required for paint formulation; its specific mass was determined along with oil consumption and critical pigment volume concentration (CPVC). The synthesized calcium titanate was used to prepare epoxy coatings with varying contents of the anticorrosion pigment. The coating was tested for physical-mechanical properties and in corrosive atmospheres. The results were compared with titanium dioxide that served as a starting material for calcium titanate preparation. Calcium titanate was prepared from materials that do not add any impurities to the anticorrosion properties of the pigment. It was identified that calcium titanate of perovskite structure is a highly efficient <b>anticorrosion</b> pigment for <b>paints...</b>|$|R
