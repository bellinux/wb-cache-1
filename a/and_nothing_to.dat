In late September he was posted to the 8th Fighter Squadron (8th FS) of the 49th Operations Group and sent to San Francisco, California. After staying at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, he and forty other {{personnel}} moved on to Fort Mason, where sailed to Hawaii along with 1,500 other soldiers. They did not stay long, however, and set sail again, this time flanked by a naval task force. After an overnight stop at Suva, Fiji, they landed at their destination of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Initially {{there was no one}} there <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do until Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, the commander of Fifth Fighter Command, organized a refresher session for the new pilots at Charters Towers Airport. In April1943, he and the P-40-equipped 8th FS relocated to Dobodura Airfield Complex in New Guinea. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to first lieutenant.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, many skulls {{evidence}} facial features or dimensions of Cro-magnon man. The latter type prevailed in Late Paleolithic times in Europe, supplanting Neanderthal man there. The Cro-magnon skull is dolichocephalic (long), the jaw prognathous (protruding), the nose flat and the supraorbital ridges (brow ridges) pronounced. Genetic analysis by {{scientists from the}} University of Ferrara (Italy) indicates that the Cro-magnons were ancestral to the current population of Europe.

25|$|While Dupont lingered at Andújar {{with two}} {{divisions}} (Generals Barbou and Fresia), attempting {{to master the}} strategic Madrid—Seville highway and the wide plains which it crossed, Castaños' four divisions advanced steadily {{from the south and}} guerrillas from Granada marched to bar the road to the sierra and La Mancha beyond. Vedel's division was posted east to Bailén with a view to guarding these nearby mountain passes and on July 1 Vedel was forced to dispatch a brigade under General Cassagne to curb the advance of the guerrillas on Jaén and La Carolina, stretching the French line still further east. Meanwhile, General Liger-Belair with 1,500 men moved into a forward post at Mengibar, a village on the south bank of the Guadalquivir. At Andújar a tower by the river was fortified and small field works constructed on the south bank to forestall an enemy crossing, but, the Guadalquivir being fordable at so many points, and open to fire from the surrounding hills, Dupont's defences did not inspire much confidence. Cassagne, after driving the guerrillas off in rout, returned to Bailén on July 5 with 200 dead or wounded <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> show for his exertion—the Spaniards having plundered the towns of all provisions.|$|E

D'Antonio stated about the cover of Alive or Just Breathing, [...] "I wanted something that looked 'old school cut-and-paste' for the cover.

500|$|The {{premise of}} Community {{was based on}} Harmon's real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his {{relationship}} with his then-girlfriend, he once enrolled in Glendale Community College, north of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together. Harmon got involved in a study group and – somewhat against his own instincts – became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. [...] "...I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them," [...] he explained, [...] "even though they {{had nothing to do with}} the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> offer them." [...] With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realised the value of connecting with other people.|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film.

[...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life.

500|$|The Ottoman army {{managed to}} advance as Vlad Ţepeş instituted {{a policy of}} {{scorched}} earth, poisoned the waters, and also created marshes by diverting the waters of small rivers. Traps were created by the digging of pits, and then covered with timber and leaves. The population and animals were evacuated to the mountains and as Mehmed advanced for seven days, his army suffered from fatigue as [...] "he found no man, nor any significant animal, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> eat or drink." [...] Vlad adopted guerrilla tactics as his cavalry made several hit-and-run attacks. He would also send ill people suffering from lethal diseases, such as leprosy, tuberculosis, syphilis — and in more significant numbers – those who suffered from the bubonic plague, to intermix with the Turks and infect them. The bubonic plague managed to spread in the Ottoman army. The Ottoman fleet launched a few minor attacks on Brăila and Chilia, but {{without being able to}} do much damage, as Vlad Ţepeş had destroyed most of the ports in Bulgaria. Chalkokondyles writes that the Sultan managed to capture a Wallachian soldier and at first tried to bribe him for information; when that didn't work, he threatened him with torture, to no avail. Mehmed was said to have commended the soldier by saying, [...] "if your master had many soldiers like yourself, in a short time he could conquer the world!" ...|$|E
500|$|Rita (Laura Elena Harring) is {{the mysterious}} and {{helpless}} apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert {{was so impressed}} with Harring that he said of her [...] "all she has to do is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55years for a Gilda remake". She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty's bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire {{to make sense of the}} film through her identity. Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is [...] "the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her". A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> use as a frame of reference for how to behave. Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of Mulholland Drive can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity. According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.|$|E
500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times Jon Pareles wrote, [...] "She's {{the woman}} with everything: the voice, the moves, the songs, the ideas and the clothes. Her two-hour set was a {{brilliant}} pop extravaganza that kept the songs at its center." [...] He further noted that Knowles didn't need distractions from her singing, [...] "which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with [...] staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a very positive review for the concert and noted that Knowles performed [...] "two fast-paced hours of terrific singing, solid musicianship, spectacular staging {{and some of the}} most imaginative choreography ever to have graced the stage of Oracle Arena." [...] Hildebrand further noted that Knowles used [...] "occasional bits of rasp to her ringing mezzo tones to emphasize key lines" [...] while performing the ballads. He wrote that every [...] "twitch, turn, slide and hip shake was in perfect sync" [...] and praised the singer's constant motion most of the time which never left her [...] "out of breath". While reviewing Knowles' concert in Bangkok, Thailand, Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised her dancing which included [...] "shaking, bouncing and belly dancing, mixed with hip-hop" [...] further comparing it with Shakira's. She further noted that the highlight of the show was when Knowles sang the slow-tempo ballads. The Courier Mails Tonya Turner praised Knowles' [...] "passionate and fiery" [...] performance accompanied by [...] "frantic booty popping and sexy R moves". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers noted that the tour was one of the [...] "modern superstar spectacles that casts the artist's reality onto the level of myth". However, she noted, that [...] "Beyoncé's 'Experience' plays off the performer's well-known struggles and triumphs to build a story that will make fans both gawk and relate. The maddening thing about this dazzling entertainment, though, is that the tale it tells is partly the wrong one." [...] She concluded the review by saying, [...] "Beyoncé is electric in concert yet reined in by her show's post-feminist theme. Why not just let it be about her musical prowess?". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Knowles' energy and powerful performance on stage, writing [...] "With her triumphant gait, statuesque figure and steely stare, the singer seemed primed not just to perform but to vanquish... Beyoncé sang with a fiery determination, stressing cries and shouts that had no use for subtlety and even less for vulnerability. She danced at an equally mad clip... hitting every mark with a vengeance... A Beyoncé show... {{has everything to do with}} power <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with nuance. It's the kind of thing meant to inspire awe, not intimacy... She sang her songs last night with the force of a rapper, stressing pieces from her two solo albums in a way that made every sound seem percussive." [...] However, Farber criticized the unsure repertoire of songs performed, writing [...] "Many of her tunes prove too skittish to sink in, and some of her rhythms are too robotic to find a groove." [...] Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter noted that the snippets of other artists that Knowles included in her own songs were refreshing and included the fast-paced Destiny's Child medley and the performances of [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights of the show.
