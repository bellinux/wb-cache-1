40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>atmospheric</b> down-welling <b>radiation</b> in studying building thermal environments and energy performance {{has been well}} identified, and empirical formulae to evaluate <b>atmospheric</b> down-welling <b>radiation</b> values developed with their inadequacies. In this paper, a study of developing an alternative general method for evaluating <b>atmospheric</b> down-welling <b>radiation</b> values to the water pond-based empirical formula by Clark and Allen is reported. The validity of the alternative general method has been demonstrated by comparing the <b>atmospheric</b> down-welling <b>radiation</b> values evaluated using the alternative general method and that using the Clark and Allen's formula. Since the alternative general method developed {{is based on a}} building roof system, and no water is involved, the alternative general method developed in this paper appears to have more advantages. On one hand, this could eliminate any potential impacts on prediction accuracy when water is used in different climates. On the other hand, the application of the alternative general method is relatively easier as only a suitable existing roof system is required. Therefore, the use of alternative general method can provide a more reliable and economic alternative in evaluating <b>atmospheric</b> down-welling <b>radiation,</b> when compared to using Clark and Allen's empirical formula. Practical application The alternative general method developed for evaluating <b>atmospheric</b> down-welling <b>radiation</b> values in this paper could be used {{as an alternative to the}} empirical formula proposed by Clark and Allen and is valid for all climate conditions and easy to be implemented to evaluate alternative general method values. It can be used when evaluating building night sky cooling, building passive cooling system, etc. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

Analyses are reinforced using GCR and SCR models, and extensive air shower descriptions based on nuclear transport simulations. First analyses {{were focused on}} neutron fluxes as function of altitude. Secondly, <b>atmospheric</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> impacts on biological doses during quiet period and extreme solar events are presented. On {{the basis of the}} relevant comparisons conducted for ambient dose equivalent during quiet solar activity, but also for the comic ray variations calculated and recorded on neutron monitor (NM) during Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) event. GLE 5 model was applied to London ↔ New-york flight dose calculations. All of these results show that dose values vary drastically, on the one hand with the route path (latitude, longitude altitude), on the other hand with the phasing of the solar event. Specific case of Antarctica is discussed because it combines both the high altitude and the very low magnetic field. Analyses show that ionizing radiation in Antarctica environment can be a problematic {{from the point of view}} of the human dose, which exerts classical recommendations established for public. This highlights the importance of monitoring <b>atmospheric</b> ionizing <b>radiation,</b> more particularly extreme solar events, then to develop semi-empirical and particle transport method for reliable calculation of dose levels...|$|R

40|$|To be {{published}} in Astroparticle Physics) There is considerable interest world-wide in developing large area atmospheric Cherenkov detectors for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy. This interest stems, in large part, {{from the fact that}} the gammaray energy region between 20 and 250 GeV is unexplored by any experiment. Atmospheric Cherenkov detectors offer a possible way to explore this region, but large photon collection areas are needed to achieve low energy thresholds. We are developing an experiment using the heliostat mirrors of a solar power plant as the primary collecting element. As part of this development, we built a detector using four heliostat mirrors, a secondary Fresnel lens, and a fast photon detection system. In November 1994, we used this detector to record <b>atmospheric</b> Cherenkov <b>radiation</b> produced by cosmic ray particles showering in the atmosphere.
