40|$|Abstract- There {{are over}} 20 million <b>subscribers</b> to {{telecommunication}} <b>services</b> in Nigeria. The telecommunication services have impacted {{the frequency and}} mode of communication of users. The Short Message Service (SMS) {{is one of the}} widely used <b>services</b> by <b>subscribers</b> due to the ability for recipients to read messages at their convenience. SMS uses computing devices such as routers and servers for delivery of messages to subscribers on a network. Not all messages sent by subscribers are delivered. An evaluation of the log files for SMS delivery indicated a high failure rate due to <b>Absent</b> <b>Subscriber.</b> This work aims to propose a solution to reduce the incidence of <b>Absent</b> <b>Subscriber</b> error. The proposed solution prevents the direct submission of the message for delivery. The proposed model was simulated using Java. The results indicate a reduction in failure rate of messages sent by subscribers...|$|R

50|$|Hotspot 2.0, {{also known}} as HS2 and Wi-Fi Certified Passpoint, is an {{approach}} to public access Wi-Fi by the Wi-Fi Alliance.

For example, to use AAPT to call a number in Tokyo, Japan, subscribers would dial 1414 0011 81 3 xxxx xxxx, or to use Optus to call a Perth they would dial 1456 08 xxxx xxxx. It is not clear if all these prefixes will actually work.|$|R
