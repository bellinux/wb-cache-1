40|$|Alienation Stories explores a Marxist theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> through {{selected}} {{works from}} three lesser known 20 th Century theorists: Franz Borkenau, Alfred Sohn-Rethel, and Kōstas Axelos.

5|$|The {{opposition}} middle szlachta movement {{came up with}} {{a constructive}} reform program during the Kraków sejm of 1538/1539.

Sigismund I's unwillingness to move toward the implementation of the reformers' goals negatively affected the country's financial and defensive capabilities.|$|E

The Theoretical part of the thesis focuses on the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> from the psychological perspective while using the categories <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as defined by Melvin Seeman. Furthermore, the thesis elaborates on the sociological perspective. The Practical part applies the types <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as identified in the Theoretical part on the two novels. The content of the novels is thus compared from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> The thesis then proceeds to the comparison of stylistic features of the novels...|$|R

5|$|Convinced {{that these}} heavy-handed tactics were {{the source of}} the <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> the native {{population}} to Soviet rule, in 1921 Moscow appointed an experienced administrator, Alexander Miasnikian, to carry out a more moderate policy and one better attuned to Armenian sensibilities. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under the Soviet rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from the central government and extensive literacy reforms were carried out. The situation was difficult for the Armenian Apostolic Church, however, which became a regular target of criticism in educational books and in the media and struggled greatly under Communism.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the arrest}} of the bishops {{has been seen as}} a turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, David Crouch, believes that {{the arrest of}} the bishops signalled the beginnings of the Anarchy, not because of any <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating the factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, Philip de Harcourt, as Chancellor.|$|E

5|$|The 1290 {{statute of}} Quo warranto {{was only one}} part of a wider {{legislative}} effort, {{which was one of the}} most important contributions of EdwardI's reign. This era of legislative action had started already at the time of the baronial reform movement; the Statute of Marlborough (1267) contained elements both of the Provisions of Oxford and the Dictum of Kenilworth. The compilation of the Hundred Rolls was followed shortly after by the issue of Westminster I (1275), which asserted the royal prerogative and outlined restrictions on liberties. In the Mortmain (1279), the issue was grants of land to the church. The first clause of WestminsterII (1285), known as De donis conditionalibus, dealt with family settlement of land, and entails. Merchants (1285) established firm rules for the recovery of debts, while Winchester (1285) dealt with peacekeeping on a local level. Quia emptores (1290)issued along with Quo warrantoset out to remedy land ownership disputes resulting from <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> land by subinfeudation. The age of the great statutes largely ended with the death of Robert Burnell in 1292.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} boom resulted in drawing {{large numbers of}} aborigines out of their villages and into the unskilled or low-skilled sector of the urban workforce. Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other communities as they all had similar political motives to protect their collective needs {{as part of the}} labor force. The aborigines became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of indigenous members from their traditional lands and the cultural <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> young people in the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fall into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have also led to an increased atmosphere of xenophobia among urban aborigines, and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} diocesan {{succession}} of Argyll is uncertain, the jurisdiction itself {{appears to have}} lain outwith the domain of Rǫgnvaldr's direct control, allowing the meic Somairle to readily act as religious patrons without his interference. Like the Kingdom of the Isles itself, the great geographic size of the Diocese of the Isles appears to {{have contributed to the}} <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> outlying areas, and to its eventual disintegration. In fact, there is reason to suspect that portions of the new diocese were likewise detached from the Scottish dioceses of Dunblane, Dunkeld, and Moray. Although the Scottish Crown may have welcomed the formation of the new diocese, as it may have formed part of a plan to project Scottish royal authority into the region, the meic Somairle rulers of the region were in fact hostile to the Scots, and the diocese's seat on Lismorealbeit first recorded in the early fourteenth centurylay far outwith the Scottish king's sphere of influence. Whatever the case, the foundation of the Diocese of Argyll {{appears to have been a}} drawn-out and gradual process that was unlikely to have been the work of one particular mansuch as Somerled, Dubgall, or Ragnall himself. Although the early diocese suffered from prolonged vacancies, as only two bishops are recorded to have occupied the see before the turn of the mid thirteenth century, over time it became firmly established in the region, allowing the meic Somairle to retain local control of ecclesiastical power and prestige.|$|E

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} concepts <b>of</b> the world, <b>alienation</b> {{is starting to}} become a more and more interesting topic, equally so to the science, art, philosophy, politics and theology. Some authors claim the alienation to be the synonym {{for the state of}} mind {{the contemporary}} man. A strong interest in the problems <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as expressed by the recent ideas is accompanied by the emergence of a great variety of interpretations of this concept. Dean Dwight assessed thirteen possible correlates <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> It is not unusual, as in the new considerations <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> many influences from the near and far tradition are present, as well as the results of the new original research and thinking. Besides, as the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> is not interesting exclusively to the philosophy, from various fields new solutions and different concepts are coming. All this makes modern discussion on alienation not only more complex, but more interesting at the same time. Starting from the fact that alienation is many-faceted phenomenon, the sociologist tried to assess its main qualifications. These efforts resulted in the well known systematization of the meanings <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> given by D. Dwight, M. Seeman, J. P. Clark and others. Contemporary sociology gives other solutions too. Especially promising is the recognition of the general characteristic of the modern concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> revealed through the comparison with the traditional concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as a whole, The traditional theory is dominated by the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> which gets the meaning {{in the context of the}} global society and the history as a whole. Alienation is meaningful primarily on the macro-level and concerns the human existence in totality. At the same time, mainly the positive aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> are stressed by the traditional approach. Contrary to such a conception <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> the modern analyses start predominantly from the micro-level approach, i. e. point oyt the individual and psychological aspects. Simultaneously, alienation acquires mostly pejorative meanings, representing deprivation, loss, disconnection, estrangement and so on. Even the interpretations of some significant traditional theories on alienation have quite another, contemporary significance in modern analyses. (Hegel’s concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as a lack of power.) In relation to the traditional one, the contemporary concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> emerges as an unique thesis, stressing mainly negative and predominantly psychological aspects of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>alienation...</b>|$|R

5|$|Douglas's {{death at}} Verneuill was {{to weaken the}} {{position}} of his son Archibald, the 5th earl. On 12 October 1424, the king and Archibald met at Melrose Abbey ostensibly to agree the appointment of John Fogo, a monk of Melrose, to the abbacy. The meeting {{may also have been}} intended as an official acceptance of Douglas but it signalled a change in the Black Douglas predominance vis-a-vis the crown and other nobles. Important Douglas allies died in France and some of their heirs realigned with rival nobles through blood ties {{while at the same time}} Douglas experienced a loosening of allegiances in the Lothians and, with the loss of his command over Edinburgh Castle, this all served to improve James's position. Even though, James continued to retain Black Douglas support allowing him to begin a campaign of political <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> Albany and his family. The king's rancor directed at Duke Murdoch had its roots in the past—Duke Robert was responsible for his brother David's death and neither Robert nor Murdoch exerted themselves in negotiating James's release and must have left the king with the suspicion that they held aspirations for the throne itself. Buchan's lands did not fall to the Albany Stewarts but were forfeited by the crown, Albany's father-in-law, Duncan, Earl of Lennox was imprisoned and in December the duke's main ally Alexander Stewart, 1st Earl of Mar, settled his differences with the king. An acrimonious sitting of parliament in March 1425 precipitated the arrest of Murdoch, Isabella, his wife, and his son Alexander—of Albany's other sons Walter was already in prison and James, his youngest, also known as James the Fat, escaped into the Lennox.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how Melvin Seeman’s theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> (1959) and modern alienation research manifest in Irvine Welsh’s “Trainspotting”. This {{is an important}} novel, {{not only because of}} its commercial success, but also because it depicts a specific marginalised subculture. Postmodernism and systems theory approaches, as well as changes in the social and political spheres have motivated researchers such as Geyer (1996), Kalekin-Fishman (1998) and Neal and Collas (2000) to reinterpret Seeman’s theory. This article attempts to incorporate this new theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in the analysis of contemporary fiction. Seeman identifies five aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> namely powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, social isolation and self-estrangement. Following Neal and Collas (2000), in particular, this article omits self-estrangement, but shows how the other four aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> have changed since Seeman’s formulation. It is argued that “Trainspotting” depicts a specific occurrence <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in modern western society, besides normlessness, meaninglessness, and social isolation, highlighting Seeman’s concept of powerlessness, in particular. The article further argues that applying Seeman’s theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in the study of contemporary literature provides a fresh theoretical approach that contributes to the understanding of how fiction engages with its environment...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{explanatory}} power and limitations of the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in educational research. Psychological studies of the phenomena associated with alienation (burnout, extrinsic motivation, cynicism, etc.) are limited by the context of individual mind, whereas the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> refers {{to a set of}} processes unfolding at both individual and sociocultural levels. The paper demonstrates the heuristic possibilities offered by the cultural-historical activity approach to meaning and meaning regulation in the analysis of alien-ation phenomena. The author reviews the findings of empirical studies <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in education, as well as existing theoretical works discussing the genesis <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> and ways to overcome it. According to these works, the ongoing growth of the body of human knowledge results in increasing alienation in the educational context, but individual activity aimed at finding the meaning of collective action and of one’s place in it may help to overcome the challenge <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> Despite being too abstract to serve as a tool for designing psychological studies, the category <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> may be useful for their interpretation, helping to integrate psychological findings into the interdisciplinary context, in order to review and improve existing educational institutions and practices...|$|R
