5|$|Scully {{is deeply}} troubled by Pfaster's crimes, and has unsettling dreams and {{hallucinations}} about the case. In Washington, {{she has a}} counseling session with a social worker, during which she shares her anxiety about the investigation. After the session, Scully learns that someone from Minnesota had called for her. When she contacts Mulder, she learns that neither he nor Bocks made the call. Tracing <b>a</b> <b>fingerprint</b> to Pfaster from his arrest, Bocks and Mulder raid his apartment, finding one of the prostitute's fingers in his refrigerator. Meanwhile, after Scully arrives in Minneapolis, Pfaster forces her car off the road. He kidnaps Scully and takes her to his late mother's abandoned house. He ties and gags Scully, and keeps her in a dark closet.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including <b>a</b> <b>fingerprint</b> examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{fingerprinting}} {{of multimedia}} data involves embedding {{information in the}} content, and offers protection to the digital rights of the content by allowing illegitimate usage of the content to be identified by authorized parties. One potential threat to fingerprints is collusion, whereby a group of adversaries combine their in&vidual copies {{in an attempt to}} remove the underlying fingerprints. Former studies indicate that collusion attacks based on a few dozen independent copies can confound <b>a</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> system that employs orthogonal modulation. However, since an adversary is more likely to collude with some users than other users, we propose <b>a</b> groupbased <b>fingerprinting</b> scheme where users likely to collude with each other are assigned correlated fingerprints. We evaluate the performance of our group-based fingerprints by studying the collusion resistance of <b>a</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> system employing Gaussian distributed fingerprints.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> {{is related}} to {{cryptographic}} hash functions. In contrast to cryptographic hash functions this robust digest is sensitive only to perceptual change.

In this paper we present <b>a</b> cumulant-based image <b>fingerprinting</b> method. Cumulants are typically used in signal processing and image processing, e. g. for blind source separation or Independent Component Analysis (ICA). From an image with reduced dimensions we calculate cumulants as an initial feature vector.

25|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} that enables fingerprints to be visualised on metallic and electrically conductive surfaces without {{the need to develop}} the prints first. This technique involves the use of an instrument called a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP), which measures the voltage, or electrical potential, at pre-set intervals over the surface of an object on which <b>a</b> <b>fingerprint</b> may have been deposited. These measurements can then be mapped to produce an image of the fingerprint. A higher resolution image can be obtained by increasing the number of points sampled, but {{at the expense of the}} time taken for the process. A sampling frequency of 20 points per mm is high enough to visualise <b>a</b> <b>fingerprint</b> in sufficient detail for identification purposes and produces a voltage map in 2–3 hours. As of 2010, this technique had been shown to work effectively on a wide range of forensically important metal surfaces including iron, steel and aluminium. While initial experiments were performed on flat surfaces, the {{technique has}} been further developed to cope with irregular or curved surfaces, such as the warped cylindrical surface of fired cartridge cases. Research during 2010 at Swansea University has found that physically removing <b>a</b> <b>fingerprint</b> from a metal surface, for example by rubbing with a tissue, does not necessarily result in the loss of all fingerprint information from that surface. The reason for this is that the differences in potential that are the basis of the visualisation are caused by the interaction of inorganic salts in the fingerprint deposit and the metal surface and begin to occur as soon as the finger comes into contact with the metal, resulting in the formation of metal-ion complexes that cannot easily be removed.|$|E

30|$|Since the QIM {{watermarking}} technique [9] and its variants [20] are {{aiming at}} {{the extraction of}} a watermark bit-sequence, the latter approach is suitable to implement. The practicality of the latter approach is, however, restricted because of the long code length. In [23], the capability of QIM for the latter approach has been explored. The results show that one variant, which is called the spread transform dither modulation (STDM), retains an advantage under the blind detection. Under the non-blind detection, which is a reasonable assumption in <b>a</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> system, {{there is still a}} performance gap with the spread spectrum method. Moreover, in [24], the traceability is further improved by combining a spread spectrum embedding like Cox's method.

40|$|Securing <b>a</b> stored <b>fingerprint</b> {{image is}} of {{paramount}} importance because <b>a</b> compromised <b>fingerprint</b> cannot be easily revoked. In this work, <b>an</b> input <b>fingerprint</b> image is mixed with another fingerprint (e. g., from a different finger), in order to produce a new mixed image that obscures the identity of the original fingerprint. Mixing <b>fingerprints</b> creates <b>a</b> new entity that looks like <b>a</b> plausible <b>fingerprint</b> and, thus, (<b>a)</b> it can be processed by conventional fingerprint algorithms and (b) an intruder {{may not be able to}} determine if a given print is mixed or not. To mix two fingerprints, each fingerprint is decomposed into two components, viz., the continuous and spiral components. After pre-aligning the two components of each fingerprint, the continuous component of one fingerprint is combined with the spiral component of the other fingerprint image in order to generate <b>a</b> mixed <b>fingerprint.</b> Experiments on the WVU and FVC 2000 datasets show that the mixed fingerprint can potentially be used for authentication and that the identity of the original fingerprint cannot be easily deduced from the mixed fingerprint. Further, the mixed fingerprint can facilitate in the generation of cancelable templates. 1...|$|R
