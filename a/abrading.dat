40|$|The {{habitability}} of Mars {{is determined}} by the physical and chemical environment. The effect of low water availability, temperature, low atmospheric pressure and strong UV radiation has been extensively studied in relation to the survival of microorganisms. In addition to these stress factors, it was recently found that silicates exposed to simulated saltation in a Mars-like atmosphere can lead to a production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we have investigated the stress effect induced by quartz and basalt <b>abraded</b> in Mars-like atmospheres by examining the survivability of the three microbial model organisms Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis, and Deinococcus radiodurans upon exposure to the <b>abraded</b> silicates. We found that <b>abraded</b> basalt that had not been in contact with oxygen after abrasion killed more than 99 % of the vegetative cells while endospores were largely unaffected. Exposure of the basalt samples to oxygen after abrasion led to a significant reduction in the stress effect. <b>Abraded</b> quartz was generally less toxic than <b>abraded</b> basalt. We suggest that the stress effect of <b>abraded</b> silicates may be caused by a production of reactive oxygen species and enhanced by transition metal ions in the basalt leading to hydroxyl radicals through Fenton-like reactions. The low survivability of the usually highly resistant D. radiodurans indicates that the effect of <b>abraded</b> silicates, as is ubiquitous on the Martian surface, would limit the habitability of Mars as well as the risk of forward contamination. Furthermore, the reactivity of <b>abraded</b> silicates could have implications for future manned missions, although the lower effect of <b>abraded</b> silicates exposed to oxygen suggests that the effects would be reduced in human habitats...|$|R
25|$|<b>Abrading</b> is {{the process}} in which surface {{deposits}} are removed using abrasives. Abrasives come in both solid and cream forms. Solid forms of abrasives include glass fiber brush or a rubber burr on a dental drill. Cream forms are usually attached to paper or film. Polishing creams are commonly used to remove thin layers of insoluble surface deposits such calcium. These creams can also remove surface dirt and marks made by tools. The best creams of ceramic do not have oil, grease, or bleach as additives and are used only on glazed ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{methods include}} dusting, picking and cutting, and <b>abrading.</b> Mechanical {{cleaning}} is typically {{much easier to}} control than chemical treatments {{and there is no}} danger of dirt being drawn into a solution and then absorbed by the ceramic. The danger of mechanical cleaning is the potential for the surface to break or become scratched with a tool. Dusting is used when dirt is not strongly adhered {{to the surface of the}} ceramic and is carried out by either a brush or a soft cloth. Large ceramic vessels are cleaned with delicate vacuum cleaner with a soft, muslin-covered head. Picking and cutting is used when there are hardened dirt, encrustations, or old restoration materials closely adheres to the surface. Needles, sharp scalpels, other custom made tools, usually made from wood, and electric vibrotools are used. The dangers with these tools are the increase potential for scratches, gouges, cracking, and breaking of the object due to pressure.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{sculpture}} is {{an ancient}} activity where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged {{in some form of}} stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe. Petroglyphs (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains in situ, by incising, pecking, carving, and <b>abrading.</b> Monumental sculpture covers large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings. Hardstone carving is the carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, sard or carnelian, and a general term for an object made in this way. Alabaster or mineral gypsum is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable. Engraved gems are small carved gems, including cameos, originally used as seal rings.|$|E

Walsh carried out a detailed examination of the skull using ultraviolet light, a high-powered light microscope, and computerized tomography. Homann took the skull to the museum again in 2008 so it could be filmed for a Smithsonian Networks documentary, Legend of the Crystal Skull and on this occasion Walsh was able to take two sets of silicone molds of surface tool marks for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The SEM micrographs revealed evidence that the crystal had been worked with a high speed, hard metal rotary tool coated with a hard abrasive such as diamond. Walsh's extensive research on artifacts from Mexico and Central America showed that pre-contact artisans carved stone by <b>abrading</b> the surface with stone or wooden tools and in later pre-Columbian times, copper tools, in combination with a variety of abrasive sands or pulverized stone. These examinations led Walsh {{to the conclusion that the}} skull was probably carved in the 1930s, and was most likely based on the British Museum skull which had been exhibited fairly continuously from 1898.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the surface of Y-TZP after abrasion with various airborne particles. METHODS: The Y-TZP blanks were cut into 44 discs and sintered according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specimens were treated as follows: (a) control specimens, (b) <b>abraded</b> with 50 μm alumina, (c) <b>abraded</b> with 110 μm alumina, (d) <b>abraded</b> with 30 μm silica-coated alumina, (e) <b>abraded</b> with 110 μm silica-coated alumina, (f) <b>abraded</b> with 110 μm alumina followed by 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles. Airborne abrasion was performed at a pressure of 2. 5 bar for 15 s/cm(2). The Y-TZP was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). RESULTS: Surface morphology of Y-TZP ceramic was changed after the airborne abrasion process compared to the control specimens. The grain boundaries disappeared and part of the airborne particles are embedded and/or rested on the ceramic surfaces. The elemental composition of the Y-TZP surface after the airborne abrasion process depended on the type and size of these particles. The concentration of Si resulted higher after the airborne abrasion process with 110 μm alumina followed by 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles in comparison to the specimens <b>abraded</b> with 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles. The ratio of elements normalized by yttrium for these specimens was: [Zr]/[Y]/[Al]/[Si]= 15. 2 / 1. 0 / 26. 0 / 73. 6, respectively. CONCLUSION: The change of grain topography occurred during each impact process. Silica nano-particles covered not only loosely the <b>abraded</b> ceramic surface after abrasion process, but the release of kinetic energy in form of thermal energy resulted in melting of the ceramic surface and in the formation of zirconium silicate...|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} anchors for slacklines are trees. Trees {{should always be}} at least , healthy, and solidly rooted.

These materials are adequate for occasional use, but with the high tension of longlines, more robust protection is needed. One of the most effective means is a wrap of vertical blocks ( [...] cut into [...] pieces) strung together by drilling a small-diameter hole through the center and running cord through them. Blocks are spaced evenly to prevent the anchor slings from contacting and <b>abrading</b> the tree's outer bark, and the length of the blocks distributes the load vertically as opposed to horizontally (which compressed a continuous line around the trunk). The addition of a carpet square between the block wrap and the outer bark is considered ideal among the founding community of slackliners.|$|E

2500|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is a popular}} and highly {{regarded}} gamefish throughout its range, with the recreational catch of the species often exceeding commercial catches. The only amateur catch data available are from the US, which has an annual catch of around 400 to 1000 tonnes per year. In Trinidad, the species {{is the basis for}} several fishing tournaments. Crevalle jack are targeted from boats, as well as from piers and rockwalls by land based anglers. Fishermen often target regions where depth suddenly changes, such as channels, holes, reefs or ledges, with strong currents and eddies favourable. The fish take both live and cut baits, as well as a variety of artificial lures; however, when the fish are in feeding mode, they rarely refuse anything they are offered. Popular baits include both live fish, such as mullet and menhaden, as well as dead or strip baits consisting of fish, squid or prawns. Crevalle jack readily accept any style of lure, including hard-bodied spoons, jigs, plugs and poppers, as well as flies and soft rubber lures. There is some evidence based on long term observations that the species favours yellow [...] lures over all others. Tackle is often kept quite light, but heavy monofilament leaders are employed to prevent the fish's teeth from <b>abrading</b> the line. Crevalle jack are generally considered quite poor table fare, with selection of younger fish and bleeding upon capture giving the best results. The flesh is very red and dark due to the red muscle of the fish, which makes it somewhat coarse and poor tasting. When pulled from the water, this fish snorts in what many people describe as [...] "a pig-like" [...] fashion. The crevalle jack has been implicated in several cases of ciguatera poisoning, although appears less likely to be a carrier than the horse-eye jack.|$|E
2500|$|This {{dramatic}} increase in prices has also led to unscrupulous sellers attempting to pass off prints from the Bohn Edition as originals, {{and it can be}} difficult for those unfamiliar with these practices {{to tell the difference between}} a restrike (commonly called [...] "a Bohn") and an original. The key indicators of a print coming from the Bohn Edition are (i) the presence of a number in the top, right-hand corner of the print (the number is most commonly in the image itself, but may be outside in the margin); (ii) the fact that the Bohn edition was issued without colouring; and (iii) the fact that the strikes for the main published volumes of the Bohn Edition were printed on both sides of the paper (the Bohn Edition of the so-called [...] "Suppressed Plates" [...] was, like the originals, printed on one side of the paper only). However, the fact that a print is single-sided does not mean that it is not a Bohn restrike: there are in existence many Bohns (for example, Light expelling Darkness) that bear a number, but which are printed on one side of the paper only. These single-sided numbered strikes are almost always printed on much higher quality paper than was used for the bound volumes, and the quality of the printing is usually much superior too, with more care having been taken to ensure a crisp impression. These impressions are believed to have been struck by Henry Bohn with a view to colouring them, and then selling them as high-quality single prints, in much the same way as the prints published in Gillray's lifetime. There are many example of such single-sided restrikes, both coloured and uncoloured. Since prices for Bohns are usually between one-tenth and one-twentieth of those for originals, unscrupulous sellers will go to great lengths to disguise the fact that a print is a Bohn. Some common methods include: (i) tortuously worded descriptions, which attempt to avoid disclosure of the fact the print is a restrike (although some sellers will just plain lie); (ii) if the number is outside the image, trimming the print to the very edges of the image; (iii) if the number is inside the image, carefully <b>abrading</b> the surface to obliterate the number; (iv) cutting strips of the image to remove the number; (v) laying the print to paper or framing it such that it is difficult to determine whether there is printing on the reverse; and (vi) adding colour.|$|E
