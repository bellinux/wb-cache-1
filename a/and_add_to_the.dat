Founded in 1316 by John Salmon, Bishop of Norwich, the chapel, in addition to its role as a chantry dedicated to the souls of Salmon's parents and the predecessors and successors of the Bishops of Norwich had also been used as a charnel house and contained the Wodehouse chantry, founded by Henry V at the request of John Wodehous, a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt. The school moved to the site in the summer of 1551, where it has remained ever since. The chapel was used as the main schoolroom while the other buildings were used to provide a library and accommodation for the master and boarding pupils. The arrangement continued until the 19th century, and today the building is used as the school chapel.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E

25|$|Swales can be {{incorporated}} in urban designs along streets or parklands <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aesthetic character of an area. Typical swales are created with longitudinal slopes between 1% and 4% {{in order to maintain}} flow capacity without creating high velocities, potential erosion of the bioretention or swale surface and safety hazard. In steeper areas check banks along swales or dense vegetation can help to distribute ﬂows evenly across swales and slow velocities. Milder-sloped swales may have issues with water-logging and stagnant ponding, in which case underdrains can be employed to alleviate problems. If the swale is to be vegetated, vegetation must be capable of withstanding design ﬂows and be of sufficient density to provide good ﬁltration). Ideally, vegetation height should be above treatment ﬂow water levels. If runoff enters directly into a swale, perpendicular to the main ﬂow direction, the edge of the swale acts as a buffer and provides pre-treatment for the water entering the swale.|$|E
25|$|Long {{aluminium}} beadings on {{the sides}} were painted cream, a visual device to make the locomotive's high sides appear more slender <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> impression of speed. Three curved chevrons on each nose, in the same cream, added to that effect. To British eyes, the locomotive's styling was reminiscent of American locomotives, such as the EMD E-unit or ALCO PA designs (partly because English Electric initially planned to offer the type for export), with high noses and small, somewhat swept-back cab windows set behind them. To add to the American look of the locomotive, a large headlight {{was to have been}} fitted to each nose (the lights were never installed but would have been of the rotating 'Mars Light' type as fitted to North American locomotives of the era). Two 18-cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, derated from the 1,750 horsepower (1.3 MW) of the marine engines in minesweepers to 1,650 horsepower (1.2 MW) each, generating 3,300 horsepower (2.5 MW) total. This derating reduced the stress on the engines, thereby increasing the service life and length of time between overhauls.|$|E
25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E

500|$|Retro {{decided to}} make the game more {{challenging}} than Metroid Prime—which was supposed to familiarize players with the control scheme—and felt that [...] "with the second Prime, we had the ability or the freedom" [...] to do so. They wanted Echoes to be focused towards a hardcore audience by making the player [...] "always worried about his health", so more mini-bosses were added to provide unique boss fights. After the game's release, the developers admitted that it was more difficult to develop than they first imagined, and Michael Kelbaugh, Retro Studios' president, commented: [...] "We wanted to expand <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> title, and not just slam out a sequel. Nintendo doesn't do things that way." [...] Retro tried to include some extras, such as a hidden version of Super Metroid, but were halted by the short development time. Producer Kensuke Tanabe later revealed that the game was just about thirty percent complete three months before the strict deadline Nintendo had set for a release in the 2004 holiday season.|$|E

Reeves added that [...] "The parasites have a voracious, rabid, bounding nature, but they also have a crab-like crawl. They have the viciousness of a dog, but with the ability to climb walls and stick to objects." [...] The top half of the parasite's head is the mandible. The top and lower jaws end in serrated edges and have four pairs of eyes each. The rest of the parasite consists of a crustacean-like carapace, several pairs of claws, and arms. A deep blue-purple muscular membrane stretches between the top and lower jaws. When a human is bitten, the victim becomes ill and bleeds profusely, mainly from the eyes, and shortly after this, the torso expands and explodes. They are called HSPs (Human Scale Parasites) on the Blu-ray Special Investigation Mode.|$|E
2500|$|The pregame show {{currently}} {{performed by}} Auburn's band {{was first introduced}} in 2004, and incorporates elements from previous pregame shows. [...] During {{the first year of}} the new pregame, it was featured several times on ESPN and called [...] "The most entertaining band performance yet." [...] The band enters from the team tunnel underneath the south end zone and performs the pregame fanfare, before marching down the field to War Eagle. [...] Then the band forms the interlocking AU emblem to perform Glory. [...] The band will then form an USA set with an American [...] "shield" [...] in the bottom of the S to perform God Bless America and the Star Spangled Banner before continuing on to perform The Horse, Tiger Rag, and some school spirit tunes. Often the end of the National Anthem will incorporate a flyover. On some occasions, the band will also play the Alma Mater between God Bless America and the National Anthem. At the end of pregame the band forms an interlocking AU tunnel through which the football team enters the field. In 2006, the band began to start its pregame performances with a trailer of the band on the video screen, now the AU HD (as of 2007), to warm up the crowds <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> excitement of the performance.|$|E
2500|$|John Barton's {{adaptation}} would {{divide the}} plays up {{in a new}} way. The first play (Henry VI) featured a shortened version of 1 Henry VI and roughly half of 2 Henry VI (up {{to the death of}} Cardinal Beaufort). The second play (Edward IV) featured the second half of 2 Henry VI and a shortened version of 3 Henry VI. This was followed by a shortened version of Richard III as the third play. In all, 1,450 lines written by Barton were added to roughly 6,000 lines of original Shakespearean material, with a total of 12,350 lines removed. Barton defended the controversial decision to cut from <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> text {{on the grounds that the}} Henry VI plays [...] "are not viable as they stand," [...] arguing they needed to be adapted [...] "in the interests of audience accessibility." [...] As an example of the alterations, in the original text, the character of the Duke of Exeter appears only in 1 Henry VI, whereas in The Wars of the Roses, he appears throughout all three plays, as a constant ally of Henry VI and the House of Lancaster. Numerous characters were also removed, such as Warwick's father, the Earl of Salisbury, a major character in 2 Henry VI, and some of the battle scenes were amalgamated to cut down on stage combat (such as the First Battle of St Albans and the Battle of Wakefield, which take place in 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI, respectively).|$|E

Dubbed [...] "America's Best Mayor" [...] at the time by several national magazine stories, Mayor Schaefer was hailed for transforming a deteriorating city into a hub of national tourism, although the groundwork and the original vision for the Inner Harbor project in the early 1960s to succeed the previous Charles Center downtown renewal of 1958–1970 had first been foreseen and crafted two mayoral administrations earlier under progressive/liberal Republican mayor and former governor of Maryland Theodore R. McKeldin (1900–1974, served 1943–1947 and 1963–1967), who was eventually recognized by having the redeveloped plaza facing the new [...] "festival marketplaces" [...] at Pratt, Light and Calvert Streets renamed for him.
