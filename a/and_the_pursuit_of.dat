5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1863, the XII Corps was {{transferred}} to the West to reinforce the Union forces besieged at Chattanooga. At the Battle of Wauhatchie, during a surprise night attack by the Confederate forces, Greene was wounded in the face, with his jaw crushed and some teeth carried away. Subsequent surgery was not able to correct his condition and he suffered from the effects of his wound {{for the rest of his}} life. After six weeks of medical leave, he was assigned to light court-martial duty until January 1865, when he was sent to join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army in North Carolina. Initially Greene voluntarily served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox participating in the battle at Kinston, where he had his horse shot out from under him. At the very end of the war Greene was in command of the 3rd Brigade in Absalom Baird's 3rd Division, XIV Corps, and participated in the capture of Raleigh <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army until its surrender.|$|E

25|$|Like the New Testament writers, Morgan {{recognized}} that departing from {{the worship of}} God alone is frequently associated with sexual immorality: “’Tis the homage of the man who, losing his God, worships at the shrine of a fallen Venus.” He references Philippians 3:18-19 to support that gluttony <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> physical pleasure are also widespread, but not new, examples of idolatry.|$|E
25|$|Confucianism expounds a {{theology}} of incarnation which sees humanity, the human being itself (仁 rén), as the incarnation of the God of Heaven.

25|$|As a businessman, Scrooge often {{resorts to}} {{aggressive}} tactics and deception. He {{seems to have}} gained significant experience in manipulating people and events towards his own ends. As often seen in stories by writer Guido Martina and occasionally by others, Scrooge is noted for his cynicism, especially towards ideals of morality {{when it comes to}} business <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> set goals. This has been noted by some as not being part of Barks's original profile of the character, but has since come to be accepted as one valid interpretation of Scrooge's way of thinking.|$|E
