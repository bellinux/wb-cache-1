5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E

25|$|Standards of play {{can vary}} from semi-professional to {{occasional}} recreational level.

25|$|A Carnatic {{composition}} {{really has}} two elements, one being the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is {{probably because of}} this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected {{to understand what was}} conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.|$|E

500|$|Mathijs and Sexton {{state that}} genre is an {{important}} part of cult films; cult films will often mix, mock, or exaggerate the tropes associated with traditional genres. [...] Science fiction, fantasy, and horror are known for their large and dedicated cult followings; as science fiction films become more popular, fans emphasize non-mainstream and less commercial aspects of it. B films, which are often conflated with exploitation, <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> to cult films as exploitation. [...] Teodor Reljic of Malta Today states that cult B films are a realistic goal for Malta's burgeoning film industry. [...] Genre films, B films that strictly adhere to genre limitations, can appeal to cult film fans: given their transgressive excesses, horror films are likely to become to cult films; films like Galaxy Quest (1999) highlight the importance of cult followings and fandom to science fiction; and authentic martial arts skills in Hong Kong action films can drive them to become cult favorites. [...] Cult musicals can range from the traditional, such as Singin' in the Rain (1952), which appeal to cult audiences through nostalgia, camp, and spectacle, to the more non-traditional, such as Cry-Baby (1990), which parodies musicals, and Rocky Horror, which uses a rock soundtrack. [...] Romantic fairy tale The Princess Bride (1987) failed to attract audiences in its original release, as the studio did not know how to market it. [...] The freedom and excitement associated with cars can be an important part of drawing cult film fans to genre films, and they can signify action and danger with more ambiguity than a gun. [...] Ad Week writes that cult B films, when released on home video, market themselves and need only enough advertising to raise curiosity or nostalgia.|$|E
