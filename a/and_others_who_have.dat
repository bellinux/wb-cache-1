25|$|Alongside the {{arguments}} introduced by Daniel Dubuisson, criticism of Mircea Eliade's political involvement with antisemitism and fascism came from Adriana Berger, Leon Volovici, Alexandra Lagniel-Lavastine, Florin Țurcanu <b>and</b> <b>others,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> attempted to trace Eliade's antisemitism throughout {{his work and}} through his associations with contemporary antisemites, such as the Italian fascist occultist Julius Evola. Volovici, for example, is critical of Eliade {{not only because of}} his support for the Iron Guard, but also for spreading antisemitism and anti-Masonry in 1930s Romania. In 1991, exiled novelist Norman Manea published an essay firmly condemning Eliade's attachment to the Iron Guard.|$|E
25|$|MRC {{released}} a report in 2007 claiming that the network morning shows devoted more airtime to covering Democratic presidential candidates than Republican ones for the 2008 election. Producers for such shows criticized the MRC's methodology as flawed. During the 2008 US presidential election, MRC {{released a}} report that claimed {{that the vast majority}} of news stories about Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama had a positive slant. MRC president Bozell praised MSNBC for having David Gregory replace Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann as political coverage anchor beginning September 8, 2008, but MSNBC president Phil Griffin disputed the statements by Bozell <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> accused the network of liberal bias.|$|E
25|$|Several {{organizations}} {{of family members}} {{of people who have}} died in the attacks are calling for an independent investigation into the attacks. In 2009, a group of people, including 9/11 Truth movement activist Lorie Van Auken <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> lost friends or relatives in the attack, appealed to the City of New York to investigate the disaster. The New York City Coalition for Accountability Now collected signatures to require the New York City Council to place the creation of an investigating commission on the November 2009 election ballot. The group collected more than enough signatures to put the proposal before the voters, but New York Supreme Court Justice Edward Lehner stated that the petition overstepped what is allowable by city law, and ruled that, despite wording in the petition to allow for elements ruled invalid to be stricken, it {{would not be allowed to}} appear on the ballot.|$|E

25|$|Although {{considered}} a liberal institution by some, various {{human and animal}} rights groups have protested the research conducted at Berkeley. Native American groups contend that the university's dismantling of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology's repatriation unit demonstrates unwillingness {{to comply with the}} Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, while Berkeley officials say the museum's reorganization complies with the law and will involve all museum staff in the repatriation process. Animal-rights activists have taken to committing various acts of vandalism and intimidation against faculty members whose research involves the use of animals. Additionally, the university's response to a group of tree sitters protesting {{the construction of a new}} athletic center has galvanized some members of the local community, including the city council, against the university. Plans to renovate Memorial Stadium in a way that would eliminate a view of the field from the surrounding hills also have encountered opposition from alumni <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> regularly watched Cal football games for free.|$|E

The category for on-ice officials was added in 1961 and a [...] "veteran player" [...] category was established in 1988. The purpose of the category was to [...] "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players". Eleven players were inducted into that category, but in 2000, the Board of Directors eliminated it; the players who had been inducted under this category were merged into the player category.|$|E

500|$|The {{gynecologist}} William Masters, the sexologist Virginia E. Johnson and {{the physician}} Robert C. Kolodny wrote that Sexual Preference {{is an important}} study of homosexuality, [...] "probably the most extensive one done to date", and that it provided no support for Bieber's theory of homosexuality. Weeks referred to Sexual Preference as [...] "the Kinsey Institute's final publication on homosexuality" [...] and suggested that like sociobiologists <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> attempted to find a biological explanation for social behavior Bell et al. had an [...] "urge to fill a conceptual gap" [...] that is stronger than their [...] "adherence to theoretical consistency and political judgment". Weeks wrote that while Bell et al. [...] "carefully explore the evidence (or lack of it) for the aetiology of homosexuality", they, unlike Kinsey, failed {{to consider the possibility}} [...] "that homosexuality might not be a unitary phenomenon with a single causative explanation". Weeks criticized Bell et al. for concluding that if a social or psychological explanation of homosexuality cannot be found then a biological explanation must exist, deeming the argument [...] "a rhetorical device" [...] that results in [...] "an intellectual closure which obstructs further questioning." [...] The sociologists Frederick L. Whitam and Robin Mathy, writing in Male Homosexuality in Four Societies (1985), criticized Bell et al. for reporting mainly on their white subjects, generally ignoring the blacks.|$|E
