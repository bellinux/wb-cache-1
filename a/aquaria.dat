5|$|Live coral {{is highly}} sought after for <b>aquaria.</b> Soft corals {{are easier to}} {{maintain}} in captivity than hard corals.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} Dall's {{porpoises}} {{have been kept}} in captivity in both the United States and Japan. However, these animals consistently failed to thrive. Captive P. dalli repeatedly ran into the walls of their enclosures, refused food, and exhibited skin sloughing. All Dall's porpoises introduced to <b>aquaria</b> died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The European Association of Zoos and <b>Aquaria</b> asked Drusillas Park in Alfriston, Sussex, England to {{keep the}} {{studbook}} for capybaras, to monitor captive populations in Europe. The studbook includes information about all births, deaths and movements of capybaras, {{as well as how}} they are related.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aquaria</b> was {{developed}} by Derek Yu and Alec Holowka {{over the course of}} two years, off of a concept that Holowka had thought of a year prior. Yu was the lead artist, and Holowka handled the programming and audio components. Both designers had previously worked in video games; Yu had made several freeware games, including I'm O.K with Holowka and others, while Holowka had worked for several video game start-ups, none of which had ever gotten a game published. Some additional work on the game, including some level design and scripting for some enemies, was done by Brandon McCartin. Holowka and Yu officially formed the studio Bit Blot to back the game a week before submitting it to the 2007 Independent Games Festival. The name of the studio is intended to represent a fusion of art and technology. <b>Aquaria</b> is the studio's only game. Both members of the team continue to make video games, but are not doing so as a partnership; Holowka went on to form a separate team called Infinite Ammo, and Yu went back to working on freeware games and various ports of Spelunky.|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1976, 50 {{killer whales}} from the Pacific Northwest were {{captured}} for display in <b>aquaria,</b> and {{public interest in}} the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led {{to the discovery of}} the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.|$|E
5|$|Fish are an {{important}} resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public <b>aquaria.</b> Fish have {{had a role in}} culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef <b>aquaria.</b> It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light. It {{can be difficult to}} control because it grows fast and spreads over other objects in the tank.|$|E
5|$|Nauticus, the National Maritime Center, {{opened on}} the {{downtown}} waterfront in 1994. It features hands-on exhibits, interactive theaters, <b>aquaria,</b> digital high-definition films and an extensive variety of educational programs. Since 2000, Nauticus has been home to the battleship USS Wisconsin, the last battleship {{to be built in}} the United States. It served briefly in World War II and later in the Korean and Gulf Wars.|$|E
5|$|The killer whale's intelligence, trainability, {{striking}} appearance, playfulness {{in captivity}} and sheer size {{have made it}} a popular exhibit at <b>aquaria</b> and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales {{were taken from the}} wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been bred outside Antarctica at SeaWorld San Diego; more than 20 {{individuals}} have hatched there since 1980. Considered a flagship species, 55 individuals were counted in captivity in North American zoos and <b>aquaria</b> in 1999. The first emperor penguin was hatched at Laohutan Ocean Park in Dalian in northeastern China in August 2010. In Japan, {{the species is}} housed at Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium and Wakayama Adventure World, with successful hatching in the latter place.|$|E
5|$|Both parents remain {{involved}} in guarding the fry from brood predators {{and engage in}} behaviors to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin digging (digging up the substrate with their fins). Brood care of eggs, larvae and free-swimming juveniles in the wild can last 4 to 6 weeks, and occurs only once per season {{for the majority of}} females. In contrast, females in <b>aquaria</b> are known to breed many times per year with short intervals of 12 or 13 days between broods, as long as suitable rocks or similar surfaces are available for them to lay their eggs on.|$|E
5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many <b>aquaria,</b> generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo was {{the first}} zoo {{in the world to}} house and to breed penguins. It is also the only zoo in Britain to house koalas and giant pandas. The zoo {{is a member of the}} British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA), the European Association of Zoos and <b>Aquaria</b> (EAZA), the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), and the Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions. It has also been granted four stars by the Scottish Tourism Board. The zoo gardens boast one of the most diverse tree {{collections}} in the Lothians.|$|E
5|$|Encounters with tawny nurse sharks {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers {{are able to}} approach the sharks closely and even touch and play with them without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, and extremely powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public <b>aquaria</b> in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef <b>aquaria,</b> sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|The Creator, after {{creating}} <b>Aquaria,</b> {{created a}} series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The Creator kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the Creator to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure {{at the beginning of}} the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the Creator, and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that she would find out the history of <b>Aquaria</b> on her own and defeat the Creator. In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E
5|$|The game follows Naija, a mermaid-like woman, as she {{explores the}} {{underwater}} world of <b>Aquaria.</b> Along her journey, she learns {{about both the}} history of the world and her own past. The gameplay focuses on a combination of swimming, singing and combat, through which Naija can interact with the world. Naija's songs can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms. These forms have different abilities, such as firing projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural form.|$|E
5|$|A global {{strategy}} {{to stem the}} crisis was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and <b>aquaria</b> around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aquaria</b> is a 2D sidescrolling action-adventure game, heavily {{focused on}} {{exploration}} and puzzle-solving, with non-linear gameplay. The player controls Naija, a lone underwater dweller; although {{similar to a}} human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, {{such as the ability}} to breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for personal computers, was designed to be primarily controlled solely through the mouse, though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija, reducing her health meter, by touching her or firing projectiles at her.|$|E
5|$|Docile and slow-moving, zebra {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public <b>aquaria</b> around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.|$|E
5|$|While timid and {{innocuous}} towards humans, the bluespotted ribbontail ray {{is capable}} of inflicting an excruciating wound with its venomous tail spines. Its attractive appearance and relatively small size has resulted in its being the most common stingray found in the home aquarium trade. However, it seldom fares well in captivity and very few hobbyists are able to maintain one for long. Many specimens refuse to feed in the aquarium, and even seemingly healthy individuals often inexplicably die or stop feeding. A higher degree of success has been achieved by public aquariums and a breeding project is maintained by the European Association of Zoos and <b>Aquaria</b> (for example, a total of 15 pups were born at Lisbon Oceanarium from 2011 to 2013). The bluespotted ribbontail ray is utilized as food in East Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia; it is captured intentionally or incidentally using gillnets, longlines, spears, and fence traps.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} nocturnal and {{spend most of}} the day resting {{motionless}} on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public <b>aquaria.</b> The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of inarticulates swim as {{plankton}} {{for months}} and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a pedicle that coils in the mantle cavity, and a small lophophore, which is used for both feeding and swimming—except that Craniids have no pedicle. As the shell becomes heavier, the juvenile sinks {{to the bottom and}} becomes a sessile adult. The larvae of articulate species live only on yolk, and remain among the plankton for only a few days. This type of larva has a ciliated frontmost lobe that becomes the body and lophophore, a rear lobe that becomes the pedicle, and a mantle like a skirt, with the hem towards the rear. On metamorphosing into an adult, the pedicle attaches to a surface, the front lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls up over the front lobe and starts to secrete the shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and the animals often lose weight in winter. These variations in growth often form growth lines in the shells. Members of some genera have survived for a year in <b>aquaria</b> without food.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s, after which time {{a large number}} of wild-caught birds entered the Australian market. Since then, it has become more common, but is still rarely seen outside Australia. Captive yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health. There is some evidence that protein may be more important to them than to other cockatoos, and low protein has been linked with the production of yolkless eggs in captivity. Females in particular enjoy mealworms. They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots, but do not handle disturbance while breeding. As with other black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos, since Australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959, but birds seized by government agencies in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the European Association of Zoos and <b>Aquaria</b> (EAZA). In 2000, there were pairs of yellow-tailed black cockatoos in Puerto de la Cruz zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam. Like most species of parrots, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
25|$|Aquarium {{filters are}} {{critical}} components of both freshwater and marine <b>aquaria.</b> Aquarium filters remove physical and soluble chemical waste products from <b>aquaria,</b> simplifying maintenance. Furthermore, aquarium filters {{are necessary to}} support life as <b>aquaria</b> are relatively small, closed volumes of water compared to the natural environment of most fish.|$|E
25|$|From {{the outdoor}} ponds and glass jars of antiquity, modern <b>aquaria</b> have {{evolved into a}} wide range of {{specialized}} systems. Individual <b>aquaria</b> can vary in size from a small bowl large enough for only a single small fish, to the huge public <b>aquaria</b> that can simulate entire marine ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|An aquarist owns fish or {{maintains}} an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic. Cuboid <b>aquaria</b> are {{also known as}} fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped <b>aquaria</b> are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl to immense public <b>aquaria.</b> Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.|$|E
25|$|They are fragile fish, {{and because}} of their {{adaptation}} to schooling behaviour they are rarely displayed in <b>aquaria.</b> Even with the best facilities <b>aquaria</b> can offer they become sluggish compared to their quivering energy in wild schools.|$|E
25|$|Pet stores market zeolites {{for use as}} filter {{additives}} in <b>aquaria.</b> In <b>aquaria,</b> zeolites {{can be used to}} adsorb ammonia {{and other}} nitrogenous compounds. However, due to the high affinity of some zeolites for calcium, they may be less effective in hard water and may deplete calcium. Zeolite filtration is used in some marine <b>aquaria</b> to keep nutrient concentrations low for the benefit of corals adapted to nutrient-depleted waters.|$|E
25|$|Ecotype, ecotope, or biotope <b>aquaria</b> {{is another}} type based on species selection. In it, an aquarist {{attempts}} to simulate a specific natural ecosystem, assembling fish, invertebrate species, plants, decorations and water conditions all found in that ecosystem. These biotope <b>aquaria</b> {{are the most}} sophisticated hobby aquaria; public <b>aquaria</b> use this approach whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing in the wild. It typically serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.|$|E
25|$|In {{freshwater}} <b>aquaria,</b> {{color temperature}} is generally of concern only for producing a more attractive display. Lights {{tend to be}} designed to produce an attractive spectrum, sometimes with secondary attention paid to keeping the plants in the <b>aquaria</b> alive.|$|E
25|$|Most public {{aquarium}} facilities {{feature a}} number of smaller <b>aquaria,</b> as well those too large for home aquarists. The largest tanks hold {{millions of gallons of}} water and can house large species, including sharks or beluga whales. Dolphinaria are specifically for dolphins. Aquatic and semiaquatic animals, including otters and penguins, may also be kept by public <b>aquaria.</b> Public <b>aquaria</b> may also be included in larger establishments such as a marine mammal park or a marine park.|$|E
25|$|Glass <b>aquaria</b> {{have been}} a popular choice for many home and {{hobbyist}} aquarists for many years. Once silicone sealant became strong enough to ensure a long-term water-tight seal, it eliminated {{the need for a}} structural frame. In addition to lower cost, glass <b>aquaria</b> are more scratch resistant than acrylic. Although the price {{is one of the main}} considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of <b>aquaria</b> to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.|$|E
25|$|Large <b>aquaria</b> might instead use {{stronger}} {{materials such}} as fiberglass-reinforced plastics. However, this material is not transparent. Reinforced concrete is used for <b>aquaria</b> where weight and space are not factors. Concrete must be coated with a waterproof layer to prevent the water from breaking down the concrete, as well as preventing contamination of the water by the concrete.|$|E
25|$|Another {{material}} used {{in building}} <b>aquaria</b> is plywood. The {{reason for this}} is many reasons including saving money, less weight, and better insulation. A popular thing to do with plywood <b>aquaria</b> is keeping them in a wall where the use of plywood hides the inside of the walls along with this putting insulation behind the plywood helps with tanks that need heating.|$|E
25|$|Some home sewage {{treatment}} systems use biological treatment, usually beds {{of plants and}} <b>aquaria,</b> that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free reclaimed water {{can be used to}} flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and <b>aquaria</b> need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large aquarium.|$|E
