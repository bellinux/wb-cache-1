5|$|Dante's {{rewriting}} of the Lucanian scene 'recuperates' {{the witch}} Erichtho by making her {{necessary to the}} Dantean Virgil's status as guide: she thus functions in <b>accord</b> <b>with</b> the Christian providence that controls the advancement of the Commedias plot line. At the same time, the Lucanian Erichtho is both marginalized and subordinated to a higher power. In this sense, Dante's rewriting of Erichtho also undoes Lucan's subversion of the original Virgilian model.|$|E

5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make aluk <b>accord</b> <b>with</b> the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E

Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to <b>accord</b> <b>with</b> all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in <b>accord</b> <b>with</b> previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E

As a result of the Internal Settlement, elections were held in April 1979, concluding with the United African National Council (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the Rhodesian Security Forces, civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites. On 12 June, the United States Senate voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.|$|E

Continuing strikes were observed the following four days.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also {{is possible}} that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this {{would be consistent with}} his baptism in 597, which is in <b>accord</b> <b>with</b> the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in <b>accord</b> <b>with</b> nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E

After this, in 551, 400Gepids were sent to fight in Narses' army, which was sent to Italy—a modest army compared to the 5,500Lombards sent by Audoin and the thousands of Heruli.|$|E
