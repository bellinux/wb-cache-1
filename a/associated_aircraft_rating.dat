The current occupant of the building, Force Control, operates a multipurpose machine shop. At the request of the US Department of Energy (DOE), a team from Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducted an independent radiological verification survey at the former <b>Associate</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Tool and Manufacturing Company Site, Fairfield, Ohio.

25|$|When {{an engine}} on a multi-engine {{aircraft}} fails, the thrust distribution on the aircraft becomes asymmetrical, {{resulting in a}} yawing moment {{in the direction of}} the failed engine. A sideslip develops, causing the total drag of the aircraft to increase considerably, resulting in a drop in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>rate</b> of climb. The rudder, and to a certain extent the ailerons via the use of bank angle, are the only aerodynamic controls available to the pilot to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{formula for}} DR is Distance = Speed x Time. An {{aircraft}} flying at 250 knots airspeed for 2 hours has flown 500 nautical miles through the air. The wind triangle {{is used to}} calculate the effects of wind on heading and airspeed to obtain a magnetic heading to steer and the speed over the ground (groundspeed). Printed tables, formulae, or an E6B flight computer are used to calculate the effects of air density on <b>aircraft</b> <b>rate</b> of climb, rate of fuel burn, and airspeed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its closure, the site was actively marketed for economic redevelopment by city officials. They were rewarded by the selection in 1978 of the ex-Turner AFB/NAS Albany site by the Miller Brewing Company, which built an extensive brewery operation at the location. However, the caveat imposed by the Miller Brewing Company was that all aviation operations must cease and relocate. With the new Miller brewery to {{be located in the}} center of the existing runway, subsequent construction almost completely obliterated any trace of the former 12,050-foot runway and <b>associated</b> <b>aircraft</b> ramp facilities.|$|R

When the Second World War broke out, Fairchild undertook a massive expansion of their factory to over 600,000 sq ft (55,000 sq m) by 1944.
