5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive for more than a year. After a gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young <b>are</b> <b>born,</b> which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. Widespread and common, it is of no conservation concern.|$|E
5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits <b>are</b> <b>born,</b> the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young <b>are</b> <b>born</b> in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E

5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species <b>are</b> <b>born</b> than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected.
