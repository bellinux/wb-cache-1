2500|$|In the {{experimental}} setup, X-rays are {{released from the}} particle beam by an undulator; a high-resolution monochromator produces a beam with small energy dispersion (typically 1.0 meV). The sample is irradiated with photons chosen around the resonance of the Mössbauer isotope and further information is provided for the specific isotope. Typical parameters for {{the experimental}} scan are –20 meV below recoil-free resonance energy to +100 meV above it. The number of scans (often recorded for 5 seconds every 0.2 meV) depends {{on the amount of}} Mössbauer-active nuclei in the sample. [...] The number of photons absorbed by the sample at any wavelength are measured by detecting the fluorescence emitted from the excited atom with an <b>avalanche</b> <b>photodiode</b> detector. The resulting raw spectrum contains a high-intensity resonance at corresponds to the nuclear excited state of the probed nucleus. [...] For bulk samples, the technique detects natural abundance 57Fe. [...] For many dilute or biological samples, the sample is often enriched in 57Fe.|$|E
2500|$|The typical FCS setup {{consists}} of a laser line (wavelengths ranging typically from 405–633nm (cw), and from 690–1100nm (pulsed)), which is reflected into a microscope objective by a dichroic mirror. The laser beam is focused in the sample, which contains fluorescent particles (molecules) in such high dilution, {{that only a few}} are within the focal spot (usually 1–100 molecules in one fL). When the particles cross the focal volume, they fluoresce. This light is collected by the same objective and, because it is red-shifted with respect to the excitation light it passes the dichroic mirror reaching a detector, typically a photomultiplier tube, an <b>avalanche</b> <b>photodiode</b> detector or a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector. [...] The resulting electronic signal can be stored either directly as an intensity versus time trace to be analyzed at a later point, or computed to generate the autocorrelation directly (which requires special acquisition cards). The FCS curve by itself only represents a time-spectrum. Conclusions on physical phenomena have to be extracted from there with appropriate models. The parameters of interest are found after fitting the autocorrelation curve to modeled functional forms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{generalized}} history-dependent recurrence {{theory for}} the time-response analysis is derived for <b>avalanche</b> <b>photodiodes</b> with multilayer, heterojunction multiplication regions. The heterojunction multiplication region considered {{consists of two}} layers: a high-bandgap AlH TGaH RAs energy-buildup layer, which serves to heat up the primary electrons, and a GaAs layer, which serves as the primary avalanching layer. The model is used to optimize the gain–bandwidth product (GBP) by appropriate selection of {{the width of the}} energy-buildup layer for a given width of the avalanching layer. The enhanced GBP is a direct consequence of the heating of primary electrons in the energy-buildup layer, which results in a reduced first dead space for the carriers that are injected into the avalanche-active GaAs layer. This effect is akin to the initial-energy effect previously shown to enhance the excess-noise factor characteristics in thin <b>avalanche</b> <b>photodiodes</b> (APDs). Calculations show that the GBP optimization is insensitive to the operational gain and the optimized APD also minimizes the excess-noise factor.
