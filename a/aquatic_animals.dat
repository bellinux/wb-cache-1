40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} aquaculture, at present, is undoubtedly recognized. The sector {{is expected to}} effectively contribute to food security, nutritional well-being, poverty reduction and economic development. However, biosecurity lapses and transboundary <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> diseases pose significant constraints to aquaculture sustainability. This paper discusses how aquaculture development brings new chal-lenges to <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> health. These challenges include compliance to international treaties, practical implementation of regional guidelines and national strategies, in-creasing biosecurity and biosecurity awareness at all levels, empowering farmers to manage disease and other risks through better management practices, and conduct-ing targeted research that will support biosecurity assessments. A short brief on emerg-ing and re-emerging issues such as chemical usage, climate change and disease ecol-ogy, fish welfare and fish health, fish-vet cooperation and certification scheme for <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> health service providers is included.

5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Grebes {{are small}} to medium-large diving birds with lobed toes and pointed bills. They are seen mainly on lowland waterbodies and coasts.

5|$|Swimming animals {{including}} fish such as herrings, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all {{converged on the}} same streamlined shape. The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> is an adaptation {{to enable them to}} travel at high speed in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{almost entirely}} on carrion. It will eat roadkill or the carcass of any animal, but is also known to hunt for food, especially small <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> in marshes. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. The lesser yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once the meat {{is in a state of}} extreme decay, as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E

5|$|In {{traditional}} medicinal texts, Platyhelminthes {{are divided}} into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated. Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter. Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts. The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs. Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.|$|E
5|$|Most {{crustaceans}} are free-living <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> {{but some}} are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. Rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) and some are sessile (e.g. barnacles). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian, and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns. Krill and copepods are not as widely fished, but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet, and form {{a vital part of}} the food chain. The scientific study of crustaceans is known as carcinology (alternatively, malacostracology, crustaceology or crustalogy), and a scientist who works in carcinology is a carcinologist.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{as long as}} {{the rapid}} {{development}} of aquaculture, the occurrence of <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> diseases increase year by year, which restrict the sustained, steady, and healthy development of aquaculture. So the rapid diagnosis of <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> disease is particularly important for their prevention and control. In the present work, an Android-based <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> disease diagnostic system has been developed in order to provide more convenient and effective <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> disease diagnostic services to ordinary farmers. The designed system includes the part of the man-machine interface (user interface, expert interface), inference engine, the case base, knowledge base and so on. Interactive interface is a visual display interface. Inference engine was written in the Java programming language. Case base and knowledge base were created using SQLite. The results show that ordinary farmers can easily use this system to realize the convenient, fast, and accurate access to the findings of disease diagnosis and prevention measures as well as aquaculture expert can add, delete, modify, view the case base and knowledge base at any time...|$|R

5|$|The {{habitats}} in {{and around}} the Nemegt rivers where Deinocheirus lived provided a home for a wide array of organisms. Occasional mollusc fossils are found, as well as a variety of other <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> like fish and turtles. Nemegt crocodylomorphs included several species of Shamosuchus. Mammal fossils are rare in the Nemegt Formation, but many birds have been found, including the enantiornithine Gurilynia, the hesperornithiform Judinornis, as well as Teviornis, a possible Anseriform. Herbivorous dinosaurs of the Nemegt Formation include ankylosaurids such as Tarchia, the pachycephalosaurian Prenocephale, large hadrosaurids such as Saurolophus and Barsboldia, and sauropods such as Nemegtosaurus, and Opisthocoelicaudia. Predatory theropods that may have lived alongside Deinocheirus include tyrannosauroids such as Tarbosaurus, Alioramus, and Bagaraatan, and troodontids such as Borogovia, Tochisaurus, and Saurornithoides. Theropod groups with both omnivorous and herbivorous members include therizinosaurs, such as Therizinosaurus, oviraptorosaurians, such as Elmisaurus, Nemegtomaia, and Rinchenia, and other ornithomimosaurians, such as Anserimimus and Gallimimus.|$|E
5|$|At the time, hadrosaurids {{were thought}} to have been <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> and KrÃ¤usel made a point of stating that the {{specimen}} did not rule out hadrosaurids eating water plants. The discovery of possible gut contents made little impact in English-speaking circles, except for another brief mention of the aquatic-terrestrial dichotomy, until it was brought up by John Ostrom in the course of an article reassessing the old interpretation of hadrosaurids as water-bound. Instead of trying to adapt the discovery to the aquatic model, he used it as a line of evidence that hadrosaurids were terrestrial herbivores. While his interpretation of hadrosaurids as terrestrial animals has been generally accepted, the Senckenberg plant fossils remain equivocal. Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that they may actually represent the gut contents of a starving animal, instead of a typical diet. Other authors have noted that because the plant fossils were removed from their original context in the specimen and were heavily prepared, it is no longer possible to follow up on the original work, leaving open the possibility that the plants were washed-in debris.|$|E
5|$|Occasional mollusk fossils are found, {{as well as}} {{a variety}} of other <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> like fish and turtles. Crocodilians {{included}} several species of Shamosuchus, a genus with teeth adapted for crushing shells. Mammal fossils are exceedingly rare in the Nemegt Formation, but many birds have been found, including the enantiornithine Gurilynia and the hesperornithiform Judinornis, as well as Teviornis, an early representative of the still-existing Anseriformes (waterfowl). Scientists have described many dinosaurs from the Nemegt Formation, including the ankylosaurid Saichania, and pachycephalosaur Prenocephale. By far the largest predator known from the formation, adult Tarbosaurus most likely preyed upon large hadrosaurs such as Saurolophus and Barsboldia, or sauropods such as Nemegtosaurus, and Opisthocoelicaudia. Adults would have received little competition from small theropods such as the small tyrannosaurid Alioramus, troodontids (Borogovia, Tochisaurus, Zanabazar), oviraptorosaurs (Elmisaurus, Nemegtomaia, Rinchenia) or Bagaraatan, sometimes considered a basal tyrannosauroid. Other theropods, like the gigantic Therizinosaurus, might have been herbivorous, and ornithomimosaurs such as Anserimimus, Gallimimus, and gigantic Deinocheirus might have been omnivores that only took small prey and were therefore no competition for Tarbosaurus. However, as in other large tyrannosaurids as well as modern Komodo dragons, juveniles and subadult Tarbosaurus would have filled niches between the massive adults and these smaller theropods.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertebrate}} fauna of {{the region}} includes 24 species of mammals, 87 species of birds, nine species of reptiles and eight species of amphibians. The ] disappeared from {{the region in the}} 1940s at the latest. At present, the largest and the most commonly seen mammal is the sambar deer. Some research findings estimate the population of sambar deer to be around 1500 to 2000, possibly more than the carrying capacity of the plains. Other mammal species found in the park include Kelaart's long-clawed shrews, toque macaques, purple-faced langurs, rusty-spotted cat, Sri Lankan leopards, wild boars, stripe-necked mongooses, Sri Lankan spotted chevrotains, Indian muntjacs, and grizzled giant squirrels. Fishing cats and European otters visit the wetlands of the park to prey on <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals.</b> A subspecies of red slender loris, the Horton Plains slender loris (Loris tardigradus nycticeboides formerly sometimes considered as Loris lydekkerianus nycticeboides) is found only in highlands of Sri Lanka and {{is considered one of the}} world's most endangered primates.

5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E
