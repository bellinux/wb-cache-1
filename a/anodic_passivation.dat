Scope of this paper includes analysis of the impedance spectra based on Bode plot. Findings: Prolongation time of <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> to 60 minutes caused formation of a two – layer model consisting of an inner layer which is compact and the barrier type, and outer layer which is porousResearch limitations/implications: Obtained results are the basis for the optimization of <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> pareameters of the Ti alloys as a metallic biomaterial. The future research should be focused on selected more suitable parameters of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test to better describe process on the solid/ liquid interface.

During <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> followed by cathodic reduction, the roughness increases with dissolution of nickel, being indicated by gradual decrease of reflectance. However, the ellipsometric parameters, Ψ (arctan of relative amplitude ratio) and Δ (relative retardation of phase), are relatively insensitive to the roughness increase. From the change of Ψ and Δ, δΨ and δΔ, during the <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> and reduction, thickness of the passive oxide film was estimated with assumption of refractive index of nf = 2. 3 of the film. The thickness estimated is a range between 1. 4 and 1. 7 nm in the passive potential region from 0. 8 to 1. 4 V vs. RHE, having a tendency of thickening with increase of potential. Cathodic reduction at constant potential induces a change of the oxide film to an oxide film with lower refractive index of nf = 1. 7, accompanied by thickening of the film about 30 % more in the initial stage of reduction for 30 s. The gradual decrease of thickness takes place for the oxide with the lower refractive index in the latter stage.

40|$|The <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> of Fe {{has been}} {{investigated}} in borate buffer, sulfate, and perchlorate solutions. In sulfate and perchlorate solutions of either pH 3. 0 or 8. 4, the passivation process is highly inefficient with very large amounts of anodic charge passing before a Substantial decrease in current is observed. In these solutions, passivation appears to be associ-ated with precipitation of a salt film and/or changes in the solution pH near the surface which permits {{the formation of a}} passive oxide. The efficiency for potential-step passivation cannot be significantly increased by changing the concentra-tion of the supporting electrolyte, the pH of the solution from 3. 0 to 8. 4, or the potential of anodization. However, the addi-tion of < 5 % pH 8. 4 borate buffer to the neutral sulfate or perchlorate solutions results in a dramatic increase in the effi-ciency, with the <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> charge decreasing by as much as two orders of magnitude. Similar trends are observed in pH 8. 4 Na 2 SO 4 solutions with previously passivated Fe electrodes which were cathodically reduced to different extents prior to anodization. The more of the prior film that remains on the surface before the anodic potential step in sulfate, the more efficient is the passivation process. The marked similarity of these results suggests that the beneficial action of bor-ate towards Fe passivation is due to its ability to assist {{in the formation of the}} surface oxide film. While the pH buffering capacity of the borate can be playing a role, it is possible that borate buffer contains strongly interacting anions which give it an inhibiting capability.

Gallium phosphide however has been studied insufficiently. As regards anodic etching of gallium phosphide there are almost no literature data, and it is not known whether gallium phosphide can be subjected to anodic etching. The passage of current through the electrochemical cell is accompanied by cathodic and anodic electrode reactions on the electrode. The following processes can take place on the anode: dissolution, formation of the phase film, anodic dissolution through the film, total <b>passivation.</b> <b>Anodic</b> dissolution can take place if the products of the anodic reaction are simple ions easily transferred into the electrolyte. The dissolution of the anode is inhibited and then interrupted, if the products of the anodic reaction are low-solubility oxides. The process of anodic dissolution of gallium phosphide is thermodynamically possible, because the electrode potentials of gallium and phosphorus are lower than the potentials of the molecules of water and OH - ions present in the electrolyte. The possibility of this dissolution could be predicted by the handbook diagrams published in Ref. 4, the diagrams of the Me-H_ 2 _O state at different pH values of the medium and the anode potential. However they are not available for gallium phosphide and, consequently, the possibility of anodic dissolution of the gallium phosphide can be evaluated only by experiments, by examining the polarisation characteristics, i. e. the relationship between the potential of the electrode and the intensity of anodic current-from the presence of areas on the polarisation curves with the logarithmic (Tafel) dependence, corresponding to the region of active dissolution of the electrode.

Distinct peaks in the potential region of 0. 7 to 0. 85 V have been observed in the voltammograms, the magnitude of which depend on the chloride concentration and, particularly, the pH in the range 1 to 3. Three peaks are observed at low chloride concentrations that merge into one peak at higher concentrations. The anodic reactivity increases with increasing pH but shows a complex dependence on the chloride concentration while in the presence of added copper(II) ions, the mixed potential shifts to more positive potentials and only one peak is observed. Hysteresis between the forward and backward-going sweeps has confirmed the transient nature of the processes except at potentials below about 0. 75 V in which region the system approaches steady-state behaviour.

The requirements for high specific energy, high specific power, and low cost make zinc an attractive negative electrode material for aqueous alkaline bat-teries in electric vehicular applications (1).

In the present study we focus on the related pro-cesses of <b>anodic</b> dissolution and <b>passivation.</b> Rapid discharge of the zinc electrode is associated largely with the high solubility of Zn(II) as a zincate ion (14, 15) in alkaline solutions.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the anisotropy in the surface chemistry of silicon in aqueous KOH solutions. Two main reactions are considered: chemical etching, and electrochemical oxidation and passivation. Anisotropic etching of masked (100) surfaces was used to form V-grooves exposing well-defined (111) facets. With this geometry it was possible to study both the chemical and electrochemical reactions at the (100) and (111) surfaces of the same material, simultaneously (chapter 2). The most striking result is perhaps the very strong anisotropy observed in electrochemical oxidation. The general features of these results could be accounted for by a previously proposed two-step mechanism, in which Si - H surface bonds are converted to Si - OH by an OH- catalyzed reaction and the polarized Si - Si back-bonds are subsequently attacked by water. Anodic current is due to injection of electrons into the conduction band from activated intermediates of the two chemical reactions. This concerted chemical-electrochemical mechanism accounts for the remarkably slow kinetics of anodic oxidation of n-type (111) surfaces. In chapter 3 it is shown that FTIR spectroscopy can be used very effectively to follow in situ the surface chemistry of silicon during anisotropic etching, <b>anodic</b> oxidation and <b>passivation,</b> and etch-back of the passivating oxide. While the first of the two chemical steps described above is generally considered to be rate determining for the chemical and electrochemical processes, the IR measurements show that oxide formation on ideally flat n-type (111) surfaces at room temperature is slow even though there is a considerable Si - OH coverage of the surface. The combination of potential-step and FTIR measurements is particularly effective for such studies. Anodic current transients measured after a potential step on well-defined n-type (111) electrodes can be used to obtain information about the chemical reactivity of the surface. In chapter 4 the effect of additives (hydrogen peroxide and isopropyl alcohol) on the kinetics of surface reactions is described. An electrochemical flow cell in combination with an optical microscope was designed to study in situ changes in morphology of silicon during chemical etching and electrochemical oxidation (chapter 5). The power of this approach was demonstrated by a study in real time of the evolution of the typical roof-tile morphology on Si(110) surfaces. A simple image-processing procedure was developed to quantify the changes in morphological structures. This approach, in combination with ex situ microscopic observation, gives a wealth of information about the relation between etch morphology and parameters such as KOH concentration, applied electrochemical potential and the presence of additives (H 2 O 2). Chapter 6 shows how the V-groove geometry can be employed to measure in situ chemical etch rates, using either electrochemical measurements or in situ optical microscopy. These approaches applied to a test wafer could be used for process control in the batch fabrication of devices. Another very interesting extension of the electrochemical approach is the possibility of following in situ the change in geometry of anisotropically etched deep trenches and buried structures in wafers...|$|R

Under dynamic situations, corrosion product growth is discussed for a variety of current densities, and a model is developed considering hydrodynamic and diffusion boundary layer effects on electric al double layer stability. Conditions leading to the formation of various corrosion product types are defined and their development with time is followed. The effects of various velocities, current densities, and current-time products on the development of ZnO platelet networks, ribbonlike corrosion products, and <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> layers are analyzed in static and dynamic environments and models for the sequential observations are developed. A model controlled by current density is offered for static conditions at low and moderate current densities, leading to either non-passivating network layers or compact passivating layers depending on the conditions. A corrosion product growth/removal cycle is hypothesized for very-high current density/high velocity situations which does not lead to zinc anode passivation. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

The use of {{intrinsically}} conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PAni) {{has been}} presented as an alternative protective coating against corrosion, it intensifies the effect of <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> and protection of the material.

It was also shown that the experimentally observed anodic peak was not the usually obtained <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> peak, {{as is the case}} with a number of metal, but an artifact due to the anodic oxidation of hydrogen absorbed during the previously employed cathodic polarization and hydrogen evolution, intended to activate the initially passive surface, or even hydrogen absorbed on the open circuit potential. It was shown that this potential establishes and electrochemical corrosion potential of the Wagner–Traud type due to the evolution of cathodic hydrogen on a passivated steel surface and anodic metal dissolution through the passive layer. It was impossible to activate 304 stainless steel in sulfuric acid of pH 1 by cathodic polarization, and the usually observed anodic peak obtained under these conditions should not be considered as an active metal dissolution process and a passivation anodic peak, but rather as an artifact due to the electrochemical oxidation of the in the steel absorbed hydrogen...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is {{investigations}} a dependence between {{the parameters of the}} electrochemical treatment of austenitic steel and their electrochemical behavior in Tyrod solution. Design/methodology/approach: Specimens (rode 30 mm × ø 1 mm) were to give in to the surface treatment – mechanically polishing, electrolytic polishing and passivation with various parameter. Electrochemical investigations concerning the corrosion resistance of austenitic steel samples were carried out by means of the potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method. Findings: The analysis of the obtained results leads to the conclusion that chemical passivation affects also the chemical composition of the passive layer of steel and changes its resistance to corrosion. Electrolytic polishing improves corrosion resistance, as can be proved by the shift {{of the value of the}} corrosion potential and break-down potential of the passive layer and the initiation of pittings. Research limitations/implications: The obtained results are the basis for the optimization of <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> parameters of the austenitic steel as a metallic biomaterial. The future research should be focused on selected more suitable parameters of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test to better describe process on the solid/ liquid interface. Practical implications: In result of the presented investigations it has been found that the best corrosion resistance can be achieved thanks to the application of electrolytic polishing of the steel in a special bath and chemical passivation in nitric (V) acid with an addition of chromic (VI) acid temperature t = 60 °C for one hour. Originality/value: The enormous demand for metal implants has given rise to a search for cheap materials with a good biotolerance and resistance to corrosion.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between engineering materials and their environment which {{give rise to}} stress corrosion cracking are reviewed and industrial examples from the petrochemical industry are described. In one of the examples, cracking took place in carbon steel exposed to pressurised gas containing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water. The crack morphology in this system was studied by metallography of samples from industrial gas processing plants and the crack growth rates were determined using precracked specimens. Constant extension rate tests, U-bend specimens and potentiodynamic studies were used to evaluate alternative materials and inhibitor additions in CO-C 02 -H 20 environments. Electrochemical noise was accessed as a technique to monitor sec on line. It {{was found that the}} CO-C 02 -H 20 system was characterised by a time dependent adsorption of carbon monoxide at anodic and cathodic sites. The adsorption produced a critical balance between crack tip corrosion rate and the repassivation process comparable to the behaviour at the active-passive transition zone in more conventional systems. The <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> exhibited a breakdown potential near to - 400 mV (Ag/ AgCI) that defined the zone of sec susceptibility. Inhibition by CO and hence sec was virtually independent of CO partial pressure provided there was a sufficient reservoir of CO. The addition of commercial film forming inhibitors did not greatly influence the system and sec was still observed in CO-C 02 -H 20 environments to which inhibitors had been added. Steels containing alloy additions of more than 9 % chromium were found to be resistant to sec but austenitic-ferritic weld joints cracked. A low alloy 3 % nickel steel performed well in the constant extension rate tests but was not wholly resistant to sec. The morphology of stress corrosion cracks in CO-C 02 -H 20 mixtures was influenced by carbon monoxide partial pressure. More corrosion was observed on the crack walls at low carbon monoxide partial pressure and widened cracks resembling •mesa• corrosion were common. This increased corrosion was probably due to difficulty in maintaining passivity in the crevice formed by the growing crack. Similarly, crevicing in precracked specimens appeared to inhibit sec and no crack extension was observed. Electrochemical noise proved to be a useful tool for monitoring.

40|$|Improvements in the Hall-Héroult {{process for}} {{electrowinning}} of aluminium have drastically reduced the anode effect duration, frequency {{and its associated}} perfluorocarbon (PFC) evolution, especially over the past 50 years. Not too long ago it was desirable {{to have at least}} one anode effect (AE) per cell day to be sure no sludge had formed under the metal pad, however, with the advent of modern process control this became unnecessary and the frequency is today less than 0. 1 AE per cell day for modern cells. With improved process control and better analysis equipment PFCs were also found be evolved outside of the traditional AE phenomena, and at normal electrolysis potentials. Albeit small in magnitude, the cumulative emissions could be substantial. To be able to visualise the phenomena in the laboratory a system with more than one anode was created. It was found that low cell-voltage PFC evolution is not specific to any cell size or technology, but can develop {{all the way from the}} large industrial cell with 40 plus anodes and down to the smallest laboratory cell with a single anode. The probability and recurrence are, however, very much related to cell properties such as the number of parallel anodes and electrolyte/alumina mixing. With a smaller cell there is less room for redistribution of current between the parallel segments without an abrupt increase in voltage, and at the extremity of one anode, redistribution can only occur by introducing a current gradient within that segment. Similarly, sheer cell size and electrolyte mixing may further enhance such a redistribution of current. With a lower possibility of redistribution it is less likely with small bursts of PFC from one or a few anodes, and the cell will instead enter the conventional anode effect accompanied by high voltage. The initiation of the low cell-voltage anode effect looks to develop in the same manner as that of the conventional anode effect with the aforementioned properties of the cell dictating if it will be a passing evolution of PFC, or if it will propagate into a full conventional anode effect. <b>Anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> potential was found to increase with alumina content in the electrolyte. PFC was in some cases found to be evolved before full passivation, and at the earliest from 2. 8 V against the aluminium pseudo-reference electrode. With the increased electrolyte convection observed on a purely vertical sample PFC was not observed until the potential reached 5. 2 V. The incipience potential of PFC is in all likelihood somewhat lower as it has been identified that some PFC gets decomposed by the electrolyte, temperature and surrounding materials. This is arguably also why PFC is often not detected until the transition to full passivation develops. Wetting of graphite under different polarisation regimes were investigated by the immersion/emersion technique. The results show the graphite/electrolyte wetting to improve with polarisation potential, even well past the potential where PFCs could thermodynamically be produced. De-wetting was observed only upon passivation. De-wetting is thus arguably not the cause of an anode effect, although it helps to maintain passivation by making less anode area available for reaction...|$|E
40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringIn {{secondary}} {{system of}} pressurized water reactors (PWRs), carbon steel undergoes severe corrosion owing to high temperature and pressure, and fast flow velocity. These circumstance, named as flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC), induces corrosion and eventually failure of power piping. Flow velocity brings about destruction of oxide layer by electrochemical corrosion and mechanical shear stress at the oxide/water interfaces. The piping {{system in the}} secondary circuit of PWRs mainly consists of carbon steels being vulnerable to FAC because Fe, main element of carbon steel, forms Fe 3 O 4 dissolved to secondary water system by changing to Fe ion. To mitigate corrosion of carbon steel, chemical and mechanical treatments to carbon steel or changing secondary water chemistry has been widely studied. Addition of Cr and/or Mo to carbon steel components {{is one of the}} adequate countermeasure to mitigate FAC by <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation.</b> Mechanical treatments are controlling surface roughness because reducing surface roughness can decrease flow turbulence at the oxide/water interface. Increasing pH, dissolved oxygen contents, and addition of advanced corrosion inhibitor to secondary system can decrease corrosion rate of carbon steels. However, maintaining homogeneous chemistry condition of water is hardly possible and changing chemical composition of carbon steel needs not only research of corrosion properties but also other mechanical properties. In contrast, application of coatings to the steel surface can be easily applied to the secondary system. Therefore, thermal spray to steel surface using less corrosive metal is widely used. Among them, cold spray has advantage with lower process temperature than that of other spray coatings which leads to low residual stress and oxidation or decarburization of coating. In this study, tungsten carbide (WC) and nickel (Ni) particles are used as feedstock materials for the coating. WC exhibits high corrosion resistance in acidic aqueous media due to the phase stability. Moreover, the oxidation resistance of WC in O 2 containing atmosphere at high temperature is applied to industry which is exposed to severe corrosive environments However, in alkaline solution, the dissolution of WC increases by forming WO 4 -. Moreover, high melting temperature and poor plastic deformation make cold spray coating difficult. To suppress the corrosion of and increase the deposition efficiency of the coating, Ni, which has better plastic deformation and lower corrosion potential and melting temperature than WC, is used as a binder metal. Ni acts like a sacrificial metal to WC so corrosion and oxidation of Ni occur before those of WC. To evaluate the potential of the coating as an effective corrosion barrier, series of corrosion tests at simulated secondary water chemistry is carried out and quantitative analysis is conducted. Surface and cross-section morphologies of the coatings before and after FAC simulation tests is investigated by scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron microscopy. Electrochemical experiments are carried out for quantitative analysis. Cold spray coatings using WC- 10 Ni with different Ni contents have rough and porous surface but significant changes of surface is not observed by SEM image. However, lower current density is measured at 25 Ni coating than carbon steel, P 22, 20 Ni and 30 Ni coating from potentiodynamic polarization experiments in pH 9. 3 ETA solution at room temperature. After 2 weeks FAC experiments, weight loss of coating is increased with increases Ni contents in coating but weight of 20 Ni coating is increased. On the other hands, weight loss occurs at 20 Ni and 30 Ni coating and weight of 25 Ni coating is increased after 4 weeks FAC experiments. Although weight change of coatings is smaller than carbon steel after 2 weeks and 4 weeks FAC experiments, weight change of 25 Ni coating shows better corrosion performance than P 22 comparing with 20 Ni and 30 Ni coating. As a result, Ni has lower corrosion potential than WC and it induces galvanic corrosion of Ni and prevents WC corrosion or oxidation at early stage of corrosion process. Moreover, oxidation product of Ni, Ni(OH) 2 is dissolved into water by Ni ion because of poor thermal stability of Ni(OH) ¬ 2. Therefore, high Ni contents in coating increases weight loss during the early stages by Ni(OH) 2 dissolution. However, after 4 weeks of immersion, WC oxidizes and transforms into WO 3 increasingly which is influenced by Ni contents. 30 Ni coating induces continuous weight loss during FAC simulation because of low WC contents which means weight gain by WO 3 formation is smaller than weight loss by Ni(OH) 2 dissolution. Therefore, weight loss occurs at 30 Ni coating. Contrarily, 20 Ni coating do not protect WC dissolution after 2 weeks because the absence of Ni and Ni(OH) 2. accelerates WC oxidation and WO 3 dissolution to water. To be concluded, WC- 10 Ni + 25 Ni coating specimens exhibit the best corrosion resistive performance, the lower corrosion current density and the small weight change than other coatings. Therefore, WC- 10 Ni + 25 Ni coating is possibly suggested to one of the option to mitigate corrosion of carbon steels. ope...|$|E
40|$|Texturing {{of silicon}} wafers is an {{important}} process step in fabrication of solar cells {{in order to reduce}} the reflection of incoming light radiation on the solar cell surfaces. The conventional wet chemical etching methods have clear limitations in etching and texturing of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers. Chemical etching of mc-Si wafers in alkaline solutions results in a coarse and non uniform surface morphology since the dissolution rate depends on the grain orientation. In contrast to alkaline etching, textures formed by acidic etchants (HF+HNO 3) are uniform. However, acidic etching is difficult to control, the disposal of the waste is expensive and the method is in general environmentally hazardous. The aim of this thesis is to study an environmentally friendly etching method, which is supposed to be an alternative to acidic texturing of both single and multicrystalline B-doped silicon wafers. The method is based on anodic polarization of Si in alkaline solutions. In spite of the fact that silicon is one of the most studied elements due to its applicability in electronic devices, its electrochemistry in alkaline solutions at increased temperatures and at high potentials has been scarcely investigated. In the first part of the thesis monocrystalline (100) and (111) silicon samples were polarized in a strong alkaline solution at different temperatures and potentials in order to study <b>anodic</b> <b>passivation</b> mechanism. In the second part single- and multicrystalline Si-wafers were textured by utilizing electrochemical treatment in hot alkaline solutions. Anodic dissolution and passivation of Si (100) and Si (111) were studied by potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarizations in 2 M KOH at temperatures ranging from 23 oC to 70 oC and at potentials from the open circuit potential (OCP) to 14. 5 V (with respect to Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Potentiostatic polarization experiments were performed on as-received (mechanically sawed or polished) and pre-etched (at OCP in the alkaline test solution) samples. The composition and thickness of the reaction products formed on the surfaces were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of the surfaces was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The oxide products formed during passivation was analyzed after polarization to the Flade potential at about 1 V. A thin (about 1 nm) homogeneous layer of Sioxyhydroxide (H 2 SiO 3) is formed at this potential. It is formed on both crystal orientations independent of temperature. The hydrated silica layer is gradually transformed into the stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 by polarizing Si (100) above the Flade potential at 23 oC or 30 oC. The phase change is indicated by an oxidation peak at around 4 V during potentiodynamic polarizations. Further, XPS analysis shows that both hydrated and dehydrated silica coexist at this potential. The oxide thickness formed during potentiodynamic polarization to 14. 5 V is 22 nm. Oxygen evolution is observed at about 4 V. At higher potentials the oxygen evolution is inhibited due to growth of thick oxide. The stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 forms and grows with increasing potential and exposure time on Si (111) at all temperatures irrespective of pre-etching. The thicknesses of the oxide are in the range 3 nm to 40 nm depending on the polarization method, potential and exposure time. The formation and growth of SiO 2 on Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures depends on surface pre-etching. Polarization of pre-etched Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures does not form SiO 2 on the surface. The compound present after polarization at all potentials was the thin, 1 nm thick hydrated silica layer. It was formed irrespectively of the polarization method or potential. Thus, pre-etching {{is an important}} parameter in the oxidation mechanism of Si (100). Oxide growth on non-pre-etched Si (100) at the high temperatures was similar to that of Si (111). However, pre-etching of Si (100) for more than 10 min at the high temperatures results in formation of pyramidal hillocks on the surface. During polarization at the high temperatures, the pyramidal hillocks are dissolved and the surface becomes flattened. Hydrated silica layer is the only detected oxidation product at all potentials. In the second part of the thesis a method is developed for electrochemical texturing of as-cut multicrystalline and single crystals, Si (111) and Si (100), in alkaline solutions. The wafers are potentiostatically polarized in 2 M KOH and 4 M KOH at temperatures in the range 30 oC to 70 oC. The applied potentials are varied from 20 V to 50 V (referred to Pt-counter electrode). Before the polarization, the samples are pre-etched in the test solution to remove the deformed zone on the as-cut surfaces. The morphology of the textured surfaces, the composition and thickness of the surface products and the light reflectivity are analyzed by utilizing SEM, XPS and Lambda UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer, respectively. Pre-etching of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers results in anisotropic surface morphology with protrusions and valleys due to etching of different grains at different etch rates in alkaline solutions. During anodic polarization at potentials above 20 V and at temperatures at 40 oC and above, all the grains are uniformly textured. At 25 V and 30 V, micro-pits are formed on the protrusions. With increasing the potential to 40 V and 50 V, concave cavities are formed on the entire surface. Isotropic texturing is achieved. Isotropic texturing on mc-Si wafers is characterized by formation of the concave cavities of 1 to 10 μm. Inside the micropits and cavities, nano-pits are formed. Their lateral size is in the range 100 nm to 200 nm. At 50 V, the nano-pits are etched away and the cavities become shallower due to enhanced dissolution. The lowest average reflectivity, 17 %, is achieved on electrochemically textured surface after polarization at 40 V for 10 min in 4 M KOH at 50 oC, which is 50 % lower than the reflectivity on the pre-etched surface. A model for the isotropic texturing mechanism is proposed based on XPS analysis and electrochemical measurements. It is suggested that the formation of pits and concave cavities is due to local pH variations caused by oxygen evolution reaction, which control formation and dissolution of the surface oxide. Protons formed during oxygen evolution reduce the pH on the surface locally. Hereby, SiO 2 becomes stable and grows on the surface in the low pH area. For prolonged exposure the growth of the oxide passivates the surface and lowers the oxidation rate of Si and water. Due to high alkalinity of the electrolyte, oxide dissolves at weak points thus creating pits. Oxidation of silicon and oxygen evolution occurs at the oxide breakdown sites. Continuous formation and local dissolution of oxide causes the formation of micro-pitted surface. Formation of pits and concave cavities are not affected by changes in the electrolyte concentration and temperature. However, pre-etching is an important factor in obtaining the uniform textures on all the grains of the mc-Si wafers. This is due to the fact that pre-etching influences the formation of SiO 2 on (100) grains at high temperatures. Isotropic textures are not obtained on mc-Si wafers containing significant number of (100) grains when pre-etched for more than 10 min. On Si (111) wafer surfaces, pre-etching results in formation of steps and terraces. The terraces contain true (111) planes are stable and steps contain fast etching planes such as (100) and (110) are more reactive. During polarization, terrace planes are passivated by formation of a stable oxide, and pits are initiated at the step edges. With increasing potential, temperature and exposure time, pitting spreads over the terrace planes. The surface reflectance is decreased with increasing pit coverage. It is demonstrated that the electrochemical texturing method can effectively replace the present isotropic etching by acidic etchants. Both single crystal and multicrystalline materials have successfully been textured. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|E
