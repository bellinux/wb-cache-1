40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of this volume {{together with the}} book Risk Assessment in Litigation published by Butterworths in 2001. The research presented as a whole represents work conducted over the period from 1999 to 2013 focussing on the assessment of risk in civil litigation in England and Wales {{in the context of}} conditional fee agreement and after the event insurance. The published works that form part of the thesis collectively present ‘doctrinal’ and ‘empirical’ legal research, terms considered {{in the light of the}} published works and the research underlying them. The initial research project commenced in 1999 and was funded by the European Social Fund, Blake Lapthorn solicitors and Litigation Protection Limited (<b>an</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary).</b> That project researched the question of whether and if so how a method or methods of risk assessment could be devised that could form the basis of a training programme for litigation solicitors. The outcomes of that research were a set of risk assessment methods that were later formed into a continuing professional development format and delivered across England and Wales. The methods were also incorporated into the book Risk Assessment in Litigation and into Butterworths Costs Service. The thesis sets out via the published works that a positive answer can be and was given to the initial research question. Part of that answer involves defining and researching tacit knowledge and the difficulties inherent in the transfer of tacit knowledge all of which is explored in chapter four: What is legal research? The present volume develops the topic of probability theory as applied to risk assessment in litigation and reviews the treatment of that topic in the original publication Risk Assessment in Litigation and takes the debate further in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Motto & Ors v Trafigura Ltd & Anor [2011] EWCA Civ 1150 where the book is cited in the judgment of Lord Neuberger MR. The research presented in this thesis also {{consists of}} detailed analysis of the law relating to the funding of civil litigation under conditional fee agreements and after the event legal expenses insurance. Over the period 1999 to 2013 the published works show a development of the law in this field and a change in government policy in respect of the regulation of conditional fee agreements with attendant changes to the law and therefore the practice of litigation. The impact on risk in litigation of these changes is considered in detail in the published works...|$|E

5000|$|Case E-04/09 Inconsult {{dealt with}} the {{criteria}} an website had to comply with {{in order to be}} considered a “durable medium”, according to Article 2(12) of Directive 2002/92/EC on insurance mediation. The Court noted that for the purposes of consumer protection, the Directive sets out certain minimum obligations relating to the information which <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> must provide to their customers {{and the manner in which}} this is done. By requiring this information to be submitted either on paper or any other durable medium, the Directive facilitates the subsequent verification of the information which an intermediary has provided to his customer. The Court held that a website can constitute a durable medium under Article 2(12) of the Directive, provided that several criteria are met. First, the website must enable the customer to store the information in question. Secondly, the website must enable the customer to store the information in a way which makes it accessible for a period of time adequate to the purposes of the information, that is, for as long as it is relevant for the customer in order to protect his interests stemming from his relations with the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary.</b> This might cover the time during which contractual negotiations were conducted even if not resulting in the conclusion of <b>an</b> <b>insurance</b> contract, the period during which <b>an</b> <b>insurance</b> contract is in force and, to the extent necessary e.g. for seeking redress, the period after such a contract has lapsed. Thirdly, the website must allow for the unchanged reproduction of information stored. In this respect, the Court held that the information must be stored in a way that makes it impossible for the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary</b> to change it unilaterally. It is for the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary</b> to ensure that the methods of electronic communication he employs permit this kind of reproduction. Finally, the Court held that for an website to qualify as a durable medium it is irrelevant whether the customer has expressly consented to the provision of information through the internet.|$|R

40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> provide <b>a</b> useful {{link between}} {{insurers}} and the insured in commercial insurance markets. However, recent revelations of improprieties by some intermediaries have cast <b>a</b> shadow on <b>insurance</b> markets. This {{has led to}} calls for reforming the workings of these markets. This study provides a theoretical framework to understand the impact on contractual relationships {{if some of the}} proposed changes are implemented. Specifically, it examines the impact of a change in the number of insurance brokers on the preferred type of compensation contracts between <b>insurance</b> providers and <b>intermediaries.</b> Two key questions addressed are: Will the widely prevalent flat fee contracts still be preferred in the face of greater intermediary competition?; and Will there be {{an increase in the number}} of projects insured when there is greater competition among <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries?...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{a variety}} of economies, recent years have {{witnessed}} prominent alterations in the regulatory framework under which financial systems operate. Most notable among these alterations are the host of revisions to the regulatory framework faced by financial intermediaries such as banks. From a theoretical perspective, this paper assesses {{the potential impact of}} regulatory policy on macroeconomic aggregates and the behavior of financial intermediaries. The general equilibrium model employed in this paper extends the neoclassical real business cycle framework by incorporating a financial intermediary with access to a stochastic capital-generating technology. In the presence of <b>a</b> deposit <b>insurance</b> system, <b>intermediaries</b> may choose to screen this technology and have direct control over the volatility of the capital return. I find that in the model’s steady-state, the deposit insurance premium exerts leverage over equilibrium screening and economy-wide consumption but has an ambiguous effect on the volatility of the intermediary’s portfolio...|$|R
40|$|How should <b>intermediaries</b> {{influence}} the <b>insurance</b> demand decision? The answer must {{refer to the}} interdependence of economic determinants and legal duties. Intermediaries potentially guide demand decisions by delivering objective information and by considering individuals' situation and economic circumstances. The economic theory provides determinants that are essential for the insurance demand decision. Undoubtedly, consumers lack information about certain variables, and therefore misjudge their demand for insurances. In response to the consumer, an intermediaries' task is to discover possible misjudgments and to provide the correct information. Since {{the information in the}} insurance market is asymmetrically distributed, <b>an</b> <b>insurance</b> agent has <b>an</b> incentive to behave opportunistically, a tendency that is reinforced by the remuneration scheme in Germany. In 2007 / 2008, <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> became regulated by law. That law states, among other things, the four basic obligations of <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and <b>a</b> liability rule to sanction violations. In order to interpret and substantiate the legal terms, those have to match the relevant economic determinants to state the ideal behavior of an intermediary...|$|R

Besides, the working of signaling devices (like reputation, advertising or certificates) to reduce asymmetric information with respect to the service quality of <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> is examined. The results obtained support the main hypotheses derived from industrial organization theories as to the poor working of quality competition under incomplete and asymmetric information on the side of consumers. Thus, public policy should concentrate on increasing transparency about intermediaries' (in-) dependence from insurance companies and improve consumers' financial literacy to raise the overall quality of the information services provided by <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> Performance of <b>Insurance</b> Distribution Systems, Information Quality...|$|R
40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> help {{consumers}} to economize on information and transaction costs in insurance markets. However, competing <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> provide heterogeneous services, which {{are difficult to}} assess by incompletely informed consumers.

The present paper uses a sample of 927 <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in Germany. By performing OLS estimations we test the impact of the different distribution channels, but also of other factors relating to the information processing activities on intermediaries’ service quality. Depending on the proxies used for service quality, we find mixed evidence for the “product quality” hypothesis according to which independent intermediaries provide better service quality than exclusive agents. We find that service quality depends also to a large extent on the information gathering and processing activities of the individual intermediaries. ...|$|R
