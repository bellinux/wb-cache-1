50|$|<b>Aniline</b> <b>leather</b> may be {{referred}} to as full aniline or full sauvage leather to differentiate between this dye treatment and variants. Semi-aniline leather is produced through a very similar process to full-aniline, but has a thin protective top coat added to protect it from wear and staining. Pull-up <b>aniline</b> <b>leather</b> has additional oil or wax applied to the leather to give it a distressed look.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aniline</b> <b>leather</b> {{is a type}} {{of leather}} dyed {{exclusively}} with soluble dyes without covering the surface with a topcoat paint or insoluble pigments. The resulting product retains the hide's natural surface with the 'grain', i.e. visible pores, scars etc. of the complete original animal's skin structure. For this reason, <b>aniline</b> <b>leather</b> {{is one of the most}} precious finishes in leather manufacturing: only high quality leathers are suitable for aniline finishing.|$|E
50|$|Oiling {{provides}} the leather with lubrication and {{allows it to}} flex repeatedly without cracking. Leather fibres that are dry and un-lubricated break very easily. Oiling does impart colour and an element of water resistance. Oiling would normally be performed on full grain <b>aniline</b> <b>leathers.</b> The {{most common type of}} leather oiled is vegetable tanned leather.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Furnishings== The Imperial Monterey {{furniture}} line conserved for Crater Lake National Park {{was purchased}} by the NPS through Meier & Frank in Portland, Oregon. It {{is one of two}} largest complete lines known in existence in a public place, the other being a line of Mason Monterey furniture just a few hours away at the Oregon Caves National Monument. The Imperial furniture line {{is one of the best}} known of the secondary Monterey lines, made in Los Angeles, California in the early 1930s. The Imperial line utilized mahogany as their primary wood, usually stained dark brown with a silvery sheen, created by grain filler, probably silex or calcium chloride. The line was solid and heavy, accented by top quality ironwork. Originally the line was upholstered in a multicolored cotton weave in a fiesta-influenced pattern. The restoration show covers chosen were rich red and cordovan colored waxed top grain <b>aniline</b> <b>leathers,</b> which was also appropriate to the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{patterns}} {{used today}} {{date back to}} 1839. Each pair of Dents Heritage gloves is handmade in England by a Dents craftsman. Every glove is individually bench cut. Quirks, which are small, diamond-shaped pieces of leather, are hand sewn {{at the base of}} the fingers in order to provide a snug fit. Dents craftsmen also utilize a hand felling technique in which the cuff of the glove is stitched to the lining, improving the gloves' shape and comfort. Dents Heritage gloves are made with peccary skins, North American deerskin, and fine <b>aniline</b> Ethiopian hairsheep <b>leathers.</b> Heritage gloves are available in a handful of stores worldwide with a luxury price tag and should not be confused with the imported gloves sold in most stores.|$|R
50|$|Nubuck {{characteristics}} {{are similar to}} <b>aniline</b> <b>leather.</b> It is soft to the touch, scratches easily, and water drops darken it temporarily (it dries to its original color).|$|E
5000|$|Chromexcel is {{registered}} trademark {{for a kind}} of <b>aniline</b> <b>leather</b> with a history of production that goes back over a century in the US. The process of creating it requires [...] "at least 89 separate processes taking 28 working days" [...] at the Horween Leather Company.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of <b>aniline</b> <b>leather,</b> but {{the same kinds of}} dyes are used in the process. The dyes used are clear and transparent chemicals that allow the grain structure of the leather to be seen. These dyes show the natural texture, but do not protect the leather from damage.|$|E
5000|$|Corrected-grain leather is any leather {{that has}} had an {{artificial}} grain applied to its surface. The hides used to create corrected leather {{do not meet the}} standards for use in creating vegetable-tanned or <b>aniline</b> <b>leather.</b> The imperfections are corrected or sanded off, and an artificial grain embossed into the surface and dressed with stain or dyes. Most corrected-grain leather is used to make pigmented leather as the solid pigment helps hide the corrections or imperfections. Corrected grain leathers can mainly be bought as two finish types: semi-aniline and pigmented.|$|E

An applique of real maple wood ran across the instrument panel, dividing it into upper and lower sections.

The lifestyle questionnaire was created to research into the subjects ’ preferences in accordance with 4 kinds of leather types, 5 kinds of grains, and 5 kinds of colors. After the authors ’ statistical analysis of 206 copies of the effective questionnaires, the research results among every group showed that the favorites were <b>Aniline</b> <b>Leather</b> of leather types, smaller particles of grains, and high contrast colors, such as white and black.
