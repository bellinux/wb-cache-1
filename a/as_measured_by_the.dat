It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{spawned a}} tropical depression near the Lesser Antilles on August30, which quickly became Tropical Storm Ella. It quickly intensified {{in the eastern}} Caribbean into a hurricane by August31 while passing south of Puerto Rico; there, the outer rainbands caused some flooding that caused minor damage. On September1, Ella strengthened to winds of , <b>as</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hurricane Hunters. At that intensity, the hurricane passed {{just south of the}} Dominican Republic before making landfall in southwestern Haiti. In the Dominican Republic, heavy rainfall and floods caused $100,000 in damage, mostly in the country's southwestern portion. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding in southwestern Haiti, and thousands of people became homeless after their houses were damaged. Near Les Cayes, 30people were killed due to flash flooding.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joanne {{was one of}} four {{tropical}} cyclones {{to bring}} gale-force winds to the Southwestern United States in the 20th century. A tropical depression developed on September 30, 1972. It then moved west northwest and intensified into a hurricane on October 1. Hurricane Joanne peaked as a Category2 hurricane, <b>as</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> modern Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), October 2. Joanne then slowed down and began to re-curve. Joanne made landfall along the northern portion of the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm. The tropical storm moved inland over Sonora on October 6 and was believed to have survived into Arizona as a tropical storm. In Arizona, many roads were closed and some water rescues had to be performed due to a prolonged period of heavy rains. One person was reportedly killed while another was electrocuted. A few weeks after the hurricane, Arizona would sustain additional flooding and eight additional deaths.|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} tax {{allowances}} on inequality <b>as</b> <b>measures</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Gini coefficient is small. The direction of {{their impact on}} inequality varies from country to country. Thus, increasing tax allowance income by one percent would lower inequality in Estonia, Latvia, Czech Republic, Spain and Greece by between a 14 th and a 20 th of a percentage point. It would increase it in France, Belgium and Ireland by approximately a 20 th of a percentage point. Note that albeit statistically significant, these effects are small in magnitude.|$|R

5|$|The United States {{government}} {{divided the}} trans-Allegheny region into several new territories. The largest {{of these was}} the Northwest Territory, which was progressively divided into several smaller territories by the United States Congress. In 1800, the Indiana Territory was the first new territory established from {{a portion of the}} Northwest Territory. The territory grew in population and development until it was admitted to the Union in 1816 as the nineteenth state, Indiana. Following statehood, the newly established state government laid out on an ambitious plan to transform Indiana from a segment of the frontier into a developed, well populated, and thriving state. The state's founders initiated a program that led to the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and state-funded public schools. Despite the noble aims of the project, profligate spending ruined the state's credit. By 1841 the state was near bankruptcy and forced to liquidate most of its public works. By its new constitution of 1851, it restricted rights of free blacks and excluded them from the suffrage. During the 1850s, the state's population grew to exceed one million. The ambitious program of its founders was realized as Indiana became the fourth-largest state in terms of population, <b>as</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1860 census.|$|E
5|$|The {{quantity}} of benthic macroinvertebrates at sites in Tangascootack Creek has been {{measured by the}} West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition using different systems.

Total taxa richness, <b>as</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> organization, ranged from 3 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 7 at site T-1, with an average of 4.3. The EPT Taxa Richness (measured on a scale of 0 to 4) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 2 at site T-1, with an average of 0.7. The scores of the sites according to version 3 of the Beckâ€™s Index (twice the number of pollution-intolerant benthos taxa plus the number of facultative benthos taxa) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 6 at site T-1. On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (a method of determining a stream's ecosystem quality based on its benthic macroinvertebrates), the sites ranged from 3.538 for site T-1 to 6.2 for site T-2, with an average of 5.024. On the Shannon index, the sites ranged from 0.950 at site T-2 to 1.925 at site T-3, with an average of 1.325.|$|E
