After the adoption of EU regulation 531/2012 the retail exchange rate {{to be used for}} the relevant year should be calculated by taking the average of the reference exchange rates published in the OJoEU on 1 March, 1 April and 1 May of that year, with the new exchange rate coming into force on 1 July of that year. The wholesale exchange rate however is taken from only the rate published on 1 May of that year.|$|E
30|$|Our main {{intended}} {{contribution is}} to put an <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> <b>Euro</b> to LW for several European countries {{so that we can}} contrast the calculated amount with the national minimum wage. Based on this exercise, we present how several of the member states of the EU currently set the MW beneath the LW level as well as amounts of MW increase, which would be necessary in each of these countries to guarantee the LW at least for all Europeans working full-time. Importantly, in line with the LW literature (Anker 2011), the presented calculations should be understood as “absolute minimum amount needed for a dignified life” and nothing more. Under no circumstances should our number be interpreted as “sufficient” level of MW. On the contrary, as argued above, we fully appreciate the current diversity of approaches to MW as an expression of legitimate democratic will of European peoples and do not argue for any harmonization beyond ensuring that MW in no member state falls under the LW.|$|E
40|$|Toxic {{currency}} {{options are}} defined {{on the basis}} of the opposition to the nature (essence) of an option contract, which is justified in terms of norms founded on the general law clause of characteristics (nature) of a relation (which represents an independent premise for imposing restrictions on the freedom of contracts). So-understood toxic currency options are unlawful. Indeed they contravene iuris cogentis regulations. These include for instance option contracts, which are concluded with a bank, if the bank has not informed about option risk before concluding the contract; or the barrier options, which focus only on the protection of bank’s interests. Therefore, such options may appear to be invalid. Therefore, performing contracts for toxic currency options may be qualified as a criminal mismanagement. For the sake of security, the manager should then take into consideration filing a claim for stating invalidity (which can be made in a court verdict). At the same time, if the supervisory board member in a commercial company, who can also be a subject to mismanagement offences, commits an omission involving lack of reaction (for example, if he/she fails to notify of the suspected offence committed by the management board members acting to the company’s detriment when the management board makes the company conclude option contracts which are charged with absolute invalidity) the supervisory board member so acting may be considered to act to the company’s detriment. In the most recent Polish jurisprudence and judicature the standard of a “good host” is treated to be the last resort for determining whether the manager’s powers resulting from criminal regulations were performed. The manager of the exporter should not, as a rule, issue any options. Issuing options always means assuming an obligation. In the case of currency put options it is an absolute obligation to purchase a given <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> at exchange rate set in advance. On the other hand issuing call options confers an absolute obligation to deliver to the other party to the option contract a specified <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> at exchange rate set in advance. This latter position (short call) means unlimited loss in the case of appreciation of euro. This was the situation faced by some Polish exporters in the second half of 2008 who in the middle of 2008 issued the most risky call options for banks and, thus, they bought a currency risk from the banks. Issuing any option always means also buying someone other’s risk, in exchange for a relatively small option premium which might trigger a relatively huge and actually unlimited risk of losses, if the assumed forecast does not come true. This is not the economic analysis of law to be relied on any more in respect of the cost of preventing the risk of loss being higher or lower than the amount of damage. The manager of an exporting company, unlike the speculator who sells options (buys risk), usually has no knowledge of financial engineering, which is essential to safely manage such excessive risk through creating a hedging portfolio...|$|E

We apply a large German household survey and conduct wage regressions to conclude whether individuals who perceive their wages as unfair earn significantly lower wages than fairly paid individuals with similar characteristics.

40|$|Financing of the Luxembourg {{pension system}} {{is based on}} a {{pay-as-you-go}} system and hence on an intergenerational contract. As is the case for most other European countries, this system will be exposed to the effects of demographic aging over the coming decades. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the impact of this demographic deficit on the long term sustainability of the Luxembourg pension system. We proceed in two steps. In a first step, we highlight the evolution of salaries in Luxembourg. To this end, we use the recent statistical group based trajectory model of D. Nagin (Nagin 2005). We estimate model parameters from a single database, provided by the general social security inspection office (IGSS) and containing annual salaries of all wage earners in the Luxembourg private sector. As a result we divide up the population into nine groups, each with its own mean salary trajectory in time and its relative weight in society. In a second step, we evaluate the pension system by means of a new criterion. This is the sustainability coefficient, which we define as the average <b>amount</b> (<b>in</b> <b>euros)</b> that the labor force has to earn to fund one euro of pension payments, based on current legislation. Our estimations show the high sensitivity of the coefficient to demographic variables and highlight the risks threatening the Luxembourg pay-as-you-go system. To this aim, we develop a theoretical model consistent with our statistical analysis. This model allows for the determination of both the initial level and the evolution of the pensions for each of the groups identified in the first step of our work. Knowing the weight of each of the groups within the Luxembourg population, we are then able to evaluate the sustainability coefficient of the system. This corresponds to comparing the sum of all incomes of the labor force to that of all the pensions paid to pensioners at a given date while taking into account the growth rate of the population in time. Finally, we interpret our results in the light of other sustainability criteria, such as the rate of contributions which ensures long-term stability of the pension level under the current legislation or the pension level that current contributions are able to finance in the long run...|$|R

For example, imagine that a script is licensed to a production company for the filming of a movie. If the contract of sale of the license to use the script stipulates that the production company will pay the author 10,000 euro, the production company will not, in fact, pay the author 10,000 euro. Rather, the production company will pay the author some lesser <b>amount</b> (<b>in</b> 2006, 9215.5 <b>euro)</b> and will pay the AGESSA the remainder (in 2007, 784.5).
