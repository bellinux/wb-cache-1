Similarly, Robin Rothman of Village Voice enjoyed the collaborations, but opined that they would [...] "be better described as augmentations". In a very negative review, a critic from NME stated [...] "To paraphrase Woody Allen, genius is like a shark; it has to move forward or it dies. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> here is a patchily impressive, fleetingly satisfying, but very, very dead shark". In a list compiled by staff members from Stereogum ranking the singer's albums out of thirty positions, they listed Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic at number 25.

"The ironic thing, {{is if we}} had {{put this}} to delegates {{a couple of weeks}} ago, before the {{international}} pro-Israeli lobby started this massive campaign emailing delegates and trying to deny us our democratic right to discuss whatever we like, it probably wouldn't have passed. People feel bullied, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen is a hardening of attitudes. All they achieved was making the delegates determined to debate and pass the motion." ...|$|E

Schumacher said, [...] "Fangio is {{on a level}} much higher than I see myself. What he did stands alone <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{achieved}} is also unique. I have such respect for what he achieved. You can't take a personality like Fangio and compare him with what has happened today. There is not even the slightest comparison." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sontag {{writes that}} the {{convenience}} of modern photography has created an overabundance of visual material, and [...] "just about everything has been photographed". This has altered our expectations {{of what we have}} the right to view, want to view or should view. [...] "In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notion of what is worth looking at <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the right to observe" [...] and has changed our [...] "viewing ethics". Photographs have increased our access to knowledge and experiences of history and faraway places, but the images may replace direct experience and limit reality. She also states that photography desensitizes its audience to horrific human experiences, and children are exposed to experiences before they are ready for them.|$|E

(This is most clearly expressed in his work [...] "Kumeŭaŭa".) Man as a cultural capital {{is the product of}} all humanity, because in our daily lives we interact with products invented by diverse people; he illustrated this with a dining table, explaining that each piece of tableware was invented by a different people, each of the foods that had been developed and planted by different people, and now ten cultures are involved in setting a table. Therefore, every man was a respectable person, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> today is the result of efforts of all nations, and therefore belongs to all.|$|E

Colvin testified that [...] "According to our information, the likelihood {{is that all the}} Afghans we handed over were tortured. For interrogators in Kandahar, it was a standard operating procedure." [...] Colvin also testified that he had made numerous reports to both the Department of Defence and the Foreign Affairs Department about the situation, starting in 2006. Defence Minister Peter MacKay responded to the allegations saying [...] "I don't believe it's credible.
