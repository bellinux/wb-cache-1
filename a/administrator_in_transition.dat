40|$|This phenomenological {{research}} study explored {{the experiences of}} educational <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> the <b>transition</b> from their administrative responsibilities into retirement. The study was guided by a grand tour question addressed by three sub-questions. Data collected during the individual interviews with 10 retired educational administrators provided the basic understanding of the issues and lived experiences as they transition into retirement from fulltime employment as educational administrators to retirees from the State of Alabama educational system. An analysis of interview data revealed four themes regarding the perceptions and lived experiences of recently retired K- 12 educational administrators from the State of Alabama. These four major themes were (a) finances, (b) pressures, (c), self-importance, and (d) health issues. The experiences of recently retired participants showed economic issues {{have a profound effect}} upon retirees, especially when they are unfavorable, and the absence of workplace activity may well lead to decreased self-worth and insecurity. Either or both, and in isolation or combination with other factors can impact their mental and physical health. The participants expressed a desire for all educational administrators to prepare earlier for retirement, attend retirement planning seminars and utilize family to successfully transition into retirement. The {{research study}} was not without limitations and further research on the topic was recommended. ...|$|R
