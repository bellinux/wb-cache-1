We are all painfully aware that this attempt to control pollution is not now and 'never has been effective.

Source reduction where possible, coupled with recovery, reuse and recycle of wastes which cannot be stopped, results in pollution prevention. Before this prevention can take place there must be a thorough understanding of what a waste is, where it comes from, what process practices create it, and what technologies are available to eliminate it.

The study summarizes the {{issues relating to}} the national and international IT audit regulations.

The paper presents the main components of IT audit, namely data center audit, computer network audit, operating system audit, Internet servers audit, database auditing, application auditing, external access flows IT audit (e. g. radio access, access from mobile devices). Practical aspects of the study describe database auditing as an important element of IT audit process.

The author makes a presentation of database components that are relevant to database audit.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} goodwill impairment test under IFRS, which prescribes that goodwill is not amortized and instead tested for impairment {{at least once}} a year. The objective of introducing this impairment-only approach in 2004 was to provide more useful information to financial statement users. The dissertation is thereforemotivated by the ongoing debate on the decision usefulness and reliability of goodwill impairment tests, as the IASB’s recent post-implementation review on business combinations shows, and the high practical relevance of this topic for firms, auditors, enforcement institutions, and regulators. Against this background, the dissertation (1) sets forth and critically discusses the accounting requirements for goodwill, (2) develops an audit approach for goodwill impairment tests, (3) empirically assesses whether goodwill impairment tests are used as a device for earnings management, and (4) performs two empirical studies to analyze how goodwill impairments are perceived by capital market participants. Based on the requirements of international and German auditing standards and the author’s practical audit experience, a risk-based audit approach is developed that outlines the different <b>audit</b> <b>steps</b> necessary to verify the reasonableness of goodwill impairment tests including practical application guidance for auditors. Using a sample of German listed firms for the periods 2006 to 2013, the main findings of the three empirical studies are that (1) the likelihood to recognize goodwill impairments and the magnitude of impairment losses are influenced by earnings management incentives, (2) investors perceive goodwill impairments as value relevant, but not timely recognized, and (3) the announcement of goodwill impairments leads to a negative capital market reaction, but the reaction is considerably smaller than the goodwill amount written off. Moreover, the perceived timeliness of goodwill impairments is shown to be influenced by auditor characteristics, which serve as a proxy for perceived audit quality. Overall, the empirical results therefore indicate that the concept of impairment testing might generally have merits in reflecting the economic value and consumption of goodwill, but that current accounting requirements might not be sufficient to ensure a rigorous impairment test providing adequate decision useful information. Hence, improvements of the current approach or the implementation of a different approach, e. g. based on certain amortization requirements with indication-based impairment testing, should be discussed...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{innovative}} quality improvement intervention developed in Morocco and discuss its implementation. Until 2004, the Moroccan Ministry of Health (MoH) encouraged pilots of quality improvement approaches but none of them were revealed to be sustainable. Internal assessments pinpointed factors such as lack of recognition of the participating team’s efforts and lack ofpressure on managers to become more accountable. In 2005, Morocco opted for an intervention called Quality Contest (QC) targeting health centres, hospitals and health district offices and combining quality measurement with structures ranking, performance disclosure and reward system. Design/methodology/approach – The QC is organized every 18 months. After the self-assessment and external <b>audit</b> <b>step,</b> the participating structures are ranked according to their scores. Their performances are then disseminated and the highest performing structures are rewarded. Findings – The results showed an improvement in performance among participating structures, constructive exchange of successful experiences between structures, as well as communication of constraints, needs and expectations between MoH managers at central and local levels; the use of peer-auditors was appreciated as it enabled an exchange of best practices between auditors and audited teams but this was mitigated by the difficulty of ensuring their neutrality; and the recognition of efforts was appreciated but seemed insufficient to ensure a sense of justice and maintain motivation. Originality/value – This intervention is an example of MoH leadership that has succeeded in introducing transparency and accountability mechanisms (ranking and performance disclosure) as leverage to change the management culture of the public health services; setting up a reward system to reinforce motivation and adapting continuously the intervention to enhance its sustainability and acceptability.

40|$|SOBA is an {{approach}} to election verification that provides observers with justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are consistent with an audit trail ("ballots"), which can be paper or electronic. SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy; (2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of contests while simultaneously assessing {{the integrity of the}} shrouded mapping between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
