6000|$|It is not {{justification}} {{that can}} secure us from being assaulted by Satan: 'Simon, Simon, Satan has desired to have you.' (Luke 22:31,32) There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> do encourage the devil to set upon {{the people of}} God:-- ...|$|E

25|$|His {{own home}} shows an {{influence}} of Japanese design that he attributed to Junzo Sakakura's Japanese pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition. The structural elements and the inter-relationship of the spaces <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he thought <b>were</b> important.|$|R
60|$|There <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Lady Desmond {{noticed in}} this: first, that her {{daughter}} should have called young Mr. Fitzgerald by his Christian name; and secondly, {{that it should have}} come to that with them, that a Fitzgerald should send a vehicle for a Desmond, seeing that the Desmond could no longer provide a vehicle for herself.|$|R
60|$|I {{think there}} <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> must be admitted: first, {{that many of}} the worst evils of {{capitalism}} might survive under Communism; secondly, that the cure for these evils cannot be sudden, since it requires changes in the average mentality.|$|E
60|$|SIR PATRICK. There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can {{be wrong}} with any man. One {{of them is a}} cheque. The other is a woman. Until you know that a man's sound on these two points, you know nothing about him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, {{they must}} marry. There {{is nothing else}} to be done. But there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder when}} it ever answers to {{interfere}} with the natural course of events!' responded Louis, musingly. 'There <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Calcott told me once upon a time.' Those <b>two</b> <b>things</b> he left unuttered. They were--that the gentleman would be wasted on the school, and that the lady was not made for a poor man's wife. No wonder they made him sigh, but he concluded by exclaiming aloud-- ...|$|R
60|$|There {{must then}} be this holy mixture {{of things in}} the heart of a truly confessing publican. There must be sound sense of sin, sound {{knowledge}} of God, deep conviction of the certainty and terribleness of the day of judgment, as also of the probability of obtaining mercy. But to come to that which remains; I told you <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> did make unfeigned confession hard. The first I have touched upon.|$|R
5000|$|A figurative {{analogy is}} a [...] about <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not alike but share only some common property. [...] On the other hand, a literal analogy <b>is</b> about <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> nearly exactly alike.|$|R
60|$|There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> great sinners are acquainted with, {{when they}} come to divulge them to the saints, that are a great relief to their faith. 1. The {{contests}} that they usually have with the devil at their parting with him. 2. Their knowledge of his secrets in his workings.|$|E
6000|$|HOLY. Then said Mr. Holy-man, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{they have}} need to possess who go on pilgrimage--courage and an unspotted life. If {{they have not}} courage, they can never hold on their way; and if their lives be loose, they will make the very name of the pilgrim stink." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However," [...] said Thursday, after {{a little}} reflection, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> might render our {{acceptance}} impossible. I suppose you will require rent for the outfit; but for a time, until we get well started, we {{could not afford to}} pay as much as {{you have a right to}} demand." ...|$|E
50|$|Viola was {{the sister}} of Ross's girlfriend. Douglas Birdsall had been the {{associate}} dean at the Texas Tech library. Ross shot both victims. Later the same day, a mountain biker came across the murder scene and found both Douglas's and Viola's bodies in a car. DNA on a latex glove found in Birdsall's car and a sweatshirt found in Ross's apartment <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> linked Ross to the double murder. In 2002 Ross was found guilty {{and sentenced to death}} by lethal injection by a jury.|$|R
6000|$|... "You ARE {{a female}} thing at bottom," [...] he admitted. [...] "I'm {{not nearly so}} sure as you. As for me, I look twice at it.... Life <b>is</b> <b>two</b> <b>things,</b> <b>that's</b> how I see it; <b>two</b> <b>things</b> mixed and muddled up together. Life is morality--life is {{adventure}}. Squire and master. Adventure rules, and morality--looks up the trains in the Bradshaw. Morality tells you what is right, and adventure moves you. If morality means anything it means keeping bounds, respecting implications, respecting implicit bounds. If individuality means anything it means breaking bounds--adventure.|$|R
60|$|Given {{the time}} and the place, there <b>were</b> only <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> could have caused this look. Either the light-haired young man had seen a ghost, or he had {{suddenly}} realized that he had not enough money to pay the check.|$|R
60|$|HOLY-MAN. Then said Mr. Holy-man, There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{they have}} {{need to be}} possessed with, that go on pilgrimage; courage, and an unspotted life. If they have not courage, they can never hold on their way; and if their lives be loose, they will make the very name of a Pilgrim stink.|$|E
60|$|There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{a defender}} of the Bolsheviks may say against the {{argument}} that they have failed because {{the present state of}} Russia is bad. It may be said that {{it is too soon to}} judge, and it may be urged that whatever failure there has been is attributable to the hostility of the outside world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I'm awful {{glad that}} father {{has come back}} and that ma won't have to wash any more," [...] {{he said with a}} sigh, [...] "but there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> kind of worry me. My Aunt Jane always said that it didn't do any good to worry, and I s'pose it don't, but it's kind of a relief." ...|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> only <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{interest}} Stanley: the crosswords {{and getting}} {{his hands on}} his mother-in-law's money, which he has dreamed about for 20 years. He finally realises that he must construct a puzzle of his own in order to give death a helping hand.|$|R
5000|$|... "“Volevo essere adeguata ma non possedevo il segreto. La bellezza e l’amore erano le due cose a cui ancora pensavo di più”. ("I {{wanted to}} be appropriate, but I did not possess the secret. The beauty and love <b>were</b> the <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I thought even more. [...] ") ...|$|R
60|$|What further madness is this? How shall they <b>be</b> {{pieces of}} <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not the same? Also {{it was not}} thus in the song.|$|R
6000|$|... [Second Caution to Weak Christians.]--As I cannot but {{condemn the}} actions of such Christians as have been touched before, so I would caution weak Christians not to be {{offended}} with true religion for the miscarriages of their fellows. There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are very apt to be an occasion of offence to the weak: one is, when the cross attends religion; the other is, when others that profess religion do suffer for evil-doing. To both these I would say this:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Do not {{be afraid}} {{that they will not}} make {{allowances}}. All men make very large allowances indeed before they stake their own lives in a war to the death with society. Nobody demands or expects the millennium. But there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> must be set right, or we shall perish, like Rome, of soul atrophy disguised as empire. The first is, that the daily ceremony of dividing the wealth of the country among its inhabitants shall be so conducted that no crumb shall go to any able-bodied adults who are not producing by their personal exertions not only a full equivalent for what they take, but a surplus sufficient to provide for their superannuation and pay back the debt due for their nurture.|$|E
6000|$|His letters {{constantly}} {{offer us}} sensible and imaginative reflection. He amused himself in some country village {{by talking to}} an old man of eighty. [...] "I love children and old men; the latter seem to me like some singular creatures that have been spared by caprice of fate." [...] He meets some old schoolfellows at Langres, nearly all the rest having gone: [...] "Well, there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> warn us of our end, and set us musing--old ruins, and the short duration of those who began life with us." [...] He is taken by a host over-devoted to such joys, to walk among dung-heaps. [...] "After all," [...] he says, [...] "it ought not to offend one's sense. To an honest nose that has preserved its natural innocence, 'tis not a goat, but a bemusked and ambre-scented woman, who smelleth ill." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{would like}} to speak about our agenda for {{collaborative}} activity {{in the area of}} Internet 2. What can the social science community do [...] in partnership with the technology-development community [...] to realize the benefits of Internet 2 development? I am pleased to say that this meeting, for me, did what it was supposed to do. Because I’m going to leave here with a really clear agenda for my own work and for the work of my center, that I wouldn’t have had, had this meeting not occurred. And that’s really what I want to talk about today. There <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> came into focus for me {{at the end of the}} day yesterday and as I reviewed the remarks I wanted to make i...|$|R
60|$|Now Deborah was {{faithful}} to the backbone, and would have given all she had in the world, almost her life itself, for her lady and the children; {{she was a good}} and honest woman in the main, but tongue and temper <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she had never learnt to restrain, and she had given her love to the first person by whom it was sought, without consideration whether he was worthy of affection or not. That Diggory was a sullen, ill-conditioned, selfish fellow, was evident to everyone else; but he had paid court to Deborah, and therefore the foolish woman had allowed herself to be taken with him, see perfections in him, promise to become his wife, and confide in him.|$|R
5000|$|Miguel de Unamuno once said: [...] "There <b>are</b> {{at least}} <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> clearly can <b>be</b> {{attributed}} to the Basques: the Society of Jesus and the Republic of Chile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me {{tell you}} the whole thing before we part," [...] {{continued}} the other, [...] "and let me put it, for the sake of clearness, as we used to put our old problems. Now there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are puzzling people about that problem, aren't there? The first is how the murderer managed to slip off the dead man's coat, when he was already pinned to the ground with that stone incubus. The other, which is much smaller and less puzzling, is the fact of the sword that cut his throat being slightly stained at the point, instead of a good deal more stained at the edge. Well, I can dispose of the first question easily. Horne Hewitt took off his own coat before he was killed. I might say he took off his coat to be killed." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as we}} {{had eaten}} (and {{porridge}} and whey {{was the best of}} the good man's diet) he took a grave face and said he had a duty to perform by Mr. Campbell, and that was to inquire into my state of mind towards God. I was inclined to smile at him since the business of the snuff; but he had not spoken long before he brought the tears into my eyes. There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> men should never weary of, goodness and humility; we get none too much of them in this rough world among cold, proud people; but Mr. Henderland had their very speech upon his tongue. And though I was a good deal puffed up with my adventures and with having come off, as the saying is, with flying colours; yet he soon had me on my knees beside a simple, poor old man, and both proud and glad to be there.|$|E
6000|$|... "It needs not excuse, sir," [...] said Mary, [...] "I {{understand}} to whom I owe this insult. There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> your Queen {{can never}} take from me--royal {{blood and the}} Catholic faith. One day some of you will be sorry for what you have now put upon me! I would be alone, sir," [...] and she proudly motioned him to the door, with a haughty gesture, showing her still fully Queen in her own apartments. Paulett obeyed, {{and when he was}} gone, the Queen seemed to abandon the command over herself she had preserved all this time. She threw herself into Jean Kennedy's arms, and wept freely and piteously, while the good lady, rejoicing at heart to have recovered [...] "her bairn," [...] fondled and soothed her with soft Scottish epithets, as though the worn woman had been a child again. [...] "Yea, nurse, mine own nurse, I am come back to thee; for a little while--only a little while, nurse, for they will have my blood, and oh! I would it were ended, for I am aweary of it all." ...|$|E
60|$|There <b>were</b> <b>two</b> {{or three}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to know. I {{do not care}} about a mystery. So I began to inquire.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>are</b> one or <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> {{not up to}} yet," [...] he answered, with a {{laugh in}} the corner of his eye, as he waxed his thread with a flourish.|$|R
60|$|BLUNTSCHLI. My dear young lady, don't {{let this}} worry you. Remember: I'm a soldier. Now what <b>are</b> the <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{happen to a}} soldier so often that he comes to think nothing of them? One is hearing people tell lies (Raina recoils): the other is getting his life saved {{in all sorts of}} ways by all sorts of people.|$|R
