2500|$|By the 1930s {{the use of}} BTDF for {{long-range}} aircraft navigation was common. A good {{example of such a}} system was first installed in Australia in 1934 as part of the [...] MacRobertson Air Race. Two stations equipped with Marconi BTDF sets and <b>Adcock</b> <b>antennae</b> were set up at Charleville and Melbourne. The success of this system led to additional stations being added to form a network of 17 DF stations for long-distance navigation. By 1945, these had been largely replaced by RDF systems in the aircraft, rather than the ground.|$|R
5|$|The LFR ground {{component}} {{consisted of}} a network of radio transmission stations which were strategically located around the country, often near larger airports, approximately 200 miles apart. Early LFR stations used crossed loop antennas, but later designs were all based on the <b>Adcock</b> vertical <b>antenna</b> array for improved performance, especially at night.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, the <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> was adopted for aerial navigation, in {{what became known}} as the Low Frequency radio range (LFR), or the [...] "Adcock radio range". Hundreds of {{transmitting}} stations, each consisting of four or five <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> towers, were constructed around the U.S. and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> (transmitting in the LF/MF bands) became a key {{feature of the}} newly created radio {{navigation}} system for aviation. The Low Frequency radio range (LFR) network, which consisted of hundreds of <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays, defined the airways used by aircraft for instrument flying. The LFR remained as the main aerial navigation technology until it {{was replaced by the}} VOR system in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> is {{an antenna}} array {{consisting}} of four equidistant vertical elements {{which can be}} used to transmit or receive directional radio waves.|$|E
50|$|The {{operator}} uses {{an antenna}} that {{is attached to}} a receiver, which is programmed to the transmitter's frequency, to pick up the electromagnetic signals given off by the transmitter affixed to the target animal. Receiver antennas may be hand-held or mounted on an object, and they are available in a variety of forms and functions. These antennas are also tuned to the proper frequency for the transmitter. The receiver produces a tone that increases in loudness or has a visual signal strength indicator that pulses as the operator approaches the transmitter. Omnidirectional antennas have no additional elements and are used to determine {{the presence or absence of}} a signal, not its exact location. Elements are added segments of an antenna to increase the range of detectability of the receiver. <b>Adcock</b> <b>antennas</b> consist of two elements and are used to locate the direction of the signal. Loop antennas are small and useful for locating low frequency transmitters. The Yagi antenna contains 3 or 4 elements and is a strong, directional antenna commonly used to determine the location of a transmitter. Antennas can also be affixed to towers. This allows the antenna to be positioned higher, avoiding interference from buildings and trees. Boat, aircraft, and vehicle-mounted antennas allow the operator to exploit a larger area while tracking.|$|R
50|$|The Watson-Watt {{technique}} uses two <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> pairs {{to perform}} an amplitude comparison on the incoming signal. An <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> pair {{is a pair of}} monopole or dipole antennas that takes the vector difference of the received signal at each antenna so {{that there is only one}} output from the pair of antennas. Two of these pairs are co-located but perpendicularly oriented to produce what can be referred to as the N-S (North-South) and E-W (East-West) signals that will then be passed to the receiver. In the receiver, the bearing angle can then be computed by taking the arctangent of the ratio of the N-S to E-W signal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> array {{has been}} widely used commercially, and {{implemented}} in vertical antenna heights ranging from over 130 feet (40 meters) in the LFR network, to as small as 5 inches (13 cm) in tactical direction finding applications (receiving in the UHF band).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> is an {{arrangement}} of four monopole masts that act as two virtual loop antennas arranged at right angles. By comparing the signals received on the two virtual loops, the direction to the signal can be determined using existing RDF techniques. Researchers had set up the antenna in 1919 but had been neglecting it in favour of smaller designs. These {{were found to have}} very poor performance due to the electrical characteristics of the Slough area, which made it difficult to determine if a signal was being received on a straight line or down from the sky. Smith-Rose and Barfield turned their attention back to the <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna,</b> which had no horizontal component and thus filtered out the [...] "skywaves". In a series of follow-up experiments they were able to accurately determine the location of transmitters around the country.|$|E
50|$|Adcock - who {{was serving}} as an Army officer in the British Expeditionary Force in wartime France {{at the time he}} filed his {{invention}} - solved this problem by replacing the loop antennas with symmetrically inter-connected pairs of vertical monopole or dipole antennas of equal length. This created the equivalent of square loops, but without their horizontal members, thus eliminating sensitivity to much of the horizontally polarized distortion. The same principles remain valid today, and the <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> array and its variants are still used for radio direction finding.|$|E

50|$|Watt {{worked at}} the RAF's Met Office in Aldershot, but in 1924 they decided to return the {{location}} to use for the RAF. In July 1924 Watt {{moved to a new}} location at Ditton Park near Slough. This site already hosted the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) Radio Section research site. Watt was involved in the Atmospherics branch, making basic studies in the propagation of radio signals through the atmosphere, while the NPL were involved in field strength measurements in the field and direction finding investigations. NPL had two devices used in these studies that would prove critical to the development of huff-duff, an <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> and a modern oscilloscope.|$|E
50|$|A major {{improvement}} in the RDF technique was introduced by Robert Watson-Watt {{as part of his}} experiments to locate lightning strikes as a method to indicate the direction of thunderstorms to sailors and airmen. He had long worked with conventional RDF systems, but these were difficult to use with the fleeting signals from the lightning. He had early on suggested the use of an oscilloscope to display these near instantly, but was unable to find one while working at the Met Office. When the office was moved, his new location at a radio research station provided him with both an <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> and a suitable oscilloscope, and he presented his new system in 1926.|$|E
50|$|Early RDF {{systems were}} useful largely for long wave signals. These signals {{are able to}} travel very long distances, which made them useful for {{long-range}} navigation. However, when the same technique was being applied to higher frequencies, unexpected difficulties arose due to the reflection of high frequency signals from the ionosphere. The RDF station might now receive the same signal from two or more locations, especially during the day, which caused serious problems trying to determine the location. This led to the 1919 introduction of the <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> (UK Patent 130,490), which consisted of four separate monopole antennas instead of two loops, eliminating the horizontal components and thus filtering out the sky waves being reflected down from the ionosphere. Adcock antennas were widely used with Bellini-Tosi detectors from the 1920s on.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, Robert Watt had {{developed}} {{the most advanced}} form of basic RDF in 1922. Watt {{was working for the}} Met Office in a lab that was colocated at the National Physical Laboratory's (NPL) Radio Research Section (RRS) at Ditton Park in Slough. He became interested in using the fleeting radio signals given off by lightning as a way to track thunderstorms. However, existing RDF techniques were too slow to allow the direction to be determined. He solved this by connecting a cathode ray tube to a directional <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> array, originally built by the RRS but now unused. This system, later known as huff-duff, allowed the almost instantaneous determination of the bearing of a signal. The Met Office began using it to produce storm warnings for aviators.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first was}} an <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna,</b> an {{arrangement}} of four masts that allowed the signal to be directed through phase differences. Using these as two separate loop antennas at right angles, one could make a simultaneous measurement of the lightning's direction in two axes. However, displaying the fleeting signals was a problem. This was solved by the second device, the WE-224 oscilloscope, recently acquired from Bell Labs. By feeding the signals from the two antennas into the X and Y channels of the oscilloscope, a single strike caused {{the appearance of a}} line on the display, indicating the direction of the strike. The scope's relatively [...] "slow" [...] phosphor allowed the signal to be read long after the strike had occurred. Watt's new system was being used in 1926 and was the topic of an extensive paper by Watt and Herd.|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of polarization error measurements {{made on a}} fat four-element and a thin eight-element <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> system, each feeding an identical twin-channel direction-finding receiver. The effect of random polarization of the received wave on the variance is investigated and comparative "bearing versus time" records for the two systems are shown.

40|$|Different {{antenna systems}} were tested for both {{horizontal}} and vertical directivity on this wavelength at distances of from 7 to 30 miles. The antennas used in these experiments included parabolic antenna, V-type, double V-type, Adcock antennas, etc. Using an <b>Adcock</b> <b>antenna</b> the azimuth of the incoming electromagnetic wave can be defined within one half degree accuracy, and with a slight modification of the receiving elements to form a horizontal H antenna, the vertical angle of the incoming wave can also be obtained with {{the same degree of}} accuracy. The former antenna can be converted into the latter by mechanical means within a few seconds and thus both vertical and horizontal angles can be measured with the same antenna set-up. With the antenna one and a half wavelengths above the ground and with the ground surface homogeneous in the immediate vicinity of the receiving antenna, the direction of the incoming electromagnetic wave coincides with that of the transmitter emitting the wave, with in the same accuracy of one half degree. Deviations from the true directions at different locations and at different times were observed. A simple theory of reception of the horizontal H and the Adcock antennas were also given. The receiver used for this experiment is a superheterodyne receiver specially designed for this purpose using a resistance-coupled I-F ampligier. It is very stable in operation and has ample sensitivity. </p...|$|E
