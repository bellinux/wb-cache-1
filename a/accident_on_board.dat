5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an <b>accident</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An {{official}} report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E
25|$|Accidents in the Indian navy {{have been}} {{attributed}} to ageing ships in need of maintenance, delayed acquisitions by the Ministry of Defence, and human error. However naval commentators also argue that as India's large navy of 160 ships clocks around 12,000 ship-days at sea every year, in varied waters and weather, some incidents are inevitable. Captains of erring ships are dismissed from their command following an enquiry. The <b>accident</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> INS Sindhuratna (S59) led to the resignation of the then Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral D K Joshi on 26 February 2014, who owned moral responsibility. The navy is envisaging a new 'Safety Organisation' to improve safety of its warships, nuclear submarines and aircraft in view of its planned increase in fleet strength over the next decade.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: In case of pathologies or <b>accidents</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> {{which require}} medical {{intervention}} but lacking on-board medical or paramedical personnel, the ship’s captain, or his delegate can contact a Telemedical Maritime Assistance Service (TMAS). International Maritime Organisation considers telemedicine at sea {{as an integral}} part of rescue procedures. Five key elements contribute to the delivery of good medical assistance at sea: one or more coordination and rescue centres; the TMAS; the possibility of intervention at sea; an organisation of appropriate institutions on ground and common operating procedures. This paper analyses the responsibility of the ship’s captain and of the TMAS doctor in case of diseases or injuries <b>on</b> <b>board</b> in the frame of the main important international regulations. Responsibility of the ship captain: In case of a disease or injury <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a ship, the captain must contact the TMAS as soon as possible. A captain not acting promptly and not doing whatever it is possible for the ill/injured person by consulting the TMAS or a physician and/or not following prescriptions received, could be charged for omission of responsibility. A captain underestimating a medical problem and knowing that the patient’s condition could worsen, but still not consulting a medical centre for assistance, should be ready to accept the consequences of his choices. Responsibility of the physician: The doctor of TMAS has full responsibility for the diagnosis, prescription and treatment, while the ship’s captain is responsible for the final decision. Regarding the medical treatment and assistance <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a ship, the TMAS doctor should pay attention not only for the diagnosis, but also for the prognosis. Telemedicine implies that the doctor should make decisions without a clinical examination, often without some additional medical examinations and by maintaining a contact with other people who are in direct contact with the patient. The physician usually has to rely on the account of colleagues of the sick seafarer as far as medical history is concerned. This may make harder to take a decision. Conclusions: The ship’s captain is guilty if he fails to contact a TMAS in case of diseases or <b>accidents</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> Similar to a traditional relationship between a patient and a physician, the doctor consulted via telecommunication systems is also responsible for his diagnosis and treatment. However, in telemedicine the contrasts with the most basic principles of the traditional medicine are obvious. This makes the delivery of medical care of seafarers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ships quite complicated...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} “Motorways of the sea” {{represents}} {{a part of}} the door-to-door logistic chain in which the maritime segment of the journey is organized according to the principle of short sea shipping. The main principle of the concept is to encourage the use of the environmental friendly mode of transport such as the sea transport aimed at providing positive effect on the reduction of air pollutant emissions and enhancing connections within the EU member states. In this matter, maritime traffic is increasing in particular sea areas with the possibility of potential emergence and appearance of maritime <b>accidents</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ships engaged in the “motorways of the sea” service. Generally, the “motorways of the sea” service uses Ro-Ro and Ro-Ro passenger ships, which have a design different from other types of ships, as well as some special features in terms of safety. This paper has analysed the particular safety features of Ro-Ro and Ro-Ro passenger ships, the maritime accidents involving these ships and the measures to increase safety of ships arising from maritime accidents...|$|R

40|$|SAFETY OF FISHERMEN: RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS AND THE INFLUENCE OF VESSEL NAUTICAL PROPERTIES G. Boccadamo Dipartimento di Ingegneria Navale - University “Federico II” of Naples A. Scamardella Dipartimento di Scienze Applicate - University "Parthenope" of Naples ABSTRACT: A {{presentation}} {{and discussion of}} the results of an in-the-field investigation into safety and the working conditions of fishermen operating in the Campania Region of Italy. The investigation has focused on two main topics: a quantitative assessment of the risks involved in fishing activities; the influence of the sea keeping and manoeuvring characteristics of the fishing vessels on both the working conditions of personnel and vessel operability. The tool adopted is a questionnaire distributed among fishermen. In this way a snapshot of the current situation has been obtained, and a comparison with the “ideal” situation as depicted by the Rules currently in force has been made. Suggestions for a more effective application of the Rules in order to avoid <b>accidents</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and for further research development have been obtained from the analysis of the questionnaire results. Results highlight that the gap between the ideal situation, construed from the Rules, and actual reality is still too great...|$|R
40|$|The prototypes of {{unmanned}} merchant {{vessels are}} expected to come into service within the coming years. The main line of argument supporting their introduction pertains {{to the increase in}} navigational safety, which is expected to be achieved by reducing the frequency of human-related <b>accidents</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ships, by removing the crews. On the other hand, the response of unmanned ship to potential accidents is still uncertain. With enthusiasm on one side and apprehension on the other, the literature lacks an objective study on the effect of unmanned ships on safety of maritime transportation. This paper constitutes an attempt to bridge the aforementioned gap by applying a framework based on what-if analysis to a hundred maritime accident reports. The aim of the analysis is to assess whether the accident would have happened if the ship had been unmanned, and once the accident had happened - would its consequences have been different. The results obtained reveal that the occurrence of navigational accidents (e. g. collision, grounding) can be expected to decrease with the development of unmanned ship. However the extent of consequences resulting particularly from non-navigational accidents (e. g. fire, ship loss due to structural failure) can be expected to be much larger for the unmanned ships when compared to the conventional ones.

40|$|Seafaring {{represents}} a particularly hazardous occupation {{when compared with}} shore-based activities and seafarers are exposed to risks rarely encountered by workers in other occupations. People living ashore may have medical services available within a short time. <b>On</b> <b>board</b> ships the situation is different {{and the majority of}} vessels is at sea for days or weeks before they can reach a port. On the other hand, ship {{represents a}}t the same time working place and living quarter and only very few ships carry a doctor or an adequately trained paramedic <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> In this situation, the best possibilities for treating diseases or <b>accidents</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> are : (i) to provide medical advice via telecommunications systems; (ii) to guarantee adequate training of personnel with the responsibility of health care on board; (iii) to have an adequate supply of drugs and essential medical equipment. Pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies carried by shipping vessels constitute the so-called ship’s medicine chest. The contents of the medicine chest and the medical equipment carried <b>on</b> <b>board</b> is prescribed by national authorities taking into account international recommendations in this field, such as those of the International Medical Guide for Ships and the List of Essential Drugs published by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as advances in medical knowledge and approved methods of treatment. The last edition of the Medical Guide for Ships and the List of Essential Drugs were published recently (2008). Contents of the medicine chest and of medical supplied to be carried by ships should consider the type of ship, the number of persons <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the nature, destination and duration of voyages. Literature available on ship’s medicine chest and more in general on maritime pharmacy is sparse and criteria followed by national authorities or by international organizations in establishing their contents are not known. The Working Group Ships Medicines established by the Community Pharmacy Section (CPS) of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) has provided an important counseling on the List of Essential Drugs recently recommended by WHO. The Group proposed an international forum to develop international standards of a global quality management system for maritime pharmacy or an internationally accepted guide issued by the WHO. Unfortunately, adeqate (pharmaco) epidemiological data on diseases occurring <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ships, their standard treatment(s) and on the use of medicines on ships serving as a reference for these actions are still missing. Taking into account that telemedical advice is largely used for treating diseases occurring <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ships, we have undertaken an extensive analysis on the type of medications most often used in telemedical assistance to ships. Analysis was based on the review of medical files assisted by Centro Internazionale Radio Medico (CIRM) in 2004 - 2008. CIRM is the Italian Telemedical Maritime Assistance Service (TMAS) and has one of the largest experience in the world of medical assistance of seafarers with more than 60, 000 patients assisted <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ships. The investigation has evaluated the following items: No. of patient’s file, ship’s flag and position, language of teleconsultation, age and sex of patient, rank, days of assistance and number of teleconsultations, diagnosis (ICD- 10), drug(s) prescribed (ATC), dosage. Based on pharmacotherapeutic guidelines for a given diagnosis, treatment prescribed <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ship and optimal (according to the guidelines) possible therapy will be defined. The expected results may serve as a reference for future regulations on the contents of the medicine chest...|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} tests seem {{to provide a}} {{workable}} balance between {{the interests of the}} claimant and the defendant by selecting the law of the place in which the claimant suffered the harm, but problems remain. In Henderson v Jaouen (2002) 2 All ER 705 there was continuing damage as the condition arising from original injury deteriorated. Similarly, in Roerig v Valiant Trawlers Ltd. 2002 1 Ll Rep 681, where the <b>accident</b> occurred <b>on</b> <b>board</b> an English ship, the main consequences in terms of loss were felt by the deceased's family in the Netherlands (their habitual residence), not England. The third rule which will apply in economic torts, breach of privacy etc., requires a test comparable to the proper law. In Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd 1983 Ch 258 negligent management decisions were based on financial reports prepared in England. Because the decisions were taken and the losses were sustained outside England, English law was not the most significant. In Metall und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin & Janrette Inc 1990 1 QB 391 action in New York induced a breach of contract in England where the loss was sustained, so English law was the more significant.|$|R
