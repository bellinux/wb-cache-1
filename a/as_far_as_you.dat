The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (<b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} 2003–04 edition as holders of the cup. The team were undefeated in 14 cup ties since their 2–1 loss to Liverpool in the 2001 FA Cup Final, and aimed {{to win the}} {{competition}} for a third season in succession, something last achieved by Blackburn Rovers from 1884 to 1886. Henry believed Arsenal's good cup form showed they were [...] "interested" [...] in the competition and hoped their success would continue. The FA Cup was not high in Wenger's priority list – [...] "The [...] and the Champions League are more important," [...] but he clarified this never meant Arsenal intended to neglect the competition: [...] "You win what you can and go <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can." ...|$|E

500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

He went to the early lead and set a moderate pace, then responded to a brief challenge by pulling away under a hand ride. The win earned Holy Bull a Beyer of 113. After the race, Smith was confident in the colt's ability to go an extra furlong in the upcoming Kentucky Derby. [...] "He would have gone around again today," [...] he said.

2500|$|Hughes was {{a skilled}} Australian rules footballer {{as a junior}} and was invited {{to play with the}} Claremont Football Club in the West Australian National Football League. He played two seasons at Claremont—1973 and 1974—alternating between the under-21 and the reserve teams, but did not manage to make the senior team. The Claremont coach, Verdun Howell, {{described}} Hughes as having [...] "Great ball skills, brilliant hand-eye coordination and a very, very reliable kickAnd he showed courage. He went full throttle at the ball and didn't look for a second option." [...] Howell told Hughes one evening at practice, [...] "I believe you could go <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> want in football." [...] Hughes played at full forward for the under-21 team and mainly in the centre in the reserves. His brief football career was interrupted by injury—he broke his neck falling off a desk at teachers college—and eventually he advised Howell that he was [...] "very much looking towards cricket" [...] in future.|$|E

Though Abu Ayyub was by then an old man, that did not deter him from enlisting. Shortly after {{engaging}} in battle, it is recorded that he fell ill and had to withdraw.

Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to be on our guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man about my age at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, that I took him to Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He told me I was squaw and a coward. I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E
