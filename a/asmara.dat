5|$|In 1958 <b>Asmara</b> {{became the}} head of the {{entertainment}} magazine Varia, where the fellow director Raden Ariffien served as his deputy. <b>Asmara</b> held the position until his death; among other roles, he wrote a series of memoires on the history of theatre in the country. He died on 20October 1961 in Cipanas, West Java, during a trip to Bandung and was buried in Jakarta.|$|E
5|$|<b>Asmara</b> Moerni was {{directed}} by Rd Ariffien, a former journalist who had {{been active in the}} nationalist and labour movements before turning to theatre. He had joined Union Films– the company behind <b>Asmara</b> Moerni– in 1940, making his debut with Harta Berdarah (Bloody Treasure). Union's head Ang Hock Liem produced, while the story was written by journalist Saeroen, who had joined Union after commercial success on Albert Balink's Terang Boelan (Full Moon, 1937) and with the production house Tan's Film.|$|E

5|$|Effendi did not direct another film until 1951, with Djiwa Pemuda, and {{the first}} {{subsequent}} native film director, Andjar <b>Asmara,</b> only began his career in 1940, with Kartinah. Tan's shut down production soon after Njai Dasima release, although it was eventually reestablished in 1938. After releasing several commercial successes, particularly Fatima (1938), it was permanently shut down in 1942, with the Japanese occupation of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|In {{a period}} of two years, Union {{released}} seven films; all were feature length, made in black-and-white, and received wide releases in the Dutch East Indies. Several were screened in nearby Singapore, including Bajar dengan Djiwa and <b>Asmara</b> Moerni. Though its films were screened at least into the 1940s, the company's output is likely lost.|$|E
5|$|Some places, (for example, the Altiplano in Peru and Bolivia, or {{the plateau}} around <b>Asmara</b> (where the airport is) in Eritrea, and some {{mountain}} passes), are many thousand {{feet above sea}} level and travelling to such places after diving at lower altitude should be treated as flying at the equivalent altitude after diving.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the increasingly frank depiction of sexuality by female writers such as Ayu Utami {{after the fall of}} the New Order, <b>Asmara's</b> works take a more conservative view. Tineke Hellwig of the University of British Columbia, Biola Tak Berdawai is anti-feminist to the point of being misogynistic. Her female characters are often pregnant or have undergone an abortion; several also have cancer of the reproductive organs. According to Hellwig, the traditional view of women being loving mothers is idealized in <b>Asmara's</b> works, but rarely shown.|$|R
50|$|Addie MS, a {{musician}} cum conductor from the Twilite Orchestra and <b>Asmara's</b> long-time friend, {{was chosen to}} compose the film's music. The Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra in Melbourne, Australia, provided the music.|$|R

5|$|After <b>Asmara</b> Moerni, Union {{produced}} a further three films; only one, Wanita dan Satria, was by Rd Ariffien, {{who left the}} company soon after, as did Saeroen. Gani did not act in any further films, but instead returned to the nationalist movement. During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–49) he became known as a smuggler, and after independence became a government minister. In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles.|$|E
5|$|After {{handling}} the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna <b>Asmara.</b> Academia {{was critical of}} the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E
5|$|Asia Raya {{contributors}} were Japanese or native, {{with the}} latter more active; works by two foreign authors, Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi, were also published in translation. The single most-published writer in Asia Raya was Rosihan Anwar, a recent senior high school graduate, who published seven poems and nine short stories while working for the newspaper. Andjar <b>Asmara,</b> a former film director, published the most serials; both of his serials were based on films he had made before the occupation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Asmara's</b> first {{revenues}} were issued in 1940 showing the city's coat of arms. When {{it was an}} Italian colony, two sets were issued, one for health inspection fees (Diritti Sanitari) {{and the other for}} secretariat fees (Diritti di Segretaria).|$|R
50|$|Rentjong Atjeh was a {{commercial}} success, which the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits to Andjar <b>Asmara's</b> marketing skills. Following this, JIF began regularly publishing a promotional magazine titled JIF Journal which carried information on its upcoming productions.|$|R
5000|$|In the <b>Asmara's</b> Opera were {{performed}} many [...] "Commedie" [...] and opera works {{like those of}} Pirandello and music by Puccini and Verdi, with soprano from the best theaters in Italy: for example, in 1951 was performed [...] "La Patente" [...] of Pirandello and music of Chopin.|$|R
5|$|<b>Asmara</b> Moerni was {{screened}} {{as late as}} November 1945. The film {{is likely}} lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E
5|$|Panggilan Darah was the directorial {{debut of}} Sutan Usman Karim, {{commonly}} known as Suska, a journalist and {{former member of the}} touring theatrical group Bolero under Andjar <b>Asmara.</b> With Panggilan Darah, which he also wrote, Suska became one of several reporters who entered the film industry in the 1940s. He directed the film for the Batavia-based film company Oriental, run by the ethnic Chinese producer Tjho Seng Han. The production house had previously released three films, all directed by Njoo Cheong Seng, but after Njoo departed for Fred Young's Majestic, Oriental had required a new director.|$|E
5|$|SPFC hired Andjar <b>Asmara,</b> {{a former}} {{journalist}} and stagewriter {{who had been}} active with The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct Djaoeh Dimata; he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name. However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar {{was more of an}} acting and dialogue coach; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product. Max Tera served as assistant cinematographer on this black-and-white film.|$|E
50|$|As he was {{a talented}} {{football}} player, in 1934 {{he was a}}sked to join the Dardanella theatre company as a footballer during their tour of southeast and south Asia. Every time the troupe arrived in a new city, he and the Dardanella side would play an exhibition game to draw potential audiences. When not playing football, Urip would help with poster design, or take on roles as an extra. In 1936, while producing a film adaptation of Andjar <b>Asmara's</b> play Dr Samsi in India, the company dissolved. After Dardanella's dissolution, Urip made {{his way back to the}} Indies and joined <b>Asmara's</b> new troupe Bolero, with whom he stayed until 1937, when he migrated to Fifi Young's Pagoda, under Njoo Cheong Seng. He stayed with this latter company until 1939.|$|R
25|$|The square {{where the}} <b>Asmara's</b> central {{post office and}} National Bank of Eritrea (former Palace of National Bank of Italy) are located was named Piazza Roma (Rome Square), but after {{independence}} it was dedicated to Zerai's memory. A number of roads, schools, hotels, and restaurants are also named after Zerai.|$|R
50|$|Elang Darat was {{produced}} by The Teng Chun for the Jacatra Film Company, a subsidiary of his Java Industrial Film. It was {{written and directed by}} former journalist Inoe Perbatasari, who had previously been assistant director on Andjar <b>Asmara's</b> Kartinah. Camerawork for the black-and-white film was handled by Tan Kim An, while sound editing was completed by The Teng Chun's brother The Teng Liong.|$|R
5|$|The colony's first directors, Heuveldorp and G. Kruger, were of European {{or mixed}} descent. They were {{followed}} by ethnic Chinese soon after, when Nelson Wong made his debut in 1928 with Lily van Java; other Chinese directors included Lie Tek Swie (1929), Wong's brothers Joshua and Othniel (1930), and The Teng Chun (1931). Ethnic Chinese directors dominated the colony's cinema {{for the remainder of}} its existence. The first native director, Bachtiar Effendi, made his debut in 1932 with the talkie Njai Dasima; another native director would not appear until Andjar <b>Asmara</b> and Rd Ariffien made their debuts in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two {{people are}} {{recorded}} as having produced fictional {{films in the}} Dutch East Indies between 1926, when L. Heuveldorp released Loetoeng Kasaroeng, the colony's first domestically produced film, and 1949, when the Dutch formally recognised Indonesia's sovereignty after a four-year revolution, leaving the Dutch East Indies defunct. Altogether they are credited for 93 of all known films produced in the Indies, and four of them remained active after independence. All were men; the first female film producer in Indonesia, Ratna <b>Asmara,</b> produced her first film in 1953.|$|E
5|$|After Bajar Dengan Djiwa, Union {{produced}} a further five films; {{all but one}} were directed by Hu or Ariffien. Saeroen wrote two of them, leaving for Star Film following Wanita dan Satria (1941). Much of the cast remained with Union for several productions. The company's subsequent production, <b>Asmara</b> Moerni (1941), for instance, had Djoewariah in the leading role, alongside a new hire (the doctor Adnan Kapau Gani). Union Films was ultimately dissolved following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in March 1942. In 2011 Ade Irwansyah of Tabloid Bintang listed the poster for Bajar Dengan Djiwa {{as one of the}} best Indonesian film posters of all time.|$|E

The reservoir can hold [...] of water; there is a pumping station at its toe, leading to a water filtration plant. This has a capacity of [...] water per day which is delivered {{to the city of}} <b>Asmara's</b> distribution system.|$|R
5000|$|Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum was {{released}} in 1948, {{and at least one}} advertisement took advantage of the lasting star power of Roekiah, who had been the main draw of Tan's Film; the advertisement included the line [...] "Roekiah? No! But Sofia in a new Indonesian film, Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum". The film was the second domestic feature production {{since the end of the}} occupation, following Andjar <b>Asmara's</b> Djaoeh Dimata for the South Pacific Film Corporation. Both films had similar themes, but ultimately Air Mata dari Tjitarum was the bigger box-office hit.|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, {{the story}} of the Eritrean patriot was rewritten by Ethiopian comedian Yilma Manaye in his work Zeraye Derese. This {{character}} was interpreted by Wegayehu Nigatu (1944–1990), a popular actor at the Ethiopian National Theater in Addis Ababa at the time. When the play was staged in Eritrea at <b>Asmara's</b> Opera, Wegayehu Nigatu's interpretation of Zerai was successfully received by the audience and his performance was so convincing that Tesfazien Deres wanted to host the actor for two weeks in order {{to have the opportunity to}} converse with him as with his dead brother.|$|R
5|$|Andjar's {{screenplay}} Dr Samsi {{was finally}} adapted {{as a film}} in 1952 by Ratna <b>Asmara,</b> who had become Indonesia's first female film director with her 1950 film Sedap Malam (Sweetness of the Night). The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail. It would prove Andjar's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime. Although no longer writing films, Andjar remained active in the country's film industry. In 1955 he headed the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival, which was criticized when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films, Usmar Ismail's Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew) and Lilik Sudjio's Tarmina. Critics wrote that Lewat Djam Malam was easily the stronger of the two and suggested that Djamaluddin Malik, Tarmina producer, had influenced the jury's decision.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in <b>Asmara</b> Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
5|$|Structurally, Amir's {{early works}} are quite {{different}} from his later ones. The works compiled in Buah Rindu generally followed the traditional pantun and syair style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with rhyming couplets; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, resulting in a different rhythm. Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as menangis (cry), duka (grief), rindu (longing), and air mata (tears), as well as words such as cinta (love), <b>asmara</b> (passion), and merantau (wander).|$|E
5000|$|The Indonesian film {{historian}} Misbach Yusa Biran credits Njoo {{with helping}} Miss Riboet dominate the country's touring theatre industry from 1929 until 1931. This was echoed by the leftist Indonesian literary critic Bakri Siregar, who writes that Njoo and fellow dramatist Andjar <b>Asmara's</b> stage plays revitalised the genre in the Indies {{and made the}} works more realistic. However, he considered the conflict in these works to have been poorly developed. The literary teacher Doris Jedamski describes him as [...] "one of the most famous, most creative, and most productive Chinese-Malay authors of the twentieth century", noting with surprise that {{little research has been}} done into his life.|$|R
50|$|By the {{following}} year Astaman had abandoned Constantinople to join the troupe Dardanella, which was run by the Penang-born actor of Russian descent Willy A. Piedro and his native wife Dewi Dja'. The troupe, which was highly successful and travelled throughout Southeast Asia, helped Astaman rise to prominence. He played various roles with them, and starred in several of their performances, including Andjar <b>Asmara's</b> Dr Samsi and a stage adaptation of Kwee Tek Hoay's Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang. In a 1964 interview with the variety magazine Varia, he recalled that every time he played a king the European viewers would laugh loudly; Astaman later learned that his costume {{was that of a}} matador.|$|R
