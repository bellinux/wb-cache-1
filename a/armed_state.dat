2500|$|Maharaja Ranjit Singh was a Sikh {{ruler of}} the {{sovereign}} country of Punjab and the Sikh Empire. His father Maha Singh led Sukerchakia, a misl within the Sikh Confederacy.

He united the Sikh factions into the Sikh Empire and took the title [...] "Maharaja" [...] on 13 April 1801, to coincide with Baisakhi. Lahore was his capital from 1799. In 1802 he conquered Amritsar, a holy city of the Sikh religion. In 1822 Ranjit Singh hired European mercenaries {{for the first time to}} train a part of his troops. He modernized his army, creating a military force whose power delayed the eventual British colonization of Punjab. The result was a powerful and heavily <b>armed</b> <b>state.</b> The Battle of Jamrud in 1837 was a major setback for Ranjit Singh: his general Hari Singh Nalwa was killed, the Khyber Pass was established as the western limit of the Sikh Empire's influence.|$|E

2500|$|Frick {{had ordered}} the {{construction}} of a solid board fence topped with barbed wire around mill property. The workers dubbed the newly fortified mill [...] "Fort Frick." [...] With the mill ringed by striking workers, agents from the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, which Frick had contracted to provide security at the plant in April 1892, planned to access the plant grounds from the river. Three hundred Pinkerton detectives assembled on the Davis Island Dam on the Ohio River about five miles (8km) below Pittsburgh at 10:30p.m. on the night of July 5, 1892. They were given Winchester rifles, placed on two specially-equipped barges and towed upriver with the object of removing the workers by force. Upon their landing, a large mêlée between workers and Pinkerton detectives ensued. Several men were killed, nine workers among them, and the riot was ultimately quelled only by the intervention of 8,000 <b>armed</b> <b>state</b> militia. Among working-class Americans, Frick's actions against the strikers were condemned as excessive, and he soon became a target of even more union organizers.|$|E

50|$|Iron Curtain uses C-band radar, a {{distributed}} optical sensor, and {{a ring of}} ballistic countermeasures {{to neutralize}} incoming threats. First the radar detects and tracks the incoming round and alerts the system. It then switches from armed-ready state to an <b>armed</b> <b>state.</b> As the round comes into close range, the optical sensor profiles the threat and tracks it within 1 cm of accuracy to select an aimpoint and determine which ballistic countermeasure to fire. The countermeasure fires straight down or up, neutralizing the incoming threat within inches of the vehicle, separating the system from many others which intercept threats several meters out, resulting in minimal risk of collateral damage to dismounted troops or civilians. The countermeasure deflagrates the RPG warhead without detonating it, leaving the dudded round to bounce off the vehicles side.|$|E
