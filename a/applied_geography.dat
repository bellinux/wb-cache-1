The ways that geography education has contributed to citizenship education as the two have developed during this century are examined.

40|$|In the GREAT-ER project (Geography-referenced Regional Exposure Assessment Tool for European Rivers) {{a refined}} {{exposure}} assessment method for `down-the-drain' chemicals was developed. Real-world data are used, including {{spatial and temporal}} variability and uncertainty. The results are geo-referenced distributions of predicted environmental concentrations (PEC). To calculate these distributions, a hybrid stochastic/deterministic simulation approach is <b>applied.</b> <b>Geographies</b> are segmented, based on river network properties. In each segment, several processes (emission or transport/conversion) can occur, which further consist of sub-processes (e. g. different treatment types). The system's core consists of steady-state deterministic models, which describe chemical fate processes in `main rivers' and in the waste water pathway (emission, transport, treatment). The results of these models are discrete PECs in the considered catchments. A stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulation is applied on top o [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Urban sprawl {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{problems}} of modern urbanism. Cities too much sprawled produce more contamination and worst quality life conditions. The current urban policies attempt to slow the advanced societies tendency to generate sprawled cities. There are a lot of contributions in the urban economics literature that try to understand the causes of sprawl in order to propose policies to reduce it. Many of these papers put their attention on the local policy decentralization as a relevant factor which impulse the probabilities of suffer a dispersed city growth. In this paper we put our attention in a very common situation around Europe: emerging metropolitan areas which appear as a consequence of the growth of closer previous medium cities. Just in Spain there are more than 60 cases that could be consider as this type of emerging metropolitan areas. We study specifically the case of Asturias: a small region in the north of Spain in which three cities growth generate an emerging polycentric and decentralized metropolitan area. We <b>apply</b> <b>Geography</b> Information Systems to study and contrast several hypothesis in this case. Our result conduct us to confirm that this case trend to generate sprawl due to the role of the small local areas, which are integrated in the emerging metropolitan space. However, this behavior could be easily avoided thought a political integration of the new metropolitan area...|$|R
