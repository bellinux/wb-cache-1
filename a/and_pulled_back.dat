5|$|On 21March, at 2200, Jourdan {{ordered the}} wounded {{to be transported}} to Schaffhausen in Switzerland, via Stockach. The main army then began its own retreat {{in the early morning}} of the 22nd. The reserve {{division}} of d'Hautpoul left first, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> via Stockach to Emmengen ob Eck. The first division pulled back to Bodman, on the northern tip of the Überlingen-finger of Lake Constance; in the retreat, a portion of the force was encircled and cut off by the 2nd Lancers of Karl Philipp, Prince Schwarzenberg's brigade, and more than 500were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can {{be transmitted}} through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E

25|$|By 11 November, Alvinczi's advance {{elements}} reached Caldiero, east of Verona. Believing that Verona {{was being}} evacuated, General-major Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen moved forward. But Bonaparte sent the divisions of Masséna and Augereau across the Adige River {{to engage the}} Austrians. Hohenzollern lost 400 men <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to a ridge running north of Caldiero. Bonaparte determined to attack the Austrians the next day.|$|E
25|$|White's {{consistency}} {{diminished in}} the 2004/2005 season. Although his ranking rose to number 8 {{he was unable}} to reach the quarter-finals of any ranking event. However he made two more memorable comebacks in the 2005 Masters. White trailed Matthew Stevens 2–5 in the first-round <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to 4–5 after needing two snookers in the ninth frame. White went on to win 6–5 and beat Stevens's compatriot Mark Williams by the same score in the quarter-finals after trailing 4–5. But White was soundly beaten 6–1 by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|By this time, single battalions of the 46th Line and 24th Light were {{committed}} to defend the Lomitten bridgehead. The action lasted eight hours, {{at the end of}} which, the Russians attempted to storm the position in one massive column. This assault came to naught when two French battalions counterattacked. Orders arrived from Soult permitting Carra Saint-Cyr to evacuate the bridgehead. Since the Russian artillery had nearly leveled the earthworks and set the village of Lomitten on fire, the division commander exercised his discretion <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> Even so, the French still blocked the bridge and the Russians fell back toward Wormditt at 8:00 PM.|$|E

25|$|Farther west {{there were}} clashes at Saluzzo and Pinerolo. On 16 October 1799 the {{divisions}} of Victor and François Muller attacked the Austrians at Beinette with serious losses on both sides. Finally, Melas {{gave up his}} attempted siege of Cuneo <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> Lemoine's division was involved in actions at Mondovì on 27–28 October. On 31 October 1799, Melas with 15,000 soldiers drubbed Grenier with 7,000 at Centallo. The French suffered 1,000 casualties while the Austrians lost only 200 and captured four guns. However, the French gradually pressed forward toward Fossano. Duhesme fought an Austrian force at Pinerolo on 1 November {{and the next day}} the French captured Mondovì.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, the Romanian 2nd and 4th Infantry Divisions {{took over}} 2nd Ukrainian Front {{bridgehead}}s on the Tisza below Szolnok. The bridgehead of the 4th Division was attacked on 19 October by the Hungarian 1st Cavalry and 1st Infantry Divisions, which the 4th Division held back until {{hit on the}} right flank by the German 24th Panzer Division, 4th SS Panzergrenadier Division, and the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion. The right flank of the Romanian 4th Division caved in and the German armor drove behind the division, cutting it off from the Tisza River and eventually forcing its surrender by 20 October. On 25 October, three Hungarian divisions (1st Cavalry, 1st Infantry and 20th Infantry) attacked the Romanian 2nd Division in its bridgehead. The Romanian 2nd Division panicked <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> across the Tisza River. This Hungarian success, however, was not repeated when a third assault was made during 26–29 October against the Romanian 19th Infantry Division's bridgehead at Alpar.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Albert Gyulay {{abandoned}} Tarvisio <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> {{behind a}} stream {{on the east}} side of the town. The position was buttressed with a line of fortified redoubts. But the batteries were armed with only 10 of the 24 cannons that were planned. He deployed elements of the brigades of Gajoli, Marziani, and Lutz, plus the Strassoldo Infantry Regiment # 27. After securing Malborghetto, Grenier rapidly moved his two divisions to join those of Baraguey d'Hilliers at Tarvisio in a noon attack. An Italian division overran a key redoubt on Gyulay's left and began to flank the Austrian infantry out of position. As the line began to crack, Grenier's troops advanced, forcing Gyulay to order a retreat. Under pressure of superior numbers, the Austrian troops panicked and fled, losing as many as 3,000 killed, wounded, and captured. Gyulay reported losing 217 men killed, 271 wounded, 1,301 captured, and 170 missing, a total of 1,959 and six guns.|$|E

40|$|To solve {{real-world}} {{problems by}} Genetic Algorithms (GAs), GAs {{that have a}} strong searching capability are needed. In this paper, Distributed Probabilistic Model-Building Genetic Algorithm (DPMBGA) is applied to solve the problems. The DPMBGA is an extended algorithm of Probabilistic Model-Building GA (PMBGA) and {{it also has a}} strong searching capability. In realworld problems, constraints often exist. As such, mechanisms that can treat the constraints should be added to the GAs. Two mechanisms for treating constraints are the penalty method <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method. The DPMBGA with the penalty method <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method is applied to truss structural optimization problems. Through a simulation, the searching capability and efficiency of the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method <b>and</b> penalty method are discussed. From the discussion, it is concluded that the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method can derive the solutions even if the problem is difficult. Compared to the penalty method, the number of the individuals that violate the constraints is smaller in the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method. ...|$|R

25|$|The 2nd Brigade reached Samawah at 3:00 AM on 30 March, {{expecting to}} assault a trench {{line on the}} eastern {{outskirts}} of the town. Instead, they discovered a sand berm surrounding a landfill, which was not defended by enemy forces. At dawn, the Americans began to advance towards the cement factory and received heavy small arms, mortar, and RPG fire. A sharp firefight developed between the Americans hiding behind the berms in the landfill and railroad track, and the Iraqi forces around the cement factory. An Iraqi sniper fired {{from the top of}} the factory's smokestack until an American soldier fired a TOW missile into the smokestack, collapsing the structure. Lacking smoke shells for their mortars in order to screen their movements, American forces were unable to advance <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to the east. OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopters arrived and attacked enemy mortar and RPG teams, and destroyed several technical vehicles. At around 3:00 PM, Navy F/A-18 Hornets arrived on station and bombed a warehouse attached to the cement factory. Fighting around the cement factory died down at nightfall.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Greble {{refused to}} pull back until the last, {{continuing}} to work his remaining gun, for {{he did not have}} enough able men left to man them both. This effort cost him his life as the Confederate artillery concentrated on his position and he was struck {{in the back of the}} head by a cannonball while finally winding up his work. When they received word of Greble's death, Lieutenant Colonel Warren, Captain Wilson and five of their men rushed back to recover Greble's body before they left the field. Greble was the first graduate of West Point and first U.S. Regular Army officer killed in the war. After littering the road back to Fort Monroe with coats and equipment on a very hot afternoon, the Union troops arrived back at Fort Monroe about 5:00p.m. that afternoon. About 100 Confederate cavalry pursued the Union force but could not mount an attack <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> as they approached Hampton because the Union force had pulled up the New Market Bridge over the southern branch of the Back River to thwart the Confederate pursuit.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E

Arthur Darvill wore a wig for the aged Rory, which was trimmed to look [...] "more masculine" [...] <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> in a ponytail. The Eknodine were CGI and the scenes were simply filmed with the actors opening their mouths. The scene in which Rory hits Eknodine-inhabited Mrs Hamil with a plank was filmed first of all with Darvill missing actress Joan Linder, and then again with Linder's stunt double, whom he was allowed to hit. There was only one prop of the plank, and fortunately all the necessary shots were completed before Darvill accidentally broke it.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 17/18 September, the JNA was ordered to trap and destroy the ZNG force in Drniš and the Miljevci Plateau area, while holding {{positions}} achieved elsewhere. In the morning, the JNA resumed its offensive towards Vodice, on the right flank of the attack, while the ZNG abandoned Drniš <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to village of Unešić. On 19 September, the ZNG captured a [...] JNA coastal artillery battery on the Smokvica Island and the [...] "Krušćica" [...] barracks near Rogoznica. Weapons retrieved from the captured barracks, a shipment received from Gospić following capture of JNA facilities in the town, as well as use of the captured artillery pieces, significantly improved ZNG's capabilities. The JNA advance south from Drniš was effectively halted that day, following three successful ambush attacks by the ZNG in Unešić, Pakovo Selo and south of Žitnić.|$|E
500|$|On 21March, at 2200, Jourdan {{ordered the}} wounded {{to be transported}} to Schaffhausen in Switzerland, via Stockach.

According to Jourdan, the retreat occurred in perfect order, and was supported in particular by a company of sappers, who blew up the bridges in the face of enemy fire, and then fought like grenadiers. The Austrians outflanked Saint Cyr's forces on the right flank and General Ferino, at the southern-most point, retreated to Salem, to maintain the line with the remainder of the French force. [...] When the first division pulled back to Bodman, on the northern tip of the Überlingen-finger of Lake Constance, a portion of the force was encircled and cut off by the 2nd Lancers of Karl Philipp, Prince Schwarzenberg's brigade, and more than 500were taken prisoner.|$|E
