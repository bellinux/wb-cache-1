5|$|The regulars found {{themselves}} {{trapped in a}} situation where they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Lacking effective leadership <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> at the superior numbers of the enemy, with their spirit broken, and likely not having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled to the safety of the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center, isolating Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett's Farm.|$|E
5|$|Author Hiromu Arakawa {{integrated}} several {{social problems}} into the plot, {{such as the}} way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers {{after the death of}} their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help {{people all over the country}} to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E
25|$|In the Harry Potter series (1997–2007) {{the most}} {{prominent}} werewolf is Remus Lupin who's portrayed as struggling with his curse <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> of infecting someone. The series also includes a werewolf villain Fenrir Greyback, who fits more with the older image of werewolves. The Potter books, while showing the intense threat the humans transformed to bloodthirsty monsters pose to the population, essentially use werewolves {{as a metaphor for}} marginalised groups who have been discriminated against in modern society.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Kingswood Village, Bonin became acquainted with a 43-year-old {{neighbor}} of his named Everett Fraser. Bonin became a regular attendee at the frequent parties Fraser held at his apartment and through these social gatherings, he became acquainted with a 21-year-old named Vernon Butts and an 18-year-old named Gregory Miley. Butts, a porcelain-factory worker and part-time magician who held a fascination with occultism, later {{claimed to have been}} both fascinated with <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> of Bonin, while freely admitting to taking a great delight in watching Bonin abuse and torture his victims. Miley—an illiterate Texas native with an IQ of 56 who supported himself with casual work—also actively participated in the murders he accompanied Bonin upon.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} old carpenter, Le Challeux, with another party of refugees, {{through the water}} and the tall grass. Le Challeux and six others of the company decided to {{make their way to the}} coast in the hope of being rescued by the ships which had {{remained}} below in the river. They passed the night in a grove of trees in view of the sea, and the following morning, as they were struggling through a large swamp, they observed some men half hidden by the vegetation, whom they took to be a party of Spaniards come down to cut them off. But closer observation showed that they were naked, <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> like themselves, and when they recognized their leader, Laudonnière, and others of their companions, they joined them. The entire company now consisted of twenty-six.|$|E

25|$|The fire {{became so}} intense that Rose was forced to crawl from {{position}} to position in order to treat the wounded, giving words of encouragement and directing the fire of the inexperienced <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> Vietnamese and Montagnard troops. Over the next few days, the company marched west and deeper into Laos, fending off incessant attacks from elements ranging from squad-sized to company-sized, covered by Air Force gunships. On 12 September, during an assault by a NVA company-sized element, one of the Montagnards was wounded 40 to 50 meters outside the perimeter. Dodging enemy fire, Rose ran and crawled {{his way to the}} wounded man, shielding him with his own body while he treated him. He dragged the Montagnard back to the company with one hand while firing at the enemy with his gun in his other hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{retreating}} raiders {{made their}} way to the coast at Zhapu while carrying their plunder with them. Their heavily laden river boats, thousands in number, stretched for miles. They however, did not have the seaworthy vessels to make their escape from China since Xu Hai had theirs destroyed when they first landed. Here Hu Zongxian offered them a deal: all who wished to surrender would be given positions in the military, while all who wished to return to Japan would be provided with seagoing vessels. The raiders had little choice but to accept. Now that Hu Zongxian had Xu Hai by the ear, he incited Xu Hai to attack his fellow marauders north in Songjiang to prove his sincerity. Xu Hai did so, hoping to keep the Songjiang marauders' booty and vessels for himself. As the raider groups fought each other in Zhujing (朱涇), the general Yu Dayou burned the river boats that Xu Hai left behind, and made short work of the remnant Songjiang marauders fleeing from Xu Hai. The operation left Xu Hai stranded <b>and</b> <b>terrified,</b> and he sent gifts and a younger brother as hostage to Hu as reassurance of his surrender.|$|E
25|$|In 1826 {{he began}} {{attending}} the Conservatoire to study composition under Jean-François Le Sueur and Anton Reicha. He also submitted a fugue to the Prix de Rome, but was eliminated {{in the primary}} round. Winning the prize would become an obsession until he finally won it in 1830, submitting a new cantata every year until he succeeded at his fourth attempt. The reason for this interest in the prize was not just academic recognition. The prize included a five-year pension – much needed income for the struggling composer. In 1827 he composed the Waverley overture after Walter Scott's Waverley novels. He also began working as a chorus singer at a vaudeville theatre to contribute towards an income. On 11 September of that year, he attended a production by a traveling English theatre company at the Odéon theatre with the Irish-born actress Harriet Smithson playing Ophelia and Juliet in the Shakespeare plays Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet. He immediately became infatuated with both actress and playwright. Prone to violent impulses, Berlioz began flooding Smithson's hotel room with love letters which both confused <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> her. His advances led nowhere.|$|E

25|$|Rufus orders Dana to {{convince}} Alice {{to sleep with}} him now that she has recovered. Dana speaks with Alice, outlining Alice's three options: she can refuse and be whipped and raped; she can acquiesce and be raped without being beaten; or she can try run away again. Injured <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> from her previous attempt to run away, Alice gives in to Rufus's desire and becomes his concubine. While in his bedroom, Alice finds out that Rufus did not send Dana's letters to Kevin, and tells Dana. Furious that Rufus lied to her, Dana runs away to find Kevin, but is betrayed by a jealous slave, Liza. Rufus and Weylin capture her and Weylin whips her brutually. Still, when Weylin finds out that Rufus has failed to keep his promise to Dana to send her letters, he writes to Kevin and tells him that Dana {{is back on the}} plantation. Kevin comes to retrieve Dana, but Rufus stops them on the road and threatens to shoot them. He tells Dana that she can't leave him again. The dizziness overcomes Dana and she travels back to 1976, this time with Kevin.|$|E
500|$|Witches' Sabbath or The Great He-Goat (...) are names {{given to}} an oil mural by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya, {{completed}} sometime between 1821 and 1823. It explores themes of violence, intimidation, aging and death. Satan hulks, {{in the form}} of a goat, in moonlit silhouette over a coven of ugly <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> witches. A withdrawn young girl in black sits to the far right, apart and withdrawn from the other women; perhaps in defiance. Goya was then around 75 years old, living alone and suffering from acute mental and physical distress.|$|E

[...] For the character's early appearances on Passions, Marshall characterized Liz as [...] "milquetoast" [...] and lacking any edge. She viewed Liz as a [...] "very strong, centered woman who has had some hard knocks and challenge", and felt she was [...] "wise beyond her years" [...] <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> of being left alone.|$|E

500|$|Also {{exhibited}} at the 1832 Summer Exhibition along with Youth and Pleasure was The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, seen as a riposte by Etty to his critics. Another of what Etty deemed [...] "visions", depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than one from literature, mythology or history, The Destroying Angel shows an imaginary classical temple under attack from a destroying angel {{and a group of}} daemons. The human figures, intentionally painted in paler tones than usual to suggest death, each show their fear in a different way. Painted soon after his 1830 travels, it is thought that the heaped corpses <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> crowds were directly inspired by events Etty had witnessed in Paris.|$|E
500|$|The Heroes of the Lance are {{the protagonists}} of the Chronicles trilogy, the first series of Dragonlance books. They {{were created by}} Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player {{characters}} in gaming sessions of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman's apartment. One player at this initial gaming session was game designer Terry Phillips, who was playing as Raistlin. According to Hickman in the foreword to The Soulforge, [...] " [...] were just settling in to the game when I turned to my good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing. Terry spoke...and the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real.

500|$|Regarding {{the acting}} and the characters, Sims and Monahan praised Middleton's performance. By contrast, Crichlow's role was {{considered}} to be repetitive. Monahan stated she just wailed, and Parker called it [...] "a harrowing performance with no arc or resolutions, just sheer fear and distress." [...] Lambie said: [...] "If there's a criticism to be levelled at the first two-thirds of White Bear, it's that Victoria's carried helplessly along by events." [...] Simon said Crichlow's potential was wasted because of the script. Jeffery criticized the fact [...] "Victoria maintains one emotional level across the episode ... she's tearful, panicked <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> throughout", but he remarked it was not Crichlow's fault, while praising Middleton and Smiley as [...] "uniformly excellent." [...] Cocks was more favorable, praising Crichlow's commitment to her performance. He also attributed to her performance [...] "one of the episode's greatest accomplishments ... how much it makes audience members feel as though they are in the position of [...] ". Edwards asserted she gave a [...] " [...] performance" [...] that is [...] "an excellent, convincing portrayal of a frightened, confused woman".|$|E

500|$|In 1946, at the {{earliest}} possible opportunity, Crawford resigned his post at the OS, where he was replaced by Charles Philips. He remained in the Southampton area and retained {{his interest in the}} city's architecture, in particular that of the Middle Ages. In 1946 he was a founding member of a lobby group, Friends of Old Southampton, which sought to protect the city's historic architecture from destruction amid post-war development. During the post-war period he also came to be preoccupied <b>and</b> <b>terrified</b> by the prospect of a nuclear war, urging archaeological authorities to make copies of all their information and disperse it in different locations to ensure that knowledge survived any forthcoming Third World War. Retaining his left-wing interests, in 1945 and 1946 he had some involvement with the Labour Party, although elsewhere he mocked the [...] "ignorant" [...] who thought that Labour [...] "genuinely" [...] represented socialism. In {{the latter part of the}} 1940s he became increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet Union after reading Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon, a book about Joseph Stalin's Great Purge and Moscow show trials, as well as learning of how Soviet scientists who did not support the ideas of Trofim Lysenko had been persecuted. In 1950—after reading the memoir of Margarete Buber-Neumann—he declared himself to be [...] "fanatically anti-Soviet [...] anti-communist".|$|E
