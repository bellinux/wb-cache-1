5|$|William Losh (1770 Carlisle–4 August 1861, Ellison Place, Newcastle) {{came from}} a rich family that owned coal mines in Northeast England. He was educated in Hamburg, and trained in Newcastle, Sweden and France. He married Alice Wilkinson of Carlisle on 1 March 1798 at Gateshead. He {{was a friend of}} the {{explorer}} Alexander von Humboldt and a one-time business partner of rail pioneer George Stephenson. His brother James Losh was also a partner in the firm, and kept a diary recording his <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> the firm during the Napoleonic wars.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{generally}} satisfactory {{situation in}} Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems {{from time to}} time. He was on one occasion – probably because of his wide network of contacts – {{the subject of an}} anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he therefore moved him to the University of Bologna. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.|$|E
40|$|Many {{elementary}} {{teachers have been}} found to have high levels of mathematics anxiety but the impact on student achievement was unknown. Elementary teachers (N = 692) completed the modified Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale-Revised (Hopko, 2003) along with a questionnaire probing <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> teaching mathematics and current mathematics instructional practices. Student mathematics achievement data were collected for the classrooms taught by the teachers. A positive relationship was found between <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> mathematics and <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> teaching mathematics. Increased student mathematics achievement was related to lower levels of <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> teaching mathematics, but was not related to general <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> mathematics. <b>Anxiety</b> <b>about</b> mathematics was positively related to more National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards-based instructional practices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} one of {{the newest}} novels of Philip Roth, Everyman. From Everyman, I will discuss about the main character's <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> death. Based on this main topic, there are three things to discuss about the main character's <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> death. Those are the causes of the main character's <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> death, the effects of the <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> death in the main character's life and the main character's ways in dealing with his <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> death. Moreover, I use psychological approach with the theory of psychoanalysis in analyzing this novel: theory of anxiety, theory of defense mechanism and concept of obsession. After analyzing the novel by using those theories, I find that the main character gets <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> death because he has negative concept about death and has a negative perspective on aging. Then, I find that there are three effects of this <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> death in the main character's life. Those effects are being obsessed by death, regretting over his past life and being an atheist. Also in my findings, I conclude that the main character in Everyman deals with his <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> death through repression, sublimation and rationalization...|$|R

40|$|Children {{have been}} found to report and {{demonstrate}} math anxiety as early as the first grade. However, previous results concerning the relationship between math anxiety and performance are contradictory, with some studies establishing a correlation between them while others do not. These contradictory results might be related to varying operationalizations of math anxiety. In this study, we aimed to examine the prevalence of math anxiety and its relationship with basic arithmetic skills in primary school children, with explicit focus on two aspects of math anxiety: <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> failure in mathematics and anxiety in math-related situations. The participants comprised 1, 327 children at grades 2 - 5. Math anxiety was assessed using six items, and basic arithmetic skills were assessed using three assessment tasks. Around one-third of the participants reported <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> being unable to do math, one-fifth about having to answer teachers' questions, and one tenth about having to do math. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> math-related situations and <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> failure in mathematics are separable aspects of math anxiety. Structural equation modelling suggested that <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> math-related situations was more strongly associated with arithmetic fluency than <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> failure. <b>Anxiety</b> <b>about</b> math-related situations was most common among second graders and least common among fifth graders. As math <b>anxiety,</b> particularly <b>about</b> math-related situations, was related to arithmetic fluency even as early as the second grade, children's negative feelings and math anxiety should be identified and addressed from the early primary school years...|$|R

25|$|Resistance {{from the}} {{military}} command and concerns about high production cost were finally overcome by <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> the poor performance of Soviet tanks in the Winter War in Finland, {{and the effectiveness of}} German tanks during the Battle of France. The first production T-34s were completed in September 1940, completely replacing the production of the T-26, the BT series, and the multi-turreted T-28 medium tank at the KhPZ plant.

25|$|Set {{against a}} {{backdrop}} of rapid economic development and social changes in post-Mao China, the protests reflected <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy which benefitted some people but seriously disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation. The students called for democracy, greater accountability, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech, though they were loosely organized and their goals varied. At the height of the protests, about a million people assembled in the Square.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Juan Almonte was {{appointed}} Director of Colonization in Texas, ostensibly to ease {{relations with the}} colonists and mitigate their <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> Austin's imprisonment. He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, {{under the guise of}} serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{reliability}} and validity of the School Anxiety Inventory (SAI) using a sample of 646 Slovenian adolescents (48 % boys), ranging in age from 12 to 19 years. Single confirmatory factor analyses replicated the correlated four-factor structure of scores on the SAI for anxiety-provoking school situations (<b>Anxiety</b> <b>about</b> School Failure and Punishment, <b>Anxiety</b> <b>about</b> Aggression, <b>Anxiety</b> <b>about</b> Social Evaluation, and <b>Anxiety</b> <b>about</b> Academic Evaluation), and the three-factor structure of the anxiety response systems (Physiological Anxiety, Cognitive Anxiety, and Behavioral Anxiety). Equality of factor structures was compared using multigroup confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance for the four- and three-factor models was obtained across gender and school-level samples. The scores of the instrument showed high internal reliability and adequate test–retest reliability. The concurrent validity of the SAI scores was also examined through its relationship with the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SASA) scores and the Questionnaire about Interpersonal Difficulties for Adolescents (QIDA) scores. Correlations of the SAI scores with scores on the SASA and the QIDA were of low to moderate effect sizes...|$|R
25|$|Two years later, the Government of India Act 1935 {{introduced}} provincial autonomy, {{increasing the}} number of voters in India to 35 million. More significantly, law and order issues were for the first time devolved from British authority to provincial governments headed by Indians. This increased Muslim <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> eventual Hindu domination. In the Indian provincial elections, 1937, the Muslim League turned out its best performance in Muslim-minority provinces such as the United Provinces, where it won 29 of the 64 reserved Muslim seats. However, in the Muslim-majority regions of the Punjab and Bengal regional parties outperformed the League. In the Punjab, the Unionist Part of Sikandar Hayat Khan, won the elections and formed a government, {{with the support of the}} Indian National Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal, which lasted five years. In Bengal, the League had to share power in a coalition headed by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the leader of the Krishak Praja Party.|$|E
25|$|The {{close of}} the twentieth century {{produced}} more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns about immigration and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties. In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years. In July 2000, it came second in the council elections for the North End of the London Borough of Bexley, its best result since 1993. At the 2001 general election it gained 16% of the vote in one constituency and over 10% in two others. In the 2002 local elections the BNP gained four councillors, three of whom were in Burnley, where it had capitalised on white anger surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward. This breakthrough generated public <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it. In the 2003 local elections the BNP gained 13 additional councillors, including seven more in Burnley, having attained over 100,000 votes. Concerned that much of their potential vote was going to the UK Independence Party (UKIP), in 2003 the BNP offered UKIP an electoral pact but was rebuffed. Griffin then accused UKIP of being a Labour Party scheme to steal the BNP's votes. They invested much in the campaign for the 2004 European Parliament election, at which they gained 800,000 votes but failed to secure a parliamentary seat. In the 2004 local elections, they secured four more seats, including three in Epping.|$|E

Tillich related these to three different historical eras: the early centuries of the Christian era; the Reformation; and the 20th century.
