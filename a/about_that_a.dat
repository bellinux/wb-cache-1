5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Royal National Theatre {{created a}} stage {{version of the}} book, adapted and {{directed}} by Katie Mitchell. Seussical, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat and the 2010 animated television series The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot <b>About</b> <b>That!</b> <b>A</b> ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The Cat in the Hat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} the exilarchate falls {{naturally}} into two periods, separated {{by the beginning of}} the Arabic rule in Babylonia. Nothing is known about the office before the 2nd century, including any details about its founding or beginnings. It can merely be said in general that the golah, the Jews living in compact masses in various parts of Babylon, tended gradually to unite and create an organization, and that this tendency, together with the high regard in which the descendants of the house of David living in Babylon were held, brought it <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> member of this house was recognized as [...] "head of the golah." [...] The dignity became hereditary in this house, and was finally recognized by the state, and hence became an established political institution, first of the Arsacid and then of the Sassanid empire.|$|E

2500|$|The {{writings}} of the early church contain strong condemnations of same-sex acts. Tertullian wrote, [...] "When Paul asserts that males and females changed among themselves the natural use of the creature in that which is unnatural, he validates the natural way”. Ambrosiaster wrote, “Paul tells us that these things came <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> woman should lust after another woman, because God was angry at the human race because of its idolatry. Those who interpret this differently {{do not understand the}} force of the argument. For what is it to change the use of nature into a use which is contrary to nature, if not to take away the former and adopt the latter, so that the same part of the body should be used by each of the sexes in a way for which it was not intended?... It is clear that, because they changed the truth of God into a lie, they changed the natural use (of sexuality) into that use by which they were dishonored and condemned". John Chrysostom wrote, [...] "No one can say that it was by being prevented from legitimate intercourse that they came to this pass or that it was from having no means to fulfill their desire that they were driven to this monstrous insanity... What is contrary to nature has something irritating and displeasing in it, so that they could not even claim to be getting pleasure out of it. For genuine pleasure comes from following what is according to nature. But when God abandons a person to his own devices, then everything is turned upside down.” Cyprian wrote, [...] "If you were able... to direct your eyes into secret places, to unfasten the locked doors of sleeping chambers and to open these hidden recesses to the perception of sight, you would behold that being carried on by the unchaste which a chaste countenance could not behold. You would see that it is in an indignity even to see... Men with frenzied lusts rush against men. Things are done which cannot even give pleasure to those who do them.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do not {{remember}} that I agreed to anything of the sort," [...] she declared.

6000|$|... "Well, I'll tell you. As {{you have}} done me this honour, I think that I am now bound {{to tell you what}} Mrs Stumfold said to me. She had no right to connect my name with yours or with that of any other gentleman, and my quarrel with her is <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>As</b> to what she said <b>about</b> you, <b>that</b> is your affair and not mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} so. I can't {{make up my}} mind what to do. Hang it. I'll have to see Bronson. There's no {{question}} <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>A</b> man ought to keep an understood substitute on hand to send to dinners when he can't go. By Jove! Elliott!" ...|$|E
60|$|So Abi {{returned}} to the white-walled city of Memphis and sat there sullenly, putting it <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> plot was on foot to deprive him of his heritage. But Kaku shook his head, saying in secret that the Star, Neter-Tua, would arise, for so it was decreed by Amen, father of the gods.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{think you}} are mistaken <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>A</b> boy works {{steadily}} when he goes directly forward in his work, without stopping to rest, or to contrive new ways of doing it, or to see other people, or to talk. Now, {{do you think you}} could work steadily an hour, without stopping for any of these reasons?” ...|$|E
60|$|He {{questioned}} {{several of}} the soldiers, who had now gathered round, attracted like the officers by the cry.

6000|$|... "However, I did {{not come}} to talk to you <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>As</b> I said before, I know nothing of the squire's affairs, and, as a matter of course, I do not ask you to tell me. But I am sure you will agree with me in this, <b>that,</b> as <b>a</b> mother, I cannot but be {{interested}} about my only son," [...] and Lady Arabella put her cambric handkerchief to her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think there}} is any doubt <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>A</b> few of them are pretty well worn out with labour and suffering, but all have gained {{strength}} and spirits greatly in the past week, and you may be sure that they will fight to the death rather than run the risk of another turn in the galleys." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus it came <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{month later}} {{on the eve of}} the Feast of Saint Matthew, the Lady Mary, as she walked front Cosford gates, met with a strange horseman, richly clad, a serving-man behind him, looking shrewdly about him with quick blue eyes, which twinkled from a red and {{freckled}} face. At sight of her he doffed his hat and reined his horse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{there is}} one thing that I want to impress upon you before I go any further, Mr. Holmes. Effie loves me. Don't let there be any mistake about that. She loves me with her whole heart and soul, and never more than now. I know it. I feel it. I don't want to argue <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>A</b> man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him. But there's this secret between us, and we can never be the same until it is cleared." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If Lady Penwether {{knew them}} why could not Lady Penwether ask them {{independently}} of us? I don't believe they ever spoke to Lady Penwether in their lives. Lord Rufford and Miss Trefoil may very likely be London acquaintances. He may admire her and therefore {{choose to have}} her at his ball. I know nothing <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>As</b> far as I am concerned he's quite welcome to keep her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{advise you}} to invest," [...] the other replied. [...] "The company has seldom paid a dividend, but not long since a rumor got <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new shaft had {{bottomed}} on rich ore." [...] He paused and shrugged. [...] "Nobody knows how such tales are started, but they appeal to optimistic outsiders who like to think they've got a secret tip. Anyhow, there was some reckless buying by people who expected developments at the shareholders' meeting. They were disappointed, and are knocking prices down by their anxiety to sell out." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{so it came}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> week {{afterwards}} Grizel was reinstalled in her old rooms. Every {{morning when}} Tommy came to see her she asked him, icily how Alice was. She {{seemed to think that}} Alice, as she called her, was his wife. He always replied, [...] "You mean Elspeth," [...] and she assented, but only, it was obvious, because she feared to contradict him. To Corp and Gavinia she would still say passionately, [...] "I want to go home!" [...] and probably add fearfully, [...] "Don't tell him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was talking}} to Billy only yesterday," [...] added Bunfit. [...] "I've got it on my mind that they didn't treat Billy quite on the square. He didn't let on {{anything}} about Benjamin; but he told me out plain, as how {{he was very much}} disgusted. 'Mr. Bunfit,' said he, 'there's that roguery <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> plain man like me can't touch it. There's them as'd pick my eyes out while I was sleeping, and then swear it against my very self.' Them were his words, and I knew as how Benjamin hadn't been on the square with him." ...|$|E
