500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston {{agreed to}} {{distribute}} the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, [...] "We {{made a deal with}} the devil, , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that,</b> in a way, we got what we deserved." [...] They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),—and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid—only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjustedn) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.|$|E
2500|$|Poco {{continued}} {{to write and}} record while performing at festivals, performing arts centers, theaters and clubs. [...] In 2005, they played a short tour in Europe, but Cotton was hospitalized in Norway with health issues and missed the last two shows of the tour. Guitarist and singer Bill Lloyd, of duo Foster and LLoyd, substituted for Cotton for several subsequent shows in the US. Cotton returned in 2006, stabilizing the lineup of Young, Cotton, Sundrud, and drummer George Lawrence. Cotton and Sundrud released solo albums. Young started writing an autobiographical history of the band. Poco alumni {{continued to}} periodically reunite in concert with this lineup. Beginning in 2009 Grantham occasionally appeared with the band again but limited his contributions to vocals only. [...] Richie Furay and Jim Messina returned for several 2008 Poco performances at the Wildwood Lodge in Steelville, Missouri, a tour of California in 2009 ending at the Stagecoach Festival in Indio where {{they were joined by}} Grantham and Timothy B. Schmit, and several dates opening for Loggins and Messina featuring Furay, Messina, and Grantham. [...] Bareback at Big Sky (2005) and [...] The Wildwood Sessions (2006) captured live acoustic versions of songs both new and familiar from their 40-plus year career. [...] Live at Columbia Studios, Hollywood 9/30/71 (2010) unearthed an unreleased 1971 live performance by Furay, Young, Schmit, Grantham, and the then recently recruited Cotton in front of a private audience of family and friends. In early 2010 Paul Cotton left Poco abruptly, publicly citing a financial dispute with Young. On his official website he announced he would not be appearing with Poco at the Wildwood concerts, stating [...] "It was not all that shocking when Rusty told me on Feb. 27 that he would not honor the contract that I had been requesting for over 15 years, and that this was goodbye..." [...] On March 12, 2010, Young responded on Poco's official website: [...] "It was a sad day when I read on Paul's website that he wasn't coming to Wildwood <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> means he's leaving the band." [...] Poco immediately reformed with Young, Sundrud, Lawrence and new keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist/singer Michael Webb of Nashville TN.|$|E

6000|$|The gaunt rancher fidgeted {{before he}} answered: [...] "You have said 'Thank you' once, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> enough. You're so blame thin in the hide, and touchy, Ormesby; <b>and</b> it wasn't <b>I</b> who did it--at least {{not much of}} it." ...|$|R

60|$|Again {{her eyes}} {{dropped to the}} floor, and a faint colour suffused her cheek. I could not {{understand}} her meaning; nor did I for a long time.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "I {{was born}} {{on a farm in}} Kansas, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> being just as 'spectable and haughty as living in a cave with your tail tied to a rock. If it isn't I'll have to stand it, that's all." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{put my hand}} on his shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> {{my voice}} trembled a trifle as, while reproving him for his act, I made it plain to him that my {{gratitude}} was no less potent a force than his loyalty to me. Then it was that I outlined to him my purpose to defy the regulation that had raised the dead lines, and to take my ship back to New York myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not many, but enough," [...] growled Johnny Chuck. [...] "Reddy Fox, Old Man Coyote, men and Dogs are the worst. Of course, when I {{was small}} I {{always had to}} be {{watching}} out for Hawks, and of course, {{like all the rest}} of us little folks, I am afraid of Shadow the Weasel.

6000|$|... "That don't {{look right}} to me, at all," [...] he said, {{shaking his head}} gravely. [...] "I've seen them Germans a few times myself, drivin' around in that big sleigh of theirn.

[...] "The shirra sent for his clerk, {{and as the}} lad is rather light o' the tongue, I fand it was for drawing a warrant to apprehend you--I thought it {{had been on a}} fugie warrant for debt; for a' body kens the laird likes naebody to pit his hand in his pouch--But now I may haud my tongue, for I see the M'Intyre lad and Mr. Lesley coming up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> Monkbarns's purpose was very kind, and that yours is muckle waur than it should be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{when you}} are near the centre of it. Why, lad, in three hours I have gone round the compass three times, with the wind dead aft all the time; but that's only {{when you are}} near the centre. When you ain't it blows straight, and I have known vessels run for days--ay, for weeks--with the wind blowing {{all the time in}} the same quarter. Some have been blown down right to the edge of the ice, south. I have been among the icebergs myself, two or three times, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> many a ship has laid her bones down in the ice fields there, and no news ever come back home as to what's come to them; and what makes it worse is as we have convicts on board." ...|$|E

'I {{might not}} have said so then, that is likely enough; one can't always tell whether a {{yearling}} {{is going to turn}} out a good horse, and a good many who think they are clever get sucked in over it; but a man who has an eye to horseflesh can tell whether a three-year-old is well bred or not, and I guess I am not far out with this one. Yes, I am struck over her. It is not often that women, or men either for that matter, get on the soft side of me. You know pretty well that I wasn't afraid of running a bit of risk in the old days, and you may guess that this country doesn't make a baby of one.

6000|$|Lapham acquiesced in {{the return}} to business. [...] "I didn't {{discover}} it," [...] he said scrupulously. [...] "My father found it one day, in a hole made by a tree blowing down. There it was, lying loose in the pit, and sticking to the roots that had pulled up a big, cake of dirt with 'em. I don't know what give him {{the idea that there}} was money in it, but he did think so from the start. I guess, if they'd had the word in those days, they'd considered him pretty much of a crank about it. He was trying as long as he lived to get that paint introduced; but he couldn't make it go. The country was so poor they couldn't paint their houses with anything; and father hadn't any facilities. It got {{to be a kind of}} joke with us; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> paint-mine did as much as any one thing to make us boys clear out as soon as we got old enough. All my brothers went West, and took up land; but I hung on to New England and I hung on to the old farm, not because the paint-mine was on it, but because the old house was--and the graves. Well," [...] said Lapham, as if unwilling to give himself too much credit, [...] "there wouldn't been any market for it, anyway. You can go through that part of the State and buy more farms than you can shake a stick at for less money than it cost to build the barns on 'em. Of course, it's turned out a good thing. I keep the old house up in good shape, and we spend a month or so there every summer. M' wife kind of likes it, and the girls. Pretty place; sightly all round it. I've got a force of men at work there the whole time, and I've got a man and his wife in the house. Had a family meeting there last year; the whole connection from out West. There!" [...] Lapham rose from his seat and took down a large warped, unframed photograph from the top of his desk, passing his hand over it, and then blowing vigorously upon it, to clear it of the dust. [...] "There we are, ALL of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume {{they were}} glad to see me," [...] said Lapham, with dignity. [...] "Mother," [...] he added gently, [...] "died that winter, and I stayed on with father. I buried him in the spring; and then I came down to a little place called Lumberville, and picked up what jobs I could get. I worked round at the saw-mills, and I was ostler a while at the hotel--I always DID like a good horse. Well, I WA'N'T exactly a college graduate, and I went to school odd times. I got to driving the stage after while, and by and by I BOUGHT the stage and run the {{business}} myself. Then I hired the tavern-stand, and--well {{to make a long}} story short, then I got married. Yes," [...] said Lapham, with pride, [...] "I married the school-teacher. We did pretty well with the hotel, and my wife she was always at me to paint up. Well, I put it off, and PUT it off, as a man will, till one day I give in, and says I, 'Well, let's paint up. Why, Pert,'--m'wife's name's Persis,--'I've got a whole paint-mine out on the farm. Let's go out and look at it.' So we drove out. I'd let the place for seventy-five dollars a year to a shif'less kind of a Kanuck that had come down that way; and I'd hated to see the house with him in it; but we drove out one Saturday afternoon, and we brought back about a bushel of the stuff in the buggy-seat, and I tried it crude, and I tried it burnt; and I liked it. M'wife she liked it too. There wa'n't any painter by trade in the village, and I mixed it myself. Well, sir, that tavern's got that coat of paint on it yet, and it hain't ever had any other, and I don't know's it ever will. Well, you know, I felt as if it was a kind of harumscarum experiment, all the while; and I presume I shouldn't have tried it but I kind of liked to do it because father'd always set so much store by his paint-mine. And when I'd got the first coat on,"--Lapham called it CUT,--"I presume I must have set as much as half an hour; looking at it and thinking how he would have enjoyed it. I've had my share of luck in this world, and I ain't a-going to complain on my OWN account, but I've noticed that most things get along too late for most people. It made me feel bad, and it took all the pride out my success with the paint, thinking of father. Seemed to me I might 'a taken more interest in it when he was by to see; but we've got to live and learn. Well, I called my wife out,--I'd tried it on the back of the house, you know,--and she left her dishes,--I can remember she came out with her sleeves rolled up and set down alongside of me on the trestle,--and says I, 'What do you think, Persis?' And says she, 'Well, you hain't got a paint-mine, Silas Lapham; you've got a GOLD-mine.' She always was just so enthusiastic about things. Well, it was just after two or three boats had burnt up out West, and a lot of lives lost, and there was a great cry about non-inflammable paint, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> was what was in her mind. 'Well, I guess it ain't any gold-mine, Persis,' says I; 'but I guess it IS a paint-mine. I'm going to have it analysed, and if it turns out what I think it is, I'm going to work it. And if father hadn't had such a long name, I should call it the Nehemiah Lapham Mineral Paint. But, any rate, every barrel of it, and every keg, and every bottle, and every package, big or little, has got to have the initials and figures N.L.f. 1835, S.L.t. 1855, on it. Father found it in 1835, and I tried it in 1855.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Carnival of the Animals - Part Two" [...] is {{a parody}} of The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns. [...] Composer Wendy Carlos wrote new music for both stories. The {{introduction}} explains: [...] "Camille, in his research, was slightly behind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> some critters just plain slipped his mind, so to fill in this void in the Animal Kingdom, I'll read some new verses.

5000|$|I {{imagine the}} story as a moving film or piece of theatre, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> start {{building}} the props and setting the scenery around the characters. <b>I</b> love atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>I</b> wanted to contribute. If I'd been left alone I would have avoided all of the key scenes, I was nervous about dealing with them, but Ben was fantastic in giving the book structure and, thankfully, insisting that I should tackle the explosive, energetic elements of the book.|$|R
5000|$|According to Roger Greenspun, [...] "the ads {{say that}} the time is just right for an out-and-out thriller like this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> you are {{supposed}} to think that a good old kind of movie has none too soon come around again. But The French Connection...is in fact a very good new kind of movie, and that in spite of its being composed of such ancient material as cops and crooks, with thrills and chases, and lots of shoot-'em-up." ...|$|E
5000|$|I have no choice. I {{am not in}} the {{position}} to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country.
