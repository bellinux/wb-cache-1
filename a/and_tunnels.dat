5|$|The disused {{platforms}} <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{have sometimes}} {{been used for}} filming and have appeared in several productions including the feature film Paperhouse, and the television series EastEnders and Waking the Dead.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing in {{the form}} of {{variable}} tolls by time-of-the-day have also been implemented in bridges <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> providing access to the central business districts of several major cities. In most cases there was a toll already in existence.|$|E
5|$|Synagogues {{like the}} First Roumanian-American Congregation, more familiarly {{known as the}} Rumanische shul, were the first spiritual homes for {{successive}} waves of European immigrants. They were built more than 100 years ago, and just like the bridges <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> of New York City, they're bound to fail if not attended to.|$|E

50|$|The Triborough Bridge <b>and</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Authority Police (TBTA Police), {{is the law}} {{enforcement}} agency of the Triborough Bridge <b>and</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Authority Operations Force in New York City. It is responsible for protecting all facilities and surrounding area owned by the Triborough Bridge <b>and</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Authority, for enforcing state and city laws at all the facilities and the surrounding area, and for many non {{law enforcement}} duties, including collecting the tolls, towing disabled and wrecked vehicles off of the roadways, and clearing snow off the roadways. The TBTA currently has approximately 700 Bridge <b>and</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Officers, Sergeants, Lieutenants and Captains.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{hydroelectric}} power stations at Mettur, called Dam <b>and</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Power Houses, respectively. Dam Power House has {{a capacity of}} 40 MW, <b>and</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Power House has a capacity of 200 MW.|$|R
5|$|The A4 {{motorway}} {{runs through}} hills and plains crossed {{by a number}} of watercourses, requiring a number of bridges, viaducts <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> along the route. Particular attention to the environment is also required, due to the several water supply and natural heritage zones.|$|E
5|$|The Inner Ring Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of the 1960s. This was the most ambitious scheme of its kind in the UK with Leeds City Council subsequently promoting the city with the slogan Motorway City of the Seventies. The works involved the construction of many flyovers <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> and the Motorway construction is notable in itself.|$|E
5|$|The White House, the Capitol, {{and various}} other {{buildings}} were evacuated. The afternoon traffic rush hour was affected, with some traffic lights inoperative, and the Washington Metro system's trains operated at reduced speeds while tracks <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> were inspected.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Applied FLUENT {{simulation}} software {{to research the}} influence of tunnel length, tunnel entrance velocity, <b>tunnel</b> equivalent diameter <b>and</b> <b>tunnel</b> buried depth four important factors on the tunnel wind cooling system in Shenyang area. The results show that, {{with the increase of}} <b>tunnel</b> length <b>and</b> <b>tunnel</b> buried depth <b>and</b> with the decrease of <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity <b>and</b> <b>tunnel</b> equivalent diameter, the outdoor air which passed into the tunnel cooling amplitude increases. For the tunnel wind cooling system optimization design in Shenyang area and the surrounding areas, the advices are that tunnel buried depth should not be more than 6 m <b>and</b> <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity should not be more than 5 m/s...|$|R
50|$|Two NZR {{estimates}} in 1974 were (1) $73½ to $75½ {{million for}} a double track electrified line <b>and</b> <b>tunnel</b> or (2) $15 to $40½ {{million for a}} non-electrified single track line <b>and</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> a small goods yard.|$|R

5|$|With {{the dawn}} of the Interstate Highway System {{following}} World War II, new highways were constructed in the region. A series of bridges <b>and</b> <b>tunnels,</b> constructed during fifteen years, linked Norfolk with the Peninsula, Portsmouth, and Virginia Beach. In 1952, the Downtown Tunnel opened to connect Norfolk with the city of Portsmouth. The highways also stimulated the development of new housing suburbs, leading to the population spreading out. Additional bridges <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> included the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1957, the Midtown Tunnel in 1962, and the Virginia Beach-Norfolk Expressway (Interstate 264 and State Route 44) in 1967. In 1991, the new Downtown Tunnel/Berkley Bridge complex opened a new system of multiple lanes of highway and interchanges connecting Downtown Norfolk and Interstate 464 with the Downtown Tunnel tubes.|$|E
5|$|Amman has an {{extensive}} road network, although the mountainous terrain {{of the area}} has prevented the connection of some main roads, which are instead connected by bridges <b>and</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The Abdoun Bridge spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle. It {{is considered one of}} Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} it was {{considered}} that the two former Line E stations <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{should be used for}} Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.|$|E
5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could accommodate a fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout of track <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by the Great Hall and the Arch. Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that the Arch and the Great Hall would be demolished, which was granted on the proviso that the Arch would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{fired on}} coastal {{batteries}} and buildings at Kojo 16 April; on railway track <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> near Hungnam 18 April; and on gun emplacements around Wonsan Harbor 20 April, silencing them in five areas {{after she had}} herself taken several near misses. Songjin provided targets 23 April. Here New Jersey scored six direct 16inch (406mm) hits on a railroad tunnel and knocked out two rail bridges.|$|E

5|$|Production on {{the season}} began in July 2015 in East Harlem, with the working title Ringside, and a nine-day-per-episode schedule. Filming {{locations}} included the Metro Theater; Roosevelt Island; Greenpoint, Brooklyn; Long Island City; SoHo for exterior shots of Murdock's apartment; Newtown Creek; the Forest Park Carousel; Bayside, Queens for Castle's old home; Green-Wood Cemetery and Catacombs; East Village; the Bronx County Courthouse; Tribeca; Hell's Kitchen; the Brooklyn Navy Yard; Fort Totten <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> inside Bayley Seton Hospital for when Murdock confronts the Hand; and Calvary Cemetery. Filming ended in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|The railway was rebuilt as a non-electrified, largely {{single-track}} line. Several surviving Waverley Route structures, including viaducts <b>and</b> <b>tunnels,</b> {{were rehabilitated}} and reused for the reopened railway. Passenger services run half-hourly on weekdays until 20:00, and hourly until 23:54 and on Sundays. The timetable also allows charter train promoters to run special excursion services, {{and for the}} weeks following the line opening scheduled steam trains were run.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of the Green Line is {{near the}} intersection of Branch Avenue (Maryland Route 5) and Auth Road just inside the Capital Beltway near Andrews Air Force Base. The route goes northwest through a park to join {{the right of way}} of the Suitland Parkway. It veers southeast along Southern Avenue and then north on 13th Street SE to rejoin Suitland Parkway. The Green Line crosses the Anacostia River <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> under the Washington Navy Yard and travels west under M Street SE. It then joins the Yellow Line in a tunnel under 7th Street SW. The tunnel bends west along Florida Avenue and U Street NW and then turns north under 14th Street NW. The tunnel turns northeast under New Hampshire Ave NW, and cut across Fort Totten Park where it intersects the Red Line. The Green Line runs east through the Fort Circle Parks <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> under Queens Chapel Road to emerge along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad right of way to Greenbelt adjacent to the Capital Beltway.|$|E

5|$|As the American and South Korean forces {{approached}} the Chinese defenses, they {{were met with}} grenades, Bangalore torpedoes, shaped charges and rocks. Unable to safely advance, American and South Korean troops were forced to rely on close-support artillery to subdue Chinese resistance, but a complex network of bunkers <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> allowed the Chinese to bring up reinforcements as the above-ground troops were depleted. Although the 31st Infantry Regiment was equipped with ballistic vests in the first mass military deployment of modern personal armor; its 1st and 3rd battalions nevertheless suffered 96 fatalities, with an additional 337 men wounded in the first attack – the heaviest casualties the 31st Infantry Regiment had suffered {{in a single day}} during the war.|$|E
5|$|As {{the route}} {{traverses}} hilly terrain, {{it requires a}} substantial number of viaducts <b>and</b> <b>tunnels,</b> as well as two major bridges to span the Drava and Mura rivers. The motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. There are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A4 motorway are grade separated. As of October 2010, there are 12exits and 3rest areas operating along the route. As the motorway is tolled using a ticket system, each exit includes a toll plaza. Exits south of the Sveta Helena mainline toll plaza have no toll plazas, as that part of the A4 route is not tolled. The same applies to the northernmost section between the Goričan exit and the Hungarian border.|$|E
5|$|At Wonsan 11 July– 12 July, New Jersey fired one of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} bombardments of her Korean duty. For nine hours the first day, and for seven the second, her guns opened fire on gun positions and bunkers on Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect. At least ten enemy guns were destroyed, many damaged, and a number of caves <b>and</b> <b>tunnels</b> sealed. New Jersey smashed radar control positions and bridges at Kojo 13 July, and was once more on the east coast bombline 22 July– 24 July to support South Korean troops near Kosong. These days found her gunners at their most accurate: A large cave, housing an important enemy observation post was closed, the end of a month-long United Nations effort, and a great many bunkers, artillery areas, observation posts, trenches, tanks and other weapons were destroyed.|$|E
