Both water and alkaline extracts from licorice root were compared regarding their biological activities.

In the present study, we investigated the biological activities of SE- 10, a granulated powder of SE supplemented with lactose, lactitol, trehalose and tea extract. Materials and Methods: Cell viability of mock-infected, HIV-infected, and UV-irradiated cells {{was determined by}} the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Scavenging activity of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals was determined by electron-spin resonance spectroscopy.

40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} reported that azulene-related compounds, and <b>alkaline</b> <b>extract</b> of Sasa senanensis Rehder potently inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated mouse macrophages. We investigated here {{whether they can}} inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production, by activated human gingival fibroblast (HGF). Materials and Methods: HGF was established from the periodontal tissues of extracted tooth. Viable cell number was determined by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Production of Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and cytokines was determined by enzyme immunoassay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results: Interleukin (IL) - 1 β did not inhibit, but rather slightly stimulated the growth of HGF cells. IL- 1 β stimulated the production of PGE 2, IL- 6, IL- 8 and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 very potently, but not that of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-α. Native LPS and synthetic lipid A from E. coli and P. gingivalis was much less stimulatory. Dexamethasone, not indomethacin, was an efficient inhibitor of IL- 8 production. Among five azulene-related compounds, benzo[b]cyclohepta[e][1, 4]thiazine most potently inhibited the IL- 8 production by HGF cells, as well as NO production by activated RAW 264. 7 cells.
