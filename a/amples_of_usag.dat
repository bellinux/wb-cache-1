50|$|United States Army Garrison Schweinfurt (USAG Schweinfurt) was a United States Army {{military}} community {{located in}} and around Schweinfurt, Germany from 1945 to 2014. The garrison comprised two installations (Conn and Ledward Barracks), two housing areas (Askren Manor and Yorktown Village Housing Area), and two local training areas (Brönnhof or Area M) in Pfändhausen, {{to the north of}} Schweinfurt as well as Sulzheim (Sulzheim Training Area), 15 minutes to the south of Schweinfurt. Cold War-era installations in Bad Kissingen, Bad Neustadt, Hammelburg, and Oerlenbach were closed prior to the closure <b>of</b> <b>USAG</b> Schweinfurt in the years following German reunification in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Germany from OEF XIII in March 2013, 1-91 CAV moved from Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt to Tower Barracks in Grafenwöhr due to a Brigade realignment and the imminent closure <b>of</b> <b>USAG</b> Schweinfurt. After moving to Tower Barracks, 1-91 CAV shifted focus from the OEF mission to Airborne proficiency, and NATO support and tactical reassurance. Since 2013, 1-91 CAV has conducted operations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Italy, France, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, and Israel {{in addition to its}} German home. Most notably, 1-91 CAV represented the United States in several internationally recognized NATO exercises to include: Operation Steadfast Jazz, Operation Atlantic Resolve and Operation Saber Junction.|$|R

40|$|The {{major problem}} {{faced by the}} society is power crisis. All the non-renewable {{resources}} like fossil fuelsnecessary for producing power are being used excessively, which might result a day in future where, the world might godark {{due to lack of}} power producing resources. Usage of renewable resources like solar energy can be a solution to thisproblem. Solar cells invented to overcome this problem show rigidity in their structure which is a drawback. Inorganicsolar cells are rigid and can be mounted only on rooftops. Hence only upper surface of buildings are utilized. In this paperwe bring out a new era or solar cells- organic solar cells, which are flexible. These organic solar cells offer the bestsolution for the above problem for a tradeoff of efficiency.

If n = 2 then according to the conjecture X is a double cover of a (singular) sextic 4 -fold in P- 5. It follows from the conjecture that a deformation of (K 3) ([n]) carrying a divisor (not necessarily <b>ample)</b> <b>of</b> degree 2 has an anti-symplectic birational involution. We test the conjecture. In doing so we bump into some interesting geometry: examples of two anti-symplectic involutions generating an interesting dynamical system, a case of Strange duality and what is probably an involution on the moduli space of degree- 2 quasi-polarized (X, H) where X is a deformation of (K 3) ([2]) ...|$|R
