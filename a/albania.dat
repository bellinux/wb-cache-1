5|$|After the {{beginning}} of Bulgaria's engagement in First World War {{on the side of}} the Central Powers in autumn 1915, many ethnic Albanians joined the Bulgarians who gave them weapons. The Kingdom of Bulgaria used its army to occupy the eastern part of <b>Albania</b> at {{the beginning}} of the occupation of <b>Albania.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the bunkers {{were never}} {{used in a}} real {{conflict}} during Hoxha's rule, some found use in conflicts that {{broke out in the}} 1990s. During the 1997 rebellion in <b>Albania,</b> the townspeople of Sarandë in southern <b>Albania</b> were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages in <b>Albania</b> were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the bunkers to shelter from the shelling.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the progress of}} <b>Albania’s</b> transition towards democratic consolidation. With a focus on <b>Albania’s</b> post-communist elections, the discussion addresses the potentials and limitations of the EU’s leverage in <b>Albania’s</b> move towards democracy. The analysis of the time prior and after the introduction of conditionality, suggests {{that the quality of}} the election processes has changed significantly in the context of EU conditionality. Yet this paper also argues that the EU needs to address the real exigencies of <b>Albania’s</b> domestic politics, more from the democracy consolidation approach rather than the stabilization one...|$|R

5|$|In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Senate of Central <b>Albania</b> (established by the rebelling towns in mid and north <b>Albania)</b> to return to <b>Albania</b> to take control. His first task was to provide financial backing for his government. Therefore, he travelled to Niš, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Pašić signed a secret treaty of Serbian-Albanian alliance on September17. In October1914 Essad Pasha returned to <b>Albania.</b> With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in Dibër and captured the interior and Durrës {{at the beginning of}} October, without a fight.|$|E
50|$|Opposition to Zogu was formidable. Orthodox peasants in <b>Albania's</b> {{southern}} lowlands loathed Zogu {{because he}} supported the Muslim landowners' efforts to block land reform; Shkodër's citizens felt shortchanged because their city did not become <b>Albania's</b> capital, and nationalists were dissatisfied because Zogu's government did not press <b>Albania's</b> claims to Kosovo or speak up more energetically {{for the rights of}} the ethnic Albanian minorities in present-day Yugoslavia and Greece.|$|R

5|$|Seeing {{that their}} {{fortunes}} were dwindling, Ferdinand's rivals tried {{to settle for}} peace with Francisco Sforza. Ferdinand sent Skanderbeg as an intermediary where Giovanni Orsini and Piccinino offered peace if paid 150,000 and 110,000 ducats respectively, something that Ferdinand refused. This was one of Skanderbeg's last personal actions in Italy. He stayed in Apulia for another month until January 1462 {{when he returned to}} <b>Albania,</b> leaving his soldiers in Italy. His reason for leaving Italy is not clear, but it is believed that at that time Mehmed was preparing his campaign against Hungary, something which could be turned against <b>Albania.</b> On his return route, he again visited Ragusa, where he was likewise welcomed as a hero. He wanted to set off for <b>Albania</b> immediately, but bad weather forced him to stay. He was offered supplies by the Ragusan Rectors, suggesting that he wished to continue to <b>Albania</b> via land, but instead, after ten days in Ragusa, he sailed by ship to <b>Albania.</b> Before leaving, he purchased grain from Sicily for his soldiers in Apulia.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Korçë was {{established}} in 1916 during World War I. The Austro-Hungarian army invaded northern <b>Albania</b> {{in the spring of}} 1916, the Kingdom of Bulgaria's army occupied the eastern parts of <b>Albania,</b> including the city of Elbassan (which was later handed over to Austria-Hungary). The French army occupied Korçë and its surrounding areas on November 29, 1916. Italy occupied the port of Vlorë and the region of south Principality of <b>Albania</b> on December 1914 and in the autumn 1916.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 (the Venizelos-Tittoni agreement), Northern Epirus was to be awarded to Greece, but {{political}} developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and strong Italian opposition in favor of <b>Albania</b> caused the area to be finally ceded to <b>Albania</b> in 1921.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{the foreign}} {{intelligence}} section maintained personnel abroad {{and at home}} to obtain intelligence about foreign capabilities and intentions that affected <b>Albania's</b> national security. Its officers occupied cover positions in <b>Albania's</b> foreign diplomatic missions, trade offices, and cultural centers.|$|R

5|$|When Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies in September 1943, all concentration camps in <b>Albania</b> were dissolved. Shortly after, the Germans invaded and occupied <b>Albania,</b> and most Italian soldiers in the country {{surrendered to}} the Germans. German forces then began to target for extermination all Jews living in <b>Albania</b> and the Albanian-dominated regions of occupied Yugoslavia. The Jewish community in western Macedonia, which had remained untouched under Italian occupation, was targeted and several groups of Jews were dispatched to extermination camps. Their property and belongings were later taken by many organizations, institutions and private individuals.|$|E
5|$|After several failed {{invasions of}} <b>Albania</b> by Ottoman captains, Murad II laid siege to the {{fortress}} of Svetigrad (which {{is thought to}} be today's Demir Hisar) on May 14, 1448, with a force of 80,000 men. Svetigrad was an important strategic point, since it controlled the routes from Macedonia into <b>Albania.</b> The small garrison, composed of Albanians, Bulgarians, and other Europeans, held the fortress while Scanderbeg attacked the Ottoman camp from outside. After the Ottomans poisoned the wells, a group of defenders decided to open the gates and let the Turks in, thus giving control of the fortress to the Ottomans. The Sultan retired from <b>Albania</b> and Skanderbeg laid siege to Svetigrad on September 23, 1448. After several failed assaults, Skanderbeg lifted the siege and retreated. In early 1450, Berat was captured by the pasha of Gjirokastër through a night attack, causing Gjergj Arianit to desert Skandebeg's cause.|$|E
5|$|Another Ottoman {{army was}} {{assembled}} in Manastir {{in the summer}} of 1434. Again under the command of Sinan Pasha, this Ottoman expedition was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti in south-central <b>Albania</b> in August 1434. After his defeat, all beys of the territories bordering <b>Albania</b> were ordered to gather their forces and attack the rebels. In December 1434 Ishak Bey, sanjakbey of Üsküb marched into south-central <b>Albania</b> but was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti. Contemporary sources from the senate of Ragusa mention that many Ottoman soldiers were captured, while Ishak Bey escaped with a small group. In April 1435, Arianiti defeated another Ottoman campaign and hostilities virtually ceased until the beginning of 1436, as Murat II's military efforts were focused against Ibrahim of Karaman in Anatolia. At the end of 1435 reports of the Ragusan senate assessed the situation as calm and noted that the belligerents had retreated to their respective territories.|$|E

5|$|His {{regime was}} also hostile towards the country's {{immediate}} neighbours. <b>Albania</b> {{did not end}} its state of war with Greece, {{left over from the}} Second World War, until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern <b>Albania</b> (known to Greeks as Northern Epirus) as well as Greece's status as a NATO member state.|$|E

5000|$|Alia did not relax censorship, {{but he did}} allow public {{discussions of}} <b>Albania's</b> {{societal}} problems and encouraged debates among writers and artists on cultural issues. In response to international criticism of <b>Albania's</b> record on human rights, the new leadership loosened some political controls and ceased to apply repression on a mass scale. In 1989, general amnesties brought about the release of many long-term prisoners. He strengthened ties with Greece, Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. A loosening of restrictions on travel and tourism resulted in a more promising outlook for <b>Albania's</b> tourist trade.|$|R
5|$|In 1925, <b>Albania</b> {{became the}} world {{center of the}} Bektashi Order, a Muslim sect. The sect was {{headquartered}} in Tirana, and Gjirokastër was one of six districts of the Bektashi Order in <b>Albania,</b> with its center at the tekke of Baba Rexheb. The city retains a large Bektashi and Sunni population. Historically there were 15 and tekkes and mosques, of which 13 were functional in 1945. Only Gjirokastër Mosque has survived; the remaining 12 were destroyed or closed during the Cultural Revolution of the communist government in 1967.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{a crisis}} erupted in <b>Albania</b> after the {{collapse}} of several massive pyramid schemes, which resulted in social deterioration and violence in the country. An imposition of a curfew and a state of emergency on 2 March provoked a popular rebellion, causing concern in Italy, which feared another large-scale migration flow. Albanian migration to Italy reached its peak {{in the latter half of}} March, bringing great pressure to Italian accommodation centers and provoking a strong reaction in Italian public opinion. Italy had been operating under a bilateral agreement with <b>Albania</b> to board Albanian vessels whenever encountered starting on 3 April 1997 and Albanian would-be migrants going to Italy would be sent back to <b>Albania,</b> in exchange for Italian financial, police, and humanitarian assistance to the country. A military Operation White Flags was established in the international waters of the Strait and implemented a de facto naval blockade.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there were 1,800 Jews in <b>Albania</b> {{at the end of}} the Second World War, eleven times the number of Jews that were living in the country in 1939. The Jewish community in Kosovo never fully recovered from the war. Few Jews remained in Kosovo and many emigrated to Israel during the communist period. Similarly, most Jews in <b>Albania</b> decided to emigrate following the communist takeover. About 300 remained in the country until the early 1990s. The official Albanian census of April 1989 recorded 73 Jews living in the country. With the fall of Communism, <b>Albania</b> eased restrictions on religion and foreign travel, which resulted in virtually the entire Jewish community of the country emigrating to Israel. From December 1990 to June 1991, 350 Albanian Jews were airlifted from <b>Albania</b> to Israel in what was codenamed Operation Flying Carpet. Most of Albania's 60 remaining Jews left in 1997, after the country became engulfed in a brief civil war.|$|E
