5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of <b>animal</b> <b>studies</b> also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the <b>animal</b> <b>studies</b> use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in <b>animal</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|E

5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from <b>animal</b> <b>studies.</b> Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple <b>animal</b> <b>studies</b> have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events. Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from <b>animal</b> <b>studies.</b> Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} {{paracetamol}} overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as {{the demand for}} glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis. In <b>animal</b> <b>studies,</b> the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.|$|E

5|$|N-Acetylcysteine {{has shown}} promise in {{combination}} with other therapies. <b>Animal</b> <b>studies</b> indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E
5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in <b>animal</b> <b>studies.</b> Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E
40|$|In {{estimating}} health-protective {{levels of}} chemicals in drinking water, {{one of the}} factors that should be considered is the proportion of the total permissible dose that is derived from water, versus other exposure routes. This is applied only for chemicals or toxic effects presumed to involve a toxicity threshold (primarily non-cancer effects), in which the combined daily dose from all exposure routes is used for calculation of allowable exposure levels. However, the calculation of the relative source contribution (RSC) is usually rather uncertain {{due to a lack of}} appropriate data, and the methods for estimation of an RSC in the absence of complete data involve a large component of “professional judgment. ” U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) policy provides limited guidance on calculating RSC. Values in the range of 0. 2 to 0. 8 (20 to 80 %) are allowed, with a default value of 0. 2 (20 %) of total permissible exposure in the absence of data. OEHHA has generally followed this guidance, although it has also used a value of 1. 0 (100 %) in its derivation of Public Health Goals (PHGs) for drinking water when human data were used, which was uncontrolled for environmental exposures. Application of the principles for development of RSCs can be illustrated by examining the values and rationale used in the development of PHGs. Examples of the range of values include aluminum (1. 0, acute human study), beryllium (0. 2, <b>animal</b> <b>study),</b> cadmium (0. 2, chronic human study), copper (0. 8, acute human study), ethylbenzene (0. 2, chronic <b>animal</b> <b>study),</b> fluoride (1. 0, chronic human studies), Freon- 11 (0. 4, subchronic <b>animal</b> <b>study),</b> nickel (0. 3, <b>animal</b> reproductive <b>study),</b> simazine (0. 2, chronic <b>animal</b> <b>study),</b> thallium (0. 2, subchronic <b>animal</b> <b>study),</b> 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene (0. 2, subchronic <b>animal</b> <b>study),</b> and xylene (0. 4, chronic human study). The entire set of 69 chemicals for which PHGs have so far been finalized provides a larger database for illustration of the application of RSC development principles...|$|R

5|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>studies</b> {{show that}} astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although {{to a lesser}} extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In <b>animal</b> <b>studies,</b> most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} <b>animal</b> <b>studies</b> utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
