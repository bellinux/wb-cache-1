On some terminal links, food was withheld to obtain start and stop times, measures of temporal control. Log initial-link response ratios stabilized within the first half of each session. Log response ratio was a monotonically-increasing but nonlinear function of programmed log terminal-link immediacy ratio. There was an effect of absolute terminal-link duration on log response ratio: For most subjects, preference for the relatively shorter terminal-link delay was stronger when <b>absolute</b> <b>delays</b> were long than when <b>absolute</b> <b>delays</b> were short.

Because of variable duration of cardiac cycle resulting in reduced image quality, AF has been considered relative contraindication for performing coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). However, recent reports have suggested that newer dual source scanner with higher temporal resolution can be used in patients with AF (Oncel et al., 2007; Wolak et al., 2008; Rist et al., 2009).

40|$|Terrestrial mammals span a {{wide range}} of sizes, with the largest {{elephant}} being several million times more massive than the smallest shrew. This huge size range results in small and large animals experiencing very different physical challenges, yet all animals must effectively interact with their environment to survive. In order to sense and respond to stimuli with similar speed and precision, small and large animals may need to control their movement in different ways. To begin to understand whether and how small and large animals coordinate their movement with similar effectiveness despite their different physical challenges, I investigated how size influences the physiological mechanisms underlying sensorimotor control. My general hypothesis was that the sensorimotor systems of larger animals have longer delays and lower precision than those of smaller animals. To investigate the scaling of delays, I combined my own electrophysiology measurements with data from the literature to determine how total response time and its component delays changed with animal mass. To investigate the scaling of precision, I combined my own histology measurements with data from the literature to determine how nerve fiber number and size distribution changed with animal mass. As part of this, I developed a supervised image analysis method to measure nerve fiber characteristics in scanning electron microscope images. I found that larger animals have longer <b>absolute</b> <b>delays</b> and more nerve fibers than smaller animals. However, changes to movement times with animal size almost entirely compensate for increases in <b>absolute</b> <b>delays,</b> resulting in similar relative delays for all sizes of animals. Nerve fiber number increases more slowly than animal mass, area, and muscle force, suggesting that larger animals have relatively fewer sensors and motor units than smaller animals. Nerve fiber size distribution becomes more bimodal as animal size increases, ameliorating the potential tradeoff between speed and precision in peripheral nerves. While small and large animals {{seem to be able to}} sense and respond to stimuli within the same relative time, large animals may face challenges in situations requiring short <b>absolute</b> <b>delays</b> and high precision, and may need to rely more heavily on predictive methods of control...|$|R

40|$|Supporting {{quality of}} service (QoS) over the Internet is a very {{important}} issue and many mechanisms have already been devised or are under way towards achieving this goal. One of the most important approaches is the so-called Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture, which provides a scalable mechanism for QoS support in a TCP/IP network. The main concept underlying DiffServ is the aggregation of traffic flows at an ingress (or egress) point of a network and the marking of the IP packets of each traffic flow according to several classification criteria. Diffserv is classified under two taxonomies: the absolute and the relative. In absolute DiffServ architecture, an admission control scheme is utilized to provide QoS as absolute bounds of specific QoS parameters. The relative DiffServ model offers also QoS guarantees per class but in reference to the guarantees given to the other classes defined. In this paper, relative proportional delay differentiation is achieved based on class-based queueing (CBQ) scheduler. Specifically, the service rates allocated to the classes of a CBQ scheduler are frequently adjusted in order to obtain relative delay spacing among them. The model presented can also be exploited in order to meet <b>absolute</b> <b>delay</b> constraints in conj. unction With relative delay differentiation provision. Simulation experiments verify that our model can attain relative as well as <b>absolute</b> <b>delay</b> differentiation provided that the preconditions posed are satisfied.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} for designing power efficient schedulers for transmitting bursty traffic sources over Gaussian wireless channels that provides deterministic and statistical guarantees on absolute delays experienced by the source packets. The proposed schedulers compute the transmission rate and power using temporal water-filling techniques without any knowledge of the arrival traffic statistics. The schedulers reduce the average transmission power substantially (55 % in some scenarios) for small increases in delay. The framework allows us to design schedulers that artfully tradeoff the performance with the complexity of computing the schedulers. We also introduce an iterative process to compute a lower bound on the transmit power of any scheduler that provides <b>absolute</b> <b>delay</b> guarantees.
