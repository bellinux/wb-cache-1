Cooper {{complained to the}} French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel.

Premature rumors {{of his death}} {{prompted}} The New York Times to print a quite vituperative obituary suggesting that Breckinridge had been a hypocrite for supporting states' rights, then abandoning his home state when it chose {{to remain in the}} Union. Confederate leaders were skeptical of Bragg's claims against Breckinridge, and in February 1864, Confederate President Jefferson Davis assigned him to the Eastern Theater <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in charge of the Trans-Allegheny Department (later known as the Department of East Tennessee and West Virginia).|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut.

He also was given custody of two estates that had escheated to the crown– Rayleigh in 1181 and Boulogne in 1183.

The new king, Richard I, kept Henry close <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in charge of assembling the fleet that Richard needed to go on the Third Crusade. His accounts for his efforts in 1190 in assembling the fleet still survive. These show that Henry bought part or all of 40 ships and paid out a year's wages for over a thousand sailors for the expedition. The total expenses for Henry's efforts totalled over 5,000 pounds.|$|E

Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, blindly believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in house arrest in {{a room at the}} ground floor of his own Bagh Durbar. Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidence, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured.

Bohemond was to retain Antioch until his death with the title of doux, unless the emperor (either Alexios or, in the future, John) chose for any reason to renege on the deal. The principality would revert to direct Byzantine rule on Bohemond's death. Bohemond therefore could not set up a dynasty in Antioch, although he was guaranteed the right {{to pass on to}} his heirs the County of Edessa, and any other territories he managed to acquire in the Syrian interior.|$|E

5|$|During an {{unsuccessful}} senatorial bid in 1914, Stanley assumed an anti-prohibition stance. This issue would dominate {{his political career}} {{for more than a}} decade <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> at odds with J. C. W. Beckham, the leader of the pro-temperance faction of the state's Democratic Party. In 1915, Stanley ran for governor, defeating his close friend Edwin P. Morrow by just over 400 votes. It was the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history. Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's administration the apex of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. Among the reforms adopted during his tenure were a state antitrust law, a campaign finance reform law, and a workman's compensation law. In 1918, Stanley was chosen as the Democratic nominee to succeed the recently deceased senator Ollie M. James. Stanley was elected, but did not resign as governor to take the seat until May 1919 and accomplished little in his single term. He lost his re-election bid to Frederic M. Sackett in the 1924 Republican landslide and never again held elected office. He died in Washington, D.C. on August 12, 1958.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 895 the talented general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder was summoned to Constantinople and sent against the Bulgarians {{at the head of}} a large army. While Simeon concentrated his forces along the southern border to confront Phokas, the Byzantine navy under admiral Eustathios Argyros sailed to the Danube Delta to assist the Magyars. Believing that Simeon I would back off Leo VI sent an envoy, Constantinacios, to propose peace. Simeon I, who had studied in the University of Constantinople and was familiar with the Byzantine diplomacy, was suspicious of the Byzantine rapprochement, charged Constantinacios with espionage <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into custody. The Danube was barred with an iron chain to impede the movement of the Byzantine navy and the bulk of the army was dislocated northwards. The Byzantines, however, managed to break the chain and transported the Magyar hordes south of the river. The Magyars, led by Árpád's son Liüntika, ravaged Dobrudzha and dealt a heavy defeat on the Bulgarian army, led personally by Simeon I. Simeon sought refuge in the strong fortress of Drastar while the Magyars pillaged and looted unopposed, reaching the outskirts of the capital Preslav. Before retreating north, the Magyars sold thousands of captives to the Byzantines.|$|E
