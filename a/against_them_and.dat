5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach a {{settlement}} in early 1990, the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{had been}} granted {{first-class}} status {{in advance of the}} 1882 season. Their maiden season at the top level was described by Wisden as disastrous, but the publication qualified this statement with mild optimism for 1883. The county {{failed to live up to}} this optimism, and although there were a few wins, performances on the whole were poor. Twice between 1882 and 1884 Somerset's opponents scored over 500 runs in an innings <b>against</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> against Lancashire in 1884 they fielded only ten players. Stephen Newton, who had captained the side since 1882, left the club at the end of the 1884 season, and thereafter played all his cricket in London.|$|E

The Jurchen, a subject tribe of the Liao, rebelled <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> formed their own state, the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). The Song official Tong Guan (1054–1126) advised Emperor Huizong (1100–1125) to form an alliance with the Jurchens, and the joint military campaign under this Alliance Conducted at Sea toppled and completely conquered the Liao dynasty by 1125.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} the start of the Grand Prix weekend, Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde {{launched}} legal action against Sauber before the Supreme Court of Victoria, to enforce a contract he entered into in June 2014 to drive for the team during the 2015 season. This action was based on an award that van der Garde obtained on 2 March 2015 through international arbitration in Switzerland, which he initiated after the team announced in November 2014 that their 2015 drivers would instead be Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. On Wednesday, 11 March 2015, van der Garde succeeded by obtaining court orders compelling Sauber to permit him to drive in Melbourne. On the same day, Sauber appealed the orders made <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> also publicly announced that they would not compromise the safety of the team or other drivers by putting van der Garde in the car, since the C34 chassis had only been tailored to fit Ericsson and Nasr.|$|E
5|$|Abiodun Alao of King's College London {{marks the}} Entumbane episode as {{the start of}} the Zimbabwe National Army's politicisation. The ex-Rhodesians' enthusiasm and success during the battle, coupled with Mugabe's {{readiness}} to deploy them, convinced many in ZAPU that ZANU–PF and the white community had united <b>against</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> intensified ZAPU opposition to the government. ZIPRA guerrillas deserted from the assembly points and the National Army en masse following the rebellion's failure, fearing for their safety. Mugabe's sense of resolve regarding his political rivals was greatly strengthened, meanwhile; Entumbane satisfied him that white army officers and airmen could be counted on in future conflicts with ZAPU. The Entumbane engagement was the RAR's last—its companies were allocated to other 1Brigade units later in 1981 during the military reform process—but a number of its white officers subsequently led units of the Zimbabwean special forces during the 1980s. Dyck, for example, headed the 1st Parachute Battalion.|$|E

5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the woods for {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E
5|$|In 723, al-Harashi was {{replaced}} as governor by Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi, who resolved late {{the next year}} to launch an expedition {{with the goal of}} seizing Ferghana. The campaign faced difficulties already in its early stages, when the news arrived of the accession of a new Caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, and the appointment of a new governor of Iraq, Khalid al-Qasri. This brought the long-simmering tribal rivalries of the Arabs of Khurasan came to the fore: the Yemeni (southern Arab) troops in Balkh initially refused to join the campaign, as they expected the imminent recall of al-Kilabi (who was of northern Arab stock) by the new regime. Only after Nasr ibn Sayyar led a force of Mudaris (northern Arabs) <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> defeated them at Baruqan did the Yemenis join al-Kilabi's army. The campaign eventually went ahead as Khalid al-Qasri wrote to al-Kilabi, urging him to proceed with it until his replacement, Khalid's brother Asad, arrived in Khurasan. Nevertheless, 4,000 troops from the Yemeni Azd tribe withdrew from the army.|$|E
5|$|In the southwest, Ecgberht was {{defeated}} in 836 at Carhampton by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> their allies the West Welsh at the Battle of Hingston Down in Cornwall. The Dumnonian royal line continued after this time, but {{it is at this}} date that the independence of one of the last British kingdoms may be considered to have ended. The details of Anglo-Saxon expansion into Cornwall are quite poorly recorded, but some evidence comes from place names. The river Ottery, which flows east into the Tamar near Launceston, appears to be a boundary: south of the Ottery the placenames are overwhelmingly Cornish, whereas to the north they are more heavily influenced by the English newcomers.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive {{controversy}} erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious {{over the loss of}} so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly <b>against</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.|$|E
5|$|The Canucks {{completed}} their second {{season with the}} Chicago Wolves as American Hockey League affiliate, the final one under the two teams' contract. The Wolves started the season by winning their first four games {{for the second time}} in franchise history. The following games were not as fruitful as they lost five of their next six games and their starting goaltender Eddie Lack suffered a hip injury. The injury required surgery, and Lack missed the remainder of the season. With Lack out the Wolves finished fifteenth in the league for fewest goals allowed. The previous season they allowed the fifth fewest goals in the league. Lack and back-up Matt Climie set a franchise record for lowest team goals against average. With the league's nineteenth best offense, the Wolves were unable to overcome the goals <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> finished fourth in their division. Thus missing the playoffs. It was the second time in three years that the Wolves missed the playoffs, but only the fourth time in franchise history. Despite missing the playoffs, Chicago finished second in league attendance.|$|E

5|$|The French, who {{had started}} {{construction}} on Fort Carillon in 1755, {{used it as a}} launching point for the successful siege of Fort William Henry in 1757. Despite that and other successes in North America in 1757, the situation did not look good for them in 1758. As early as March, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, the commanding general responsible of the French forces in North America, and the Marquis de Vaudreuil, New France's governor, were aware that the British were planning to send large numbers of troops <b>against</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> that they would have relatively little support from King Louis XV of France. The lack of support from France was in large part due to an unwillingness of the French military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the Atlantic Ocean, which was dominated by Britain's Royal Navy. This situation was further exacerbated by Canada's poor harvest in 1757, which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into three parts: concealment, advertisement, and disguise. Part 1, concealment, covers the methods of camouflage, which are colour resemblance, countershading, {{disruptive}} coloration, and shadow elimination. The effectiveness of these, arguments for and <b>against</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> experimental evidence, are described. Part 2, advertisement, covers the methods of becoming conspicuous, especially for warning displays in aposematic animals. Examples are chosen from mammals, insects, reptiles and marine animals, and empirical evidence from feeding experiments with toads is presented. Part 3, disguise, covers methods of mimicry that provide camouflage, as when animals resemble leaves or twigs, and markings and displays that help to deflect attack or to deceive predators with deimatic displays. Both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry are treated as adaptive resemblance, much like camouflage, while a chapter is devoted to the mimicry and behaviour of the cuckoo. The concluding chapter admits that the book's force is cumulative, consisting of many small steps of reasoning, and being a wartime book, compares animal to military camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{petitions}} {{and political}} crisis continued to {{the reign of}} Hamad (1923–42) who —encouraged by the British— began it by setting up a criminal court to try {{those involved in the}} violence including his first cousins, the Khalids. The ruler was put in a dilemma between his tribal alignment and public law, and so he exiled his cousins, but paid their expenses. The Khalids, however, held a deep grudge against residents of Sitra who witnessed <b>against</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> in 1924 attacked the island before their exile, killing several Shia men, women and children. The attackers were sentenced to death following major Shia protests and a lengthy second trial, but managed to escape before the sentence was carried out. Their father was confined to Manama. The trials marked the first time in Bahrain's history that members of the ruling family were convicted.|$|E

5|$|Despite Justinian's {{intentions}} and proclamations, however, Roman control over Africa {{was not yet}} secure. During his campaign, Belisarius had secured most of the provinces of Byzacena, Zeugitana and Tripolitania. Further west, on the other hand, imperial control extended {{in a series of}} strongholds captured by the fleet along the coast as far as Constantine, while most of the inland areas of Numidia and Mauretania remained {{under the control of the}} local Moorish tribes, as indeed had been the case under the Vandal kings. The Moors initially acknowledged the Emperor's suzerainty and gave hostages to the imperial authorities, but they soon became restive and rose in revolt. The first imperial governor, Belisarius' former domesticus Solomon, who combined the offices of both magister militum and praetorian prefect, was able to score successes <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> strengthen Roman rule in Africa, but his work was interrupted by a widespread military mutiny in 536. The mutiny was eventually subdued by Germanus, a cousin of Justinian, and Solomon returned in 539. He fell, however, in the Battle of Cillium in 544 against the united Moorish tribes, and Roman Africa was again in jeopardy. It would not be until 548 that the resistance of the Moorish tribes would be finally broken by the talented general John Troglita.|$|E
5|$|Theodore was {{released}} in 1237 when his daughter Irene married John Asen, and quickly managed {{to regain control of}} Thessalonica, ousting Manuel. Having been blinded during his captivity and thus disqualified from occupying the throne again, he installed his eldest son John as emperor, but remained the de facto regent of the state. Manuel tried to regain Thessalonica with Nicaean support, but a negotiated settlement was reached which gave him Thessaly and left Thessalonica and its environs to Theodore and John. In 1241, John III Vatatzes invited Theodore to visit Nicaea. He was welcomed and treated with great honour, but was effectively detained there until the spring of next year, when Vatatzes marched on Thessalonica with Theodore in tow. Theodore was sent in to negotiate with his son and convince him to accept demotion to the rank of Despot and to recognize the suzerainty of Nicaea. John died in 1244 and was succeeded by Theodore's younger son Demetrios. In 1246, Vatatzes overthrew the unpopular Demetrios and annexed Thessalonica. Theodore influenced his nephew Michael II to launch an attack on Thessalonica in 1251, but in 1252, Vatatzes campaigned <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> forced Michael to come to terms. Theodore was taken prisoner and sent into exile in Nicaea, where he died around 1253.|$|E
