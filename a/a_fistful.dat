The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Steiger {{played a}} chauvinistic big game hunter, {{explorer}} and war hero opposite Susannah York in Mark Robson's Happy Birthday, Wanda June, before agreeing to star alongside James Coburn as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in Sergio Leone's Duck, You Sucker!, which was alternatively titled <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dynamite. Leone was initially dissatisfied with {{his performance in}} that he played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan's stagecoach is destroyed. After the film's completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned {{for the role of}} Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him.|$|E

5|$|Yojimbo (The Bodyguard), Kurosawa Production's second film, {{centers on}} a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two {{opposing}} violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the Western, {{while at the same}} time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring Tatsuya Nakadai in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by Kazuo Miyagawa (who shot Rashomon) and Takao Saito, the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. The movie and its blackly comic tone were also widely imitated abroad. Sergio Leone's <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake with Toho filing a lawsuit on Kurosawa's behalf and prevailing.|$|E

Commemorating its 25th anniversary, Megaforce reissued the album on three colored 10-inch LPs, also including Armed and Dangerous.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent re-releases {{have largely}} used the title <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dynamite, {{although}} the DVD appearing in The Sergio Leone Anthology box set, released by MGM in 2007, used the original English language title of Duck, You Sucker!.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} Spaghetti Westerns {{were those of}} Sergio Leone, whose Dollars Trilogy (<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), {{featuring}} Clint Eastwood and scores by Ennio Morricone, came to define the genre along with Once Upon a Time in the West.|$|E
25|$|The {{turning point}} in Morricone's career took place in 1964, {{the year in which}} his third child, Andrea Morricone, who would also become a film composer, was born. Film {{director}} Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's different version of the Western, <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars (1964).|$|E
500|$|Michael Christopher of The Boston Phoenix {{commented that}} Anthrax {{has learned from}} its past {{mistakes}} in making the album. He observed that the humor that characterized the previous albums was still present, and called this album <b>a</b> [...] "fresh <b>fistful</b> of metal". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times compared Worship Music to Metallica's Lulu, saying that Anthrax, unlike Metallica, opted to [...] "reclaim ground" [...] dominated by younger bands. Mark Fisher, writing in Metal Forces, highlighted the guitar performance, saying {{it reminded him of}} the sound Anthrax is mostly associated with. Although Fisher preferred the albums with John Bush on vocals, he remarked that Worship Music is a fine recording with a career-defining performance by Joey Belladonna. Chad Bowar from About.com also praised Belladonna's performance, noting that the vocal delivery was filled with angst and emotion. He opined that Anthrax sounded rejuvenated and qualified the album as a return to form.|$|R
25|$|His 1996 effort Last Man Standing with Bruce Willis, a Prohibition-era Western {{update of}} Yojimbo (and thus {{reminiscent}} of that film's inspiration, Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest, and its western incarnation, <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars) saw him {{return to his}} earlier style to some extent: a gruff antihero and a heavy focus on stylized action.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to {{the success}} of the Dollars trilogy, Morricone {{composed}} also the scores for Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Leone's last credited western film <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dynamite (1971), as well as the scores for My Name Is Nobody (1973) and A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe (1975), produced by Sergio Leone.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars was {{released}} in Italy in September 1964. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed {{more than any other}} Italian film up to that point. In January 1967 the film premièred in the United States grossing $4.5 million for the year. It eventually grossed $14.5 million in its American release. In 1969 it was re-released, earning $1.2 million in rentals.|$|E

25|$|Being period drama pieces, {{both the}} Western and samurai genre {{influenced}} {{each other in}} style and themes throughout the years. The Magnificent Seven was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's film The Seven Samurai, and <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars was a remake of Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which itself was inspired by Red Harvest, an American detective novel by Dashiell Hammett. Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was {{a fan of the}} genre, most especially John Ford.|$|E
25|$|As few Spaghetti Westerns had {{yet been}} {{released}} in the United States, many of the European cast and crew took on American-sounding stage names. These included Leone himself ("Bob Robertson"), Gian Maria Volontè ("Johnny Wels"), and composer Ennio Morricone ("Dan Savio"). <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars was shot in Spain, mostly near Hoyo de Manzanares close to Madrid, but also (like its two sequels) in the Tabernas Desert and in the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, both {{in the province of}} Almería.|$|E
25|$|The Western films {{directed}} by Sergio Leone were felt {{by some to}} have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns. Veteran American actors Charles Bronson, Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as James Coburn, Henry Fonda, Klaus Kinski, and Jason Robards. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series Rawhide, unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars was {{at first}} {{intended}} by Leone to reinvent the western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite {{the fact that even}} Hollywood began to gear down production of such films, Leone knew that there was still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences laughed at the stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting.|$|E
25|$|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was {{marketed as}} {{the third and final}} {{installment}} in the Dollars Trilogy, following <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is now seen {{as one of the greatest}} and most influential Westerns of all time.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars was {{released}} 18 January 1967 (28 months after its initial Italian release); For a Few Dollars More {{was released}} 10 May 1967 (17 months); and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was released 29 December 1967 (12 months). Thus, {{all three of}} Leone's Dollars Trilogy films were released in the United States during the same year. The original Italian domestic version was 177 minutes long, but the international version was shown at various lengths. Most prints, specifically those shown in the United States, had a runtime of 161 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than the Italian premiere version, but others, especially British prints, ran as short as 148 minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars was an Italian/German/Spanish co-production, {{so there}} was a {{significant}} language barrier on set. Leone did not speak English, and Eastwood communicated with the Italian cast and crew mostly through stuntman Benito Stefanelli, who also acted as an unlicensed interpreter for the production and would later appear in Leone's other pictures. Similar to other Italian films shot at the time, all footage was filmed silent, and the dialogue and sound effects were dubbed over in post-production. For the Italian version of the film, Eastwood was dubbed by stage and screen actor Enrico Maria Salerno, whose 'sinister' rendition of the Man with No Name's voice contrasted with Eastwood's cocksure and darkly humorous interpretation.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars {{became the}} first film to exhibit Leone's famously {{distinctive}} style of visual direction. This was influenced by both John Ford's cinematic landscaping and the Japanese method of direction perfected by Akira Kurosawa. Leone wanted an operatic feel to his western, {{and so there are}} many examples of extreme close-ups on the faces of different characters, functioning like arias in a traditional opera. The rhythm, emotion, and communication within scenes can be attributed to Leone’s meticulous framing of his close-ups. This is quite different from Hollywood's use of close-ups that used them as reaction shots, usually to a line of dialogue that had just been spoken. Leone's close-ups are more akin to portraits, often lit with Renaissance-type lighting effects, and are considered by some as pieces of design in their own right.|$|E
25|$|Shepherd wrote {{a series}} of humorous short stories {{about growing up in}} {{northwest}} Indiana and its steel towns, many of which were first told by him on his programs and then published in Playboy. The stories were later assembled into books titled In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories: and Other Disasters, The Ferrari in the Bedroom, and <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Fig Newtons. Some of those situations were incorporated into his movies and television fictional stories. He also wrote a column for the early Village Voice, a column for Car and Driver, numerous individual articles for diverse publications, including Mad Magazine ("The Night People vs. Creeping Meatballism", March/April 1957), and introductions for books such as The America of George Ade, American Snapshots, and the 1970 reprint of the 1929 Johnson Smith Catalogue.|$|E
25|$|During the {{production}} of Johnny Oro, Sergio Corbucci was approached by Manolo Bolognini, an ambitious young producer who had previously worked as Pier Paolo Pasolini's production manager on The Gospel According to St. Matthew, to write and direct a Spaghetti Western that would recoup the losses of his first film as producer, The Possessed. Corbucci immediately accepted Bolognini's offer, leaving Johnny Oro {{to be completed by}} others. The director wanted to create a film inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which he had seen two years prior on recommendation from his regular cinematographer, Enzo Barboni. Corbucci also wanted to make a film that would rival the success of <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars, a Yojimbo adaptation directed by his friend Sergio Leone. According to Ruggero Deodato, Corbucci's assistant director, the director borrowed the idea of a protagonist who dragged a coffin behind him from a comic magazine he found on a news-stand in Via Veneto, Rome.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{the lead}} roles of Duck, You Sucker! {{proved to be}} a {{difficult}} process. The role of John Mallory was written for Jason Robards, who had played Cheyenne in Once Upon a Time in the West. However, the studio wanted a bigger name for his character. Clint Eastwood was then approached by Leone for the role, but he saw it as just a different take of the same character he had already played in the Dollars Trilogy, and he also wanted to end his association with the Italian film industry. As a result, he declined the offer and starred in Hang 'Em High instead. George Lazenby was then approached to play John, but he declined. A young Malcolm McDowell, then mostly known for his performance in if...., was considered for both John and Nolan, John’s Irish friend, but Leone eventually settled on James Coburn to play John. Coburn had previously been considered for other Leone projects, including <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars and Once Upon a Time in the West. He had also previously been considered for a role in another United Artists-financed Zapata Western, Sergio Corbucci's The Mercenary, but Franco Nero was later cast in what was originally his role.|$|E
500|$|In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on Rawhide, Eric Fleming, {{rejected}} {{an offer}} to star in an Italian-made western called <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars, to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his Rawhide image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for elevenweeks' work, with a bonus of a Mercedes automobile upon completion. Eastwood later spoke of {{the transition from a}} television western to <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I {{decided it was time to}} be an anti-hero." [...] Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the [...] "mask" [...] he was attempting to create for the loner character.|$|E
500|$|The Dollars trilogy was not {{released}} in the United States until 1967, when <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars opened in January, followed by For a Few Dollars More in May, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly on December 29, 1967. All the films were commercially successful, particularly The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which eventually earned $8million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star. All three films received bad reviews, and {{marked the beginning of}} a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect. Judith Crist described <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars as [...] "cheapjack," [...] while Newsweek considered For a Few Dollars More as [...] "excruciatingly dopey." [...] Renata Adler of The New York Times said The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was [...] "...the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre." [...] Time magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially on the part of Eastwood, though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised Eastwood's coolness in playing the tall, lone stranger. Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Chuck has been {{described}} as [...] "a blending of action soundtracks with Schwartz's penchant for good, pretty obscure bands" [...] such as Foreign Born and The Shins. Journey's song [...] "Any Way You Want It" [...] is featured as Chuck's ringtone. Other songs include [...] "Cobrastyle" [...] by Teddybears, [...] "Cellphone's Dead" [...] by Beck, [...] "Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is" [...] by Jet, [...] "See the World" [...] by Gomez, [...] "For <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars" [...] by Ennio Morricone, and [...] "The Missionary" [...] by Brothers Martin.|$|E
500|$|Wells {{has been}} used as the setting for several films including: The Canterbury Tales (1973), <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Fingers (1994), The Gathering [...] (2003), The Libertine (2004), [...] (2007), and Hot Fuzz (2007, as Sandford). The cathedral {{interior}} stood in for Southwark Cathedral during filming for the Doctor Who episode The Lazarus Experiment, and was also used as an interior location in the film Jack the Giant Slayer (2013), and in 2017 for the film Hellboy. In 2017 the market square and town hall was used for production of the BBC series Poldark.|$|E
500|$|... "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and the {{previous}} episode, [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship", were the first episodes to be produced for the seventh series, and both were directed by Saul Metzstein. The two episodes are Metzstein's first Doctor Who credits. Much of the episode was filmed around the desert area of Almería, Spain, where studios have built Wild West-style streets {{that have been used}} in the making of over 100 Western-set films, such as <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> of Dollars. Filming the episode in Spain was cheaper than constructing a set in the UK. Moffat stated, [...] "We knew from the start we need some serious location shooting for this one, and given the most iconic American setting imaginable, there was only one place to go– Spain." [...] They reportedly filmed there from 8 March to 17 March 2012. Filming took place at Oasys/Mini Hollywood, and Fort Bravo/Texas Hollywood. While Smith was allowed to try riding the horse, most of the action shown in the episode was done by his stuntman. Composer Murray Gold mimicked Western-style scores when creating the music for the episode.|$|E
