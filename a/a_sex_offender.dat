5|$|Under Oregon law, Goldschmidt {{would have}} been {{required}} to register as <b>a</b> <b>sex</b> <b>offender,</b> had he been convicted {{of the crime of}} third degree rape. The fact that the registration law didn't pass until 1997, after the illicit sexual relationship ended, would not have exempted him from registration. Oregon case law has determined that the registration of offenders whose acts were committed prior to the passage of the law does not violate either Oregon’s Constitution or the United States Constitution’s prohibition on ex post facto laws.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) and the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) {{began to work}} against police {{persecution}} of gay bars and entrapment in San Francisco. Oral sex was still a felony, and in 1970, nearly 90people in the city were arrested for having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800gay men were arrested for public sex in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as <b>a</b> <b>sex</b> <b>offender.</b>|$|E

40|$|Child <b>sex</b> {{abuse is}} <b>an</b> issue that raises much social concern, {{and in some}} {{societies}} <b>a</b> <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> 2 ̆ 7 register {{is used as a}} key measure to combat this problem. Drawing heavily upon a discourse of child protection, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong has recently suggested that such a mechanism should be implemented in Hong Kong. This article examines how the protection of children has in this case overridden the interests of other social groups and processes, whilst not necessarily reducing risks faced by children. What this proposal would achieve, however, is a false sense of control and security for both parents and policy makers. An effective response to child sexual abuse must include community education and rehabilitation provision for offenders, and must avoid over-reliance on 2 ̆ 7 protection-oriented 2 ̆ 7 measures such as <b>a</b> <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> 2 ̆ 7 register...|$|R
