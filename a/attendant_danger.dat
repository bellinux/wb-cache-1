40|$|Multiple testing {{procedures}} {{are commonly used}} in gene expression studies {{for the detection of}} differential expression, where typically thousands of genes are measured over at least two experimental conditions. Given the need for powerful {{testing procedures}}, and the <b>attendant</b> <b>danger</b> of false positives in multiple testing, the False Discovery Rate (FDR) controlling procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) has become a popular tool. When simultaneously testing hypotheses, suppose that R rejections are made, of which Fp are false positives. The Benjamini and Hochberg procedure ensures that the expectation of Fp/R is bounded above by some pre-specified proportion. In practice, the procedure is applied to a single experiment. In this paper we investigate the across-experiment variability of the proportion Fp/R as a function of three experimental parameters. The operational characteristics of the procedure when applied to dependent hypotheses are also considered. ...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Manchester University Press via [URL] article seeks to examine {{the notion of a}} ?history boom? on UK television (TV) {{during the second half of}} the 1990 s and 2000 s. It does this by sampling the UK TV schedule between 1982 and 2012, presenting material from interviews with leading producers and commissioners, and conducting an analysis of key programmes. What emerges is the contrary notion of a ?history dip? between the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, which in turn reveals an earlier high level of history programme output on UK TV. By adding to the previous accounts of history TV production, this article comments on a tendency in media history towards a ?history of the victor?, with the <b>attendant</b> <b>danger</b> of overlooking important periods of televisual output and industrial transformation. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This article {{critically}} examines {{recent works}} on resilience. In so doing, it argues {{that rather than}} representing some radical rupture with current practices heralding {{the dawn of a}} new era, as David Chandler claims, the emphasis on individuals as resilient subjects simply represents a new phase inthe neoliberal shift from the state as provider to state as enabler and promoter of self-reliance. Indeed, our present preoccupation with complexity, uncertainty, and resilience can best be understood as reflecting the consequences of neoliberal policies Moreover, the article further argues that there is an <b>attendant</b> <b>danger</b> that resilience thinking may further promote neoliberal forms of governmentality and encourage a degree of political passivity. The emphasis on resilience is in danger of depoliticising highly political choices, shifting attention toward ex-post policies of survival and recovery rather than challenging the current economic order and resisting the further imposition of neoliberal policies on already beleaguered populations. This article therefore argues for shifting our emphasis towards a Foucauldian analysis of power and resistance...|$|E

In this article, the author briefly reviews the major areas {{of theory and}} research in the British study of publication administration, further identifying important contributions by British scholars {{in the areas of}} modernist-empiricism, the new public management, regulation, policy networks and governance, and interpretive theory. Although there is a discernible American influence on British public administration, there is little British impact on U. S. public administration; nowadays it is a one-way street. Increasingly, British scholars are involved in a growing community of European public administration scholars with whom they share active, two-way connections. Recent European developments suggest that American and European public administration academics are growing further apart. Due to the immense strength of modernist-empiricism throughout American universities, plus the interpretive turn to a European epistemology of "blurred genres," these twin, traditionally self-referential, communities seem to be parting company with an <b>attendant</b> <b>danger</b> that future intellectual engagement may be a dead end.

We identified three vital metrics (system inventory, system expediting, and service level at the final echelon in the supply chain) as drivers of performance. Simulation experiments we ran disclosed four key findings: (1) a cost function based on these vital metrics can be quite ill-behaved, warranting the use of metaheuristics capable of looking beyond local optima, (2) genetic search over inventory system parameters yields better solution quality than unimodal search, (3) variability induced by disruptions can amplify in a supply chain, and severely affect service levels and system inventory for long periods, and (4) order expediting, often used to mitigate disruptions, can also trigger bullwhip effects, and hurt rather than help overall performance.

5000|$|Many vocal pedagogues warn of {{the dangers}} of quick identification. Premature concern with {{classification}} can result in misclassification, with all its <b>attendant</b> <b>dangers.</b> Notable vocal pedagogue William Vennard has stated, [...] "I never feel any urgency about classifying a beginning student. So many premature diagnoses have been proved wrong, and it can be harmful to the student and embarrassing to the teacher to keep striving for an ill-chosen goal. It is best to begin in the middle part of the voice and work upward and downward until the voice classifies itself."Most vocal pedagogues believe that it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the voice. When techniques of posture, breathing, phonation, resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop. Many vocal pedagogues suggest that teachers begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The {{reason for this is that}} the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to mis-classify or damage the voice.|$|R
60|$|Into this {{atmosphere}} charged with suspicion was interjected the Popish Plot, said by Titus Oates {{and his fellow}} perjurers to be designed to murder Charles II and place James on the throne. From September 1678, when Oates began his series of revelations {{until the end of}} March 1681, when the King dissolved at Oxford the third Parliament elected under the Protestant furore excited by the Plot, Shaftesbury and his followers had the upper hand. The King was obliged to propose concessions to the popular will and to offer to agree to limitations on the authority of a popish successor. But Shaftesbury was bent on passing the Exclusion Bill, which excluded James from the throne and substituted the King's illegitimate son, Monmouth. Here he made a fatal blunder because he alienated churchmen who believed in the divine right of kings, all whose sense of decency was outraged by the prospect of a bastard's elevation to the throne, and the supporters of William of Orange, husband of Mary, the elder daughter of James, and the great opponent of Louis XIV.

A total of 106 healthy volunteers completed the Oxford and Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences and Launay-Slade hallucination scale, the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire and two versions of the MCQ: the original which assesses five domains of meta-cognition and an adapted version in which items relating to worry had been replaced by items relating to thinking or reflecting on thinking (MCQ-th). ANOVA indicated highly significant differences between three groups of individuals differentiated in terms of high, medium and low proneness to hallucinations on four of the five MCQ sub-scales, and three of the four MCQ-th factors. Regression analyses indicated that the MCQ factors encompassing (1) a sense of uncontrollability of thinking (and the perceived <b>attendant</b> <b>dangers</b> of this) and (2) negative beliefs about thinking related to suspicion and punishment were the strongest predictors of high schizotypy. Individuals who score higher on a measure of HP are more likely to display patterns of meta-cognitive processing that resemble, in certain respects, those reported in individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Nigeria, {{systemic}} hypertension is the commonest noncommunicable disease, {{and public}} awareness about hypertension and its determinants is poor. This study aims {{to assess the}} knowledge and level of awareness of the disease among hypertensive patients attending the medical outpatient clinic of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OOUTH). METHODOLOGY: Hypertensive patients who attended the medical outpatient clinic during the one-year study period and gave their consent were recruited into the study. Response to a questionnaire on various aspects of hypertension was analyzed using the STATA for Windows software. RESULTS: There were 254 hypertensive patients, of which 111 were males and 143 were females, giving a male: female ratio of 1 : 1. 3. The mean age (SD) of the patients was 51 years +/- 12. 2; 52. 4 % {{of the participants were}} aware that hypertension was the commonest noncommunicable disease in Nigeria. About one in 10 patients (11. 4 %) was aware that "nil symptom" is the commonest symptom of hypertension, while 37 % were not aware that hypertension could cause renal failure. Only about one-third (35. 4 %) of the patients knew that hypertension should ideally be treated for life, while 58. 3 % believed that antihypertensive drugs should be used only when there are symptoms. The remaining 6. 3 % believed that the treatment of hypertension should be for periods ranging from two weeks to five years but not for life. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated inadequate knowledge of hypertension in patients with hypertension in our study population. Conscious efforts should be made and time set aside to health educate hypertensive patients. Organization of "hypertensive club or society" could be encouraged. These will reduce dissemination of false or inaccurate information by hypertensive patients to the public and its <b>attendant</b> <b>dangers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Waveform {{templates}} are {{a powerful}} tool for extracting and characterizing gravitational wave signals, acting as highly restrictive priors on the signal morphologies that allow us to extract weak events buried deep in the instrumental noise. The templates map the waveform shapes to physical parameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for these parameters. However, there are <b>attendant</b> <b>dangers</b> in using highly restrictive signal priors. If strong field gravity is not accurately described by General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental bias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect signals. Here we study such dangers, concentrating on three distinct possibilities. First, we show that there exist modified theories compatible with all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo network using searches based on GR templates, but which would be detected using a one parameter post-Einsteinian extension. Second, we study modified theories that produce departures from GR that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency, producing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) scheme. We show that even the simplest ppE templates are still capable of picking up these strange signals and diagnosing a departure from GR. Third, we study whether using inspiral-only ppE waveforms for signals that include merger and ringdown can lead to problems in misidentifying a GR departure. We present an easy technique that allows us to self-consistently identify the inspiral portion of the signal, and thus remove these potential biases, allowing GR tests to be performed on higher mass signals that merge within the detector band. We close by studying a parameterized waveform model that may allow us to test GR using the full inspiral-merger-ringdown signal. Comment: 13 pages, 16 figures.

The institution was unusual for the heavy commitment of its directors, Aleksandr Kots and Nadezhda Ladygina-Kots, to the use of art works for illuminating past and contemporary evolutionary theory within the displays. The discussion focuses on the Museum???s strategic, discursive use of what Nikolai Krementsov has termed ???Marxist Darwinst??? rhetoric, in contextualising and explaining the significance of the art works, in order to defend its position and access state resources for a larger building to house the collection. It will be seen that the Darwin Museum gradually aligned itself in the 1920 s- 1930 s with aspects of Marxist Darwinism that became key elements of Lysenko???s ???Michurinist biology???. This strategy opened up a gap between the scientific research and interests of the museum directorate, their connections with western scientists, and what was said to the museum visitors. Lysenko???s triumph in August 1948 necessitated dramatic changes to the museum display and very careful adherence to the current nuances of Lysenko???s version of ???Michurinist biology???. After 1955, while Kruschev???s ???Thaw??? and de-Stalinisation allowed the museum tentatively to indicate visually its (enduring) adherence to genetics rather than Michurinism, this was strategically, equivocally expressed - ultimately to the museum???s disadvantage regarding the new building. In conclusion, while the study notes that the museum clearly contributed, however unwillingly, to the entrenchment of Lysenkoism, it vividly illustrates some of the <b>attendant</b> <b>dangers</b> of transforming the complex discourses of science into simplified and demagogic ???cultural resources. ??? In particular, it underlines the deep problems underlying any suppression of public access to the complexity and relativism of real scientific discourse...|$|R
