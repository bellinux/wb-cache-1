5|$|Le Père Goriot is also {{recognized}} as a bildungsroman, wherein a naive young person matures while learning {{the ways of the}} world. Rastignac is tutored by Vautrin, Madame de Beauséant, Goriot, and others <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of Parisian society and the coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success. As an everyman, he is initially repulsed by the gruesome realities beneath society's gilded surfaces; eventually, however, he embraces them. Setting aside his original goal of mastering the law, he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing. In some ways this mirrors Balzac's own social education, reflecting the distaste he acquired for the law after studying it for three years.|$|E

25|$|Another {{criticism}} of constructivism {{is that it}} holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This being the case, {{it is impossible to}} make comparative judgements about statements made according to each worldview.

Also, it held that Republika Srpska's failure to inform the applicants <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of the fate and whereabouts of their missing relatives, including conducting a meaningful and effective investigation into the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, violated their rights to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, as guaranteed by Article 3 of the European Convention. Finally, the Chamber concluded that in failing to fulfill its obligations owed to the applicants under the European Convention, the Republika Srpska had discriminated against the applicants due to their Bosniak origin.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{concentrates}} on witchcraft to such degree that {{she goes to}} live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess. Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan still {{will be able to}} control demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere. After Mordred spots the images of Lancelot's passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle's walls while he was imprisoned there, Morgan shows them to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they do not do this. In the Vulgate La Mort le Roi Artu (The Death of King Arthur, also known as just Mort Artu), Morgan vanishes {{for a long time and}} stops troubling Arthur, who assumes her to be dead. One day, he wanders into Morgan's remote castle while on a hunting trip, and they instantly reconcile with each other. Morgan welcomes him warmly and the king is overjoyed of their reunion and allows her to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon to live there with other sorceresses. However, the sight of Lancelot's frescoes and Morgan's confession finally convinces Arthur <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> to the rumours of the two's secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Sir Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the Round Table. The goddess Fortune, who appears to Arthur to foretell his death towards the end the Vulgate Cycle, is regarded by some as a double for Morgan. At the end of Mort Artu, Morgan is the first among the black-hooded ladies who take the dying Arthur to his final rest in Avalon.|$|E

A tentacle-like entity emerges, and she backs out into a group of Winders. They take her to one of many voting booths {{set up on the}} ship. She is shown a video <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of Starship UK, and then asked if she wants to [...] "protest" [...] the truth or [...] "accept" [...] it, the latter causing her short-term memory to be wiped.

The Doctor is curious as what [...] "protest" [...] will cause and activates it, sending he and Amy into the maw of a giant creature below the ship.

Rasputin had {{released}} ardent, though completely innocent in nature, letters written by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses to him. They circulated throughout society, fueling more rumors. Pornographic cartoons circulated that depicted Rasputin having relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background. Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went {{on a pilgrimage to}} the Holy Land. Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered in 1916. [...] "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed," [...] Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916. Tatiana was rumored to have been present at Rasputin's murder on 17 December 1916, [...] "disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her". It was also rumored that Rasputin was castrated in front of Tatiana, wrote Maurice Paléologue, the French ambassador to Russia, in his memoirs. Paléologue was skeptical at the time <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of the wild rumors and attributed them to the hatred of Rasputin held by people in St. Petersburg. In his memoirs, A.A. Mordvinov reported that all four grand duchesses appeared [...] "cold and visibly terribly upset" [...] by Rasputin's death and sat [...] "huddled up closely together" [...] on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Tatiana attended Rasputin's funeral on 21 December 1916, and Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse side by Tatiana, her mother and sisters.|$|E
