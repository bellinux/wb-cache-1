25|$|The {{relationship}} between Barth, liberalism, and fundamentalism {{goes far beyond}} the issue of inerrancy, however. From Barth's perspective, liberalism, as understood {{in the sense of}} the 19th century with Friedrich Schleiermacher and Hegel as its leading exponents and not necessarily expressed in any particular political ideology, is the divinization of human thinking. This, to him, inevitably leads one or more philosophical concepts to become the false God, thus attempting to block the true voice of the living God. This, in turn, leads to the captivity of theology by human ideology. In Barth's theology, he emphasizes <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> human concepts of any kind, breadth or narrowness quite beside the point, can never be considered as identical to God's revelation. In this aspect, Scripture is also written human language, which bears witness to the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Scripture cannot be considered as identical to God's self-revelation, which is properly only Jesus Christ. However, in his freedom and love, God truly reveals himself through human language and concepts, with a view toward their necessity in reaching fallen humanity. Thus Barth claims that Christ is truly presented in Scripture and the preaching of the church, echoing a stand expressed in his native Swiss Reformed Church's Helvetic Confession of the 16th century.|$|E
500|$|Wallis's memoirs, The Heart Has Its Reasons, were {{published}} in 1956. One of her biographers, Charles Higham, said of the book, [...] "facts were remorselessly rearranged in {{what amounted to a}} self-performed face-lift... reflecting in abundance its author's politically misguided but winning and desirable personality." [...] He describes the Duchess as [...] "charismatic, electric and compulsively ambitious". The Daily Telegraph, in their obituary of Higham, said: [...] "The themes of fascism, closet homosexuality and sexual perversion that had proved so productive in the case of [...] Flynn were themes that Higham would mine <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> <b>That</b> his motives were probably financial is suggested by his admission in an interview that there was 'certainly a difference of an enormous number of sales' between his poetry books and his biographies." ...|$|E
500|$|With polls {{released}} on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt {{of being a}} warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, {{but he had been}} advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's [...] "falsifications". The president stated, [...] "I have said again and <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." [...] Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, [...] "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.|$|E
5000|$|On any {{song that}} we're writing, {{the first thing}} I think is, [...] "Where's the chorus? What's the chorus? Where's the hook?" [...] Then we've got {{something}} to build around. I'm very into the regular pop format of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus and variations thereof. To me, the chorus {{has to be the}} thing that grabs me and hooks me in - especially in death metal, because there's no vocal melody. Yeah, you've got riffs, {{but you have to have}} something to hook the listener in, to bring them back, to keep them listening <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> <b>That's</b> really the goal, to create music that I would want to listen to five years later. For me, it's all about choruses and trying to write catchy songs.|$|R
60|$|They {{quenched}} {{the flames}} {{and put out}} the fire, and, unbinding their dear sister from the stake, they kissed <b>and</b> hugged her <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> <b>And</b> now <b>that</b> {{she was able to}} open her mouth and speak, she told the King why she had been dumb and not able to laugh.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Hayatullah Khan reappeared <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> {{asserted}} <b>that</b> the Taliban's {{leadership was}} in Afghanistan, not Pakistan.He said that Pakistan was more {{dangerous for the}} Taliban's leadership than Afghanistan.He denied {{the existence of the}} Quetta Shura.|$|R
2500|$|Biographer Susan Cheever {{wrote in}} My Name Is Bill, [...] "Bill Wilson never held himself up as a model: he only hoped {{to help other}} people by sharing his own experience, {{strength}} and hope.

'Many more vile and abominable {{things were}} {{in those days}} fomented by them, by which I was driven to a more narrow search of the Scriptures, and was, through their light and testimony, not only enlightened, but greatly {{confirmed}} and comforted in the truth'; and, as I said, the guilt of sin did help me much, for still as that would come upon me, the blood of Christ did take it off <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> too, sweetly, according to the Scriptures.

6000|$|<b>Again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> was <b>that</b> command repeated, <b>and</b> {{even while}} it was being dinned into our ears so emphatically, Doctor Warren, seeming to think we Minute Boys might show the white feather, came up to us as we stood where we could peer over the breastwork, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|His mind went <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> to <b>that</b> tall {{old man in}} the ditch. What was {{the meaning}} of his scared and sorrowful glance?

60|$|But Tommy {{would not}} pass that. He {{explained}} to her <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> the doctor was dead, and perhaps she would remember, or perhaps, without remembering, {{she said she was}} glad he was dead.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stevens {{would have}} been glad had young Dick decided {{to give up his}} work on the ranch; but the latter has {{declared}} <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> he will leave mining strictly alone, because [...] "cattle are good enough for him." ...|$|E
60|$|The fellow begged <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> {{we would}} relieve {{him from his}} bonds so he might walk around, {{promising}} to be as obedient to our orders as was Horry Sims; but I knew him too well to put any trust in his words.|$|E

60|$|During {{the long}} march he had thrashed over <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> all <b>that</b> {{the success of}} his rash venture would mean to him. Of all those who might conceivably stand between him and the woman he loved--the woman who had just {{acknowledged}} that she loved him--these two men were the most to be feared.|$|R
60|$|Daniel Doyce {{was still}} {{reluctant}} to consent, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> urged <b>that</b> {{they had better}} put it by. But it was natural that he should gradually allow himself to be over-persuaded by Clennam, and should yield. Yield he did. So Arthur resumed the long and hopeless labour of striving to make way with the Circumlocution Office.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was when}} this thought recurred, <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>that</b> {{the cry of}} agony burst from him, but it was {{invariably}} succeeded by the thought, [...] "No, not for ever.

60|$|I said {{to myself}} <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> if the red-coated gentry held him in their power a prisoner, he would be treated with some fair consideration, for these {{soldiers}} of the king were not red Indians, and would not proceed to extremities at least until after the semblance of a military trial.|$|E
60|$|I said {{to myself}} <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>that</b> if General Herkimer really needed such {{services}} as we could render, {{it would have been}} better had we remained with him, rather than spend so many days and be forced to such severe labor as was required for the march to Cherry Valley and back.|$|E
50|$|For Falconetti, the {{performance}} was an ordeal. Legends {{from the set}} tell of Dreyer forcing her to kneel painfully on stone and then wipe all expression from her face—so that the viewer would read suppressed or inner pain. He filmed the same shots <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> hoping <b>that</b> in the editing room he could find exactly the right nuance in her facial expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I was not tired; at least, not exactly," [...] said Clara, {{blushing}} <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> being conscious <b>that</b> she blushed. [...] "But--but--you {{know it was}} {{the first}} ball I was ever at." ...|$|R
60|$|Released at {{last from}} durance vile {{and placed on}} board of an Erie canal-boat, {{on my way to}} Canada, I for a moment breathed the sweets of liberty.

Henry Breckinridge Folair, a consistent copperhead, captain of the canal-boat, <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> pressed <b>that</b> suit I had so often rejected.|$|R
60|$|The {{operator}} {{had been}} very eager to learn why officers should be summoned from the city; but Jet professed entire ignorance of the matter, repeating <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> he had only brought the message from a stranger a short distance up the road, and the questioner finally ceased trying to extract information.|$|E

60|$|The younger man's {{excitement}} and apprehension for White Fang was growing. He struck Cherokee about the head savagely <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> But <b>that</b> did not loosen the jaws.

6000|$|... "And {{what brings}} him to France?" [...] asked Tressan. The captain smiled <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> there came <b>again</b> <b>that</b> {{expressive}} shrug of his. [...] "A little over-ready with the steel," [...] said he.|$|R
5000|$|Hwang {{has said}} that when {{choosing}} scripts, {{he looks at the}} overall storyline rather than the character itself. He then exerts effort to continuously bring out the character's inner workings. Hwang said, [...] "It is very important that you don't get too absorbed in yourself. You must always remember that there is another person watching the scene. Maintaining objectivity is important." [...] Hwang emphasizes sincerity and empathy in his acting. [...] "The camera doesn't lie. You can never fool the viewer. You have to act with your heart, not your head." [...] It is because of this commitment to emotional truth that Hwang can confidently tell interviewers that he is 100 percent satisfied with his work. During a crisis on set, or when he is either feeling too satisfied or caught up in mannerisms, he takes out notes he made when he first read the screenplay. He said, [...] "I look at the screenplay <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> <b>That's</b> where all the answers are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘It {{has been}} {{represented}} to me <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> {{this is the}} course I ought to pursue,’ replied Miss Lillerton, ‘but pardon my feelings of delicacy, Mr. Tottle—pray excuse this embarrassment—I have peculiar ideas on such subjects, and I am quite sure that I never could summon up fortitude enough to name the day to my future husband.’ ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>that</b> {{day we were}} cursed for our knuckle talking by {{whatever}} guard was on. But we could not refrain.

60|$|Nor did Lucilla's {{attempts}} at body curing succeed better. Her rubbing only evoked screeches, and her advice was scornfully rejected.

60|$|After musing <b>and</b> meditating <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> over {{everything}} <b>that</b> had occurred, Coningsby fell asleep when the morning had far advanced, resolved to rise when a little refreshed {{and find out}} Lady Wallinger, who, he felt sure, would receive him with kindness.|$|R
