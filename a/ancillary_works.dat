2500|$|On 20 December 2006 the Port Tunnel {{which carries}} traffic {{from the port}} and onto the {{motorway}} close to the M50/M1 interchange was opened {{as the first step}} of an eastern bypass to Dublin, making the M1 junctions 1 to 3 part of the M50. Though originally intended to be a two-lane single-bore system catering specifically to HGV traffic, the Port Tunnel was built to motorway standard as two separate tunnels to cater for all traffic (although HGV traffic is not tolled). The tunnels are deeper than originally planned to reduce disturbance to residential areas, and were built one kilometre longer and with more <b>ancillary</b> <b>works</b> to facilitate this.

30|$|We {{previously}} {{observed that}} sodium lactate infusion enhanced fluid balance in pig endotoxic shock [25, 26]. This beneficial effect of sodium lactate {{could not be}} totally explained neither by its hyperosmolar or alkalizing effects [25] nor by its energy load or {{its effect on the}} chloride balance [26]. Finally, two additional mechanisms have been hypothesized: first, lactate infusion is better metabolized in poor hemodynamic conditions than glucose, and second, lactate could decrease proinflammatory response and/or improve endothelial barrier function. Interestingly, {{it is well known that}} proinflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction exacerbate the endotoxin-induced DIC [27, 28]. So, in order to better understand the beneficial effect of sodium lactate on fluid balance, we conducted an <b>ancillary</b> <b>work</b> focused on DIC and renal histology.|$|R
30|$|<b>Ancillary</b> <b>work</b> of an interventional {{randomized}} open label controlled experimental study. Fifteen female “Large White” pigs (2 months old) were challenged with intravenous {{infusion of}} E. coli endotoxin. Three groups of five animals {{were randomly assigned}} to receive different fluids: a treatment group received sodium lactate 11.2 % (SL group); an isotonic control group received 0.9 % NaCl (NC group); a hypertonic control group, with the same amount of osmoles and sodium than SL group, received sodium bicarbonate 8.4 % (SB group). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) markers, coagulation and inflammation parameters were measured over a 5 -h period. Immediately after euthanasia, kidneys were withdrawn for histological study. Statistical analysis was performed with nonparametric tests and the Dunn correction for multiple comparisons. A p <  0.05 was considered significant.|$|R

40|$|The {{well-known}} platinum(II) chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin [cis-(NH(3)) (2) PtCl(2) ] and carboplatin [Pt(NH(3)) (2) C(6) O(4) H(6) ], {{as well as}} the analogous transplatin [trans-(NH(3)) (2) PtCl(2) ], {{were studied}} by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy, coupled to quantum mechanical methods, and some <b>ancillary</b> <b>work</b> with X-ray diffraction on powders. An assignment of the experimental spectra was carried out based on the calculated INS transition frequencies and intensities (at the DFT level), thereby achieving a good correspondence between the calculated and observed data. Unusually good-quality INS spectra were obtained from about 250 mg, which is the smallest sample of a hydrogenous compound for which a successful INS interpretation has been reported. The knowledge of the local configuration of this kind of complexes is essential for an accurate understanding of their activity, which will pave the way for the rational design of novel third-generation drugs comprising cisplatin- and carboplatin-like moieties...|$|R
5000|$|The Commission {{eventually}} transferred 13.5 {{million acres}} (55,000 km²) by 1920. Following the Land Conference of December 1902 arranged by George Wyndham (a conservative minister and Chief Secretary for Ireland, but also descended from Lord Edward FitzGerald), the revolutionary Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act 1903 was orchestrated through Parliament by William OBrien, MP, which provided government finance {{to buy out}} freeholds, with the former tenant farmers paying back the capital over 68 years. This was managed by the Land Commission, along with <b>ancillary</b> <b>work</b> such as compiling statistics. Valuations were reckoned on a [...] "years purchase" [...] (Y.P.) basis, the price being a multiple of (perhaps 16 times) the annual rent, instead of the discounted cash flow method used today. The Commission had to supervise the haggling process and find the fairest multiple for every transfer. The loans issued by government were resold in the capital markets as [...] "Land Bonds".|$|R

5000|$|Connacht Rugby first {{participated in}} European Rugby's blue ribbon competition, the European Rugby Champions Cup (known before the 2014-15 {{season as the}} Heineken Cup), in season 2011-12. This spurred a new phase of {{development}} at the Sportsground to extend formal capacity to 7,500 supporters. The existing Clubhouse terrace was knocked down {{to be replaced by}} the new covered [...] "Clan Terrace". This terrace primarily houses season ticket holders. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>work</b> was also undertaken behind the terrace which saw {{the construction of a new}} bar (The Clan Bar), food outlets and restroom facilities on the Clubhouse side of the ground. A temporary covered and seated [...] "West Stand", adjacent to the existing main stand was also erected for the season. This raft of improvements came on the back of a series of development which the Irish Rugby Football Union to fund had helped in the preceding years, such as a new playing surface, a new Clubhouse and floodlighting, while a new gymnasium had been built in 2008.|$|R

40|$|In {{the core}} of this thesis I test and confirm the {{hypothesis}} that separate classes of interneurons respond differentially to sensory stimulation independent of volitional or other top-down control {{on the part of the}} animal. I also test and confirm the hypothesis that, based only on bottom-up sensory stimulation the activity of two major classes of interneurons (adapting Parvalbumin positive and facilitating Somatostatin positive interneurons) predominates during different phases of what corresponds to natural sensing cycles in a behaving rodent. These questions are addressed using an in vivo mouse model with intrinsically fluorescent, but differentiable, interneuron populations combined with 2 -photon imaging, Ca²+-sensitive dyes. Anesthesia and electrical control of facial muscles allowed for naturalistic stimulation without the confounds presented by volitional whisking and unknown top-down or behavioral states.

40|$|This report {{presents}} preliminary {{operational guidelines}} and supporting work products developed through the interagency Operational Guidelines Task Group (OGT). The report consolidates preliminary operational guidelines, all <b>ancillary</b> <b>work</b> products, and a companion software tool that facilitates their implementation into one reference source document. The report {{is intended for}} interim use and comment and provides the foundation for fostering future reviews of the operational guidelines and their implementation within emergency preparedness and response initiatives {{in the event of}} a radiological dispersal device (RDD) incident. The report principally focuses on the technical derivation and presentation of the operational guidelines. End-user guidance providing more details on how to apply these operational guidelines within planning and response settings is being considered and developed elsewhere. The preliminary operational guidelines are categorized into seven groups on the basis of their intended application within early, intermediate, and long-term recovery phases of emergency response. We anticipate that these operational guidelines will be updated and refined by interested government agencies in response to comments and lessons learned from their review, consideration, and trial application. This review, comment, and trial application process will facilitate the selection of a final set of operational guidelines that may be more or less inclusive of the preliminary operational guidelines presented in this report. These and updated versions of the operational guidelines will be made available through the OGT public Web site ([URL] as they become finalized for public distribution and comment...|$|R
