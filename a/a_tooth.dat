5|$|Dens invaginatus, {{also called}} Dens in dente, {{is a deep}} {{invagination}} in <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> causing the appearance of <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> within <b>a</b> <b>tooth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> has a 2–3mm band {{of bright}} pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva surrounding an implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5|$|Accessory cusps are {{additional}} cusps on <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> and may manifest as a Talon cusp, Cusp of Carabelli, or Dens evaginatus.|$|E

5|$|Ectopic enamel is enamel {{found in}} an unusual location, such as the root of <b>a</b> <b>tooth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prismatic enamel - The enamel coating on {{the surface}} of <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> {{consists}} of prisms, solid, rod-like structures extending from the dentin to the tooth's surface.|$|E

5000|$|Crocodilia are {{the only}} non-mammalian {{vertebrates}} with tooth sockets. [...] Alligators grow <b>a</b> successional <b>tooth</b> (<b>a</b> small replacement <b>tooth)</b> under each mature functional tooth for replacement once <b>a</b> year, each <b>tooth</b> being replaced up to 50 times in the alligator's life. Crocodilia are researched for tooth regeneration in humans.|$|R
5000|$|A fang is <b>a</b> long, pointed <b>tooth.</b> [...] In mammals, a fang is <b>a</b> canine <b>tooth,</b> {{used for}} biting and tearing flesh. In snakes, it is <b>a</b> venom-injecting <b>tooth</b> (see snake venom). Spiders also have {{external}} fangs, which {{are part of}} the chelicerae.|$|R
5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on <b>a</b> <b>tooth.</b> As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus meriani {{was a new}} {{combination}} by George Olshevsky for Megalosaurus meriani Greppin, 1870, {{based on}} <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> from the Late Jurassic of Switzerland. However, a recent overview of Ceratosaurus included it in Ceratosaurus sp.|$|E
5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5000|$|Bonding is {{a process}} in which an enamel-like dental {{composite}} material is applied to <b>a</b> <b>tooth's</b> surface, sculpted into shape, hardened and then polished.|$|R

5|$|Buffetaut (1989, 1992) {{referred}} three specimens {{from the}} Institut und Museum für Geologie und Paläontologie of the University of Göttingen in Germany to Spinosaurus: a right maxilla fragment IMGP 969-1, a jaw fragment IMGP 969-2, and <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> IMGP 969-3. These {{had been found}} in a Lower Cenomanian or Upper Albian deposit in southeastern Morocco in 1971.|$|E
5|$|I. hilli, {{coined by}} Edwin Tully Newton in 1892 for <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> {{from the early}} Cenomanian Upper Cretaceous Lower Chalk of Hertfordshire, has been {{considered}} an early hadrosaurid of some sort. However, recent work places it as indeterminate beyond Hadrosauroidea outside Hadrosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Less {{commonly}} used tests might include trans-illumination (to detect congestion of the maxillary sinus or to highlight {{a crack in}} <b>a</b> <b>tooth),</b> dyes (to help visualize a crack), a test cavity, selective anaesthesia and laser doppler flowmetry.|$|E
5000|$|Some men's {{necklaces}} (and a few women's) attach <b>an</b> animal <b>tooth</b> as the pendant portion. A {{particularly popular}} variant is a leather string necklace with <b>a</b> shark <b>tooth</b> attached.|$|R

50|$|A {{bridge is}} a fixed dental {{restoration}} (a fixed dental prosthesis) used to replace <b>a</b> missing <b>tooth</b> (or several <b>teeth)</b> by joining <b>an</b> artificial <b>tooth</b> permanently to adjacent teeth or dental implants.|$|R
5|$|Most broaches {{are made}} from high speed steel (HSS) or an alloy steel; TiN {{coatings}} are common on HSS to prolong life. Except when broaching cast iron, tungsten carbide is rarely used as <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> material because the cutting edge will crack on the first pass.|$|E
5|$|Reversible/irreversible pulpitis is a {{distinct}} concept from whether the tooth is restorable or unrestorable, e.g. <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> may only have reversible pulpitis, but has been structurally weakened by decay or trauma {{to the point that}} it is impossible to restore the tooth in the long term.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Dromaeosauroides, evidence of more dinosaurs has been found on Bornholm. In 2002, <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> thought {{to belong to a}} juvenile titanosaurian sauropod was found in the Jydegaard Formation. Footprints of a sauropod and a thyreophoran were reported from the Middle Jurassic Bagå Formation in 2005. Small dromaeosaur and indeterminate maniraptoran teeth from the Early Cretaceous Rabekke Formation were reported in 2008, and sauropod tracks were also reported from the formation that year. In 2011, footprints of a sauropod, a thyreophoran and a theropod were reported from the Bagå Formation. Lower Jurassic tracks reported form the Rønne Formation on Bornholm in 2014 are the earliest evidence of dinosaur activity in Denmark. <b>A</b> <b>tooth</b> from the multituberculate Sunnyodon was found in the Rabekke Formation in 2004, making it the first known Danish and Scandinavian Mesozoic mammal.|$|E

5000|$|Teeth from Heptranchias howelli {{have been}} found in Europe. An antero-lateral <b>tooth</b> and <b>an</b> upper lateral <b>tooth</b> were found in Faxe, Denmark in 2014 [...] In addition, two {{incomplete}} antero-lateral <b>teeth</b> and <b>an</b> upper anterior <b>tooth</b> are kept in a private collection. A 2015 study in [...] yielded <b>a</b> complete lower <b>tooth,</b> 17 incomplete lower <b>teeth,</b> and <b>an</b> unidentified broken <b>tooth.</b>|$|R
5|$|Wear facets {{are areas}} of <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> that show {{evidence}} {{of contact with}} <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as occlusion). Flynn and colleagues identified two wear facets at {{the front and back}} margins of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear facets suggest the presence of a protocone (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars. In a 2005 paper on Asfaltomylos, a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear facets within the talonid basin in Ambondro and instead identified wear facets on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on the rims, not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone.|$|E
5|$|When Galton {{revisited}} Thescelosaurus and Bugenasaura in 1999, {{he described}} the dentary tooth UCMP46911 from the Upper Jurassic of Weymouth, England as cf. Bugenasaura. If it is indeed <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> from a thescelosaur-like animal, this would significantly extend the stratigraphic range of the group.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from hockey Phillps ran his own lumber company and later moved to Toronto in 1920. After having <b>a</b> <b>tooth</b> pulled in 1923, {{he died of}} blood poisoning {{at the age of}} 40. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was founded in 1945, Phillips was inducted as part of the first class of inductees. He was also inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.|$|E
