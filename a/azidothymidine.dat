J., Furman, P. A., St. Clair, M. H., Nusinoff-Lehrman, S., Gallo, R. C., Bolognesi, D., Barry, D. W. & Broder, S. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 7096 - 7100]. In contrast, inhibition {{of the growth of}} uninfected human fibroblasts and lymphocytes has been observed only at concentrations above 1 mM. The nature of this selectivity was investigated. <b>Azidothymidine</b> anabolism to the 5 '-mono-, di-, and -triphosphate derivatives was similar in uninfected and HIV-infected cells. The level of <b>azidothymidine</b> monophosphate was high, whereas the levels of the di- and triphosphate were low ({{less than or equal to}} 5 microM and less than or equal to 2 microM, respectively). Cytosolic thymidine kinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 21) was responsible for phosphorylation of <b>azidothymidine</b> to its monophosphate. Purified thymidine kinase catalyzed the phosphorylations of thymidine and <b>azidothymidine</b> with apparent Km values of 2. 9 microM and 3. 0 microM. The maximal rate of phosphorylation with <b>azidothymidine</b> was equal to 60 % of the rate with thymidine. Phosphorylation of <b>azidothymidine</b> monophosphate to the diphosphate also appeared to be catalyzed by a host-cell enzyme, thymidylate kinase (EC 2. 7. 4. 9). The apparent Km value for <b>azidothymidine</b> monophosphate was 2 -fold greater than the value for dTMP (8. 6 microM vs. 4. 1 microM), but the maximal phosphorylation rate was only 0. 3 % of the dTMP rate.

To address this possibility, mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase [deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed), EC 2. 7. 7. 49] gene have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned constructs in Escherichia coli.
