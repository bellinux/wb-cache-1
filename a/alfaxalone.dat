2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in animals for major surgery. Animals are often premedicated intravenously or intramuscularly with a sedative, analgesic, and anticholinergic agent (dogs frequently receive buprenorphine, acepromazine, and glycopyrrolate). The next step is induction, usually with an intravenous drug. [...] Dogs and cats commonly receive thiopental (no longer allowed in the UK), ketamine with diazepam, tiletamine with zolazepam (usually just in cats), and/or propofol. <b>Alfaxalone</b> is a steroid anaesthetic used in many practices in the UK to induce anaesthesia in cats and sometimes dogs. It is similar in physiological effect but different in composition to the now withdrawn Saffan. [...] Horses commonly receive thiopental and guaifenesin. [...] Following induction, the animal is intubated with an endotracheal tube and maintained on a gas anesthetic. [...] The most common gas anesthetics in use in veterinary medicine are isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane, although desflurane and sevoflurane are becoming more popular due to rapid induction and recovery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> {{can be used}} as a {{sedative}} {{when given}} intramuscularly (IM), though this requires a larger volume (and not all countries allow <b>alfaxalone</b> to be administered IM).|$|E
5000|$|Currently, a {{human form}} of <b>alfaxalone</b> is in {{development}} {{under the name}} [...] "Phaxan": <b>alfaxalone</b> will be dissolved in 7-sulfo-butyl-ether-β-cyclodextrin, which, unlike the cyclodextrin used in Alfaxan, is not toxic to people.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> has {{relatively}} few side effects {{compared to other}} anesthetics; most notable is its lack of cardiovascular depression at clinical doses, which makes it unique among anesthetics. The most common side effect is respiratory depression: in addition to apnea, the most prevalent, <b>alfaxalone</b> can also decrease the respiratory rate, minute volume, and oxygen saturation in the blood in cats and dogs. <b>Alfaxalone</b> should be administered slowly {{over a period of}} at least 60 seconds or until anesthesia is induced; as quick administration increases the risk of apnea. <b>Alfaxalone</b> has some depressive effects on the central nervous system, including a reduction in cerebral flood flow and intracranial pressure, as well as in body temperature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> {{has been}} used to perform c-sections in {{pregnant}} cats; though it crosses the placental barrier and had some effects on the kittens, there is no respiratory depression and no lasting effect. <b>Alfaxalone</b> has also been found to be safe in young puppies and kittens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> is metabolized {{quickly and}} does not {{accumulate}} in the body; its use as an induction agent thus doesn't increase {{the time needed to}} recover from anesthesia. If it administered more slowly by diluting it in sterile water, less actual <b>alfaxalone</b> is needed. It binds to 30-50% of plasma proteins, and has a terminal half-life of 25 minutes in dogs and 45 minutes in cats when given at clinical doses (2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg respectively). The pharmacokinetics of <b>alfaxalone</b> are nonlinear in cats and dogs.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{preservatives}} in <b>alfaxalone</b> vials {{gives them}} an extremely short shelf-life once the seal has been broken, as microbes can grow inside the vial. Official instructions in the U.K. are to take up enough <b>alfaxalone</b> into a syringe as needed and to discard the rest immediately. In the United States, a vial of <b>alfaxalone</b> can be kept up to six hours after its first use. In New Zealand and Australia, a used vial can be kept in a fridge for up to seven days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> was marketed in 1971 in {{combination}} with alfadolone acetate under the brand name Althesin for human use and Saffan for veterinary use. Althesin was withdrawn from the market in 1984, whereas Saffan remained marketed. A new formulation containing <b>alfaxalone</b> only was introduced for veterinary use in 1999 under the brand name Alfaxan. Following the introduction of Alfaxan, Saffan was gradually discontinued and is now no longer marketed. Another new formulation containing <b>alfaxalone</b> alone is currently under development for use in humans with the tentative brand name Phaxan.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>alfaxalone</b> {{metabolism}} {{takes place}} in the liver, though some {{takes place in}} the lungs and kidneys as well. In the liver, it undergoes both phase I (cytochrome P450-dependent) and phase II (conjugation-dependent) metabolism. The phase I metabolites products are the same in cats and dogs: allopregnatrione, 3β-alfaxalone, 20-hydroxy-3β-alfaxalone, 2-hydroxyalfaxalone, and 2α-hydroxyalfaxalone. In dogs, the phase II metabolites are <b>alfaxalone</b> glucuronide (the major metabolite), 20-hydroxyalfaxalone sulfate, and 2α-hydroxyalfaxalone glucuronid. In cats, there is a greater production of 20-hydroxyalfaxalone sulfate than <b>alfaxalone</b> glucuronide; cats also have 3β-alfaxalone-sulfate, which is not present in dogs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> is {{dissolved}} in 2-hydroxylpropyl-β cyclodextrin (which is toxic to people); the cyclodextrin is a large, starch-derived molecule with a hydrophobic core where <b>alfaxalone</b> stays, allowing {{the mixture to}} be dissolved in water and sold as an aqueous solution. They act as one unit, and only dissociate once in vivo.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{use as an}} anesthetic, <b>alfaxalone</b> {{itself has}} no {{analgesic}} properties.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> {{is used as}} an {{induction}} agent, an injectable anesthetic, and as a sedative in animals. While its {{commonly used}} in cats and dogs, {{it has also been}} successfully used in rabbits, horses, sheep, pigs, and exotics such as red-eared turtles, axolotl, green iguanas, marmosets, and koi fish. As an induction agent, <b>alfaxalone</b> causes the animal to relax enough to be intubated, allowing inhalational anesthesia to be administered. Premedication (administering sedative drugs prior this event) increases the potency of <b>alfaxalone</b> as an induction agent. It can be used instead of gas anesthetics in surgeries that are under 30 minutes, where it is being given at a constant rate via IV (constant rate infusion); this is especially useful in procedures such as bronchoscopies or repairing tracheal tears, as there is no endotracheal tube in the way. Once the administration of <b>alfaxalone</b> stops, the animal quickly recovers from anesthesia.|$|E
50|$|When no premedications are used, <b>alfaxalone</b> causes animals (especially cats) to be {{agitated}} when recovering. Dogs {{and cats}} will paddle in the air, vocalize excessively, may remain rigid or twitch, and have exaggerated reactions to external stimuli such as light and noise. For this reason, {{it is recommended}} that animals recovering from anesthesia by <b>alfaxalone</b> stay in a quiet, dark area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> {{is mostly}} {{excreted}} in the urine, though some is excreted in the bile as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> {{has been}} noted {{to be a good}} {{anesthetic}} agent for dogs with ventricular arrhythmias and for sighthounds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> is a neuroactive steroid {{derived from}} progesterone, {{though it has}} no {{glucocorticoid}} or mineralocorticoid action. Instead, it works by acting on GABAA receptors. It binds to the M3/M4 domains of the α subunit and allosterically modifies the receptor to facilitate the movement of chloride ions into the cell, resulting in hyperpolarization of the post-synaptic nerve (which inhibits actions potentials). At concentrations over 1 micromolar, <b>alfaxalone</b> binds to a site at the interface between the α and β subunits (near the actual GABA binding site) and acts as a GABA agonist, similar to benzodiazepines. <b>Alfaxalone,</b> however, does not share the benzodiazepine binding site, and actually prefers different GABAA receptors than benzodiazepenes do. It works best on the α1-β2-γ2-L isoform. Research suggests that neuroactive steroids increase the expression of GABAA receptors, {{making it more difficult}} to build tolerance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> is the , , , and [...] of alfaxolone. Alphaxalone was {{the former}} [...] of the drug, {{but this was}} {{eventually}} changed. Alphaxolone and alfaxolone are additional alternative spellings.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, a {{lyophilized}} form of <b>alfaxalone</b> {{was released}} for cats. The new drug, Alfaxan, used a cyclodextrin as a carrier agent to make <b>alfaxalone</b> more water soluble rather than Camphor EL. Alfadolone {{was not included}} in the mixture, as its hypnotic effects were quite weak. An aqueous form of Alfaxan was released in Australia in 2000-2001, and Saffan was finally removed from the market in 2002. Alfaxan was released in the UK in 2007, central Europe in 2008, Canada in 2011, and the United States in 2012.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone,</b> {{also known}} as 11-oxo-3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione, or 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone (pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione). It is specifically a modification of progesterone in which the C3 ketone {{has been reduced to}} a hydroxyl group, the double bond between the C4 and C5 positions has been reduced and is now a single bond, and a ketone has been substituted at the C11 position. <b>Alfaxalone</b> is also a derivative of allopregnanolone (5α-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one), differing from it only by the addition of the C11 ketone. Other closely related steroids include ganaxolone (3β-methyl-5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one), hydroxydione (21-hydroxy-5β-pregnane-3,20-dione), minaxolone (11α-(dimethylamino)-2β-ethoxy-5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one), pregnanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one), and renanolone (5β-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione).|$|E
50|$|In 1971, a {{combination}} of <b>alfaxalone</b> and alfadolone acetate was released as the anesthetics Althesin (for human use) and Saffan (for veterinary use). The two were dissolved in Cremophor EL: a polyoxyelthylated castor oil surfactant.|$|E
50|$|Alfaxolone/alfadolone (brand names Althesin (human), Saffan (veterinary) {{is a short}} acting {{intravenous}} anaesthetic agent. It {{was withdrawn}} from the market due to severe drug reactions. It is composed of a 3:1 mixture of <b>alfaxalone</b> and alfadolone, two neurosteroids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> is marketed for {{veterinary}} use {{under the}} brand name Alfaxan {{in a number of}} countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E
50|$|In 1941, {{progesterone}} and 5β-pregnanedione {{were discovered}} to have CNS depressant effects in rodents. This began a search {{to make a}} synthetic steroid {{that could be used}} as an anesthetic. Most of these efforts were aimed at making <b>alfaxalone</b> more water-soluble.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>alfaxalone</b> is not {{licensed}} for IM or {{subcutaneous use}} in the United States (as both cause longer recoveries with greater agitation and hypersensitivity to stimuli), it is routinely used IM in cats, and is licensed as such in other countries.|$|E
50|$|The quick {{metabolism}} and elimination of <b>alfaxalone</b> {{from the body}} decreases the chance of overdose. It would takes over 28 times the normal dose to cause toxicity in cats. Such doses, however, can cause low blood pressure, apnea, hypoxia, arrhythmia (caused by the apnea and hypoxia), death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone</b> {{works as}} a {{positive}} allosteric modulator on GABAA receptors and, at high concentrations, as a direct agonist of the GABAA receptor. It is cleared quickly by the liver, giving it a relatively short terminal half-life and preventing it from accumulating in the body, lowering the chance of overdose.|$|E
50|$|Alfaxolone/alfadolone is short-duration, {{intravenous}} anaesthetic {{made from}} a combination of two steroidal compounds, <b>alfaxalone</b> and alfadolone of which the former is the primary anasethetic agent. Alfadolone acts to increase the solubility of the mixture in which it is dissolved, a polyethylated castor oil adjuvant. Anaesthetic efficacy is achieved by allosteric potentiation of the GABAA chloride channel to produce 'fast' synaptic inhibition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alfaxalone,</b> {{also known}} as alphaxalone or alphaxolone, is a neuroactive steroid and general anesthetic. It is used in {{veterinary}} practice under the trade name Alfaxan as an induction agent for anesthesia and as an injectable anesthetic. Though it is more expensive than other induction agents, it often preferred {{due to the lack}} of depressive effects on the cardiovascular system. The most common side effect is respiratory depression; when premedications aren't given, patients also become agitated and hypersensitive when waking up.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the induction doses, then minimum infusion rates of <b>alfaxalone</b> for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), and subsequent, cardiopulmonary effects, recovery characteristics and <b>alfaxalone</b> plasma concentrations in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy after premedication with butorphanol-acepromazine or butorphanol-medetomidine. Study design: Prospective randomized blinded clinical study. Animals: Twenty-eight healthy cats. Methods: Cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy were assigned into two groups: together with butorphanol [0. 2 mg kg− 1 intramuscularly (IM) ], group AA (n = 14) received acepromazine (0. 1 mg kg− 1 IM) and group MA (n = 14) medetomidine (20 μg kg− 1 IM). Anaesthesia was induced with <b>alfaxalone</b> to effect [0. 2 mg kg− 1 intravenously (IV) every 20 seconds], initially maintained with 8 mg kg− 1 hour− 1 <b>alfaxalone</b> IV and infusion adjusted (± 0. 5 mg kg− 1 hour− 1) {{every five minutes}} according to alterations in heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (fR), Doppler blood pressure (DBP) and presence of palpebral reflex. Additional <b>alfaxalone</b> boli were administered IV if cats moved/swallowed (0. 5 mg kg− 1) or if fR > 40 breaths minute− 1 (0. 25 mg kg− 1). Venous blood samples were obtained to determine plasma <b>alfaxalone</b> concentrations. Meloxicam (0. 2 mg kg− 1 IV) was administered postoperatively. Data were analysed using linear mixed models, Chi-squared, Fishers exact and t-tests. Results: <b>Alfaxalone</b> anaesthesia induction dose (mean ± SD), was lower in group MA (1. 87 ± 0. 5; group AA: 2. 57 ± 0. 41 mg kg− 1). No cats became apnoeic.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 <b>Alfaxalone</b> (3 a-hydroxy- 5 a-pregnane- 11, 20 -dione) is a neuroactive steroid {{that can}} induce anesthesia. It has {{recently}} been reformulated and solubilized in 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HCPD). Propofol and the combination of ketamine and diazepam are commonly used induction drugs in all species. The objective of this prospective randomized and crossover design study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of induction with this new formulation of intravenous <b>alfaxalone</b> in alpacas and to compare these effects to those of propofol and the combination of ketamine/diazepam. Five healthy alpacas (96. 7 ± 19. 9 kg, 9. 6 ± 3. 1 years old) were anesthetized on three different occasions with propofol, ketamine/diazepam or <b>alfaxalone</b> by titrated intravenous injection. Quality of induction and intubation was assessed using a simple descriptive scale and quality of recovery was scored: 1 (very poor) - 5 (excellent). The auricular artery was catheterized to measure systolic (SAP), mean (MAP), and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressures and for collection of arterial blood to obtain blood gases and electrolytes. Electrocardiography, pulse oximetry (SpO₂), respiratory rate, and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (P[subscript E]´CO₂) were also monitored.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{adequacy}} of oxygen delivery {{and severity of}} shock during maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane or <b>alfaxalone</b> infusion in greyhounds experiencing blood loss. Study design: Prospective, randomised study. Animals: Twenty-four greyhounds (ASA I). Methods: All greyhounds were premedicated with methadone (0. 2 mg kg- 1) intramuscularly. Anaesthesia was induced with <b>alfaxalone</b> 2. 5 mg kg- 1 intravenously. Following endotracheal intubation, the dogs were connected to an anaesthetic circle circuit delivering oxygen. Dogs were allocated to receive inhaled isoflurane or an intravenous infusion of <b>alfaxalone</b> for maintenance of anaesthesia. Isoflurane was initially administered to achieve an end-tidal concentration of 1. 4 % and <b>alfaxalone</b> was initially administered at 0. 13 mg kg- 1 minute- 1. The dose of isoflurane or <b>alfaxalone</b> was adjusted during instrumentation to produce a clinically equivalent depth of anaesthesia. All dogs were mechanically ventilated to normocapnia (PaCO 2 35 - 40 mmHg; 4. 67 - 5. 33 kPa). Passive warming maintained core body temperature between 37 and 38 °C. Measured and calculated indices of cardiovascular function, including mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), oxygen delivery index (ḊO 2 I), oxygen consumption index (V̇O 2 I) and oxygen extraction ratio (OER), were determined at baseline (60 minutes after start of anaesthesia) and after removal of 32 mL kg- 1 and 48 mL kg- 1 of blood. Results: In all dogs, blood loss resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} MAP, CI, ḊO 2, and a significant increase in SVRI, V̇O 2 I, and OER. The changes in each of the indices did not differ significantly between dogs receiving isoflurane and dogs receiving <b>alfaxalone.</b> Conclusion and clinical relevance: No difference in oxygen delivery or severity of shock was observed when either inhaled isoflurane or intravenous <b>alfaxalone</b> infusion was used for maintenance of anaesthesia in greyhounds experiencing blood loss. There appears to be no clinical advantage to choosing one anaesthetic agent for maintenance of anaesthesia over the other in a dog experiencing blood loss...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the neurosteroidal anaesthetic, <b>alfaxalone,</b> in horses after a single intravenous (IV) injection of <b>alfaxalone,</b> following premedication with acepromazine, xylazine and guaiphenesin. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Ten (five male and five female), adult, healthy, Standardbred horses. Methods Horses were premedicated with acepromazine (0. 03 mgkg IV). Twenty minutes later they received xylazine (1 mgkg IV), then after 5 minutes, guaiphenesin (35 mgkg IV) followed immediately by IV induction of anaesthesia with <b>alfaxalone</b> (1 mgkg). Cardiorespiratory variables (pulse rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry) and clinical signs of anaesthetic depth were evaluated throughout anaesthesia. Venous blood {{samples were collected}} at strategic time points and plasma concentrations of <b>alfaxalone</b> were assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and analysed by noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The quality of anaesthetic induction and recovery was scored {{on a scale of}} 1 - 5 (1 very poor, 5 excellent). Results The median (range) induction and recovery scores were 4 (3 - 5) (good: horse slowly and moderately gently attained recumbency with minimal or no rigidity or paddling) and 4 (1 - 5) (good: horse stood on first attempt with some knuckling and ataxia) respectively. The monitored cardiopulmonary variables were within the range expected for clinical equine anaesthesia. The mean±SD durations of anaesthesia from induction to sternal recumbency and from induction to standing were 42. 7 ± 8. 4 and 47 ± 9. 6 minutes, respectively.

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{the study}} was to evaluate, in a controlled, randomised, masked {{clinical}} trial, the influence of administration rate of <b>alfaxalone</b> at induction on its relative potency in cats and to report the incidence of cardiorespiratory adverse effects. Methods Twelve healthy female domestic cats admitted for ovariohysterectomy were premedicated with buprenorphine 20 µg/kg intramuscularly and <b>alfaxalone</b> 3. 0 mg/kg subcutaneously. Sedation scores were established (using a published scale ranging from 1 [no sedation] to 5 [profound sedation]) prior to anaesthesia induction with <b>alfaxalone</b> intravenously at 2 mg/kg/min (group A 2; n = 6) or 0. 5 mg/kg/min (group A 0. 5; n = 6) to effect until orotracheal intubation was achieved. Sedation scores and <b>alfaxalone</b> induction doses were compared between the groups, using a Mann-Whitney exact test. Results are reported as median and range. Presence of apnoea (no breathing for more than 30 s) or hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure < 60 mmHg) within 5 mins postintubation was also reported. Results Although sedation scores (1. 5 [range 1. 0 - 3. 0] and 2. 5 [range 1. 0 - 3. 0] for A 2 and A 0. 5, respectively) were not significantly different (P = 0. 32), cats in group A 2 required significantly more <b>alfaxalone</b> (4. 3 mg/kg [range 3. 4 - 7. 0 mg/kg]) than group A 0. 5 (2. 1 mg/kg [range 1. 5 - 2. 5 mg/kg]) (P = 0. 002). Two cats in each group presented postinduction apnoea, and two cats in group A 2 and three cats in group A 0. 5 presented postinduction hypotension.
