5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|Where {{medicinal}} plants are harvested {{from the wild}} rather than cultivated, {{they are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could be addressed by cultivation of some {{medicinal plants}}, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of}} the world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Sinclair {{licensed}} the Spectrum {{design to}} Timex Corporation in the United States. An enhanced version with better sound, graphics and other modifications was marketed in the USA by Timex as the Timex Sinclair 2068. Timex's derivatives were largely incompatible with Sinclair systems. Some of the Timex innovations were later adopted by Sinclair Research. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> was the abortive Pandora portable Spectrum, whose ULA had the high resolution video mode pioneered in the TS2068. Pandora had a flat-screen monitor and Microdrives and {{was intended to}} be Sinclair's business portable. After Amstrad bought the computer business of Sinclair Research, Sir Clive retained the rights to the Pandora project, and it evolved into the Cambridge Computer Z88, launched in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Capcom {{discovered}} a few business principles through {{their experience with}} development and release of the five. The first was to focus on multi-platform releases. Second, Capcom needed to streamline development. Prior to the five, the company had announced expected losses of US$103 million for fiscal year 2002, largely due to poor sales and extended development times, and ultimately posted over US$163 million in losses. Resident Evil 4 was <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point,</b> beginning development in 1999 and going through four discarded versions {{by the time of}} its 2005 release. The third lesson was to focus on old franchises rather than create new ones; Resident Evil 4 was the only unmitigated commercial success of the five and also the only game based on an existing property. To wit, Viewtiful Joe 2 started development shortly after the release of Viewtiful Joe and was completed just a year later. However, the brisk schedule meant that the team was not given time to implement all the features they had wanted, including a cooperative gameplay mode. Viewtiful Joe 2 debuted on both GameCube and PlayStation 2 to reach a wider audience and maximize profitability.|$|E

25|$|Blackface {{performances}} are not unusual within the Latino community. A minstrel tradition exists {{throughout most of}} Latin America and Spain, and it has traveled to the United States. As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational blackgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is the representation of Latino and its popular embodiment as a stereotypical Dominican man.|$|E

Flypapers also show a simple evolutionary gradient from sticky, non-carnivorous leaves, through passive flypapers to active forms. Molecular data show the Dionaea–Aldrovanda clade is closely related to Drosera, and evolved from active flypaper traps into snap traps.|$|E

Most {{of the immigrants}} were attracted to North Hastings by free land grants beginning in 1856. Three Irish settlements were established in North Hastings: Umfraville, Doyle's Corner, and O'Brien Settlement. The Irish were primarily Roman Catholic. Crop failures in 1867 halted the road program near the Irish settlements, and departing settlers afterward outnumbered new arrivals. By 1870, only the successful settlers, {{most of whom were}} farmers who raised grazing animals, remained.|$|E

His work deals with everyday issues encompassing a wide range of themes from urbanization and popular culture to faith and tradition. He often employs video installations and still photography. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is his series of composite photomontages in which each main image is constructed out of countless smaller photos of diametrically opposite subjects.

25|$|The Brackenburn near Kilmaurs {{has been}} misnamed as the Garrier by the Ordnance Survey since the 1860s. When burns or rivers join {{it is usually}} the largest that decides the name of the river downstream, unless the name changes completely, such as the Kilmarnock Water forming from the Fenwick and Craufurdland Waters. Occasionally a water course is reduced in volume due to changes upstream, <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> being the Garrier, which used to drain Buiston Loch near Kilmaurs. This was drained as part of {{agricultural}} improvements and now the Garrier is only seasonal, even though it keeps the name Garrier, even when joined by the Brackenburn and the Lochrig burns that flow all year.|$|E

The camera was allowed to roll, capturing {{the faces of the}} people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. Ten was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a digital micro-cinema is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.|$|E

Phillip II and III of Portugal used forts built from the destroyed temples, including Fort Fredrick in Trincomalee, and others in southern Ceylon such as Colombo and Galle Fort, to fight sea battles with the Dutch, Danish, French, and English. This {{was the beginning of the}} island's loss of sovereignty. Later the Dutch and English succeeded the Portuguese as colonial rulers of the island.|$|E
25|$|A reconstructed martial art {{necessarily}} {{rests on}} historical records, either combat manuals or pictorial representations. Martial arts reconstruction specifically does not claim an unbroken tradition of some historical martial arts. On the contrary, the {{premise is that}} in an unbroken tradition, styles significantly evolve over time. It is not necessary for the tradition to have been interrupted in order to reconstruct an earlier style; <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is classical fencing which reconstructs the sport fencing of the 19th century before it evolved into current Olympic fencing, or historical German ringen which over time developed into contemporary styles of folk wrestling. Claims of ancient martial arts which survive unchanged by unbroken tradition (e.g. as suggested by Yehoshua Sofer), do not fall under reconstruction and are by their nature unverifiable, even to the person making the claim.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, English-speaking {{fans have}} sought {{clues to the}} story's mysteries by {{examining}} the way {{certain parts of the}} books have been translated in foreign editions. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is the identity of a character mentioned by initials only in the book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The English initials R.A.B. could have belonged to several minor characters from the books, but variations on the initials in other languages gave evidence to the true identity of the mystery character: in the Dutch edition of the book R.A.B. was translated into R.A.Z., 'zwart' being Dutch for 'black'; in the Norwegian edition, R.A.B. translates to 'R.A.S.', svart being Norwegian for 'black'; and in the Finnish edition the initials were R.A.M., 'musta' being Finnish for 'black'. Fans took this to mean that the character was Regulus Black, the brother of Sirius Black; when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was published, this was revealed to be the case.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} {{it was said that}} {{appearing}} as a Bond girl would damage an actress's career. Lois Chiles is often cited as <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point,</b> even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of Holly Goodhead, but rather because, after she lost her younger brother to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in Casino Royale (2006) was hindered by potential actresses' concerns about the effect that playing the role might have on their careers. At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress Eva Green agreed {{to play the role of}} Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won BAFTA's Rising Star Award for her performance. Rosamund Pike, who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in Die Another Day (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for Gone Girl.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
