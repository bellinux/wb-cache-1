5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions <b>attenuate</b> the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} attenuating the Sabin 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.|$|E
40|$|Three infectious, <b>attenuated</b> {{molecular}} clones of simian {{immunodeficiency virus}} (SIVmac) were tested for viral and host determinants of protective immunity. The viruses differed in degree of virulence from highly <b>attenuated</b> to moderately <b>attenuated</b> to partially <b>attenuated.</b> Levels of immune stimulation and antiviral immunity were measured in rhesus macaques inoculated 2 years previously with these viruses. Monkeys {{infected with the}} highly <b>attenuated</b> or moderately <b>attenuated</b> viruses had minimal lymphoid hyperplasia, normal CD 4 /CD 8 ratios, low levels of SIV-specific antibodies, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity against p 55 gag (Gag) or gp 160 env (Env). Monkeys infected with the partially <b>attenuated</b> virus had moderate to marked lymphoid hyperplasia, normal CD 4 /CD 8 ratios, high levels of SIV-specific antibodies, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity against both Gag and Env. After pathogenic virus challenge, monkeys immunized with the partially <b>attenuated</b> virus had 100 - to 1, 000 -fold-lower viral load in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and lymph node mononuclear cells than naive control animals. One of four monkeys immunized with the highly <b>attenuated</b> virus and two of four monkeys immunized with the moderately <b>attenuated</b> virus developed similarly low viral loads after challenge. These three <b>attenuated</b> strains of SIV induced a spectrum of antiviral immunity that was inversely associated with their degree of attenuation.

40|$|The {{adenovirus}} 72 -kilodalton DNA-binding protein (DBP) binds to the <b>attenuated</b> RNA {{derived from}} the viral major late promoter. Protection from T 1 RNase digestion can be observed when DBP is incubated with <b>attenuated</b> RNA. By using <b>attenuated</b> RNA labeled at one end, the T 1 RNase digestion pattern can be mapped to residues located at specific sites in this RNA. Heterologous competitor RNAs do not alter the pattern of DBP protection of a labeled <b>attenuated</b> RNA, as does the identical <b>attenuated</b> RNA. These data indicate some specificity {{of the interaction between}} DBP and <b>attenuated</b> RNA. Adenovirus infection of monkey cells results in a more efficient attenuation of RNA initiated at the major late promoter and a reduced level of infectious virus. Adenovirus mutations in DBP relieve this restriction. These DBP mutant proteins do not change their binding properties to the <b>attenuated</b> RNA but suggest a mechanism by which DBP plays a role in the adenovirus host range restriction in monkey cells...|$|R

The set of subspaces {{of a given}} {{dimension}} in an <b>attenuated</b> space has a structure of a symmetric association scheme and this association scheme is called an association scheme based on an <b>attenuated</b> space.

50|$|Vaccines {{created through}} reverse {{genetics}} methods {{are known as}} <b>attenuated</b> vaccines, named because they contain weakened (<b>attenuated)</b> live viruses. <b>Attenuated</b> vaccines are created by combining genes from a novel or current virus strain with previously <b>attenuated</b> viruses of the same species. <b>Attenuated</b> viruses are created by propagating a live virus under novel conditions, such as a chicken’s egg. This produces a viral strain that is still live, but not pathogenic to humans, as these viruses are rendered defective in that they cannot replicate their genome enough to propagate and sufficiently infect a host. However, the viral genes are still expressed in the host's cell through a single replication cycle, allowing {{for the development of}} an immunity.|$|R

Based on findings in CAD with psychosis, we hypothesized that an older age at presentation of <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome would be associated with less severe symptoms and better psychosocial functioning than presentation in childhood or younger adolescence. Ninety-four CAD (age 9 - 18) meeting <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome criteria participated in the study. The sample was divided and compared according to the age of presentation of <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome (9 - 14 vs 15 - 18 years). The predictive value of age of <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome presentation was investigated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) -curve calculations. The two <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome groups were homogeneous in terms of gender distribution, IQ scores and comorbid diagnoses. Older <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome patients showed better functioning and lower depressive scores. ROC curves revealed that severity of functional impairment was best predicted using an age of presentation cut-off of 14. 9 years for social functioning and 15. 9 years for role functioning. This study partially confirmed our hypothesis; older age at presentation of <b>Attenuated</b> Psychosis Syndrome was associated with less functional impairment, but age was not associated with psychotic symptoms...|$|R

In addition, when inhibitor isolated from virulent cells was administered to mice challenged with <b>attenuated</b> cells, the latter cells became virulent in vivo. When <b>attenuated</b> and virulent cells were administered simultaneously in the same host, the <b>attenuated</b> cells were able to develop into progressively growing tumors.
