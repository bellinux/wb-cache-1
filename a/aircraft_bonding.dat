40|$|For {{more than}} six decades, chromic acid {{anodizing}} (CAA) has been the central process in the surface pre-treatment of aluminum for adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>aircraft</b> structures. Unfortunately, this electrolyte contains hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), a compound known for its toxicity and carcinogenic properties.

40|$|Adhesives are {{increasingly}} being employed as alternatives to mechanical fasteners in aerospace and other engineering applications. While structural adhesives are commonly employed on <b>aircraft,</b> electrical <b>bonding</b> continues to be achieved with rivets as the existing electrically conductive adhesives suffer from low strength due to the high loading (typically 25 - 30 vol. %) of conductive filler particles. Carbon nanotubes {{are one of the}} more attractive candidates for development of multifunctional adhesives for both structural and conductive bonding because of their high conductivity and high aspect ratio. The latter enables creation of conductive pathways at much lower loading (< 1 vol. %) and, therefore, conductivity can be achieved without degrading mechanical performance. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) offer the highest intrinsic conductivity and aspect ratio as well as the lowest percolation threshold, which is associated with higher conductivity at a fixed loading. In this work, SWCNTs were incorporated at low loading (0. 5 - 3 wt%) into an unfilled aerospace-grade epoxy system, to impart electrical conductivity while maintaining structural bonding capability. Mechanical properties of composite-tocomposite joints were evaluated using ASTM-based lap shear and peel tests. Bulk electrical conductivities over 1 S/m were achieved without degrading the joint structural performance in the selected test methods. The mechanical and electrical performance of a SWCNT-modified epoxy adhesive was also studied for aluminumto- aluminum bonding. It was found that the integration of 1 wt% SWCNTs can considerably improve joint Mode I fracture toughness by ~ 35 % due to mechanisms such as crack bridging. The electrical resistance of the bondline was also consistent with the electrical conductivity of SWCNT-modified adhesive films (~ 10 - 3 S/m), but slightly lower than the bulk electrical conductivity measured on thicker samples.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This work {{is aimed}} at {{reproducing}} numerically a campaign of experimental tests performed {{for the development of}} reinforced panels, typically found in <b>aircraft</b> fuselage. The <b>bonded</b> reinforcements can significantly reduce the rate of fatigue crack growth and increase the residual strength of the skin. The reinforcements are of two types: stringers and doublers. The former provides stiffening to the panel while the latter controls the crack growth between the stringers. The purpose of the study is to validate a numerical method of analysis that can predict the damage tolerance of these reinforced panels. Therefore, using a fracture mechanics approach, several models (different by the geometry and the types of reinforcement constraints) were simulated with the finite element solver ABAQUS. The bonding between skin and stiffener was taken either rigid or flexible due to the presence of adhesive. The possible rupture of the reinforcements was also considered. The stress intensity factor trend obtained numerically as a function of crack growth was used to determine the fatigue crack growth rate, obtaining a good approximation of the experimental crack propagation rate in the skin. Therefore, different solutions for improving the damage tolerance of aircraft reinforced panels can be virtually tested in this way before performing experiments...|$|R
40|$|When {{ultrasonic}} pulses {{are used}} to detect flaws that are near the surface or in thin-layered structures, the natural tendency {{is to use a}} narrow pulse. A broadband pulse with a high center frequency and a large bandwidth will allow the flaw echo and interface echoes to be resolved from the front surface echo in an immersion or squirter testing situation. However, {{there are a number of}} limitations in using high frequency ultrasound. The major disadvantages are the high attenuation, hence the limited interrogation depth, and the degradation of ultrasonic scan images due to interference effects. Interference fringes can arise from minute thickness changes of the various material layers and can mask the flaw images [1]. In ultrasonic C-scans it is also important that the time gate used for interrogating a certain depth range be properly positioned and that the gate be able to follow the surface contour if the part is not flat. These problems can largely be avoided at lower frequencies, but the correspondingly poorer temporal resolution can impair the detection of near-surface flaws. It is generally accepted that there is a “dead time” associated with the front surface ringdown during which near-surface flaws are undetectable.

This {{is due to the fact}} that they develop smooth load transfer and fewer points of stress concentration as compared to fastener joints. The failure prediction of such joints is extremely important, to avoid catastrophic failures during aircraft service period. In the present investigation, an adhesively bonded lap joint between metal-composite (i. e., Al 2024 -T 3 /CFRP) adherends bonded with Redux 319 -A adhesive has been analyzed using finite element method considering geometric non-linearity and incorporating adhesive material nonlinear behavior.

Soon this process, known for producing a readily adherent oxide with an excellent corrosion resistance, will be banned by strict international environmental and health regulations. Replacing this traditional process in a high-demanding and high-risk industry such as aircraft construction requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying adhesion and degradation mechanisms at the oxide/resin interface resulting from alternative processes. The relationship between the anodizing conditions in sulfuric and mixtures of sulfuric and phosphoric acid electrolytes and the formation and durability of bonding under various environmental conditions was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the oxide features. Selected specimens were studied with transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to measure resin concentration within structurally different porous anodic oxide layers {{as a function of}} depth. Results show that there are two critical morphological aspects for strong and durable bonding. First, a minimum pore size is pivotal for the formation of a stable interface, as reflected by the initial peel strengths. Second, the increased surface roughness of the oxide/resin interface caused by extended chemical dissolution at higher temperature and higher phosphoric acid concentration is crucial to assure bond durability under water ingress. There is, however, an upper limit to the beneficial amount of anodic dissolution above which bonds are prone for corrosive degradation.

Two types of tests were conducted: tensile and tension-tension fatigue tests.

The graphite/epoxy composite was chosen to be the reinforcing material for all the tests. An efficient finite element model was also developed to evaluate the performance of a bonded repair. By the model, the strain energy release rate of a cracked panel can be determined.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to find a way}} of {{improving}} the damage tolerance of composite bonded repairs to metallic aircraft structures, the effect of using conventional crack growth retardation techniques in conjunction with bonded repairs was experimentally investigated. Hence, an experimental test program was set up to determine whether fatigue crack growth under bonded repairs is retarded further by giving the crack to be repaired a crack growth retardation treatment prior to repair patch application. In addition, it was set up to determine the influence of a bonded repair on the effectiveness of a crack growth retardation method. Centrally cracked aluminium plates were used. Stop drilling followed by cold hole expansion and the application of single overloads were selected as retardation treatments. Two patch materials were considered; boron/epoxy and Glare 2. Further test variables were the aluminium alloy and the plate thickness. Fatigue testing was carried out under constant amplitude loading and baseline results were determined first. In addition to optically monitoring the crack growth, local and global out-of-plane deformations were visualised with holographic interferometry and shadow moireì. Furthermore, the stress intensity factors under the repair patch were examined with strain gauges and measurement of the central crack opening displacement. Disbonds and fracture surfaces were studied after residual strength tests. The crack growth results obtained showed that retardation treatments decrease crack growth rates under a repair patch and that the effectiveness of a retardation treatment is increased by the patch. Although identical crack growth rates were observed under boron/epoxy and Glare 2 patches, the reinitiation period after the retardation treatment lasted longer when Glare 2 patches were applied. Analytical predictions of the extent of retardation based on existing models showed that the conjunctive effect of retardation treatments and bonded repairs was underestimated. A sustained reduction in crack growth rates was observed under bonded repairs with a prior overload retardation treatment. It was concluded that the damage tolerance of bonded repairs is increased by the application of a crack growth retardation treatment because the crack growth is retarded further. These findings indicate that the range of cracks in <b>aircraft</b> for which <b>bonded</b> repairs can be considered is expanded and that economic benefits can be obtained...|$|R
