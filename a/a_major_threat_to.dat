5|$|B.spinulosa {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It is {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it {{does not appear}} on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse {{because the}} survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction {{does not mean}} that the species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) {{lists the}} serval as least concern; {{the animal is}} also {{included}} in CITES Appendix II. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> {{the survival of the}} serval include the degradation of wetlands and grasslands. Trade of serval skins, though on the decline, still occurs in countries such as Benin and Senegal. In western Africa, the serval has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E

The Second Liberian Civil War, originated in clashes in April 1999 but was not <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Taylor until 2000–01. However, on the government side the AFL played only a minor role; irregular ex National Patriotic Front of Liberia militias backed by more privileged Taylor partisans such as the Anti-Terrorist Unit saw most of the fighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks on}} the Southern Pictish Zone at Dunnottar and Dundurn {{represented}} <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Ecgfrith's suzerainty. Ecgfrith was contending with other challenges to his overlordship. In June 684, countering a Gaelic-Briton alliance, he sent his armies, led by Berhtred, son of Beornhæth, to Brega in Ireland. Ecgfrith's force decimated the local population and destroyed many churches, actions which are treated with scorn by Bede.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It has excellent resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing.

5|$|After marrying {{his niece}} Martina and being crowned by the Patriarch, the 35-year-old Heraclius {{set out to}} perform his work as emperor. Phocas' brother, Comentiolus, {{commanded}} a sizable force in central Anatolia but was assassinated by the Armenian commander Justin, removing <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Heraclius' reign. Still, transfer of the forces commanded by Comentiolus had been delayed, allowing the Persians to advance further in Anatolia. Trying to increase revenues and reduce costs, Heraclius limited the number of state-sponsored personnel of the Church in Constantinople by not paying new staff from the imperial fisc. He used ceremonies to legitimize his dynasty, and he secured a reputation for justice to strengthen his grip on power.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially {{recognized}} tropical {{storms and}} hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane {{was reported to}} have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named for whatever reason, it would've received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{successful}} campaign in Extremadura, on 27 January 1811 Soult began his investment of Badajoz. Almost immediately the Spanish Army of Extremadura {{arrived in the}} vicinity with some 15,000 troops {{under the command of}} Gen. Mendizabal. Soult's army, too small to surround Badajoz, was unable to prevent 3,000 of Mendizabal's men from reinforcing the fortress and the remainder occupying the heights of San Cristóbal. This posed <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the French, so Soult moved at once to engage. In the ensuing Battle of the Gebora the French inflicted 1,000 casualties on the Spanish field army and took 4,000 prisoners, at a cost to themselves of only 400 casualties. The remnants of Mendizabal's defeated army fled towards Badajoz or into Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Glover's pika {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it occurs in remote areas of China which are unlikely to be affected by human activities. The current state of its population trend is unclear, as no natural historic or ecological investigation has been done on this species. However, being locally poisoned and trapped is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Glover's pika populations. It is also regionally red listed as a species of least concern in China.|$|E
5|$|The Alamanni {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to launch a major invasion of Gaul and northern Italy. However, the Visigoths were defeated in battle that summer near the modern Italian-Slovenian border and then routed in the Battle of Naissus that September by Gallienus, Claudius and Aurelian, who then turned and defeated the Alemanni at the Battle of Lake Benacus. Claudius' successor Aurelian defeated the Goths twice more in the Battle of Fanum Fortunae and the Battle of Ticinum. The Goths remained <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Empire but directed their attacks away from Italy itself for several years after their defeat.

5|$|After the May elections, the Grinius/Sleževičius {{government}} lifted martial law, {{still in}} effect in Kaunas and other localities, restored democratic freedoms, and granted broad amnesty to political prisoners. For the first time, Lithuania had become truly democratic. However, the change {{did not meet}} with universal approval. Many of the released prisoners were communists who quickly used the new freedoms of speech to organize a protest attended by approximately 400 people in Kaunas on 13 June. The protest was dispersed. The new government's opposition used this protest as the platform for a public attack on the government, alleging that it was allowing illegal organizations (the Communist Party of Lithuania was still outlawed) to continue their activities freely. Despite its local nature, the incident was presented as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Lithuania and its military; the government {{was said to be}} incapable of dealing with this threat.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>major</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> Georgia’s {{waterways}} continue, volunteer-based monitoring {{groups such}} as Georgia Adopt-A-Stream (GA AAS) have become a vital source of information on aquatic ecological condition. Biological monitoring {{is an important component}} of the program, with macroinvertebrates serving as the primary tool for assessing water quality. We evaluated the validity and applicability of the GA AAS macroinvertebrate index on three impacted and two reference streams within an agricultural landscape in the Coastal Plain region of southwest Georgia. We compared these findings to a concurrent study that examined the condition of streams impacted by grazing livestock, through water quality, physical and vegetative parameters as well as macroinvertebrate metrics. The GA AAS index for macroinvertebrates proved to be effective in separating sites with different impacts, showing similar results as most invertebrate indices, and appears to be a valid tool to assess the ecological condition of Coastal Plain streams.
