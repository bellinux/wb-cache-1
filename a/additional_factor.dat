5|$|Jensen {{was able}} to take on {{production}} of the Tiger because its assembly contract for the Volvo P1800 had recently been cancelled. An <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> in the decision was that Jensen's chief engineer Kevin Beattie and his assistant Mike Jones had previously worked for Rootes, and understood how the company operated. The first of 14 Jensen-built prototypes were based on the Series IV body shell, which became available at the end of 1963.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> in {{the decline in}} huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland–Virginia {{football}} rivalry was {{a designated}} official ACC cross-divisional series when Maryland was an ACC member and the teams have a long-standing rivalry due to proximity and history. The programs also vie for recruits {{in the same}} region, and more recently, an <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> has been the schools' academic competition. Maryland and Virginia have occasionally served as spoilers for one another by precluding a championship or bowl game appearance. Since Maryland is {{moving out of the}} ACC and into the Big Ten, the future of this series is in question. On January 12th, 2017, the schools jointly announced a home-home series would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.|$|E

5|$|Various {{weapons and}} power-ups {{can be used}} in battle to inflict damage, recover health, or {{dispense}} additional items. They fall randomly onto the stage in the form of items from Nintendo franchises, such as Koopa shells, hammers, and Poké Balls.}} The nine multiplayer stages are locations taken from or in the style of Nintendo franchises, such as Planet Zebes from Metroid and Sector Z from Star Fox. Although stages are rendered in three dimensions, players can only move within a two-dimensional plane. Stages are dynamic, ranging from simple moving platforms to dramatic alterations of the entire stage. Each stage offers unique gameplay and strategic motives, making the chosen stage an <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Baker created four {{distinct}} {{stages of}} makeup design so that West {{would appear to}} melt gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate stages of editing, these makeup stages were ultimately eliminated from the final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor Rebar was impatient and uncooperative with the extensive makeup sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all of the facial appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, {{might have been an}} <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> in the lack of makeup effect stages in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused his body to melt. Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation.|$|E
5|$|The NKAP (Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti—People's Ministry of the Aircraft Industry) {{announced}} its 1941 production plan on 9 December 1940. Zavod Nr. 1 {{would be required}} to build a total of 3,500 in 1941. Zavod Nr. 43 in Kiev would begin construction of the MiG-3 and complete one hundred aircraft {{by the end of the}} year and Zavod Nr. 21 in Gor'kiy would start to plan construction of an upgraded version of the MiG-3, although this last program was canceled shortly afterwards. 140 were delivered in January 1941 and Zavod Nr. 1 was on pace to exceed its quota with 496 delivered in July, 562 in August and 450 in September. In October the German advance on Moscow forced the factory, and its OKO, to evacuate to Kuybyshev where production resumed under unsuitable conditions. However, shortly afterwards, Stalin sent a telegram to the directors of the plants building the Ilyushin Il-2 and the MiG-3 demanding more Il-2 production, resulting in MiG-3 production being terminated in favor of the Il-2, with a final thirty aircraft built in 1942 from spares. An <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> in cancellation of the MiG-3 was that its Mikulin AM-35A engine was closely related to the Il-2's AM-38 allowing production to be quickly switched from one to the other.|$|E

In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> of shear modulus which affects compression waves due to off-axis elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.|$|E

25|$|A {{molecule}} {{that allows}} the genetic material to be realized as a protein was first hypothesized by François Jacob and Jacques Monod. Severo Ochoa won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for developing a process for synthesizing RNA in vitro with polynucleotide phosphorylase, which was useful for cracking the genetic code. RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965; however, the RNA synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested {{the existence of an}} <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> needed to terminate transcription correctly.|$|E
25|$|The French paradox implies two {{important}} possibilities. The {{first is that}} the hypothesis linking saturated fats to CHD is not completely valid (or, at the extreme, is entirely invalid).

25|$|Foreign {{investment}} in the Cuban tourism sector has increased steadily since the tourism drive. This has been made possible due to constitutional changes to Cuba's socialist command economy, {{to allow for the}} recognition of foreign held capital. By the late 1990s, twenty five joint foreign and domestic venture companies were working within Cuba's tourist industry. Foreign investors and hoteliers from market based economies have found that Cuba's centralized economy and bureaucracy has created particular staffing issues and higher costs than normal. An <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> cited by foreign investors is the degree of state involvement at the executive level, which is far higher than average.|$|E
25|$|Meeting this {{scalability}} {{condition is}} possible {{for a wide range}} of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required bits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between L and L2, where L is the number of bits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> of L. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 104 bits without error correction. With error correction, the figure would rise to about 107 bits. Computation time is about L2 or about 107 steps and at 1nbsp&MHz, about 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Philip II {{was also}} able to field archers, {{including}} mercenary Cretan archers and perhaps some native Macedonians. In most Greek states, archery was not greatly esteemed, nor practised by native soldiery, and foreign archers were often employed, such as the Scythians prominent in Athenian employ. However, Crete was notable for its very effective archers, whose services as mercenaries were in great demand throughout the Greek World. Cretan archers were famed for their powerful bows, firing arrows with large, heavy heads of cast bronze. They carried their arrows in a quiver with a protective flap over its opening. Cretan archers were unusual in carrying a shield, which was relatively small and faced in bronze. The carrying of shields indicates that the Cretans also had some ability in hand-to-hand fighting, an <b>additional</b> <b>factor</b> in their popularity as mercenaries. Archers were also raised from Macedonia and various Balkan peoples. Alexander inherited the use of Cretan archers from his father's reign, yet around this time a clear reference {{to the use of}} native Macedonian archers was made. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace and were organized into chiliarchies.|$|E
