5|$|Andrew Johnston (born 23 September 1994) is a British {{singer who}} rose to fame when he {{appeared}} as a boy soprano on the second series of the UK television talent show Britain's Got Talent in 2008. Although he did not win the competition, he received a contract to record with Syco Music, a label owned by the Britain's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell. Johnston's debut album, One Voice, was released in September of the same year, and reached number four on the UK Albums Chart.

Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience {{of more than a}} million people at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician.|$|E

25|$|Henry Hill Hickman (1800–1830) {{experimented with}} the use of carbon dioxide as an {{anesthetic}} in the 1820s. He would make the animal insensible, effectively via almost suffocating it with carbon dioxide, then determine the effects of the gas by amputating one of its limbs. In 1824, Hickman submitted the results of his research to the Royal Society in a short treatise titled Letter on suspended animation: with the view of ascertaining its probable utility in surgical operations on human subjects. The response was an 1826 article in The Lancet titled 'Surgical Humbug' that ruthlessly criticised his work. Hickman died four years later at age 30. Though he was unappreciated {{at the time of his}} death, his work has since been positively reappraised <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> recognised as one of the fathers of anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a victory}} {{propelled}} {{him into a}} different league of steeplechases, horses and trainers. Christopher Green was granted a passport in 1850 which may well mean he was riding abroad. He rode, and won, often for 'Mr Carew' and Ben Land snr. <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> mainly mentioned by the sporting press only when {{something out of the}} ordinary happened. For a while, though, Green had been wanting to set up a training establishment on his own account and so moved back to Littleport in the Isle of Ely (his father's birthplace) where 'he soon got the management of several steeple chase horses' but found 'it was easier to find stabling than a country to train over'. He soon made the acquaintance of Henry Jones of Aps (or Apes) Hall, Littleport which became a long-standing relationship of friendship rather than one of pure business. In the 1850s, Green and Jones, as co-owners, bought Tomyrus (foaled 1851) who had a successful flat and hurdles career. Prince Charlie, Camel, Hester, Avenger, Gownsman 'and other good horses' were all descended from Tomyrus and gave Jones fame and success.|$|E

Because of his great achievements in sumo {{he was given a}} bonus of 130million yen and was also made a [...] "one generation" [...] elder without having to purchase a share in the Association. This enabled him to keep his fighting name <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> known as Takanohana Oyakata. With his father's health failing, he took over the operation of his training stable in January 2004, renaming it Takanohana stable. Its last sekitori, Takanonami retired shortly afterwards. During 2008, he added four new recruits to his stable, the first for several years, bringing the total number of wrestlers in his charge up to ten. These include his first foreign recruit, a Mongolian with amateur sumo experience named Takanoiwa, and two twins. In July 2012 Takanohana produced his first sekitori level wrestler when Takanoiwa was promoted to the second highest jūryō division. He won the jūryō championship in January 2013 and a year later was promoted to the top makuuchi division.|$|E

500|$|In 1926, {{a letter}} to the editor of the Register asking about the origin of the name Waterloo Bay sparked a lively {{exchange}} between a Register journalist and west coast local Archie Beviss and others. According to Foster et al., Beviss was relying on local hearsay about the massacre, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> associated with the [...] "most bloodthirsty versions of the legend". Beviss claimed to have been told about the massacre by several people, including Hamp's son, as well as James Geharty, one of the police officers involved in investigating the murders. Beviss stated that Hamp's son was a 16-year-old shepherd at the time of his father's murder, and that he had found his father's head in a camp oven, having been cut off with a crosscut saw. According to Beviss, after the murder of Easton, Geharty urged the government to take action, and after approval was given, a force of 160 men was raised. The force then drove about 260 Aboriginal people over the cliffs. Finally, Beviss stated that Geharty named Waterloo Bay after the massacre. Foster et al. have identified several inconsistencies in Beviss' account. Firstly, Geharty did not name Waterloo Bay. Beviss named Easton's husband as being involved in the drive against the Aboriginal people, but James Easton went to Adelaide after his wife's murder and never returned. There is also no evidence that the government sanctioned the raising of a force. Finally, if 160 men participated in the drive, the authors question why no first-hand accounts of the massacre exist.|$|E
