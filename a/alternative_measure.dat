25|$|One of {{the most}} widely used instruments, the Rosenberg {{self-esteem}} scale (RSES) is a 10-item self-esteem scale scores that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves. An <b>alternative</b> <b>measure,</b> The Coopersmith Inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves. If a subject's answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the scale regards them as well adjusted. If those answers reveal some inner shame, it considers them to be prone to social deviance.|$|E
40|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>measures</b> are formalized {{programs}} across Canada {{by which}} offenders {{who would otherwise}} proceed to court are dealt with through non-judicial, community-based alternatives. Typical programs could include com-munity service, personal service or financial compensation to a victim, apologies, or educational sessions. In 1998 - 99, 33, 173 youth cases reached agreement to participate in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures.</b> For every 10, 000 youth in Canada, 135 participated in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures.</b> Among jurisdictions, Alberta had {{the highest rate of}} youth assigned to <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> (384 per 10, 000 youth). British Columbia (63) and Ontario (66) had the lowest participation rates. Males represented the majority of youth participating in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures.</b> Almost two-thirds (63 %) of alter-native measures cases involved males. However, this is lower than the proportion of cases heard in youth courts involving males (79 %). Six out of ten youth assigned to <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> were 15 years of age or older. Aboriginal youth are disproportionately represented in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures.</b> While representing 4 % of the youth population, Aboriginal youth accounted for 15 % of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> cases in jurisdictions that were able to provide data. For {{the second year in a}} row, youth who committed property-related crimes were most often referred to alterna-tive measures. Over one-half (57 %) of all cases in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> were for theft under $ 5, 000. Similar to that found in 1997 - 98, the most frequent types of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> interventions administered to youth in 1998 - 99 were community service (22 %) and apologies (17 %). The majority of youth in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> successfully completed all measures agreed to (93 %).

40|$|POLICY <b>Alternative</b> <b>measures</b> {{should be}} {{considered}} for any case where the successful completion of an <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> program can achieve the most important objectives of a court prosecution. The Criminal Justice Branch supports the use of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> programs, and recognizes {{that they can be}} the most appropriate and effective way to address harm done to the community and to allow offenders to be rehabilitated and accept responsibility for their criminal conduct. This specifically includes programs authorized under section 717 of the Criminal Code which are based on restorative justice principles, such as family group conferencing, community accountability panels, aboriginal justice programs and victim/offender reconciliation processes. The Branch also supports other restorative justice programs which do not involve the <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> process. The Branch supports the use of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> programs which recognize the circumstances of aboriginal offenders. Prior to recommending <b>alternative</b> <b>measures,</b> Crown Counsel must be satisfied that there is a substantial likelihood of conviction. The application of this policy is a continuing one. Notwithstanding an initial determination that <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> are not suitable, upon receipt of new information it may be appropriate to reassess the decision regarding <b>alternative</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

25|$|Packing {{fraction}} – The {{packing fraction}} is a parameter borrowed from physics {{to define the}} organization (or state i.e. solid, liquid, or gas) of 3D fish groups. It is an <b>alternative</b> <b>measure</b> to density. In this parameter, the aggregation is idealized as an ensemble of solid spheres, with each fish {{at the center of}} a sphere. The packing fraction is defined as the ratio of the total volume occupied by all individual spheres divided by the global volume of the aggregation (Cavagna 2008). Values range from zero to one, where a small packing fraction represents a dilute system like a gas.|$|E
25|$|Rank {{correlation}} coefficients, such as Spearman's {{rank correlation}} coefficient and Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (τ) measure {{the extent to}} which, as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase, without requiring that increase to be represented by a linear relationship. If, as the one variable increases, the other decreases, the rank correlation coefficients will be negative. It is common to regard these rank correlation coefficients as alternatives to Pearson's coefficient, used either {{to reduce the amount}} of calculation or to make the coefficient less sensitive to non-normality in distributions. However, this view has little mathematical basis, as rank correlation coefficients measure a different type of relationship than the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and are best seen as measures of a different type of association, rather than as <b>alternative</b> <b>measure</b> of the population correlation coefficient.|$|E

As a leading measure, the Premier attempted to relinquish the state's {{share in the}} National Bank of Romania (BNR). The project was opposed by BNR founder and National Liberal doyen Eugeniu Carada, who informed Carp {{that there was little}} chance of profitable privatization. BNR Governor Mihail C. Sutzu also resisted the move—the other shareholders ultimately agreed to purchase government stock, and to provide future loans for the state. As an <b>alternative</b> <b>measure,</b> Carp leased the state tobacco monopoly to a bankers' syndicate. In Education, Minister Constantin C. Arion imposed a norm against the accumulation of offices in the academic system, a measure largely directed at PNL-ist staff. Through his Minister of Internal Affairs (Constantin Olănescu), Carp also imposed strict measures against moonshiners, after which riots and bloodshed occurred throughout the poorer regions of Wallachia.|$|E
