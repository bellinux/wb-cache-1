5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>cup.</b> The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
500|$|Starting {{with the}} {{introduction}} of its BK Chicken Fries product in 2005, BK began adapting some of its product packaging so that it could be placed in an automotive cup holder. The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce. Burger King credits the design of this box with helping to make its Chicken Fries the most popular adult-oriented chicken product in the United States. It has since added a trademarked and patented round French fry container which it calls the [...] "FryPod", which is <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> made from 50 percent recycled materials that is designed to fit in an automotive cup holder. The package design won an honorable mention at a packaging industry design competition. BK's large and King sized beverage containers are made from molded HDPE plastic with a funnel-like shaped bottom that allows the oversized cups to fit in cup holders.|$|E

Since most of the fast food industry's business is take-out or drive-thru traffic, this allowed the convenience food purchaser to drive and eat with little effort. With the introduction of the BK Chicken Fries, BK began adapting some of its other product packaging so that it could also be placed in an automotive cup holder.

"Colored {{people lived}} in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles," [...] wrote Harvard {{professor}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr. {{about growing up in}} segregated West Virginia in the 1960s. [...] "Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said.... Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence." [...] "For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores," [...] recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: [...] "'He knows my name, boy,' my father said after a long pause. 'He calls all colored people George.'"

40|$|AbstractObjective: There {{are many}} {{settings}} {{in which a}} spacer device is not available for the administration of bronchodilator. Therefore, we tested whether <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> disposable <b>cup</b> is as effective as a commercially produced spacer to administer bronchodilator. Methodology: Randomised controlled trial. 50 subjects aged 16 – 50 years who had wheeze and a greater than 10 % decrease in FEV 1 after histamine inhalation test (HIT). Subjects were randomised to either the 150 ml <b>paper</b> disposable <b>cup</b> group (CUP) or the commercially produced spacer group (SPACER). Twenty minutes after 400 μg salbutamol was administered FEV 1 was measured. The recovery index measured post-bronchodilator FEV 1 {{as a percentage of}} baseline FEV 1. Also, analysis of covariance tested whether recovery of FEV 1 was related to the magnitude of the fall following the HIT. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between CUP and SPACER groups in any characteristics. There was no difference for the recovery index (t 48 = 1. 14,P = 0. 26). Regression analyses showed that the relation between the magnitude of the fall in FEV 1 during the HIT and the percent recovery was not different between the CUP and SPACER groups (t=− 1. 2,P < 0. 23). Conclusions: <b>A</b> <b>paper</b> disposable <b>cup</b> was effective for the reversal of mild to moderate bronchoconstriction. Therefore, <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> disposable <b>cup</b> can be used for the first-aid management of asthma when there is concern about cross-infection and a commercially produced spacer is not available...|$|R

40|$|Paper and {{paperboard}} are {{the most}} widely used packaging materials for both food and non-food products. Because they are composed of highly porous cellulose networks, they readily absorb moisture in high humidity environments or when in contact with liquid or high moisture foods.

One of the major uses of such hydrophobic material coated paperboard is <b>a</b> disposable single-use <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> with or without a lid.

5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> drink <b>cup</b> as opposed to the normal fry carton.

40|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>cups</b> are {{ubiquitous}} {{in daily life}} for serving water, soup, coffee, tea, and milk due to their convenience, biodegradability, recyclability, and sustainability. The thermal insulation performance of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> is of significance because {{they are used to}} supply hot food or drinks. Using an effective thermal conductivity to accurately evaluate the thermal insulation performance of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> is complex due to the inclusion of complicated components and a multilayer structure.
