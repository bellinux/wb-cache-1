5|$|ATC {{maintained}} normal {{two-way radio}} {{contact with the}} Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on VHF frequency 125.05MHz with Brasilia Center. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary radar contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E

5|$|Joe Dante was {{the next}} choice, {{increasing}} the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, {{making it to the}} final product. However, <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E

Sir Christopher Wren was attempting another restoration in 1666 when the cathedral was destroyed in the Great Fire of London. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> old structure was demolished, and the present, domed cathedral was erected on the site, with an English Baroque design by Wren.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Florida, {{the storm}} {{continued}} rapidly northeastward and transitioned into a tropical cyclone. Late on February3 it {{reached its peak}} strength with maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h). On February4 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. Around that time, gale force winds extended 100miles (160km) to the east of the center. Later that day, it passed over Cape Cod, and early on February5 it moved into eastern Maine. The Hurricane Research Division assessed the storm as losing its identity shortly thereafter, over New Brunswick. However, a map produced by the U.S. Weather Bureau indicated that the storm continued northward into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and later crossed eastern Quebec and Labrador. By February6, it reached the ocean again, deepening to a minimum pressure of 988mbar (29.18inHg). <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> Weather Bureau track ended, and as such the ultimate fate of the storm is unknown.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> <b>The</b> conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

As the 15th Battalion advanced to relieve the 57th/60th Battalion, it clashed with Japanese units and, on 3 July, as a company from the 47th Battalion came under heavy attack, one the 15th Battalion's platoons was dispatched with two tanks in support to provide assistance. Heavy fighting continued throughout the afternoon following their arrival, during which at least 20 Japanese were killed. The 15th Battalion occupied a position around Sisikatekori and along Killen's Track, in the southern sector of the brigade's area, while the Australians made preparations to resume the advance towards the Buin stronghold. The most-forward battalion, on 6 July it was subjected to heavy attacks as the Japanese sought to infiltrate the Australian forward positions and cut their lines of communication. As {{a result of these}} attacks, the plan to advance was cancelled temporarily.|$|E

As the party weakens Nene, it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along, and she was the voice that told the others to swallow the spheres. When Zola was too weak to defend herself, Nene had given her a shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy. Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him.|$|E
