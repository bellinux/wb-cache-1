500|$|As {{with the}} South Carolina class, these ships were fitted with two 3-inch/50 caliber {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns in Mark 11 mounts in 1917. The Mark 11 mount {{was the first}} 3-inch AA mounting issued by the US Navy. They had <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> height of [...] compared to a height of [...] for the pedestal mountings used against surface craft. This allowed them an elevation range between −10 and 85 degrees. Maximum range was [...] at 43 degrees and maximum ceiling [...] at 85 degrees.|$|E
500|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} manually-operated director-control tower and the separate rangefinder situated above the bridge. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. [...] and Hereward saw {{the introduction of a}} new style of bridge that would become standard on all Royal Navy fleet destroyers from the [...] through to the [...] of 1944. This was necessary as Hereward was fitted with a prototype twin-gun mounting that had <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> height [...] higher than the previous weapons, therefore it was necessary to raise the wheelhouse to allow the helmsman to see over the top. Raising the wheelhouse meant it had to be placed in front of, rather than underneath, the bridge, and it was given angled sides, resulting in a characteristic wedge shape with a sloping roof.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong's guns used a [...] "built-up" [...] construction, {{comprising}} {{a central}} [...] "A" [...] tube (initially of wrought iron, and from 1863 of mild steel toughened in oil) holding the bore over which were shrunk several wrought iron coils which kept the central tube under compression, a breech-piece, and <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> ring. The guns' rifling {{was on the}} [...] "polygroove" [...] system; the bore of the gun had 38 grooves along its length with a twist of one turn per 38 calibres.|$|E

"Ay, ay," [...] replied Vin, [...] "when I am {{got into}} my fustian doublet again, with my bit of <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> under my arm, I can walk Alsatia at midnight as I {{could do that}} there Fleet Street in midday--they will {{not one of them}} swagger with the prince of 'prentices, and the king of clubs-- they know I could bring every tall boy in the ward down upon them." ...|$|E
60|$|Everywhere a ruin {{that was}} picturesque, a decay that was refined and gentle, a neglect that was graceful, met the eye; the sharp {{exterior}} and reentering angles were softly rounded and obliterated by overgrowths of semitropical creepers; the abatis was filled by a natural brake of scrub-oak and manzanita; the clematis flung its long scaling ladders over the escarpment, until Nature, slowly but securely investing the doomed fortress, had lifted a victorious banner of palm from the conquered {{summit of the}} citadel! Some strange convulsions of the earth had completed the victory; the barbette guns of carved and antique bronze commemorating fruitless and long-forgotten triumphs were dismounted; one turned in the cheeks of its carriage had <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> raised piteously {{in the air like}} an amputated stump; another, sinking through its rotting chassis, had buried itself to its chase in the crumbling adobe wall. But above and beyond this gentle chaos of defense stretched the real ramparts and escarpments of Todos Santos--the impenetrable and unassailable fog! Corroding its brass and iron with saline breath, rotting its wood with unending shadow, sapping its adobe walls with perpetual moisture, and nourishing the obliterating vegetation with its quickening blood, as if laughing to scorn the puny embattlements of men--it still bent around the crumbling ruins the tender grace of an invisible but all-encompassing arm.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{attribute}} of a Dobsonian's mount {{is that it}} resembles a [...] "gun carriage" [...] configuration with a [...] "rocker box" [...] consisting of <b>a</b> horizontal <b>trunnion</b> style altitude axis and a broadly supported azimuth axis, both making use of material such as plastic, Formica, and Teflon to achieve smooth operation. Many derivative mount designs have kept this basic form while heavily modifying the materials and configuration.|$|R
50|$|Cinetheodolites {{consist of}} a stable base and bearing, a {{vertical}} gimbal or trunnion carrier which rotates about a vertical axis normal to {{the plane of the}} base; a central drum or housing which contains the system telescopic lenses, plus a camera and film assembly; <b>a</b> horizontal <b>trunnion</b> shaft on which the central drum is mounted so that it can rise or dip about the horizontalaxis; and the sighting telescopes, which are also mounted on the horizontal trunnion shaft.|$|R

40|$|Designing Engineer: Hugh E. Young Consulting Engineer: Lewis M. Gram; The former {{bridge at}} Jefferson Avenue was a narrow swing bridge {{that needed to}} be {{replaced}} by around 1910. However, construction did not begin on the new bridge until 1920 and a detour for Jefferson Avenue was needed. The detour was created up stream with an old truss bridge from the Michigan Central Railroad, and was floated into place. Construction then began on <b>a</b> single <b>trunnion,</b> double-leaf bascule bridge that opened in 1922...|$|R
50|$|The trailer chassis was a {{lattice frame}} of tubular members. It {{comprised}} <b>a</b> transverse <b>trunnion</b> box {{member at the}} front, from which six longitudinal tube members ran aftward and converged into one large main central tube at the rear; the six longitudinal members were braced vertically and horizontally by smaller-gauge tubes. The rear central tube member supported a large horizontal-plane turntable. A steerable front truck was installed just behind the trunnion box member, while the turntable surmounted a two-axle rear bogey.|$|R
5|$|Route 3 {{crosses the}} Passaic River {{on a fixed}} bridge, which {{replaced}} <b>a</b> double-leaf <b>trunnion</b> bascule bridge in 2013, into Rutherford, Bergen County. Just after crossing the river, the route interchanges with County Route 507 (Riverside Avenue). The freeway continues through a residential area and comes to an exit that provides access to southbound Route 17. Past this interchange, Route 3 is closely paralleled by Route 17 to the south until Route 3 interchanges again with Route 17, which continues {{to the north of}} Route 3.|$|R
50|$|After cooling the gun the {{machining}} process began. The bore was bored out to proper size, the exterior was turned smooth, the trunnions were turned on <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> lathe, and a vent was drilled.|$|E
50|$|On stage {{lighting}} instruments, <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> is {{a bracket}} attached to {{both ends of}} a striplight that allows the striplight to be mounted on the floor. Sometimes trunnions are also equipped with casters to allow the striplight to be moved easily.|$|E
5000|$|The gun {{consisted}} of a central toughened steel [...] "A" [...] tube surrounded by wrought-iron coils, with <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> ring and cascabel.

5000|$|In firearms, {{the barrel}} is {{sometimes}} mounted in <b>a</b> <b>trunnion,</b> {{which in turn}} is mounted in the receiver. This usage is common for tubular or pressed metal frame guns, such as the AK-47, G3, PPSh-41, Sten, Uzi and others, in which case the BATFE refers to the trunnion as a [...] "mounting block".|$|E
50|$|The Model 1887 was {{constructed}} of an A tube and three layers of reinforcing hoops that {{extended to the}} muzzle. There was also an outer jacket, <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> and a C hoop with a breech ring. The guns had a three-motion Interrupted screw breech and electric firing similar to early British 6 inch QF guns of the period.|$|E
50|$|Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company was the {{contractor}} for the substructure, and the Ketler-Elliot Company was {{the contractor}} for the superstructure. Original electrical equipment was installed by C. H. Norwood. The bridge {{is an example}} of <b>a</b> <b>trunnion</b> bascule bridge, with each half of the roadway is cantilevered out from shore abutments. The bridge is extremely efficient to operate.|$|E
40|$|The main {{thrust of}} these studies has {{resulted}} in an active inertial feedforward/feedback isolation system. This prototype magnetic suspension system has been demonstrated in a laboratory setting in six degrees-of-freedom and has been preliminarily characterized in its isolation performance with favorable results. This isolation system consists of a closed loop digital control system referencing a platform around six relative and six inertial sensors. These sensors control the isolated mass through nine attractive electromagnetic actuators with a system capability of +/- three-tenths of an inch travel in three dimensions. The development of a prototype system from design to fabrication leads directly into the demonstration phase of the project which will attempt a low gravity environmental demonstration of engineering hardware for the isolation of a scientific payload. The demonstration phase of the project will use an aircraft low gravity maneuver to establish a research testbed {{for the study of}} isolation hardware and control strategies in an off-loaded environment. In developing this demonstration capability the Lewis Learjet aircraft has been characterized through its parabolic flight maneuvers and <b>a</b> <b>trunnioned</b> experimental volume has been designed for the test of both active and passive isolation packages. This vibration isolation testbed is operational and has two data acquisition systems available for both autonomous and interactive operation, with a combined input capability of 32 channels...|$|R
