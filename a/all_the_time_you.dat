500|$|Julianne Moore as Julian Taylor. For Julian, Cuarón {{wanted an}} actor who had the [...] "credibility of leadership, intelligence, [...] independence". [...] Moore was cast in June 2005, {{initially}} to play {{the first woman to}} become pregnant in 20 years. [...] "She is just so much fun to work with," [...] Cuarón told Cinematical. [...] "She is just pulling the rug out from under your feet <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> don't know where to stand, because she is going to make fun of you." ...|$|E

2500|$|He was {{eventually}} released on September 27, 2002 along with Shawn Stasiak {{and his own}} cousin, Horace Hogan. Awesome quoted saying [...] "Being in the WWE (formerly the WWF) sucked. I hated it. You had to kiss everybody's ass... You {{had to be on}} your political toes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> would not believe the backstage politics. You were getting stabbed in the back constantly. I was so happy when I was told I was gone [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1999 New York Times story, [...] "C.E.O. Round Table- Online Pioneers: The Buzz Never Stops", Espuelas {{explained}} his approach: [...] "I {{spent a lot}} of time learning how Winston Churchill ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor—not having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high. Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than what we have to do. But that was part of the encouragement—to think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't have to get it right <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> just have to get it right 51 percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although his terse one-liners {{are well}} known, {{he is also}} known for having a dark sense of humour. On the 20th lap of the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Räikkönen had just taken the lead from Lewis Hamilton and his race {{engineer}} Simon Rennie advised that Fernando Alonso was five seconds behind {{and that he would}} be kept informed of Alonso's pace; Räikkönen replied, [...] "Just leave me alone, I know what I'm doing!" [...] Later in the same race, he admonished his team again, when being told to manage the tyre temperature: [...] "Yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm doing that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> don't have to remind me every ten seconds!" [...] The first quote attracted significant press coverage, and Räikkönen made no attempt to apologise in the post-race interview. It was earlier reported that he printed 500 T-shirts with the quote for the entire Lotus team, but this was later invalidated by Räikkönen in an interview with an FOM media personnel. The quote is also featured on his official website.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well,' said Elizabeth, smiling, 'I know <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>you</b> have <b>the</b> {{best of the}} argument. It {{would not}} be so if it was not good for us.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "True. Once at the woman's {{house you}} can hardly say nay to being one in a jig, knowing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>you</b> be {{expected}} to make yourself worth your victuals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; that won't {{help you}} much. Then I should advise <b>you</b> to use <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>you</b> can spare, after {{ordering}} your outfit, in riding. No doubt you could hire a horse." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Listen. You {{have had}} a terrible shock, and it has {{affected}} your mind. You are mistaken in what you think, what <b>you</b> dream of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Do <b>you</b> understand? You are wrong!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Goodness gracious! what a {{child to}} ask questions. Do {{you want to keep}} me {{thinking}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time?</b> Don't <b>you</b> know that thinking is very bad for Dragons?" [...] returned the big one, impatiently.|$|R
