Turner was given the nickname [...] "Bulldog", and Roy was known as [...] "Tiger". Turner later recalled his college experience as follows: [...] "We got room, board and tuition, {{but we had to}} buy our own books and we were supposed to take care of two jobs. I had to sweep out the gym and wait tables, but I kind of farmed out the sweeping after a while.

In letters to his prospective father-in-law, he expressed his outrage at the critics: [...] "So the Salon is the scene of my disgrace;... The scoundrels, they waited until I was away to assassinate my reputation... I have never been so unhappy....I knew I had many enemies; I never was agreeable with them and never will be. My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound them with my works, which don't in any way resemble theirs; [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> advance, the less their work will resemble mine." [...] He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement. Julie Forestier, when asked years later why she had never married, responded, [...] "When one has had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres, one does not marry." ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{brings a}} {{discussion}} about the source of the inaccuracy in observations of objects <b>and</b> demonstrates that <b>the</b> essential reason of the lack of precision is changeability, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> changeability, <b>i.</b> e. <b>more</b> dynamics, can be experienced <b>the</b> <b>more</b> inaccurate, more fuzzy judges can be. The space of ordered fuzzy numbers (OFN), the new model of fuzzy numbers that make possible to deal with fuzzy inputs quantitatively, exactly {{in the same way as}} with real numbers, is shortly presented. The new model possesses a set of properties which are in accordance with the influence of changeability on the increase of the inaccuracy in observations of the environment. The use of OFN is getting rid of the main problem in a classical fuzzy numbers- an unbounded increase in inaccuracies with next calculations. Moreover, new interpretation can be treated as an extend of classic proposals so there is no need to abandon existing ideas to deal with the new model of fuzzy numbers. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper details <b>the</b> design <b>and</b> {{construction}} of a biologically inspired nanorover prototype for exploring Mars. Although all Martian exploration vehicles to date have been wheeled, a six legged design was selected for this rover so as to improve its trafficability across rough terrains, since {{the main focus of}} this project was miniaturisation, with a goal of building a rover which weighed less than 1 kg. To this end, shape memory alloy actuators were used instead of conventional rotary motors, due to their small size and mass, and carbon fibre was used as the main construction material. The rover was analysed using a combination of empirical results and computer simulation, in particular a simulation tool being developed at the University of Surrey called <b>the</b> Legged Performance <b>and</b> Traction Predicting Tool (LPTPT), with results suggesting that the design could be the basis of a successful planetary exploration vehicle. One of the main limitations in planning a planetary exploration mission is that of mass; the greater the mass of the mission hardware, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> fuel is required to deliver it to it's final destination, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> power <b>i...</b>|$|R

This paper lays out our view of the theoretical considerations necessary when deciding on the type of experiment to conduct.
