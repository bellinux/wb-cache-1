The unit cells of this periodic layered structure {{are composed of}} dielectric (e. g., GaAs) and EIT atomic vapor. The frequency-sensitive behavior of controllable reflectance and transmittance depending on the external control field can be applicable to new device design (e. g., it can serve as the fundamental working mechanism for photonic switches and photonic logic gates).

40|$|Ras {{proteins}} occupy dynamic {{plasma membrane}} nanodomains called nanoclusters. The {{significance of this}} spatial organization is unknown. Here we show, using in silico and in vivo analyses of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling, that Ras nanoclusters operate as <b>sensitive</b> <b>switches,</b> converting graded ligand inputs into fixed outputs of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). By generating Ras nanoclusters {{in direct proportion to}} ligand input, cells build an analogue-digital analogue circuit relay that transmits a signal across the plasma membrane with high fidelity. Signal transmission is completely dependent on Ras spatial organization and fails if nanoclustering is abrogated. A requirement for high-fidelity signalling may explain the non-random distribution of other plasma membrane signalling complexes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Stand-alone Solar Photovoltaic {{system is}} very popular in {{off-grid}} areas of Bangladesh. But recently the government is encouraging the use of solar electricity in urban areas too. Now-a-days people have to use solar systems to get electricity connection in newly completed buildings to meet certain percentage of their electricity demand. The solar electricity is stored in battery and then inverted to alternating current for use. These batteries can also be charged from the power line electricity. In this paper a light dependent switch is designed for the efficient use of solar systems. The light <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> automatically charges the battery from power line after sunset, if the battery is not fully charged. The design of the switch and its analysis is presented using Yenka and Orcad Pspice package...|$|R
40|$|Living cells {{provide a}} fluctuating, out-of-equilibrium {{environment}} in which genes must coordinate cellular function. DNA looping, which is a common means of regulating transcription, {{is very much a}} stochastic process; the loops arise from the thermal motion of the DNA and other fluctuations of the cellular environment. We present single-molecule measurements of DNA loop formation and breakdown when an artificial fluctuating force, applied to mimic a fluctuating cellular environment, is imposed on the DNA. We show that loop formation is greatly enhanced in the presence of noise of only a fraction of $k_B T$, yet find that hypothetical regulatory schemes that employ mechanical tension in the DNA [...] as a <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> to control transcription [...] can be surprisingly robust due to a fortuitous cancellation of noise effects...|$|R
40|$|An array compatible, {{fast and}} high {{contrast}} opto-electronic polarisation <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> is proposed. The element's electrical configuration {{is a standard}} p-i-n heterostructure under reverse bias voltage. Its optical configuration {{is very similar to}} an Asymmetric Fabry-Perot Resonator (AFPR) where an electroabsorptive i-layer is included between the p and n layers, as in a SEED. Both p and n-layers are Bragg-reflectors. The front mirror of the AFPR is made slightly polarisation dependent using a subwavelength grating etched in the top layer of the p-type reflector stack. We calculate the polarisation dependent overall absorption (photocurrent) and reflection of the device and model the steady state behaviour and polarisation induced switching properties, for an electroabsorption coefficient that increases linearly with applied voltage. Using a standard load-line analysis we show that changing the input polarisation (at constant intensity) from TE to TM can lead to a dramatic decrease or increase in overall reflectivity...|$|R
40|$|Animal cells {{control their}} {{membrane}} lipid composition within narrow limits, but the sensing mechanisms underlying this control are largely unknown. Recent studies disclosed a protein network {{that controls the}} level of one lipid – cholesterol. This network resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A key component is Scap, a tetrameric ER membrane protein that binds cholesterol. Cholesterol binding prevents Scap from transporting SREBPs to the Golgi for activation. Using a new method to purify ER membranes from cultured cells, we here show that Scap responds cooperatively to ER cholesterol levels. When ER cholesterol exceeds 5 % of total ER lipids, SREBP- 2 transport/activation are abruptly blocked. They resume when ER cholesterol falls below the 5 % threshold. The 5 % threshold is lowered to 3 % when cells overexpress Insig- 1, a Scap-binding protein.

40|$|Feeding {{requires}} {{the integration of}} homeostatic drives with emotional states relevant to food procurement in potentially hostile environments. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates feeding and anxiety, but how these are controlled in a concerted manner remains unclear. Using pharmacogenetic, optogenetic, and calcium imaging approaches with a battery of behavioral assays, we demonstrate that VMH steroidogenic factor 1 (SF 1) neurons constitute a nutritionally <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch,</b> modulating the competing motivations of feeding and avoidance of potentially dangerous environments. Acute alteration of SF 1 neuronal activity alters food intake via changes in appetite and feeding-related behaviors, including locomotion, exploration, anxiety, and valence. In turn, intrinsic SF 1 neuron activity is low during feeding and increases with both feeding termination and stress. Our findings identify SF 1 neurons as {{a key part of}} the neurocircuitry that controls both feeding and related affective states, giving potential insights into the relationship between disordered eating and stress-associated psychological disorders in humans...|$|R

The published article can be found at: [URL] surface adhesion of cells {{is one of the}} early pivotal steps in bacterial biofilm formation, a prevalent adaptation strategy in response to changing environments. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, this process is regulated by the Lap system and the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP. High cytoplasmic levels of cyclic-di-GMP activate the transmembrane receptor LapD that in turn recruits the periplasmic protease LapG, preventing it from cleaving a cell surface-bound adhesin, thereby promoting cell adhesion. In this study, we elucidate the molecular basis of LapG regulation by LapD and reveal a remarkably <b>sensitive</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism that is controlled by LapD's HAMP domain. LapD appears to act as a coincidence detector, whereby a weak interaction of LapG with LapD transmits a transient outside-in signal that is reinforced only when cyclic-di-GMP levels increase. Given the conservation of key elements of this receptor system in many bacterial species, the results are broadly relevant for cyclic-di-GMP- and HAMP domain-regulated transmembrane signaling...|$|R
40|$|AC {{conversion}} {{has a huge}} {{variety of}} applications {{and so there are}} many ongoing research topics as in every type of power electronic conversion. New semiconductors allow the increase of the switching frequency fact that brings a whole new prospective improvement in converter's operation. Many other possible nonlinear operation regimes, including period doubling and chaotic oscillations, appear besides the conventional steady state operation. In this work, a nonlinear discrete-time model of an AC/AC buck type converter is proposed. A discrete time iterative map is derived to highlight the <b>sensitive</b> <b>switching</b> dynamics. The model is able to observe fast scale phenomena and short transient effects. It offers more information compared to other methods such as the averaging ones. According to Electro-Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) regulations, low wide-band noise is more acceptable than the high narrow-band, therefore the goal of this work is to spread the harmonic noise into a wide frequency spectrum which has lower amplitudes compared to the conventional comb-like spectrum with distinctive amplitudes at switching frequency multiples. Through the numerical and experimental consideration the converter can operate in a chaotic motion and the advantages of the performance improvement are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Spumaviruses, {{commonly}} called foamy viruses (FV), are complex retroviruses that establish lifelong persistent infections without any accompanying pathologies. In tissue culture, cells {{can be either}} lytically or latently infected, depending on cell type. Regulation of FV replication is controlled by two promoters: the LTR and a second promoter within the env gene termed the internal promoter (IP). The IP directs expression of the transcriptional activator, Tas, and a second accessory protein, Bet, whose function has been elusive. In this study, we report that expression of exogenous Tas is sufficient to initiate a switch from latent to lytic replication. We also show that treatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) can {{lead to an increase}} in transcription from the IP, and that Bet protein expression abrogates this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that Bet expression severely limits the ability of PMA to activate transcription of latent FV genomes, and that replication of a Bet(-) virus is more easily activated than wild-type FV. Taken together, these data suggest that viral transcription is regulated by a <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch,</b> and that Bet functions as a negative regulator of basal IP activity...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{cooperative}} interactions in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes between Scap, cholesterol, and Insig result in switch-like control over activation of SREBP- 2 transcription factors. This allows cells to rapidly adjust rates of cholesterol synthesis and uptake in response to even slight deviations from physiological set-point levels, thereby ensuring cholesterol homeostasis. In the present study we directly probe for the accessibility of cholesterol in purified ER membranes. Using a soluble cholesterol-binding bacterial toxin, perfringolysin O, we show that cholesterol accessibility increases abruptly at ∼ 5 mol % ER cholesterol, the same concentration at which SREBP- 2 activation is halted. This switch-like change in cholesterol accessibility is observed not only in purified ER membranes but also in liposomes made from ER lipid extracts. The accessibility of cholesterol in membranes is related to its chemical activity. Complex formation between cholesterol and some ER phospholipids can result in sharp changes in cholesterol chemical activity and its accessibility to perfringolysin O or membrane sensors like Scap. The control of the availability of the cholesterol ligand to participate in cooperative Scap/cholesterol/Insig interactions further sharpens the <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> that exerts precise control over cholesterol levels in cell membranes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Calcium {{oscillations}} suppress mitochondrial movements {{along the}} microtubules to support on-demand distribution of mitochondria. To activate this mechanism, Ca(2 +) targets a yet unidentified cytoplasmic factor {{that does not}} seem to be a microtubular motor or a kinase/phosphatase. Here, we have studied the dependence of mitochondrial dynamics on the Miro GTPases that reside in the mitochondria and contain two EF-hand Ca(2 +) -binding domains, in H 9 c 2 cells and primary neurons. At resting cytoplasmic [Ca(2 +) ]([Ca(2 +) ](c)), movements of the mitochondria were enhanced by Miro overexpression irrespective of the presence of the EF-hands. The Ca(2 +) -induced arrest of mitochondrial motility was also promoted by Miro overexpression and was suppressed when either the Miro were depleted or their EF-hand was mutated. Miro also enhanced the fusion state of the mitochondria at resting [Ca(2 +) ] c but promoted mitochondrial fragmentation at high [Ca(2 +) ] c. These effects of Miro on mitochondrial morphology seem to involve Drp 1 suppression and activation, respectively. In primary neurons, Miro also caused an increase in dendritic mitochondrial mass and enhanced mitochondrial calcium signaling. Thus, Miro proteins serve as a [Ca(2 +) ](c) - <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> and bifunctional regulator for both the motility and fusion-fission dynamics of the mitochondria...|$|R

40|$|The {{secretion}} of vesicles for intracellular transport often {{relies on}} the aggregation of specialized membrane-bound proteins into a coat able to curve cell membranes. The nucleation and growth of a protein coat is a kinetic process that competes with the energy-consuming turnover of coat components between the membrane and the cytosol. We propose a generic kinetic description of coat assembly {{and the formation of}} coated vesicles and discuss its implication to the dynamics of COP vesicles that traffic within the Golgi and with the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that stationary coats of fixed area emerge from the competition between coat growth and the recycling of coat components, in a fashion resembling the treadmilling of cytoskeletal filaments. We further show that the turnover of coat components allows for a highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism between a quiescent and a vesicle producing membrane, upon a slowing down of the exchange kinetics. We claim that the existence of this switching behavior, also triggered by factors, such as the presence of cargo and variation of the membrane mechanical tension, allows for efficient regulation of vesicle secretion. We propose a model, supported by different experimental observations, in which vesiculation of secretory membranes is impaired by the energy-consuming desorption of coat proteins, until the presence of cargo or other factors triggers a dynamical switch into a vesicle producing state...|$|R

The expected primary amine products, N-desmethyldesipramine, (S) -norfluoxetine, and N,N-didesmethyldiltiazem, are also observed. The formation of metabolic-intermediate (MI) complexes from these substrates and metabolites was examined. In each example, the initial rates of MI complex accumulation followed the order secondary hydroxylamine > secondary amine ≫ primary amine, {{suggesting that the}} primary amine metabolites do not contribute to formation of MI complexes from these secondary amines. Furthermore, the primary amine metabolites, which accumulate in incubations of the secondary amines, inhibit MI complex formation. Mass balance studies provided estimates of the product ratios of N-dealkylation to N-hydroxylation. The ratios were 2. 9 (DES-CYP 2 C 11), 3. 6 [(S) -FLX-CYP 2 C 19], and 0. 8 (MA-CYP 3 A 4), indicating that secondary hydroxylamines are significant metabolites of the P 450 -mediated metabolism of secondary alkyl amines. Parallel studies with N-methyl-d 3 -desipramine and CYP 2 C 11 demonstrated significant isotopically <b>sensitive</b> <b>switching</b> from N-demethylation to N-hydroxylation. These findings demonstrate that the major pathway to MI complex formation from these secondary amines arises from N-hydroxylation rather than N-dealkylation and that the primary amines are significant competitive inhibitors of MI complex formation...|$|R

Phenology is central to plant adaptation and productivity in different agro-ecologies. We studied a panel of 209 accessions, including 189 indica types and 20 acc. representing other genetic groups. The panel was field-phenotyped under flooded conditions for duration to flowering (F) for 6 sowing dates in Senegal (capturing different thermal and day length regimes) and during two years at two altitudes (mid, 857 m asl; high, 1497 m asl; with similar latitude) in Madagascar. The experiments had an augmented design in Senegal (6 blocks × 6 dates as subplots and 209 acc. as sub-subplot) with 4 replicated check varieties; and a complete block design with 3 replications at 2 sites × 2 years in Madagascar. To dissociate different traits contributing to variation of F, five genotypic Index Variables were calculated. Among them, PCA identified three as describing 98 % of diversity: Estimated basic vegetative phase (BVP), photoperiod (PP) sensitivity, and altitude response. Three clusters were identified within the indica group and related to genotype origin, agronomic type and ecosystem of adaptation. Cluster C 1 was PP-sensitive, C 2 had short BVP and C 3 had long BVP. Within C 1, a sub-cluster was highly <b>altitude</b> <b>sensitive,</b> and within C 3 two sub-clusters were comparatively altitude insensitive. Harvest index (HI), aboveground dw and stem height observed in the most favorable environment (Senegal wet season) showed distinct patterns among clusters, with C 2 having high HI and C 1 being tall.
