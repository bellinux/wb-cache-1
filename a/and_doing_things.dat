[...] "There's something about it– there were echoes of it in No Country for Old Men that were quite interesting for us", he said, [...] "because it was the idea of the physical work that somebody does that helps reveal who they are and is part of the fiber of the story.

2500|$|Most actors {{had contact}} before filming with the {{individuals}} {{they were to}} portray, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: [...] "We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down {{a vast number of}} characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this." [...] As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.|$|E
2500|$|Native Americans {{have made}} up an {{integral}} part of U.S. military conflicts since America's beginning. [...] Colonists recruited Indian allies during such instances as the Pequot War from 1634–1638, the Revolutionary War, as well as in War of 1812. Native Americans also fought on both sides during the American Civil War, as well as military missions abroad including the most notable, the Codetalkers who served in World War II. The Scouts were active in the American West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Including those who accompanied General John J. Pershing in 1916 on his expedition to Mexico in pursuit of Pancho Villa. Indian Scouts were officially deactivated in 1947 when their last member retired from the Army at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. For many Indians it was an important form of interaction with white American culture and their first major encounter with the whites’ way of thinking <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, Drummond bought A Smell of Sulphur in the Wind by Richard Long, for $20,000. In Drummond’s own words, he ‘fell in {{love with}} Richard Long’s work because’ [...] "it was art by walking <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> on his walks." [...] Five years later, Drummond {{felt that he was}} no longer [...] "getting his money's worth" [...] from the photograph. [...] He decided to try to sell it by placing a series of {{placards}} around the country. When this failed to result in its sale, in 2001 he cut the photograph and mounting card into 20,000 pieces to sell for $1 each. His plan, upon retrieving the $20,000 in cash, is to walk with it to the remote place in Iceland where Richard Long had made the photograph and bury it in a box beneath the stone circle. He will then take his own photograph of the site, bring it home, frame it, hang it in the same place in his bedroom where the Richard Long hung, and call the new work The Smell of Money Underground. Drummond's books How to be an Artist and a later soft-bound edition titled $20,000 recounts this story.|$|E
2500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Madonna's then-husband, filmmaker Guy Ritchie in February 2001 and filmed throughout various parts of Los Angeles, including one location on W. Olympic Blvd and S. Wooster St. The video uses the dance remix version of the song, produced by Above & Beyond, instead of the album's original version. According to Madonna, the video [...] "shows my character acting out a fantasy <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> girls {{are not allowed to}} do," [...] she said in a written statement distributed by her record label, Warner Bros. [...] "This is an angry song and I wanted a matching visual with an edgy dance mix." [...] It premiered on Oxygen TV channel, on March 22, 2001, but was banned from TV broadcasts {{in many parts of the}} world, including the most famous MTV and VH1, due to its violent content. It was only aired on MTV and VH1 just once time, during a news segment at a more mature hour of 11:30p.m. ET. While the video failed to air on both networks, Madonna released it as a DVD single on April 24, 2001, becoming the biggest-selling DVD single of 2001. According to Andrew Morton, writer of the book Madonna, the video is [...] "entirely consistent with the themes that she has been exploring for the last twenty years, namely the relationship between the sexes, the ambiguity of gender, and the unresolved conflict, for women in a patriarchal society of being fully female and sexual while exercising control over their lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was heavily {{criticized for being}} overly violent and graphic. Madonna's {{spokesperson}} {{said that there was}} a lot of violence because it tells the story of a woman who had probably been abused. Madonna also explained that her character was acting out a [...] "fantasy <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> that girls are not allowed to do." [...] The video was received only early hours play on MTV. However, it was not the first time that Madonna had a video rejected for heavy rotation by MTV, since in 1990, the channel refused to show [...] "Justify My Love" [...] because of its steamy images, and in 1992 MTV only showed [...] "Erotica" [...] late at night. The decision to ban the video was a source of argument, since it appeared to be no more violent than some television shows that aired at the time. Ironically, the video went into heavy rotation on Oh! Oxygen and was streamed on America Online frequently. It was also later played frequently on VH1 Madonna programs, but in an edited format. According to Eden Miller of PopMatters, the reason why the video was possibly banned from MTV was due to the scene where it featured Madonna pointing a gun towards the police, as MTV had previously banned videos that contained guns. Miller explained that [...] "while Madonna is one of MTV's darlings, she's still a woman, and the idea of a woman taking her aggressions out on men is something the network can just not have. That's what is so disturbing [...] And that really is what it feels like for a girl." [...] MSN listed the song on [...] "Madonna's Most Shocking Moments" [...] and said the song was supporting a [...] "pro-feminist image".|$|E

60|$|And, after all, {{will it be}} {{the worse}} for these women, or for the society in which they live, if they do {{interest}} themselves in politics? Might not (as Mr. Boyd Kinnear urges in an article as sober and rational as it is earnest and chivalrous) their purity and earnestness help to make {{what is now called}} politics somewhat more pure, somewhat more earnest?

Might not the intervention of a few women who are living according to the eternal laws of God, help to infuse some slightly stronger tincture of those eternal laws into our legislators and their legislation? What women have done for the social reforms of the last forty years is known, or ought to be known, to all. Might not they have done far more, and might not they do far more hereafter, if they, who generally know far more than men do of human suffering, and of the consequences of human folly, were able to ask for further social reforms, not merely as a boon to be begged from the physically stronger sex, but as their will, which they, as citizens, have a right to see fulfilled, if just and possible? Woman has played for too many centuries the part which Lady Godiva plays in the old legend.
