It involved a fake attack on the German radio station at Gleiwitz on 31 August 1939. Heydrich masterminded the plan and toured the site, which was about four miles from the Polish border.

Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E

5|$|In 572 the Byzantine ruler JustinII (reigned 565–578) {{refused to}} renew the annual {{payments}} to Sassanid Persia that {{had been part of}} the peace agreement concluded by his uncle, JustinianI (r. 527–565) and the Persian shah KhosrauI (r. 531–579) in 562. This marked the culmination of the progressive deterioration of Byzantine–Persian relations over the previous years, which manifested itself in diplomatic and military manoeuvring in their geopolitical periphery. Thus the Byzantines initiated contacts with the Central Asian Göktürks for a joint effort against Persia, while the Persians intervened in Yemen against the Christian Axumites, allies of Byzantium. Justin furthermore regarded the annual tribute as an indignity unworthy of Romans, and used the outbreak of a major revolt in Persian Armenia in 571–572 as <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> <b>for</b> refusing to continue the payments.|$|E

Sources disagree on the exact date of the meeting. According to Dasović, the meeting took place on 15 October, at approximately 9:00p.m., which he attended along with several other officials. Other sources, including the subsequent criminal inquiry and trial witnesses, indicated the meeting was held on 16 or 17 October. The courts processing the case, including the Supreme Court of Croatia, determined that the meeting took place on 17 October and that Orešković and Norac ordered those in attendance to execute civilians that had been arrested based on the prepared lists.
