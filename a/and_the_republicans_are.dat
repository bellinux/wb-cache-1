50|$|Under House rules, the Speaker {{schedules}} floor {{votes on}} pending legislation. The Hastert Rule {{says that the}} Speaker will not schedule a floor vote on any bill {{that does not have}} majority support within his or her party — even if the majority {{of the members of the}} House would vote to pass it. The rule keeps the minority party from passing bills with the assistance of a minority of majority party members. 218 votes are needed to pass a bill in the House; if the Democrats are the minority <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> the majority, the Hastert Rule would not allow 200 Democrats and 100 Republicans together to pass a bill, because 100 Republican votes is short of a majority of the majority party, so the Speaker would not allow a vote to take place.|$|E
50|$|This double victory, {{over both}} <b>the</b> Carlists Legitimists <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>was</b> a {{success for the}} regime.

The village of El Mazuco itself was then indefensible. To the south, Pico Turbina was almost taken, but the attack was driven back with hand-grenades, in confused fighting in dense fog.|$|R
60|$|The enemy {{were closing}} round them, but {{the capture of}} Pontorson {{deranged}} the plans of <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> <b>The</b> place had <b>been</b> held by four thousand men and ten pieces of cannon and, {{as it could be}} approached only by a narrow defile, it was believed that it would be impossible for the Vendeans to force their way into it.

50|$|In early 44 BC, Julius Caesar {{announced}} his intentions to invade Parthia and restore Roman {{power in the}} East. His reasons were to punish the Parthians for assisting Pompey in the recent civil war, to avenge Crassus' defeat at Carrhae, and especially to match the glory of Alexander the Great for himself. Before Caesar could launch his campaign, however, he was assassinated. As part of the compromise between Antony <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> to restore order following Caesar's murder, Publius Cornelius Dolabella was assigned the governorship of Syria and command over Caesar's planned Parthian campaign. The compromise did not hold, however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>were</b> forced to flee to <b>the</b> East. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> directed Quintus Labienus to attract the Parthians to their side in the resulting war against Antony <b>and</b> Octavian. After <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>were</b> defeated at <b>the</b> Battle of Philippi, Labienus joined the Parthians. Despite Rome's internal turmoil during the time, the Parthians did not immediately benefit from the power vacuum in the East due to Orodes II's reluctance despite Labienus' urgings to the contrary.|$|R
