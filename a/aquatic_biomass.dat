40|$|Low {{productivity}} in aquatic ecosystems {{is associated with}} reduced individual growth of fish and increased concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) in fish and their prey. However, many stream-dwelling fish species can use terrestrially-derived food resources, potentially subsidizing growth at low-productivity sites, and, because terrestrial resources have lower MeHg concentrations than aquatic resources, preventing an increase in diet-borne MeHg accumulation. We used a large-scale field study to evaluate relationships among terrestrial subsidy use, growth, and MeHg concentrations in two stream-dwelling fish species across an in-stream productivity gradient. We sampled young-of-the-year brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), potential competitors with similar foraging habits, from 20 study sites in streams in New Hampshire and Massachusetts that encompassed {{a wide range of}} <b>aquatic</b> prey <b>biomass.</b> Stable isotope analysis showed that brook trout used more terrestrial resources than Atlantic salmon. Over their first growing season, Atlantic salmon tended to grow larger than brook trout at sites with high <b>aquatic</b> prey <b>biomass,</b> but brook grew two-fold larger than Atlantic salmon at sites with low <b>aquatic</b> prey <b>biomass.</b> The MeHg concentrations of brook trout and Atlantic salmon were similar at sites with high <b>aquatic</b> prey <b>biomass</b> and the MeHg concentrations of both species increased at sites with low prey biomass and high MeHg in aquatic prey.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Riparian {{areas are}} eco-tones where aquatically- and terrestrially-derived insect biomass is {{exchanged}} between habitats, presenting consumers with {{new sources of}} energy, and resulting in a reciprocal subsidy. The relative contribution of energy exchange and the resulting impacts on vertebrate riparian consumers, such as fish or birds, remains poorly understood. We explored this reciprocal exchange within Honeygrove watershed [...] an alder dominated riparian system within the Oregon Coast Range. Diet samples were collected from birds and fish along with a suite of insect samples {{during the summer and}} fall of 2003 and spring 2004. We detected seasonal differences in the abundance and biomass of terrestrial and aquatic insects available to riparian consumers. Spring provided the most adult aquatic insect biomass, and biomass was similar in summer; the fall emergence was an order of magnitude less than the other seasons. Prey sources differed between salmonids. Salmonid diet varied in biomass consumption by season and prey type. Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kitsutch) on average, consumed more benthic <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomass</b> than adult aquatic insect biomass regardless of season. Despite the availability of externally derived prey, this species depended more on stream-derived resources in summer and fall but not during spring. In all sampling seasons, co-occurring cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), consumed more terrestrial invertebrate biomass than <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomass,</b> on average. Only in summer, cutthroat trout ate more adult aquatic than benthic <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomass.</b> In fall, their consumption of adult and benthic insect biomass was equal. During spring, cutthroat trout consumption, on average, consisted of more benthic <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomass</b> than adult <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomass.</b> Bird diet samples obtained from commonly encountered species such as Swainson’s thrush, Song Sparrow, and Pacificslope Flycatcher, showed more terrestrial derived than aquatic prey during the summer sampling season.

Contaminated water with methyl orange is taken as a sample for studying the effect of various experimental parameters such as contact time, temperature, the initial concentration of dye and the dose of adsorbent. Results. The results show that {{as the amount of}} adsorbent increases, the adsorption of methyl orange decreases while it increases with increasing the concentration of the initial dye. The adsorption kinetics follows the pseudo-second-order model (R 2 > 0. 99). The thermodynamic parameters were calculated. They proved that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic.

Although, this finding is widely accepted only little work has been carried out to investigate thermo-chemical conversion of algal specimen to produce biofuels, power and heat. This work aims at contributing fundamental knowledge for thermo-chemical processing of <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomass</b> via intermediate pyrolysis. Therefore, it was necessary to install and commission an analytical pyrolysis apparatus which facilitates intermediate pyrolysis process conditions as well as subsequent separation and detection of pyrolysates (Py- GC/MS). In addition, a methodology was established to analyse <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomass</b> under intermediate conditions by Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). Several microalgae (e. g. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris) and macroalgae specimen (e. g. Fucus vesiculosus) from main algal divisions and various natural habitats (fresh and saline water, temperate and polar climates) were chosen and their thermal degradation under intermediate pyrolysis conditions was studied. In addition, it was of interest to examine the contribution of biochemical constituents of algal biomass onto the chemical compounds contained in pyrolysates. Therefore, lipid and protein fractions were extracted from microalgae biomass and analysed separately. Furthermore, investigations of residual algal materials obtained by extraction of high valuable compounds (e. g. lipids, proteins, enzymes) were included to evaluate their potential for intermediate pyrolysis processing. On basis of these thermal degradation studies, possible applications of algal biomass and from there derived materials in the Bio-thermal Valorisation of Biomass-process (BtVB-process) are presented.

Variations of the major physical and chemical properties of the floodwater (temperature, pH, 02 concentration, N content [...] .) during the crop cycle are summarized. The section on photosynthetic <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomass</b> considers composition, nutrient contribution, and effects on N dynamics, namely : biological N 2 fixation, N immobilization, N recycling, N accumulation at the soil surface, N supply to rice crop, and N losses by NH 3 volatilization in relation to pH increase due to photosynthetic activity in the floodwater. The section on fauna emphasizes grazing and nutrient recycling by ostracods and snails, and the role of tubificid worms on floodwater ecology. The second part deals with the agronomic management of the floodwater ecosystem. It reviews cultural practices that take advantage of the agronomic potential of the floodwater ecosystem (decreasing losses due to NH 3 volatization, promoting photodependent BNF, recycling of nutrients), and the effects of crop intensification on floodwater ecology and possible related effects on soil fertility.

Three different rice seeding rates (100, 200 and 300 kg ha(- 1)) {{were used in the}} absence or presence of fish (Oreochromis niloticus (all male), Puntius gonionotus, and Cyprinus carpio). Significantly (P < 0. 05) higher paddy and fish yields were obtained at the lowest rice seeding rate. No significant effect of the rice seeding rate on <b>aquatic</b> weed <b>biomass</b> was found, whereas water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and pH were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher at 100 kg rice seed ha(- 1). The presence of fish resulted in a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction of <b>aquatic</b> weed <b>biomass,</b> and significantly (P < 0. 05) lower dissolved oxygen and PO 4 concentrations, and higher chlorophyll-a levels in the pond water. Analysis of the results indicated that the effect of rice seeding rate on fish production was most likely to be related to a 'growth effect' resulting from increased availability of oxygen and food. Paddy yields at high seeding densities were affected by mutual shading. A further reduction of rice seeding rate may be feasible for rice-fish farmers, given their limited possibilities for weed control through land preparation (field levelling) and water management.

However, traditional population control methods are frequently ineffective, unpopular with stakeholders, may affect non-target species, and can be both expensive and impractical to implement.

We used an individual-based model to predict the efficacy of a sacrificial feeding area in preventing grazing damage by mute swans (Cygnus olor) to adjacent river vegetation of high conservation and economic value. The accuracy of model predictions was assessed by a comparison with observed field data, whilst prediction robustness was evaluated using a sensitivity analysis.

Among these sources, biomasses originating from algae, seaweed or leaves receive lots of attention. However, when the yields and purities of protein extracted from these sources are compared to the corresponding data for protein crops such as soy, lupine and pulses, much lower yields are reported for alternative biomasses. Scope and approach In this overview paper, we analyse whether this difference is {{due to lack of}} scientific insight and technology or that more fundamental reasons are behind the variations in the extraction behaviour. For this purpose, we prepared a description of herbaceous and <b>aquatic</b> <b>biomasses</b> (denoted as green biomass/sources) and their protein extraction practices, final products, and common trends and challenges. The discussion continues with a general comparison to protein crops and the implications for future research. Key Findings and Conclusions Overviewing the state of the art, we tend to conclude that physiological and biochemical factors hinder efficient fractionation of green sources. Such factors include cell architecture and high interconnection between cell components; and biochemical differences, in particular the type of proteins present. These fundamental differences imply that green sources should be explored in a different manner, with higher emphasis on the interesting functional properties of enriched fractions and less on their purity. This approach is further encouraged by highlighting examples where the intricate structures found in green biomass can give rise to positive effects (e. g. health, food structure) when integrally applied in food products. <br/...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} focused at {{investigating}} {{the improvement of}} the heavy metal removal process produced by the aquatic plant, Lepironia articulata for the treatment of wastewater. The bio-sorption of chromium (Cr) by the aquatic plant, Lepironia articulata signifies one of the key alternatives for heavy metal removal. The application of Lepironia articulate as bio-absorber of heavy metal hasn’t been studied yet. The bio-sorption of chromium (Cr) by the aquatic plant, Lepironia articulata near to Taman Anggerik, Kedah, Malaysia, was examined in wastewater contaminated with 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg l - 1 of Cr. chromium concentrations were analysed in the wastewater regularly and in <b>aquatic</b> plant <b>biomass</b> after the experiments. The results revealed that maintaining pH at 6. 1 ± 0. 1, temperature at 22 ± 1 ºC and photoperiod at 12 h/j Lepironia articulata was capable of accumulating in its biomass 3, 15, 24 and 25 mg g - 1 DM, for the four preliminary Cr concentrations selected. At the selected Cr concentrations, the heavy metal removal ranged between 62. 45 – 72. 84...|$|R
