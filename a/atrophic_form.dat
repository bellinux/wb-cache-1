40|$|OBJECTIVE: Oral {{lichen planus}} (OLP) is chronic {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} oral mucosa, presenting in various clinical forms. The etiology of OLP is still unknown but mounting evidence points to the immunologic basis of this disorder. Aim: Our study was undertaken to quantify the salivary levels of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) in the reticular and the erosive/ <b>atrophic</b> <b>forms</b> of OLP, compared with age-matched healthy control volunteers. Subjects and methods: Whole saliva from 40 patients with active lesions of OLP, {{as well as from}} 20 healthy persons, was investigated for the presence of TNF-a by enzyme immunoassay. Results: Salivary TNF-a levels were significantlly increased in patients with OLP in comparison with healthy subjects. The presence of TNF-a showed positive correlation to clinical forms of OLP, being significantly higher in the erosive/atrophic type than in the reticular type of disease. Conclusion: Saliva provides an ideal medium for the detection of pro-inflammatory markers of the oral cavity. In patients with OLP, TNF-a levels in saliva are elevated, correlating with the severity of illness. Salivary TNF-a analysis may be a useful diagnostic tool and a potential prognostic marker in OLP.

40|$|AIM—A {{case-control study}} was {{initiated}} {{to determine the}} risk factors {{for the development of}} age related macular degeneration (AMD).  METHODS—Study participants, who were all white, aged 50 - 85 years, and were recruited from private ophthalmology practices. Each practitioner enrolled patients with bilateral AMD, who were then matched with controls for sex and age. Environmental factors and systemic and ocular histories were screened. All patients had bilateral red-free fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography. Photographs were classified into pigment epithelium alterations, drusen, geographic atrophy, and exudative AMD. Statistical analysis included the identification of risk factors for AMD. A multivariate analysis was performed {{at the end of the}} study. Analysis included the entire study population and was carried out for each stage of AMD.  RESULTS— 1844 controls were compared with 1844  patients with AMD. Mean age was 71  years for controls and 72  for cases. Logistic regression identified six major risk factors for AMD (whole population) : arterial hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 28), coronary disease (OR= 1. 31), hyperopia (OR= 1. 33), light coloured irises (OR= 1. 22), and lens opacities or previous cataract surgery (OR= 1. 55). The significance of vascular risk factors was increased for late stages of AMD, especially the <b>atrophic</b> <b>forms</b> (coronary disease, OR= 3. 19).  CONCLUSIONS—This large case-control study confirms some of the risk factors previously identified and may contribute to the determination of methods for prevention of AMD.    Keywords: age related macular degeneration; risk factors; case-control stud...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{associated}} with dementia, brain atrophy and the aggregation and accumulation of a cortical amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). Chronic bacterial infections are frequently associated with amyloid deposition. It had been known from a century that the spirochete Treponema pallidum can cause dementia in the <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> of general paresis. It is noteworthy that the pathological hallmarks of this <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> {{are similar to those}} of AD. Recent observations showed that bacteria, including spirochetes contain amyloidogenic proteins and also that Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation can be induced in or in vivo following exposure to bacteria or LPS. Bacteria or their poorly degradable debris are powerful inflammatory cytokine inducers, activate complement, affect vascular permeability, generate nitric oxide and free radicals, induce apoptosis and are amyloidogenic. All these processes are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Old and new observations, reviewed here, indicate that to consider the possibility that bacteria, including several types of spirochetes highly prevalent in the population at large or their persisting debris may initiate cascade of events leading to chronic inflammation and amyloid deposition in AD is important, as appropriate antibacterial and antiinflammatory therapy would be available to prevent dementia...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to analyse the possible malignant transformation of oral lichen planus to carcinoma, especially in the <b>atrophic</b> erosive <b>forms</b> and those displaying plaques involving {{the top of the}} tongue. A review has been made of the literature, from 1986 to the present day. This search outlines the relationship between oral lichen planus, hepatitis C virus infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection and the importance of periodic follow-up in all patients with oral lichen planus. The case is described of malignant transformation of oral lichen planus to oral cancer in a female presenting asymptomatic hepatitis C virus infection. The clinical history confirms the most important aspects of the relationship between oral lichen planus and oral cancer. Oral lichen planus should be considered as a precancerous lesion, particularly in patients presenting hepatitis C virus infection, requiring follow-up, at close intervals, starting from 3 months after diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{can be classified}} into two main categories: the <b>atrophic,</b> dry <b>form</b> and the exudative, wet form. The crucial difference between dry and wet AMD {{is the development of}} choroidal neovascularization in wet AMD. One fundamental cause of the neovascularization is the increased expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Progression of AMD is linked to augmentation of cellular stress, for example, oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress, inflammation and hypoxia. All these conditions can trigger stress in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which maintains protein quality control in cells. ER stress induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) via IRE 1 (inositol-requiring protein- 1), PERK (protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase) and ATF 6 (activating transcription factor- 6) transducers. UPR signaling is a double-edged sword, that is, it can restore cellular homeostasis as far as possible, but ultimately may lead to chronic, overwhelming stress that can cause apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, ER stress is a well-known inducer of angiogenesis in cancer. Moreover, stress conditions associated with the progress of AMD can induce the expression of VEGF. We discuss the role of ER stress in the regulation of neovascularization and the conversion of dry AMD to its wet, detrimental counterpart...|$|R

The evidence available {{is not enough}} to prove that the goitrous precedes the <b>atrophic</b> <b>form,</b> but immunogenetic analysis suggests that they may be distinct entities. The distribution of HLA class II alleles DRB 1 * and DQB 1 * was verified in patients from the region of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil with both forms of thyroiditis. Ninety-one patients with primary hypothyroidism through autoimmune thyroiditis were classified as goitrous - 54 patients, 42. 27 +/- 11. 72 years old, having had hypothyroidism for 8. 57 +/- 6. 63 years - or atrophic - 37 patients, 42. 72 +/- 12. 01 years old, hypothyroidism for 6. 73 +/- 4. 07 years. The distribution of class II alleles was determined, DRB 1 * and DQB 1 * were genotyped after purifying DNA blood samples using the DNAzol technique, and the low-resolution PCR-SSP system was utilized for determination of generic alleles. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were utilized to compare the distribution frequency of HLA alleles and the significant p-values were subjected to Bonferroni correction. We have demonstrated that the DRB 1 * 04 allele is associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, and that there are genotypic differences regarding the presentation forms with a strong association between DRB 1 * 04 and DQB 1 * 03 and the <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> only...|$|E

30|$|Oral {{lichen planus}} (OLP) is a chronic {{mucocutaneous}} disorder of unknown etiology with a reported prevalence of 1 to 2.0 % (average 1.27 %) {{in different countries}} and {{is more common in}} females aged 30 – 60  years with a 1.57 % frequency in women compared to 0.96 % in men (McCartan and Healy 2008; Gupta and Jawanda 2015). OLP can present itself in six clinical presentations, mainly the reticular, erosive, atrophic, plaque-like, papular, and bullous types (Canto et al. 2010). The erosive, <b>atrophic,</b> and bullous <b>forms</b> are symptomatic and necessitate treatment. However, despite numerous existing remedies, to date, no effective cure has been found, which is mainly attributed to the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease (Kaplan et al. 2012). Nevertheless, corticosteroids remain the primarily used medications for the treatment of symptomatic OLP. Among the topical corticosteroids, triamcinolone acetonide paste is the most widely used topical medication for OLP (Arunkumar et al. 2015). However, in many cases, the side effects of long-term treatment with corticosteroid are not tolerated by many patients, or patients are not comfortable with this kind of treatment and are unable to comply with it, requiring the search for alternative efficient therapy (Sousa and Rosa 2008).|$|R
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is the leading}} cause of blindness in developed countries. The etiology of AMD remains poorly understood and no treatment is currently available for the <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> of AMD. Atrophic AMD has been proposed to involve abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which lies beneath the photoreceptor cells and normally provides critical metabolic support to these light-sensing cells. Cumulative oxidative stress and local inflammation are thought to represent pathological processes involved in the etiology of atrophic AMD. Studies of tissue culture and animal models reveal that oxidative stress-induced injury to the RPE results in a chronic inflammatory response, drusen formation, and RPE atrophy. RPE degeneration in turn causes a progressive degeneration of photoreceptors, leading to the irreversible loss of vision. This review describes some of the potential major molecular and cellular events contributing to RPE death and inflammatory responses.

The magnitude of this issue is becoming more evident with an aging population and an increasing number of older individuals. Objective: The objective of this article was to review the clinical and pathological aspects of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diagnostic tools, and therapeutic modalities presently available or underway for both <b>atrophic</b> and wet <b>forms</b> of the disease. Methods: An online review of the PubMed database was performed, searching for the key words. The search was limited to articles published since 1980 to date. Results: Several risk factors have been linked to AMD, such as age (> 60  years), lifestyle (smoking and diet), and family history. Although the pathogenesis of AMD remains unclear, genetic factors have been implicated in the condition. Treatment for atrophic AMD is mainly close observation, coupled with nutritional supplements such as zinc and antioxidants, whereas treatment of wet AMD is based on targeting choroidal neovascular membranes. Conclusion: Identification of modifiable risk factors would improve the possibilities of preventing the progression of AMD.

40|$|Purpose. “En face” is an {{emerging}} imaging technique derived from spectral domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). It produces frontal sections of retinal layers, also called “C-scan OCT. ” Outer retinal tubulations (ORTs) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are a recent finding evidenced by spectral-domain OCT. The {{aim of this study}} is to characterize the morphology of ORT according to the form of AMD, using “en-face” spectral domain OCT. Methods. “En face” OCT imaging was prospectively performed in 26 consecutive eyes with AMD that also had ORT. Results. There were 15 neovascular, 8 atrophic, and 3 eyes with a mixed (fibrotic and <b>atrophic)</b> <b>form</b> of AMD. Among the neovascular group, the most frequent tubulation pattern on “en-face” OCT was a branching network emanating from a fibrovascular scar; we term this pattern as “pseudodendritic. ” It did not require treatment when observed as an isolated finding. In all cases of atrophic AMD, the tubular network was located at the edge of the geographic atrophy area, and formed a “perilesional” pattern. Six atrophic cases showed tubular invaginations inside this area. Conclusion. “En face” OCT is a valuable technique in the diagnosis and followup of macular disease.

Senile-plaque-like beta amyloid (Aβ) deposits are also observed in mice following inhalation of C. pneumoniae in vivo, and Aβ accumulation and phosphorylation of tau is induced in neurons by HSV- 1 in vitro and in vivo. Specific bacterial ligands, and bacterial and viral DNA and RNA all increase the expression of proinflammatory molecules, which activates the innate and adaptive immune systems.

Early detection and precise monitoring of progression of ARM are main goals of current research due to lack of sufficient treatment options, especially in the dry, <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> of this disease. We applied the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) that can detect any local functional deficit objectively in the central retina. We recorded two paradigms in early ARM patients, the fast flicker and the slow flash paradigm which both represent fast adaptation processes of the proximal retina but under differing photopic conditions and stimulation rates. By subtracting the waveform responses we extracted a late component in the difference waveform that was significantly reduced in the early ARM group compared to a healthy control group (p < or = 0. 05). We propose that this multifocal nonlinear analysis permits the detection of adaptative deficits and provides topographic mapping of retinal dysfunction in early ARM. The difference waveform component we extracted with this novel approach might indicate early functional loss in ARM caused by ischemia in postreceptoral layers such as bipolar cells and inner plexiform regions...|$|E
40|$|Arthritis deformans in its <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> (rheumatoid arthritis) is, perhaps, best {{defined as}} a chronic disease {{affecting}} many joints, principally the smaller ones. It occurs chiefly in the female sex, is due probably to the action of a toxin, and is characterised by changes in the cartilages and the soft structures surrounding the joints, thus causing great immobility and deformity. That arthritis is a disease of great antiquity is {{borne out by the}} fact that recently-unearthed bones from tombs of about 3700 - 1300 B. C. showed unmistakable evidence of the affection. In exarnination of remains in Egypt, remains representative of all periods from early predynastic times dovm to the Fifth Dynasty after Christ, "the disease which showed itself with by far the greatest frequency in the bodies of all periods is rheumatoid arthritis". Virchow has left records describing the affection in bones unearthed from Pompeii. From these remote times onwards through the Middle Ages to the present day, an almost continuous series of historical records testifies that the disease has always been with us, and also that its clinical characters have remained unaltered through all the ages. The aetiology and pathology of the disease have, however, been so shrouded in darkness that we find the various writers, in their information on the subject, making indiscriminate use of the terms rheumatism, gout and arthritis to designate this affection...|$|E
40|$|Following {{previous}} observations {{a statistically}} significant association between various types of spirochetes and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) fulfilled Hill’s criteria {{in favor of a}} causal relationship. If spirochetal infections can indeed cause AD, the pathological and biological hallmarks of AD should also occur in syphilitic dementia. To answer this question, observations and illustrations on the detection of spirochetes in the <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> of general paresis, which is known to be associated with slowly progressive dementia, were reviewed and compared with the characteristic pathology of AD. Historic observations and illustrations published {{in the first half of}} the 20 th Century indeed confirm that the pathological hallmarks, which define AD, are also present in syphilitic dementia. Cortical spirochetal colonies are made up by innumerable tightly spiraled Treponema pallidum spirochetes, which are morphologically indistinguishable from senile plaques, using conventional light microscopy. Local brain amyloidosis also occurs in general paresis and, as in AD, corresponds to amyloid beta. These historic observations enable us to conclude that chronic spirochetal infections can cause dementia and reproduce the defining hallmarks of AD. They represent further evidence in support a causal relationship between various spirochetal infections and AD. They also indicate that local invasion of the brain by these helically shaped bacteria reproduce the filamentous pathology characteristic of AD. Chronic infection by spirochetes, and co-infection with other bacteria and viruses should be included in our current view on the etiology of AD. Prompt action is needed as AD might be prevented...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{whether or not}} brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc- 99 m MIBI or Tc- 99 m ECD (ethyl cysteinate dimer) can detect any abnormality in patients with definite multiple sclerosis (MS). We then compared these values {{with the results of}} T 1, T 2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods: A total of 16 patients with proved MS were enrolled in the study, and the MRI with and without gadolinium contrast and also brain SPECT with Tc- 99 m MIBI (8 cases) or Tc- 99 m ECD (8 other cases) were performed. Results: MRI studies was performed in 16 patients (13 women and 3 men, aged 16 - 38 years) and an average of 10. 47, 3. 7, 5. 3, 1. 7, and 0. 9 lesions was found in respect in periventricular white matter, juxtacortical white matter, corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles, and brainstem, whereas brain SPECT with Tc- 99 m MIBI or Tc- 99 m ECD detected no abnormality. In addition, 6 cases had some degree of contrast enhancement. Conclusions: It seems that brain SPECT with Tc- 99 m MIBI or Tc- 99 m ECD would not improve this insufficiency. The small sizes of some plaques, particularly in chronic <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> of lesions, and the possibility of deeper anatomic positions of plaques can explain to some extent why the MS lesions were impossible to delineate on brain scan, although additional studies are needed.

40|$|Immunohistochemical {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that cystatin C (CysC) co-localizes with amyloid-b (Ab) in amyloid-laden vascular walls and in the senile plaque cores of amyloid. In vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest that CysC protects against neurodegeneration by inhibition of cysteine proteases, inhibition of Ab aggregation, induction of autophagy and induction of cell division. CysC levels may be altered and may have a potential link with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab levels in various types of dementia with characteristic amyloid deposits, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and the <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> of general paresis (AF-GP). We assessed the serum and CSF levels of CysC and the CSF levels of Ab 40 and Ab 42 in patients with AD (n = 51), DLB (n = 26) and AF-GP (n = 43) and normal controls (n = 30). Using these samples, we explored the correlation between CSF CysC and CSF Ab levels. We found that {{in comparison to the}} normal control group, both CSF CysC and CSF Ab 42 levels were significantly lower in all three dementia groups (all p, 0. 001); serum CysC levels were the same in the AD and DLB groups, and were lower in the AF-GP group (p = 0. 008). The CSF CysC levels were positively correlated with both the CSF Ab 40 and Ab 42 levels in the AD, AF-GP and normal control groups (r = 0. 306, 0. 657, all p, 0. 05). Lower CSF CysC levels might be a common feature in dementia with characteristi...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} on seven patients affected by the <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> of age-related macular degeneration (AF-ARMD). The patients under investigation belonged to a larger study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of rheopheresis treatment (RT) on the visual function of AF-ARMD patients. Following the protocol of the larger study, patients received RT twice a week, every two weeks, {{for a total of}} ten treatments, as well as high-dose supplementation with zinc and vitamins A, E and beta-carotene. Recruited patients underwent skin laser Doppler flowmetry coupled with skin iontophoresis of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) and a test of skin post-ischemic reactive hyperemia, before and after the first RT (time 1 : all seven patients) and the fifth RT (time 2 : six patients). A significantly higher absolute (anova for repeated measures) and relative (percentage change from the baseline) skin blood flux response (SBFR) to ACh iontophoresis was observed after RT, compared to before RT at time 1 (679 +/- 43 % and 436 +/- 78 %, respectively; P < 0. 05), as well as before RT at time 2 compared to before RT at time 1 (683 +/- 74 % and 436 +/- 78 %, respectively; P < 0. 05). Absolute and relative SBFR to ischemia did not differ either after RT compared to before RT at time 1, or before RT at time 2 compared to before RT at time 1. These findings are consistent with an acute and subacute beneficial effect of RT on skin microvascular endothelial function in the studied AF-ARMD patients...|$|E
40|$|A 47 -year-old {{man with}} a 25 -year history ofsmall plaque {{psoriasis}} treated withbetamethasone dipropionate cream pre-sented with well-demarcated areas of skin atrophy, confined to his back (Figure 1). The atrophic areas were mildly erythematous and showed slight scal-ing (Figure 2). Skin scrapings from these areas were examined microscopically using 15 % potas-sium hydroxide with Parker blue–black ink. Thick fungal hyphae and grape-like bunches of spores were seen, consistent with Malassezia yeast. Although pityriasis (tinea) versicolor is com-mon, the <b>atrophic</b> <b>form</b> is unusual, with the first case reported in 1971. 1 The atrophy {{is limited to the}} area affected by the pityriasis versicolor. Case reports have suggested an association with the use of topical corticosteroids. The fungus, which is confined to the stratum corneum and follicles, is thought to disrupt the skin barrier, allowing better absorption of the steroid, which induces atrophy. Corticosteroid-induced atrophy is usually associ-ated with epidermal atrophy and telangiectasis. Our patient did not have this feature. In a case series involving 12 patients with atrophying pityriasis versicolor, long-term topical corticosteroid use was reported for only one patient. 2 In these cases, the atrophy was thought to have been induced directly by Malassezia yeast, which produce diffusible products that enhance dermal elastolysis, possibly by activating tissue histiocytes. Degeneration of elastic fibres has been noted on skin biopsies. 3 Following treatment of Malassezia, the atrophy usually resolves. Our patient had a complete recovery following treatment with systemic ketoconazole. The presence of fine scaling overlying the atro-phy allows clinicians to distinguish this form of cutaneous atrophy from other causes of skin atro-phy, especially anetoderma. Examination using potassium hydroxide confirms the diagnosis...|$|E
