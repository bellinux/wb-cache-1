40|$|Thermodynamic {{study of}} {{incubated}} eggs {{is an important}} component in the optimisation of incubation processes. However, research on the interaction of heat and moisture transfer mechanisms in eggs is rather limited and does not focus on the hatching stage of incubation. During hatch, both the recently hatched chick and the broken eggshell add extra heat and moisture contents to the hatcher environment. In this study, we have proposed a novel way to estimate thermodynamically the amount of water evaporated from a broken eggshell during hatch. The hypothesis of this study considers that previously reported drops in eggshell temperature during hatching of chicks is the result remaining water content evaporating from the eggshell, released on the inner membrane by the recently hatched wet chick, just before hatch. To reproduce this process, water was sprayed on eggshells to mimic the water-fluid from the wet body of a chick. For each sample of eggshell, the shell geometry and weight, surface area and eggshell temperature were measured. Water evaporation losses and convection coefficient were calculated using a novel model approach considering the simultaneous heat and mass transfer profiles in an eggshell. The calculated average convective coefficient was 23. 9 ± 7. 5 W/m(2) °C, similar to previously reported coefficients in literature as a function of 0. 5 - 1 m/s <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> Comparison between measured and calculated values for the water evaporation showed 68 % probability accuracy, associated to the use of an experimentally derived single heat transfer coefficient. The results support our proposed modelling approach of heat and mass transfer mechanisms.

40|$|Aerodynamics {{results in}} two {{characteristic}} speeds of flying birds: the minimum power speed and the maximum <b>range</b> <b>speed.</b> The minimum power speed requires the lowest rate of energy expenditure per unit time to stay airborne and the maximum <b>range</b> <b>speed</b> maximizes <b>air</b> distance traveled {{per unit of}} energy consumed. Therefore, if birds aim to minimize the cost of transport under a range of wind conditions, they are predicted to fly at the maximum <b>range</b> <b>speed.</b> Furthermore, take-off is predicted to be strongly affected by wind speed and direction. To investigate the effect of wind conditions on take-off and cruising flight behavior, we equipped 14 European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis with a back-mounted GPS logger to measure position and hence ground speed, and a neck-mounted accelerometer to record wing beat frequency and strength. Local wind conditions were recorded during the deployment period.
