The NFIP Regulations and Building Codes require that any residential building constructed in Flood Zone Type A have the lowest floor, including basements, elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE). Enclosed areas are permitted under elevated buildings provided that they meet certain use restrictions and construction requirements such as the installation of flood vents to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. This wet floodproofing technique is required for residential buildings.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 251) This thesis examines {{a unique}} method for the <b>automatic</b> frequency <b>equalization</b> {{of a music}} system in typical automobile environments. Both the need for frequency equalization {{and some of the}} considerations that {{must be taken into account}} in order to achieve this equalization are discussed. The particular method developed for achieving this equalization combines test signal generation, adaptive digital and analog filtering, and power spectrum estimation. This new method is called 'adaptive signal generation and filtering' (ASGF). The system designed to implement ASGF is called the 'automatic frequency equalizer??? (AFE). Background theory of ASGF and the system design of the AFE for ASGF implementation are examined in detail. Although an actual AFE was not built, a computer simulation of the AFE was created in order to show that ASGF is a valid method for <b>automatic</b> frequency <b>equalization</b> in automobile environments. Simulation runs were made on both ideal data and real data collected from three different types of cars. These simulation runs are discussed in detail and do establish the viability of the ASGF approach. Finally, the thesis concludes with a discussion of possible improvements that could be made to both the ASGF approach and its AFE implementation...|$|R

Therefore, the long-term average spectrum (LTAS) was analyzed for a large dataset of popular music. The mean LTAS was computed, visualized, and then approximated with two quadratic fittings. The fittings were subsequently used to derive the spectrum slope. By applying harmonic/percussive source sepa- ration, the relationship between LTAS and percussive prominence was investigated. A clear relationship was found; tracks with more percussion have a relatively higher LTAS in the bass and high frequencies.

40|$|Color {{equalization}} algorithms {{exhibit a}} variety of behaviors described in two differing types of models: Gray World and White Patch. These two models are considered alternatives {{to each other in}} methods of color correction. They are the basis for two human visual adaptation mechanisms: Lightness Constancy and Color Constancy. The Gray World approach is typical of the Lightness Constancy adaptation because it centers the histogram dynamic, working {{the same way as the}} exposure control on a camera. Alternatively, the White Patch approach is typical of the Color Constancy adaptation, searching for the lightest patch to use as a white reference similar to how the human visual system does. The Retinex algorithm basically belongs to the White Patch family due to its reset mechanism. Searching for a way to merge these two approaches, we have developed a new chromatic correction algorithm, called <b>Automatic</b> Color <b>Equalization</b> (ACE), which is able to perform Color Constancy even if based on Gray World approach. It maintains the main Retinex idea that the color sensation derives from the comparison of the spectral lightness values across the image. We tested different performance measures on ACE, Retinex and other equalization algorithms. The results of this comparison are presented...|$|R

The emitter base junction of a bipolar transistor is covered with an SiO₂ layer and a voltage is applied to this point. With zero volts applied, the unit acts as a bipolar transistor. Increasing the voltage at this point increases the emitter injection efficiency of the bipolar transistor, which in turn increases the current gain of the device. An SiO₂ layer with no leakage paths can retain the charge applied to it for long periods of time; thus the gain will remain at this level as long as the charge remains on the oxide layer. A large number of such devices can be fabricated on a single chip.

In the last two decades, various underwater devices were developed for detecting the mines and mine-like objects in the deep-sea environment. However, there are some problems in recent equipment, like poor accuracy of mineral objects detection, without real-time processing, and low resolution of underwater video frames. Consequently, the underwater objects recognition is a difficult task, because the physical properties of the medium, the captured video frames, are distorted seriously. In this paper, we are considering use of the modern image processing methods to determine the mineral location and to recognize the mineral actually within a little computation complex. We firstly analyze the recent underwater imaging models and propose a novel underwater optical imaging model, which is {{much closer to the}} light propagation model in the underwater environment.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1966 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{hardware}} and theory of a multi-threshold bit decision technique called Quarternary Decision Logic are described. Quartenary Bit Decision Logic results in two simultaneous decisions on each received {{bit of a}} binary digital transmission: (1) a binary status decision; and, (2) a reliability decision which reflects on the presence/absence of multilation in the bit. Both decisions {{are based on a}} Shannon Integration of the received information over the whole bit interval. The ability to assess bit mutilation is then used to develop adjustable security-enforcing restraints on error correction and the receiving process itself. These restraints are developed by a Word Security Logic which keeps a "mutilation count" on each received word, The "mutilation count" per word results in a "Correction Permit/Inhibit" and a "Receiving Permit/Inhibit" output on each word. The "Correction Permit/ Inhibit" output bars error correction when the risk of a spurious correction is high. The "Receiving Permit/Inhibit” output blocks receiving when the risk of a direct evasion of security is high. The improvement in bit decision security and the improvements in security against spurious correction and direct evasions of Error detection are evaluated quantitatively in comparison to conventional single-threshold techniques, These improvements enable secure operation with lower redundancy coding systems because of the information gain which Quarternary Decision Logic provides. The possible contributions of Quarternary Decision Logic to self-adaptive data transmission systems and to <b>automatic</b> line <b>equalization</b> are explored in the section entitled "Conclusions"...|$|R

The {{aim is to}} achieve a ﬂat frequency response and delay adjustment between different physically-placed speakers at the measuring point, which is nowadays usually made manually by the sound technician.

The automation is in the calculation of different parameter sets: estimation of the time delay, {{the selection of a}} suitable crossover frequency, and calculation of the gains for a third-octave graphic equalizer. These automatic methods reduce time and effort in the calibration of line-array PA systems, since only three sine sweeps must be played though the sound system.

A perceptual approach for interfaces assessment Software requires a good interface, {{not only in terms of}} spatial distribution of commands or function readability and grouping, but also in terms of color and text visual appearance. In this {{paper we propose}} the use of an algorithm designed for digital image enhancement as visual interfaces automatic valuator.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{professional}} movie field, image quality is mainly judged visually. In fact, experts and technicians judge {{and determine the}} quality of the film images during the calibration (post production) process. As a consequence, the quality of a restored movie is also estimated subjectively by experts [26, 27]. On the other hand, objective quality metrics do not necessarily correlate well with perceived quality [28]. Moreover, some measures assume that there exists a reference {{in the form of an}} "original" to compare to, which prevents their use in digital restoration field, where often there is no reference to compare to. That is why subjective evaluation is the most used and most efficient approach up to now. But subjective assessment is expensive, time consuming and does not respond, hence, to the economic requirements of the field [29, 25]. Thus, reliable automatic methods for visual quality assessment are needed in the field of digital film restoration. Ideally, a quality assessment system would perceive and measure image or video impairments just like a human being. The ACE method, for <b>Automatic</b> Color <b>Equalization</b> [1, 2], is an algorithm for digital images unsupervised enhancement. Like our vision system ACE is able to adapt to widely varying lighting conditions, and to extract visual information from the environment efficaciously. We present in this paper is the use of ACE as a basis of a reference free image quality metric. ACE output is an estimate of our visual perception of a scene. The assumption, tested in other papers [3, 4], is that ACE enhancing images is in the way our vision system will perceive them, increases their overall perceived quality. The basic idea proposed in this paper, is that ACE output can differ from the input more or less according to the visual quality of the input image In other word, an image appears good if it is near to the visual appearance we (estimate to) have of it. Reversely bad quality images will need "more filtering". Test and results are presented...|$|R
30|$|With various {{application}} {{scenarios of}} color correction, many scholars have proposed novel methods for color correction. Luz et al. propose a method based on Markov Random Field (MRF) {{which is used}} to represent the relationship between color depleted and color image to enhances the color of the image for the application of underwater image [36]. The parameters of the MRF model are learned from the training data and then the most likely color distribution for each pixel in the given color-depleted image is inferred by using belief propagation (BP). This allows the system to adapt the color restoration algorithm to the current environmental conditions and also to the task requirements. Colin et al. propose a method for correcting the color of multiview video sets as a preprocessing step to compression [37]. Distinguished from a previous work, where one of the captured views is used as the color reference, they correct all views to match the average color of the set of views. Block-based disparity estimation is used to find matching points between all views in the video set, and the average color is calculated for these matching points. A least-squares regression is performed for each view to find a function that will make the view most closely match the average color. Rizzi et al. propose a new algorithm for digital images unsupervised enhancement with simultaneous global and local effects, called ACE for <b>Automatic</b> Color <b>Equalization</b> [38]. It is based on a computational model of the human visual system that merges the two basic “Gray World” and “White Patch” global equalization mechanisms. Similar with the human visual system, ACE adapts {{to a wide range of}} lighting conditions and effectively extracts visual information from the environment. It has shown promising results in achieving different equalization tasks, e.g., performing color and lightness constancy, realizing image dynamic data driven stretching, and controlling the contrast. Yoon et al. use the temporal difference ratio of HSV color channels to compensate of color distortion between consecutive frames [39]. Experimental results show that the proposed method can be applied to consumer video surveillance systems for removing atmospheric artifacts without color distortion.|$|R
