5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E

Polychaetes and amphipods served as better indicators of <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of tuna farming compared with molluscs and decapods. Lower number and Shannon–Wiener diversity of polychaete and amphipod taxa were recorded over time <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacted</b> plots compared with the control plots, while the polychaete/amphipod index indicated that the Ecological Quality Status <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacted</b> plots changed from “Poor”/”Moderate” to “Good” during the study period. Results of the multivariate analyses indicated significantly higher dispersion of samples of the polychaete and amphipod assemblages over time <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacted</b> plots compared with the control plots, indicative of stressed assemblages. Differences in the macroinvertebrate assemblages between impacted and control plots were consistent across faunal groups except for molluscs, which showed no response. Results must be interpreted with caution due to the high spatiotemporal variation in the influence of tuna farming on the macroinvertebrate assemblages, which highlights the importance of including multiple impacted and reference areas, as well as replicate sampling times, in assessing <b>the</b> environmental <b>impact</b> of tuna farms.

5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> the cemetery scheme {{would have on}} the normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E

A health impact assessment, including a baseline health survey, was commissioned by the Addax Bioenergy Sierra Leone project in 2010. As part of the monitoring, a follow-up survey was conducted three years later. A set of health indicators was assessed at six impacted and two control sites. Most of these indices improved, particularly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacted</b> sites. <b>The</b> prevalences of stunting, wasting, and Plasmodium falciparum in children under five years of age decreased significantly at impacted sites (all p < 0. 05) and non-significantly at control sites.

25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the formation of and widespread distribution of tektites requires the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism {{for the formation of}} tektites is by the jetting of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a hypervelocity impact, have been used to explain the formation of tektites. Any mechanism by which tektites are created must explain chemical data that suggest that parent material from which tektites were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified Impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required in order for tektites to be created by a meteorite impact.|$|E

25|$|However {{in spite}} of public outrage the Spanish {{government}} has {{made no attempt to}} reform policing and police mistreatment of the public. On the contrary, in July 2016 new reforms to the law on Public Security and the Criminal Code came into force which limit the right to freedom of assembly and give police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a 'lack of respect' towards them. The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability. Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to €600 euros, and as much as €30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers. Amnesty International identifies three main areas of concern about police action during demonstrations and assemblies: excessive use of force and inappropriate use of riot equipment, excessive use of force when arresting demonstrators, and ill-treatment of detainees in police custody.|$|E

The following week, Jarrett started showing signs of a heel turn as he threatened Hogan with legal actions; however, on the January 28 episode of Impact!, he changed his mind and agreed to fight for his spot. In the main event of the show, he came out to no entrance music or pyrotechnics and was defeated by Mr. Anderson after a low blow. This started an angle of Hogan's business partner Eric Bischoff, acting on his own without Hogan, having Jarrett work humiliating jobs backstage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Impact!</b> Zone, such as flipping burgers and cleaning restrooms, while also booking him in unfavorable matches, such as surprise Falls Count Anywhere and handicap matches.|$|E

500|$|In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a geology {{professor}} from the University of Missouri, completed {{an analysis of}} sediment below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory.

The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact. Multiple-impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as [...] "rather hyper-inflated" [...] and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf.

Sea urchin density, test size-structure and biomass, and the percent cover of barrens were evaluated at four locations (5 - 6 km apart from each other), two heavily <b>impacted</b> by <b>the</b> date-mussel fishery and two controls. Sea urchin density and barren habitat cover were assessed at two and three sites (100 - 300 m apart), respectively, within each location. Sea urchin biomass was evaluated only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scale of locations. Average density of P. lividus did not significantly change between impacted locations and controls, whereas A. lixula showed a greater density <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacted</b> locations. Distribution patterns of A. lixula, in addition, differed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spatial scale of a few metres between impacted locations and controls, being generally more aggregated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> controls. The size-frequency distribution (test diameter) of P. lividus showed a mode at 3 - 4 cm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacted</b> locations compared to a mode at 2 - 3 cm in the controls. The size-frequency of A. lixula was bimodal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> damaged locations (with modes at 1 - 2 and 4 - 5 cm, respectively) and unimodal (with <b>the</b> mode <b>at</b> 4 - 5 cm) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> controls. Average biomass of both sea urchins (P. lividus and A. lixula) was two- to fourfold greater <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacted</b> locations (similar to 600 g wet wt m(- 2)) than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> controls (150 - 250 g wet wt m(- 2)).
