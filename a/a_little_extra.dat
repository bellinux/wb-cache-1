Inexpensive places in dormitories are available from Studentenwerk, a statutory non-profit organization for student affairs. However, there are only enough places for a fraction of students. Studentenwerk also runs canteens and cafés on campus, which are similarly affordable. Other common housing options include renting a private room or apartment as well as living together with one or more roommates to form a Wohngemeinschaft (often abbreviated WG).

25|$|To make <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>extra</b> money {{beyond what}} his pension and {{scripting}} earnings brought in, Barks started doing oil paintings {{to sell at}} the local art shows where he and Garé exhibited. Subjects included humorous depictions {{of life on the}} farm and portraits of Native American princesses. These skillfully rendered paintings encouraged fan Glenn Bray to ask Barks if he could commission a painting of the ducks ("A Tall Ship and a Star to Steer Her By", taken from the cover of Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #108 by Barks). This prompted Barks to contact George Sherman at Disney's Publications Department to request permission to produce and sell oil paintings of scenes from his stories. In July 1971 Barks was granted a royalty-free license by Disney. When word spread that Barks was taking commissions from those interested in purchasing an oil of the ducks, much to his astonishment the response quickly outstripped what he reasonably could produce in the next few years.|$|E

[...] Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters has hence been labeled as a cult film by a number of horror-fantasy film fans, as well as by some critics who initially saw no merit in the movie. This significant financial and fan following have led some to question the initial perception of the film in relation to its debut in January, considered to be [...] "a refuge for films that don't have a shot of generating good word of mouth or having a leggy run." [...] While Renner's box office draw and the film's [...] "well-articulated premise" [...] have been listed as major factors behind its [...] theatrical success, its ability to maintain a lasting fan following has also been attributed to its original concept, excellent gore and action sequences, Renner's and Arterton's tongue-in-cheek performances, and the film's ability to not take itself too seriously. The film was nominated for the 40th People's Choice Awards in the category Favorite Horror Movie, but lost to Carrie.|$|E
