5|$|According to Mifune, in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi, after {{defeating}} three adversaries in succession, but in {{a following}} tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries {{in a row and}} was awarded the rank of 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often misunderstood <b>and</b> <b>frightened</b> many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E

5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, <b>and</b> <b>frightened</b> – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E

There he defeated King Porus in the Battle of the Hydaspes (near modern-day Jhelum, Pakistan) and conquered much of the Punjab. Alexander's march east put him in confrontation with the Nanda Empire of Magadha and the Gangaridai of Bengal. His army, exhausted <b>and</b> <b>frightened</b> {{by the prospect of}} facing larger Indian armies at the Ganges River, mutinied at the Hyphasis (modern Beas River) and refused to march further East.
