50|$|There are {{numerous}} requirements that exist for an equitable assignment of property, outside the 'standard' clear and unconditional intention to assign. These requirements are fundamental {{characteristics of a}} statutory assignment: <b>Absolute</b> <b>assignment</b> (an unconditional transfer: conditions precedent or part of a debt are not absolute) and the assignment must {{be made in writing}} and signed by the assignor, and in particular, this applies to real property.|$|E
50|$|Assigning future {{property}} in equity cannot be gratuitous. The assignor must receive {{consideration for the}} agreement, otherwise the assignment will be ineffective. However, an <b>absolute</b> <b>assignment</b> does not require consideration to be given. Secondly, between the period of agreement between assignor and assignee and acquisition by the assignor, the assignees rights are not contractual, but rather a proprietary right to the property. This means the assignee {{has an interest in}} this {{future property}}, in the same manner any owner has over property.|$|E
50|$|The {{consequence}} was that, {{with these}} and certain statutory exceptions (e.g., actions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned {{chose in action}} must have been brought at law {{in the name of}} the assignor, though the sum recovered belonged in equity to the assignee. All choses in action being in equity assignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, in equity the assignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-plaintiff or as defendant. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between legal and equitable choses in action of no importance. The Judicature Act of 1873, s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal chose in action could be passed by <b>absolute</b> <b>assignment</b> in writing under the hand of the assignor.

For example, the conformationally restricted, cyclic disulfide-containing enkephalin analogue (D-Pen², D-Pen⁵) enkephalin (DPDPE) was modified by addition of a methyl group at either the pro R or pro S position of the beta carbon of the phenylalanine- 4 residue and by addition of a nitro group in the para position of the phenylalanine- 4 position. Other modifications at the Phe⁴ position included methyl substitution on the aromatic ring and dehydration of the C(α) -Cᵦ bond.

40|$|A general method {{based solely}} on mass spectrometric {{techniques}} for the <b>absolute</b> configuration <b>assignment</b> of ortho, meta, or para isomers of acyl nitrobenzenes and derivatives is described. Instead of comparing the mass spectra of the three intact molecules of each positional isomer and investigating {{each one of the}} many sets of positional isomers, the method generalizes the effort by performing structural analysis on configurationally diagnostic fragment ions that are common for a given class of compounds. These ions must therefore retain the positional information of the parent molecules and be unequivocally distinguished. Nitrobenzoyl cations are common and stable fragment ions of most acyl nitrobenzenes and derivatives retaining the respective ortho, meta, or para configuration of the precursor molecules. The different NO 2 and CO+ ring alignments profoundly influence their collision-induced dissociation and bimolecular reactivity, and the isomeric 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -nitrobenzoyl cations are found to be unequivocally distinguished using both approaches. Absolute ortho, meta, or para positional assignment by tandem MS of every isomeric molecule of the acyl nitrobenzene class and derivatives forming detectable amounts of any of those diagnostic nitrobenzoyl cations is, therefore, possible. The ability to perform <b>absolute</b> (non-comparative) configuration <b>assignment</b> using such diagnostic ions is exemplified for a single test molecule of (2 R) -(−) - 2 -methylglycidyl 4 -nitrobenzoate.
