In 2010 he rebuffed a query about his interest in sculpting a memorial to Bill McLaren, a rugby union broadcaster: [...] "I do not do sportsmen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not do sports commentators. I do artists, philosophers and poets", he said, [...] warning that memorials are often hastily erected. Advocates of the memorial described the remarks as insensitive, and said that [...] "To have Bill {{looking down on the}} fans at Murrayfield, microphone in hand, would bring a huge smile to so many faces." ...|$|E

6000|$|... '"You {{have the}} {{advantage}} then, Mademoiselle. I am a newcomer here. I never have seen you before to my knowledge; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not, could not, hate you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I don't {{care what}} a person's {{politics}} are!" [...] exclaimed Lady Firebrace {{with an air}} of affectionate devotion. [...] "I should be very glad indeed to see you one of us. You know your father was! But if any one is my friend I never will hear him attacked behind his back without fighting his battles; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> fight yours last night." ...|$|R
60|$|And for a {{year and}} a half on end I never took a drink, nor thought of taking a drink. I hadn't the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not have the inclination. Between my janitor-work, my studies, and {{innocent}} amusements such as chess, I hadn't a moment to spare. I was discovering a new world, and such was the passion of my exploration that the old world of John Barleycorn held no inducements for me.|$|R
60|$|His manner {{was usually}} odd it is true, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not pay much {{attention}} to it; but that sort of obscure intention, which seemed to lurk in his nonchalance like a wary old carp in a pond, had never before come so near the surface. He had distinctly aroused my expectations. I would have been unable to say what it was I expected, but at all events I did not expect the absurd developments he sprung upon me no later than the break of the very next day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to say, I have a very bad account of you from your mother. She says you are a passionate and wicked girl. How is it, dear; you are not passionate here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not think you are wicked?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Dick, I {{would rather}} you did not. The {{business}} {{will be more}} dangerous than usual, and I should not like the responsibility of having you with me. Tom had as narrow a shave yesterday as ever I saw, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not want two of you on my hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, Harcutt," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{bound to}} take an {{advantage}} over you! I only got this card by an accident, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not know the Princess well enough to present you. I shall be compelled to leave you here! All that I can promise is, that if I discover anything interesting I will let {{you know about it}} to-morrow. Good-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are not implying, Robert, that I ever--. If I {{ever did}} I always {{told you about}} it afterwards, didn't <b>I?</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> never <b>did</b> it until I was sure you were comfortable.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "as you say, it is {{not likely}} that I shall have any {{occasion}} to mention you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> won't <b>do</b> it casually. You must, however, be content with that." ...|$|R
60|$|But when <b>I</b> turned around, <b>and</b> {{peered over}} the dark waters, {{it was quite}} plain {{to me that it}} was not want of oil, but {{increased}} distance, which made those lights so dim. I could now perceive but three of them, and as the surface was agitated only by a gentle swell, I could not suppose that any of them were hidden from our view by waves. We were being left behind, that was certain, <b>and</b> all <b>I</b> could do was to row on as long and as well as I could in the direction which the other boats had taken. I had been used to rowing, <b>and</b> thought <b>I</b> pulled a good oar, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not expect to be left behind in this way.|$|R
60|$|December 12.--Reconsidered the {{probable}} downfall of my literary reputation. I am so constitutionally {{indifferent to the}} censure or praise of the world, that never having abandoned myself to the feelings of self-conceit which my great success was calculated to inspire, I can look with the most unshaken firmness upon the event {{as far as my}} own feelings are concerned. If there be any great advantage in literary reputation, I have had it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not care for losing it.|$|E
6000|$|Rinaldo {{could not}} find words to express his sense of the devil's good-will, nor of that of Foul Mouth himself. He said: [...] "Ashtaroth, I am as sorry to part with you {{as if you were}} a brother; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> believe that nobleness of spirit exists, as you say, among your people below. I shall be glad to see you both sometimes, if you can come; and I pray God (if my poor prayer be worth any thing) that you may all repent, and obtain his pardon; for without repentance, you know, nothing can be done for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{long way}} from that, Matteo," [...] Francis laughed. [...] "Still, I hope we may manage it somehow. I have the {{greatest}} horror of a Genoese prison, for it is notorious that they treat their prisoners of war shamefully, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not mean to enter one, if there is the slightest chance of avoiding it. But for today, Matteo, I shall not even begin to think about it. In the first place, my head aches with the various thumps it has had; in the second, I feel weak from loss of blood; and in the third, my wounds smart most amazingly." ...|$|E
5000|$|I didn't do {{any sport}} outside school, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> didn't <b>do</b> any at university. Eventually though, I got into triathlon when I started work, because a guy I worked with did {{them and he}} seemed to be having a lot of fun. The triathletes I met were such nice people I just sort of got hooked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am, perhaps, not {{altogether}} without blame in the matter. A short time ago, the Vicomte de Tulle {{told me that}} he hoped to better his fortune by a rich marriage. He named no names, nor said aught of the measures he intended to adopt. But I said it would be well that he should do so, for rumours had reached me that his finances were in disorder. Whether he took this as a permission to use any means that he thought fit <b>I</b> cannot tell; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not suspect, when I heard of the disappearance of Mademoiselle de Pointdexter, that he had any hand in it, and was shocked when the baron came here and denounced him to me. I am glad, indeed, that his enterprise was thwarted, for it was a most unworthy one.|$|R
6000|$|... “I shall go out myself, father, in {{the course}} of a month or two, to pay him a visit. He and his wife saved my life at the risk of disgrace and {{punishment}} to themselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> promised them that if I should get safely home I would go over to see them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> so.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Millicent," [...] Mark said calmly. [...] "I {{only want}} you to have the same {{advantages}} that other girls have, neither more nor less, and for you to enjoy yourself as others do. There is nothing undignified or objectionable about that, especially as we are agreed that nothing shall be said about your fortune. Well, we will think it over. Mr. Prendergast <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not wish to act as tyrants, and there is no occasion to come to a decision in a hurry. We have only discovered our good fortune today, and can scarcely appreciate the difference that it will make to us. We can think over what will be for the best at our leisure, and see if we cannot hit upon some plan that will be agreeable to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{understand}} what you mean," [...] she said quietly, [...] "by saying {{that the child is}} not fit to associate with my other pupils. She is singularly gentle and taking in her manner. She expresses herself better than any child of her own age in Sidmouth, so far as I know. There are few so neatly and prettily dressed. What is there to object to? Her grandfather has been a sergeant in the army. He bears a good character, and is liked wherever he goes. I do not consider that James or myself are, in any way, demeaned by sitting down to meals with the child, who, indeed, behaves as prettily and nicely as one could wish; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not see that any of my pupils can be injuriously affected by the fact that, {{for an hour or two}} in the day, she learns her lessons in the same room with them. Had I thought that they would be, I should not have received her. I shall, of course, be sorry if any of my pupils are taken away, but as I have several girls only waiting for vacancies, it would make no difference to me pecuniarily." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Included {{under the}} heading of nature {{religion}} would be modern witchcraft/Wicca and Neo-Paganism, various revitalised aboriginal spiritual traditions, movements that appropriate aspects of aboriginal spirituality but consist mostly of non-aboriginals, neo-shamanistic groups, various portions of environmental movements, some feminist movements, certain 'New Age' movements, and movement within traditional religions such as Christian creation spirituality. This list could vary somewhat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not want to suggest that such classification is an unambiguous matter." [...] Peter Beyer, 1998.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the second}} season, Sara {{becomes part of}} the {{conspiracy}} plot of the show after her involvement in Michael and Lincolns escape, and her fathers later pursuit of information concerning Lincolns case. She is continuously chased by covert agents after the death of her father in [...] "Buried". Sara later confides in Michael in episode [...] "Chicago" [...] that the two things keeping her going are her feelings for him and that she wants to seek justice for her fathers death. The character is described by Jay Bobbin from Zap2it.com as [...] "gutsy", while TV Guides Maya Schechter remarks that Sara is [...] "one tough cookie". Regarding her characters change in the second season, Callies says, [...] "Shes just someone who has really rushed at life and absorbed experience with real enthusiasm.

5000|$|In 1973, Rev. Zabelka {{attended}} a three-day workshop given by his Diocese for the priests of his Diocese on Gospel Nonviolence directed by a layman, Emmanuel Charles McCarthy. In {{the following two}} years, he attended the same workshop on two other occasions in different locations. Then, in his 1975 Christmas letter to his friends, he wrote this: ”“I {{do not want to}} lose any of you as my friends <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not want to offend any of you, but I must do an about face. I have attended this workshop on Christian Nonviolence several times and have read the books that were recommended at it.

500|$|According to Coldplay's {{lead singer}} Chris Martin, the song's writing was {{inspired}} by his own behaviour. Martin recalls, [...] "There were some bad things going in our band... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>certainly</b> <b>doing</b> that to {{some members of the}} band." [...] He added that he supposed it was about time to stop acting like a knobhead. The four members of Coldplay are credited as co-writers of [...] "Trouble".|$|R
60|$|Two {{days after}} our {{engagement}} took place I received {{a very nice}} letter from Lady Desborough, saying how pleased she was to hear of Percy's choice, and its success. She said a good many kind and complimentary things, to which I did not, even at the time, attach much importance, for I knew well {{that it was only}} the fact of her son choosing, greatly against her wishes, an active military life, which made her regard with approval his engagement with myself. However, I did not fret seriously about that; she gave her consent, and that was all that was required, while I had the hearty approval of my own dear parents in my choice. I believed Percy loved me with all his heart, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> him with all mine. So the time they stopped with us went over very happily and quickly. Nothing was said before they went away about our marriage; indeed, mamma was so very ill, that it was a question which could not be discussed, as of course I could not have left her in the state she was in, and how long she might remain as she was no one could tell.|$|R

5000|$|On March 12, MSNBC {{commentator}} Keith Olbermann {{launched an}} unusually vehement {{critique of the}} Clinton campaign, accusing the campaign of using Ferraro as a surrogate to imply that Obama (who was president of Harvard Law Review at Harvard Law School during his time there and is a magna cum laude graduate of its law school) was the beneficiary of social and media affirmative action. Some commentators saw these comments by Ferraro as a coded attempt by the campaign to appeal to race-conscious white voters in the upcoming Pennsylvania primary. Later on March 12, Ferraro resigned from the Clinton campaign, saying [...] "The Obama campaign is attacking me to hurt you. I won't let that happen." [...] At a campaign stop with the National Newspaper Publishers Association which represents over 200 African American newspapers, Clinton was asked to apologize for Ferraro's remarks and said, [...] "I said yesterday that I rejected what she said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> repudiate it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In March 2013, Carson {{described}} his views about same-sex marriage on Hannity, saying: [...] "Marriage is {{between a man}} and a woman. No group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are. They don't get to change the definition." [...] The comments caused controversy. GLAAD criticized Carson for having [...] "equated gays" [...] with those from the North American Man/Boy Love Association and supporters of bestiality. A number of students at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, [...] "enraged by Carson's comparison of homosexuality with bestiality and pedophilia," [...] called upon Carson to withdraw as a commencement speaker. Carson withdrew as speaker and apologized for his remarks, saying that he was not equating those groups. He said:You know, as a Christian... I have a duty to love all people and that includes people who have other sexual orientations, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do,</b> and never had any intention of offending anyone. What I was basically saying, and if anybody was offended, I apologize to you. But what I was basically saying is that there is no group. I wasn’t equating those things. I don’t think they’re equal. Just, you know, if you ask me for apple and I give you an orange you would say, well that's not an orange. And then I say, that's a banana, that's not an apple either. And there's a peach, that's not an apple, either. But it doesn’t mean that I’m equating the banana and the orange and the peach. And in the same way I’m not equating those things.|$|E

Let me suggest that we live in morally pluralistic world (all of past history and current events are my evidence). Let me suggest that this is sometimes a good thing.

50|$|In August 2008, Prime Minister of Tonga, Dr Sevele {{said at a}} Pacific Islands Forum meeting Unfortunately, the Forum’s {{relationship}} with the interim government of Fiji has now deteriorated from the apparent, promising situation at the Forum last year in Tonga, to one of disappointment and of an uncertain future. As Forum Leaders, we are all extremely disappointed at the interim Prime Minister’s decision not to attend this Forum meeting. As Chair of last year’s Forum Meeting in Tonga and Chair of the last 12 months, let me place on record {{the fact that the}} commitments that Commodore Bainimarama made at the Leaders’ Retreat were not forced on him, as has been claimed.He agreed with and accepted the 7-point communiqué on Fiji, and so told all the Leaders present at the Retreat. Sir Michael Somare <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not pressure him into making those commitments.We, and all the Leaders, were, and are, keen on helping Fiji move forward, but Fiji has to play its due part. The interim Prime Minister has an obligation to explain in person to the Forum Leaders as to why he could not fulfill those commitments, and we were all looking forward to his doing this at this Forum in Niue. That he chose not to do this is most unfortunate and most disappointing.|$|R
60|$|I {{never have}} been {{what one might call}} a ladies' man, though I like their company immensely, and during my college days and since have made various friends among the sex. I think that I rather appeal to a certain type of girl for the reason that I never make love to them; I leave that to the {{numerous}} others who do it infinitely better than I could hope to, and take my pleasure out of girls' society in what seem to be more rational ways--dancing, golfing, boating, riding, tennis, and the like. Yet in the company of this half-naked little savage I found a new pleasure that was entirely distinct from any that I ever had experienced. When she touched me, I thrilled as I had never before thrilled in contact with another woman. I could not quite understand it, for I am sufficiently sophisticated to know that this is a symptom of love <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not love this filthy little barbarian with her broken, unkempt nails and her skin so besmeared with mud and the green of crushed foliage that it was difficult to say what color it originally had been. But if she was outwardly uncouth, her clear eyes and strong white, even teeth, her silvery laugh and her queenly carriage, bespoke an innate fineness which dirt could not quite successfully conceal.|$|R
