5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright <b>awful</b> {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone. It's not only {{hard to believe that}} a sequel this downright abominable didn't kill the franchise, but that it actually would be followed by a movie that was arguably worse—Jaws: the Revenge.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati has fierce, warlike {{attributes}} too. In the Shakta pramoda, she crushes {{bones in}} her mouth, creating an <b>awful</b> noise. She {{also makes the}} fearful and warlike noises of drums and bells. She wears a garland of skulls, chews the corpses of the demons Chanda and Munda, and drinks a mixture of blood and wine.|$|E
5|$|I am solidly {{confident}} no European {{has ever}} seen this rail alive, for that requires such a degree of toughening and such demands on oneself as I cannot so easily attribute to others.

5|$|The Barbara Dex Award {{has been}} {{annually}} awarded by the fan website House of Eurovision since 1997, {{and is a}} humorous award given to the worst dressed artist {{each year in the}} contest. It is named after the Belgian artist, Barbara Dex, who came last in the 1993 contest, in which she wore her own self designed (<b>awful)</b> dress.|$|E
5|$|The scrimmages were {{something}} <b>awful</b> to witnessliving, kicking, scrambling masses of humanity surging to and fro, each individual after the leather oval. If a Baltimorean {{got the ball}} and started for a run, he was unfailingly caught {{by one of the}} brawny Cadets and dashed to earth with five or six men falling on him.|$|E
5|$|Entering the race, {{the only}} two drivers still in {{contention}} for the IndyCar Championship were Ganassi's Franchitti and Penske's Power. Franchitti was 18 points ahead of Power, retaking the championship points lead from him with a second-place finish at the 2011 Kentucky Indy 300 two weeks prior. Power was still mathematically in the points race despite an <b>awful</b> finish at Kentucky, but needed to finish far ahead of Franchitti {{in order to win}} the championship title.|$|E
5|$|Other nude Hindu goddesses {{who might}} have {{inspired}} Chhinnamasta are the malevolent war goddess Kotavi and the South-Indian hunting goddess Korravai. Kotavi, sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother goddess"), is nude, dishevelled, wild, and <b>awful</b> in appearance. She is mentioned in the scriptures Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana, often as a foe of the god Vishnu. The ferocious, wild Korravai is the goddess of war and victory. Both goddesses are linked to battlefields; Chhinnamasta is not. Kinsley points out that while there are several bloodthirsty, nude, and wild goddesses and demonesses in Hindu mythology, Chhinnamasta is the only goddess who displays the shocking self-decapitation motif.|$|E
5|$|The site {{features}} regular Photoshop contests, {{in which}} users use a graphical editing program (such as Adobe Photoshop, {{from which the}} contest draws its name) to manipulate an image provided by {{the creator of the}} contest. A similar site, Something <b>Awful,</b> sponsors Photoshop Phriday contests. The image is usually manipulated for humorous effect, but can also be edited to create an aesthetically pleasing image or to showcase a poster's image manipulation skill, which is then voted on by others in the forum.|$|E
5|$|Hawks' friend Howard Hughes finally {{suggested}} Cary Grant for the role. Grant {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The <b>Awful</b> Truth, and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. Grant was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E
5|$|Indians {{confirmed}} in 1746 that French traders periodically arrived by sea {{to trade with}} tribes in the lower Trinity River region. Eight years later, the Spanish learned of rumors that the French had opened a trading post {{at the mouth of}} the Trinity River. In September 1754, the governor, Jacinto de Barrios y Jáuregui sent soldiers to investigate, and they captured five Frenchmen who had been living at an Indian village. To dissuade the French from returning, Spain built the presidio of San Agustín de Ahumada and the mission of Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Orcoquisac near the mouth of the Trinity at Galveston Bay. Conditions were <b>awful</b> at the new location, and both the presidio and the mission were closed in 1770.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea was}} taken up again {{in the search for}} solar neutrinos. Theoretically, the Sun {{produced}} neutrinos in the course of nuclear fusion reactions. Pontecorvo credited Maurice Pryce for this idea. The most common, the proton–proton chain reaction in which hydrogen is fused to form helium produces neutrinos that are not energetic enough to interact with chlorine. However, the much less common CNO cycle that produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen does. In the late 1960s, Ray Davis and John N. Bahcall detected solar neutrinos in the Homestake Experiment, for which Davis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. The experiment was the first to successfully detect and count solar neutrinos, but the number of neutrinos detected was between one third and one half of the predicted number. This became the solar neutrino problem. For a time scientists contemplated the <b>awful</b> possibility that the Sun might have burned out.|$|E
5|$|The terrier George {{was played}} by Skippy, known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in The <b>Awful</b> Truth. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both {{played by a}} trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E
25|$|On July 20, 2003, the spam {{filtering}} organization Spam Prevention Early Warning System (SPEWS) {{added an}} entire class-B subnet with the Cogent ISP to their spammer list, since Cogent was hosting a known spammer that SPEWS found difficult to block. Something <b>Awful</b> {{was added to}} the list in the process, disrupting its ability to communicate with its customers who were using SPEWS. Upon appeal, SPEWS initially refused to delist SA. The Something <b>Awful</b> administrators responded by telling their users to post their support in the Usenet newsgroup news.admin.net-abuse.blocklisting. However, that group and news.admin.net-abuse.email were flooded with off-topic posts and trolls from Something <b>Awful</b> users, incensing SPEWS advocates. The SA administrators claimed that SPEWS was attempting to hack the Something <b>Awful</b> server. Forum users responded by threatening to perform a distributed denial of service attack on SPEWS, although this type of behavior was strongly discouraged by Kyanka and assistant editor Zack Parsons.|$|E

25|$|Um Jammer Lammy follows on {{from the}} {{gameplay}} of PaRappa the Rapper, albeit with a stronger focus on guitar playing. Each of the levels sees Lammy playing alongside a teacher, with play alternating between the teacher and Lammy. Symbols appear on a scrolling score {{at the top of}} the screen, with an icon depicting whose turn it is. After the teacher sings a line and the player's controller vibrates, the player must hit the corresponding buttons to make Lammy play a response. The player can either follow the symbols exactly, or attempt to freestyle to earn some extra points. Successfully performing freestyle lines will allow the player to advance from the normal Good rank to Cool, in which the teacher leaves the screen and the player can freestyle however they feel until the end of the song, or if their freestyling isn't good enough, they return to Good. If the player successfully inputs a code displayed on the loading screen whilst in Cool Mode, they will enter Fever Mode where massive points can be earned. However, if the player performs badly, they will drop to Bad and subsequently <b>Awful</b> rank, and will need to perform well to climb back up to Good. The song is failed if the player drops below <b>Awful,</b> or if the player is in Bad or <b>Awful</b> rank when the level ends. The player progresses by reaching the end of the song in either Good or Cool rank.|$|E

25|$|It dispelled so many {{myths about}} the {{coaching}} business -- {{that you had}} to be a yeller and a screamer to win. You can be your own person, treat people with respect, be very demanding but demanding in a way that doesn't trample on people. And you don't have to give up your faith to win in the NFL.

His continuing imprisonment in these <b>awful</b> conditions led him to entreat his brother to supply him with poison.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, Maria Monk's <b>Awful</b> Disclosures of the Hotel Dieu Nunnery in Montreal was published.

Numerous ex-priests and ex-nuns were on the anti-Catholic lecture circuit with lurid tales, always involving heterosexual contacts of adults—priests and nuns with dead babies buried in the basement.|$|E
25|$|Iraq sent a 60,000 man {{expeditionary force}} to the Syrian front during the Yom Kippur War.

The two armoured divisions were, Pollack says, 'unquestionably the best formations of the Iraqi Army.'(Pollack p.167) Yet during their operations on the Golan Heights, their performance was <b>awful</b> in virtually every category of military effectiveness. Military intelligence, initiative, and small unit independent action was virtually absent.|$|E
25|$|Welles was cremated by prior {{agreement}} with the executor of his estate, Greg Garrison, whose advice about making lucrative TV appearances in the 1970s {{made it possible for}} Welles to pay off a portion of the taxes he owed the IRS.

Only a few close friends were invited: Garrison, Graver, Roger Hill and Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Chris Welles Feder later described the funeral as an <b>awful</b> experience.|$|E
